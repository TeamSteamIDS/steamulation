												This is a unique air hockey inspired game. The gameplay is fun. The characters are amusing. It is apparent there is much replay value to this game.The gameplay is great. Each opponent you face off against has a special shot they perform once powered up. The opponents you face in the beginning don't have very tricky shots but the shots of later opponents are very intense and hard to combat. You can play a variety of modes against each opponent. There is a simple duel mode in which you battle your opponent up to a certain amount of points. There is also a bet mode in which you can bet up to a set number of coins on the match. A survival mode is also available where one strike against you results in the game being over.The unlock system adds complexity to the game. Mallets and pucks of varying abilities are able to be unlocked. In fact you can unlock the mallets your opponents use to unlock their shots. There is also a leveling system in which you unlock different coin boosts for the particular modes.A couple minors gripes I have are the lack of multiplayer and some annoying quirks of the characters. When you score on characters they perform the same action upon every point you win against them. So their catchphrases can get old quickly. However, you can just play a different character upon getting too annoyed.Overall this game surprised me with how fun it is and I feel I will be sinking many hours into it.			"

												Well i saw this game and my first immpresion was ""OH they made a new STAR WARS game set in the cantina on mos eisley about shufllepucks"" (it was the dancer that tricked me).Anyway i was wrong but someone on the development team must be a STAR WARS fan,i mean look at the dancer pure STAR WARS anyday and the same can be said of what a few of the others characters look like to.Anyway i must say i love this game its such an easy game to get into but it will take a while to master it and get used to all the games little quirks.You start of having crashed into the desolate planet (and you completely wreck your ship) that the cantina is on and from there you proceed to the only building in sight which happens to be the cantina.To get of this rock you must play shufflepuck against the inhabitants of the cantina and win,therefore earning coin to buy better pucks and other equipment and in the process also earning medals and also the right to buy profile pages on the competitors.Now you need to buy all these to challenge the characters to a shufflepuck duel to earn their spaceship piece and therfore get back home to good old EARTH (think thats where you come from,never do you take your helmet of so anyone could be under there even good old ALF who knows).The graphics are good for such a small download and so to is the music and the only thing that lets it down is the story-there isnt really one just to earn the spaceship parts and leave.I like this game most because like most of my favorite games of late i just found the time passing by whilst playing and then going ""OH IS IT THAT TIME ALLREADY"" and it is just so addictive it has that one more go factor thet pulled me in.Still i cant get STAR WARS out of my head even when i think of this game but never mind.If you want a game that will slowly but surely creep under your skin with its addictivness then buy this game as HELL it did that to me.

												Air hockey in an alien cantina with a gazillion levelups and powerups... nice game but I can't shake the feeling it's better played on a tablet with a touch interface instead of on pc with a mouse.EDIT: After playing it for quite a while well... it's really grindy if you want to max everything out but to actually finish the main game it isn't too bad if you find the underlying mechanics fun which I do. It's really satisfying to achieve perfection vs the diverse oponents and their various playstiles if you like the basic air hockey gameplay. Just be sure to play it as little or as much as you want and don't go overboard and it's a really enjoyable experience.			"

												Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a great animated 3D air hockey game.  The game is controlled via the computer’s mouse. You have to hit a hockey puck with the aim to knock the hockey puck past the opponent’s site (and to get the puck when the opponent knocks it to you). In Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe you have a modern, colorfull design, 13 opponents on 5 floors (with different looking rooms), more than 40 gadgets and equipment and and and. This game is perfect if you just want to play a bit alone. The game saves itself so you have nothing to do when you want to quit the game. You can level your own character (about 200 levels!) and there are over 350 missions and 120 mini quests you can do. If you really want to collect all achievements and to do all quests you can spend much time on that game. I would buy it always again.			"

												******UPDATED******After more hours into the game and all floors unlocked I have to say the game becones unfair with ai using their powers as much as they like and to get any thing is a major grind. I am talking about Star Wars Force Collection grind, I would hate to see the f2p mobile version. Sadly I can not recommend due to those things.Do you like pong? Do you like Star Wars? If you answered yes to both then this game is for you! Though not set in the Star Wars universe the universe you are in is very Star Warsy even down to the cantina music. It's got a cute charm to it. Before you dive into the trenches of this game be warned first, this was originally a phone game that was free to play with in app purchases. No no, there are no IAP here, you buy the game once and that's it, but you can tell because you have to grind and grind and grind to get anything. The graphics really surprised me knowing that this is a mobile game, though it could use a little AA, it's very pleasing to the eyes. The music is hit or miss after hours of grinding your better off playing your own. The matches are short and sweet lasting only a minute or so but they are fun. You can unlock different power ups and upgrade your paddles and puck slightly. The only thing missing from this game is online play, that would be a blast to play your buddy in a pong like game.			"

												This is a port of an iOS free-to-play-with-microtransactions game.  It seems that the only thing that has been changed is that the microtransactions have been removed.  I wanted to relive my Shufflepuck Cafe days, not have to grind for hours to get the different types of currency needed to buy upgrades and new levels.  The game looks and plays well enough, but it's so obviously a port of a microtransaction-laden game that I just can't recommend it until the devs cut out some of the ridiculous grinding.			"

												Normally being a fan of more action-like games or even shooters, I am surprised of how much this game draws me in. The characters are interesting and way more multidimensional than characters in other games that are supposed to be ""main heroes"", the gameplay itself is fluid, fun, and there are a lot of things to earn and rewards to get that will keep you going.I can't recommend this game enough and I am surprised how much I like it, given how it was a ""curiosity-buy"". I am not disappointed :)Buy this.			"

												Sufflepuck Cantina is a cute little casual game about air hockey simulation, ideal for playing in small doses. What it does it does perfectly with a smooth mouse response and clear and intuitive controls.Long story short, you play as an astronaut stranded in a distant planet inhabited by a bunch of freaks obsessed with air hockey. In order to get them help you to fix your broken spaceship you need to make youself a name as an air jockey player and beat (a looot of times) the 13 opponents. You start with a basic mallet and puck and the 3 beginner opponents, and you must grind your way up to the rest of them, their special mallets and pucks and some other unblockables, such as concept art, pieces of background for the diffferent characters, etc. Each enemy has their own mallet and puck and a special move, but the concept of the game is always the same.Some people have said it resembles Star Wars Tatooine cantina aesthetics, and it does indeed. There's even a ""Twi'lek"" girl and a guy cosplayed as Han Solo, and every alien is very Star Warsy, so if you like the saga then you'll probably find Sufflepuck Cantina attractive to the eye. Most defining trait is the grinding, which many people have complained about; there's no ingame purchases inherited from its former app game nature, yet you will need tons of ingame currency to buy everything, from access to more challenging enemies to new mallets and its upgrades. As there are only 13 enemies and the only mechanics in the game are the short, intense air hockey matches (no other minigames included), this may get repetitive after a while. You can, however, buy your classic coin doubler upgrade, which I recommend you to do first thing (there are a couple upgrades for the puck to give you money when it hits the table and the mallet).Also the lack of multiplayer really damages a game like this one, which could use it to add some replayability and extra fun. However, the developers are considering to add it in the future if they get funding, and you can read about it in the Steam forums. I had this game on a bundle so I will definitely be investing a couple bucks :p + Cute design and characters+ Addictive and tons of unlockable content+ Polished and responsive controls and puck behavior+/- Some people may find the grinding annoying, while others (like me) may find it catchy- The concept gets repetitive quickly- No multiplayer (although it could have it eventually)- Some will find 10€ is a bit pricey due to lack of varietyAfter playing for 6 or 7 hours I say it's a good game, fun and with a fair amount of content, but it can get old quickly. If, like me, you are a sucker for casual games and achievement hunting, you will sure enjoy it. If you are looking for a more hardcore game, I would advice to avoid this one, specially at full price, as some will consider it to be a bit too much for what it offers; I had it in a bundle though, so I am more than happy with the value. I totally recommed it if you get it on sale and enjoy some good old casual gaming.			"

												An OK little game to remember the original game from the nineties with some flaws that cannot be overlooked.Clearly designed originally as a free-to-play (an insame amount of challenges, in-game achievements requiring 50+ hours of gameplay and more than a thousand matches to win, different sort of currencies, XP, slot machine, etc...), these mechanisms only strenghten the impression of a lack of content.Which is sad, because the grinding slowly kills a game that had good efforts put into it (there's decent writing, overall good controls, balanced AI). This should be a lesson to game designers: forcing the player to put more hours than he normally would have only makes him/her notice the little things that are wrong (repetitive sound design, aberrant mallet behaviour on some occasions, too many menus...).If you are bent on 100%ing games, just don't buy this one, the time you will have to spend is not worth it. For the others who might enjoy a few arcade air hockey matches, you can spend a few bucks when the game is on sale.			"

												I hate Shufflepuck. The original game that is. Whenever i heard as a kid that droid go 'Njyy Njyy' on me when it scored on the Amiga version i wanted to throw that (expensive) monitor through the window.  It did not get any better on the misc. linux versions where the motionless poker-faced Tux the linux penguin would own my♥♥♥♥♥and take numbers while maintaining a stony faced posture worthy of Clint Eastwood. Now this game is different for us slow pokes as the system is such that there are a lot of missions to do which in turn enables an enviroment where it's possible to learn to be better (and get different equipment and special shot abilities) while collecting misc stuff. And suddenly it works.  Best shufflepuck game ever.  Kill the others with fire. this is the only one worth playing.			"

												It's a fun sci-fi take on air hockey and it's a marvel how good it looks and sounds despite being only a 55MB download. Beyond that though...wow...this is the worst case of mobile F2P grinding garbage I have found on steam. You will absolutely want to find a cheat tool or something to give yourself more currency. This is really shameful. It expects you to beat every character a few hundred times to really fulfill every goal. You'll lose interest completely by the third match with each of them. I paid about $1.21 after selling some cards and using a coupon and I still think it was a bit of a rip off.			"

												Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe mixes the music and setting of the Star Wars cantina scenes and adds shufflepuck to it. And what do you know, it works surprisingly well.What's there to tell about shufflepuck I hear you say ? Not much really. I think we all know how it works. But this game allows you to play it against aliens and by putting power-ups on the field to aid you or your opponent. Winnings allows you to level up which results in you gaining XP more often. There's also other stuff to collect and win like coins to buy biographies of characters or better pucks. You can also scratch tickets if you feel lucky and try to gain (more) XP and money that way. Completing certain challenges (i.e. buying 10 biographies) and mini-quests also reward you with XP and money.There are many opponents to challenge, and several floors to unlock. The higher you go the more difficult your opponents will become. It actually becomes really challenging about halfway through. Wow.The only downside to this game is that the money you earn after each successful game is just not enough. It literally takes hours before you're able to buy a puck or a set of biographies. That, and you'll be playing against the same opponents for tens of games. So it's also a variety issue really. Hopefully this gets fixed with a patch as I don't see a sequel appearing anytime soon (I mean, what more could they possibly add ?). Frustrating and it makes the game a little less fun to play.Despite those issues Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is still a fun and worthy addition to anyone's collection and I'd definitely recommend it.[Rating: 74/100]			"

												The game didn't look like much when I picked it up in a bundle, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.  I'm currently up to the second floor out of five, but you can unlock the new floors with their new opponents in any order(except for the fifth, which might require all of the others to be beaten by the looks of it).This is the first video game adaptation I've played of air hockey, and it feels great.  Opponents can be challenging, but so far they haven't been unreasonably hard, with most of the difficulty variation coming from their specialty shots.  There are credits that you earn by playing and can be spent on biographys to give backstory on some of the other players, and also new paddles and pucks that have varying effects on the game.The visuals are great, and the feel of being in that specific cantina that was obviously a large inspiration for the aesthetic here is very well developed.  The game is also only 65 MegaBytes, which is amazing for a game that looks like this, so no one should ever have to worry aobut download caps or hard disk space when buying this.Edit on difficulty: The higher levels do indeed get significantly harder, with oponents moving much faster and in a less predictable fashion, so there can be plenty of room for improvement.

												It is a very nice remake of Shufflepuck Cafe :) It requires a huge amount of grinding, but it does it in a quite rewarding way. Learning the patterns of your opponents is actually fun! You have a lot of things to do off the table and it doesn't get boring if you like shufflepuck. This game is for people that liked the original game and/or like shufflepuck for what it is. The biographies are nice to read, but they won't make up for a decent story driven game. Play the game for what it is and you get a lot of very good gameplay :) It's even addictive once you get into it ;)Recommended for everybody that likes shufflepuck and/or loved the game Shufflepuck Cafe! At a sale price of 2.50 $ I'd recommend it to everyone that likes a mildly challenging sport game with a lot of 'side-tracked' activities :)			"

You accomplish this by playing many many games of what I would call air hockey. Tons of puck and mallet upgrades to purchase with crez ( in game currency). Plus all your opponents offer you several missions which unlock lots of urgrades and special shots you can make with the puck and mallets. Visuals in the game are very vibrant and colorful. Only played for a short while to get my card drops but I would recommend this to anyone looking for a casual game to play.			"

												I've been told air hockey isn't a sport. But despite that I found this game to be charming and easy to play. Basically you go around playing different people games to get parts to replace your ship that has crashed on some planet and you need to build a new one to get home. For a game as simple as air hockey the graphics are really nicely done. And the cast of players different with their own play styles and charm. You have to unlock parts of your opponents biography to progress through the game.  As you go up to nicer floors the competition also gets tougher to beat. There's 3 game types duel, bet, and survival. And the missions each character will give you are missions of the survival variety. Although I genuinely enjoy playing this game it fails to give you a unique variation of missions / quests. In later missions it might change the puck you have to use but the developer could have had missions where you were forced to play with a mini mallet or puck, maybe some style of collect the most coins, just a missed opportunity to make the challenges more than ""beat this player in survival mode for X amount of goals.""This is my go to game when I just want to play something casual. If you're an achievement hunter be warned that even though it's got plenty missions and goals and all that good stuff this game is a grind. Don't expect to get everything in 20 hours. Heck I've already spent well past 60 hrs and I'm only at some 75% completion. Multiplayer is also something that could have been a good addition to this game but perhaps in a future sequel the developer might consider it. If you see this game in a sale I'd recommend picking it up. It's something to do when you're not looking for something casual and pick up for a couple minutes at a time.			"

												It's air hockey. Don't expect anything else but air hockey. Anyway, it's air hockey in a great package. A lot of characters and plenty of additional options and features (mallets, pucks, achievements, missions, challenges, etc.) add surprising depth and immersiveness to this rather simple game. It adds unexpected complexity and addictiveness to a rather menial game. The graphics are also super nice for an air hockey game. Especially the NPCs are really nicely designed and come with distinct personalities which makes them quite likeable. Unfortunately the sounds are too repetitive and they may get annoying. If I had to hear one more ""ohnonono"" from Furry I would've probably broken the screen. The worst thing about this game is the lack of multiplayer. I mean, come on, it's air hockey, imagine how cool multiplayer would have been! Leaderboards can never compensate. If it had multiplayer, it would've been a great game. Otherwise, it's just good.

												This game is very simple, but yet surprising.  You're basically playing shufflepuck over and over again against various opponents trying to save up enough cash to buy spaceship parts.  But each player is unique in the different special moves they do and the games are surprisingly challenging and faced paced as you make your way up in the world.There are also ""missions"" that help you to earn a lot of coin so you don't have to play shufflepuck for years to beat the game.  Plus, you get to learn about all the strange characters.  I like this game and it's many, many nods to Chalmun's Cantina on Mos Eisley -- though you'll have to mute the song after an hour or it will drive you insane.			"

												[TL;DR -- An unexpectedly addictive and beautifully presented game, well worth the $7.99-$9.99 USD price-point in my humble opinion.]Though not a regular player of Arcade games, I thought I would make a foray into the genre when I picked up the newly-released Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe (SCD) for $7.99 USD. The game consists of playing Shufflepuck (essentially air hockey) against a series of increasingly challenging opponents to win points and money (known as ‘Credz’), ultimately in order to build a new spaceship to return home to Earth. Although a fairly simple premise, the game mechanics are well executed, and the opponents are sufficiently diverse to keep the game interesting and fresh as you progress.The game takes place in a five-level Cantina, where Shufflepuck is the key form of entertainment for patrons. The graphics are crisp and polished, with each area of the Cantina having its own style. There are indeed no loading times, and the player can seamlessly travel between each level of the Cantina via an elevator. Four of the levels are populated by three opponent characters each (with the fifth level devoted to a single ‘Boss’ opponent), as well as bystanders and props. The activity in each area is sufficient to bring the game to life, but is subtle so as to not distract the player.Each of the 12 regular opponents have unique mallets and pucks, as well as unique ‘special moves’, which the player is able to obtain and use as they progress through the game. The different special moves employed by each opponent adds greatly to the challenge of the game, as the player must adapt quickly to avoid defeat, particularly when required to face a series of different foes in attempting to complete each character’s ‘mini-quests’. The Shufflepuck matches are challenging, particularly those which require the player to concede no points over the course of the match. There’s a genuine sense of achievement in a flawless 15-0 victory against a difficult opponent.As the player progresses, more points and Credz are amassed, as well as Tokens. Points are used to determine the player’s Level, which provides bonuses, as well as to rank the player amongst their friends and the global playerbase. Credz are used to purchase items from the Store, such as puck and mallet improvements, as well as the biography of each opponent character. Tokens can be exchanged for points or Credz via a ‘prize machine’, which involves a random-chance card-flipping interface akin to a slot machine, and may be subject to bonuses derived from your Level. The character biographies are well thought-out and consistent, and provide a back-story to the player to explain some of the feuds between characters the player will notice during the game. SCD does not have a narrative or story arc in the way that many FPS or RPG games do, however the character dialogue and biographies do a good job of filling that void, bearing in mind the context of an Arcade game.All-in-all, I am very happy with my purchase and got a solid 20 hours of entertainment before finishing the core game missions. No doubt it would require many more hours to achieve 100% completion. The game is executed to a standard well above what I expected, indeed well above what I would expect of any new 3D game at the $9.99 USD or below price-point from an independent game developer. I would recommend to all, but particularly those who are fond of Arcade games. This game is fun, challenging and accessible, and at less than 100MB download, you’ll be able to jump into it almost immediately.			"

												A great remake of the old Shufflepuck Cafe from the late 80s. The gameplay is simple and fluid. The graphics are nice and unobtrusive and working well with the atmosphere the developers tried to create: the game now takes place not in a Cafe but a Cantina on a desert planet - very reminiscent of a similar establishment in a certain wretched hive of scum and villainy. Even the music fits.The game has recieved some sense of progression. The cantina has multiple floors and you need to earn credz to purchase access to them. The patrons you can challenge all have little quests (which basically require you to play even more shufflepuck), unlockable background information and eventually you can earn their special equipment and skills.In a way recommending it is like recommending Pinball: can you see yourself playing the same thing over and over and over and having fun? If the answer is yes, then yes, the game is a lot of fun and highly recommended.			"

												Yes, it's Shufflepuck Cafe.  In 2013.How MUCH like the original?Well, I keep doing the thing where you'd smash the puck, only to have the baton or whatever it is called get in FRONT of the puck, and then I move backwards to reset - and smash the puck into my own goal.  That happened on the original, and it happens here.The 2nd floor has a good remix of the original tune.Now, there are extras - you have to collect parts of your spaceship and thus play a lot of games vs. the characters, rather than just get to Biff via playing various others.  Also I haven't seen my favorite, the character who'd get drunk gradually and then you'd beat the crap out of him because he was WASTED.  Oh wait, maybe he's on floor 2 - maybe he's the insect that is at the bar there.The little guy with the eyes is named 'Furry' and he is essentially a cat. There are biographies of each type, and quests.The ONLY problem with the game is there is no Paranoimia cracktro on the front.  Felix Schmidt's music on that is brilliant and I kinda wish it was in the game somewhere.Also, yay this was in the shop so I could buy it.  I never saw, or was given the option to purchase, the original, in stores or elsewhere.Yes, I like this game (:			"

												8.4/10 - Shufflepuck. More fun than saying it 3x Fast!In my world this is called Air Hockey, but most Air Hockey games suck... so smart move with the rename! However, this is the best ""Air Hockey"" game I have ever played for sure!I really dig this format as opposed to the classic tournament style. You basically challenge people in the room to various games. Once you earn enough cash can rep you can move to the next floor. There are lots of opponents and floors along with 30+ special features to unlock. The actual gameplay is fluid, very challenging and you can choose between a variety of modes. I keep coming back to this one because of its fun gameplay but I rage quit after almost every session.Worth $5-10; lots of replay value!

												Okay, I have to say that whenever I make reviews I try REALLY hard to find a way to recommend the game or show it in a positive light. So, first off, if you like air hockey games, then get this game. It can be very enjoyable and has a long life span. This life span, however, is allowed because of one critical feature.It's all about the grind.OMG the grind man. If you are like me, and used to grinding, then this should not be a problem.I primarily have been playing this game for the cards so I can also unlock (the super insignificant chance of) booster pack drops. I have to admit, this is the first game that I have purchased and am seriously considering not playing to get all possible badges. I do not like air hockey THIS much. I've read reviews that this was originally an app game, and that makes sense because I've played other air hockey games for the touchscreen. That works REALLY well. I don't know if it's my mouse sensitivity (I play on 3200 DPI with +2 acceleration {whatever that means; it's REALLY sensitive}) or if I just really, really suck at this game, but the grinding for me is taking especially long. I don't know if I can do it.Here's a taste of what you have to go through:There are multiple floors in the cantina, each with new, harder opponents than the previous floor. On the first floor, there is a small alien dude who keeps periodically saying: nonononono, and I want to stab him so badly because it is so annoying. There is a dancer alien girl who I haven't played yet, and there is a robot bartender. Cool.You play the bartender, and let's say you win 4 points to 2 (it is first to 4 on the first floor at least) in Duel mode. You get around 100 or so currency points. A new puck costs 5000 points. A new mallet (the thing you hold) costs 5-15 thousand. Seriously. WTF.Also, you can unlock biography codexes for each character, and after ALL the biographies of a character are unlocked, I'm guessing you unlock that character as a player(?). The tutorial explains that you will get their paddle and their unique skill. For example, the robo-bartender has a really annoying dodge shot skill where it will bank left or right and suddenly then go straight. Did I mention that there are 19 (NINETEEN!) biographies for the stupid robot?!Oh and did I also mention that all of the biographies (except the 1st one, I believe) cost 500 points?That's at least 9000 points. OMFG.If you are proficient in this game, it should go by pretty fast, I guess. If you arent, like me, then you will hate this game.There is also a gambling feature that I feel is seriously trolling me. You unlock these gamble tokens that you can use to reveal face down cards, and the bonuses are nice, however, if you reveal a skull, you lose everything you've revealed (including the tokens you spent). I swear I have gone 2 consecutive prizes ONCE, every other time, the skull is second to be revealed. I want to give this a recommendation, I really do. But I just can't, so this will be my first non-recommendation.			"

												I was never a big fan of this game back in the Amiga days, when it was merely Shufflepuck Cafe. Now the joint has been upgraded to become a Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe. The core gameplay is the same, PC air hockey, and while it is extremely simple to play, it's anything but simple to beat the majority of your opponents.Now featuring upgradeable pucks and mallets, along with the ability to acquire special shots (so your opponents are no longer the only players with tricks up their sleeve), the game now offers quite a bit more to tweak the core gameplay. There are also more opponents, although the difficulty level ramps up a lot more steeply than it did in it's earlier Amiga incarnation. Acquiring the necessary credz to purchase upgrades isn't limited to just beating your opponent. There are also collectable credz (as well as experience points) on the air hockey table itself, plus there is some kind of alien fruit machine available to try your luck on, in order to win extra credz and experience points.The Cantina itself features 4 floors, with 3 opponents on each floor. As you earn more credz, you can purchase access to the other floors, where tougher opponents and greater rewards await you. There are also other items for purchase, such as concept art and biographies (in 18 parts) of each of your opponents. Purchasing these all help towards your ultimate goal, acquiring enough parts to repair your spaceship and return home.This is a strangely addictive little game that is perhaps a bit pretentious in it's execution. It's almost like the developer wants people to think it is more than just air hockey, as if that alone wouldn't be enough to interest people. The bottom line is it IS just air hockey on the PC, but that isn't a bad thing, many of the best video games are due to their simplicity. That said, i only purchased this because i had a coupon for it, bringing the price down to £1.75. I think it is a good and i do recommend it, but only if you get one of these coupons or if the game goes on sale. At £2 it's great value for money, but at the full £6.99 price i don't think i would be recommending as much.			"

												Great concept, lovely environment.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of variety in the first few levels of the game, and I doubt that changes later on.  Nothing is really enticing me to progress.  It is a fun casual go-to for some shufflepuck tho.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=acceptable 5=lovedGame design: 3/5  It's just shufflepuck.  It's done well but it is mostly the same thing over and over.Tone: 4/5  Great atmosphere for the story and game style.Personal skew: 4/5 I don't know many games that revolve around shufflepuck, and I've enjoyed this one.

												For some reason, this was an incredibly addictive game to play. Nice gem in the dust. I mean, it's virtual air hockey, kind of hard to go wrong with that. But this game made me get annoyed, made me jut my hand in the air from victory, and other things associated. I'd definitely play this when I'm bored, or like as a mood booster. The only downside is that it's a little grindy.			"

Essentially, the game is a pong/air hockey type of game with power ups and unlockables. I would say I like the game, however, I think you should only play it in small increments, as it does get repetitive.Overall, I recommend the game if it looks interesting, or it ends up on sale cheap enough.

												Do you remember an old shufflepuck game where you squared off against aliens?  Everything you liked about that game is here!  Weird looking aliens/robots/etc. want you to challenge them to a game of shufflepuck (think air hockey), and they have lots of dirty tricks up their sleeves to win.  A great game to pick up and play for a few minutes at a time or if you get into it there are plenty of missions, quests and unlockables to work towards.  The only thing lacking is a multiplayer mode, this game would be great to go against friends or setup a tournament with.  If this game blasts off into popularity I'm sure the devs will start working on it.			"

												This is a solid arcade title -- it looks nice, controls well, has basic but satisfing gameplay (it's air hockey) with a few twists like special moves or unlockable upgrades. On top of regular matches against AI opponents, there are challenges with special win conditions for variety. It's all very classic, as you can tell, but it's well-made.I have gotten a solid 4-5 hours of enjoyment out of Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe and would recommend it without reservation to anyone tempted by virtual air hockey/arcade game fans.Fair warning: It seems like the progression curve is slow and built around the expectation that you'll play a lot (and I do mean a lot) of this game, which might frustrate the completionist in you if you have a mind to unlock all the equipment and every costume. None of it is required to have fun really, but you can tell that this game has roots in the mobile world just by how they stretched out content.			"

												I do recommend the game if you NEVER played any air hockey or even shufflepuck game - in game or in real life (if you don't know air hockey, try it at least once, it is cool). I do recommend this game too if like me, you remember your teenage time playing Shufflepuck Cafe on Atari... good times. Now, I would not recommend this game just like that, because it is not that great. It is fine. Very repetitive (that's air hockey... better in real life with real friends), very grindy (win 15 times against him - good, now beat him 8 times without loosing - good, now you can duel the new opponent... who tells you to beat the previous one 10 times...), and the table is a TAD too small (actually, there is too much camera inclination), BUT the gameplay is really smooth, the different opponents moves are nice though as too simple as the original game, so, yeah, overall it is enough to pass the time if you buy it on sale.

												Linux: set up by enabling /dev/input/event* to have read permission for the mouse to work.  Otherwise had zero issues as a Linux user.I love these kinds of games, and this one delivered:The main thing here is the controls/gameplay are more fun than you would expect.  I mainly bought this game because of nostalgia from an old tablet game, but am already having a lot more fun than expected with a mouse.  There's enough variety in the gameplay that other similar games I've played seem a bit ""flat"" in comparison.The second thing is how fast it gets you into the action.  There's a tutorial, but it's skippable.  The story stuff can barely bring down the pace, but does a great job of adding incentive to keep playing.  Ignoring all that, the game launches quickly and there's barely any clicks before you're quickly setting up a game.  It's a smooth and extremely well presented/executed process imo.The personal nitpicks I have against are minor and rarely get in the way of playing.  It being a bit unclear of the ""best"" way to earn rewards.   If/how neutral power-ups impact the AI.  Stuff like I can't find a volume control (only music/sound on/off) and the default is probably loud because of that.  For the last one, I'm catching up on my own music collection in the background anyway, so adjusted that to the sound effects volume.Overall, Shufflepuck is a nice balance between getting you into the action and providing enough presentation/gameplay variety to keep you interested in one more match.  If you've enjoyed an Air Hockey type game before, digital or physical, this is worth picking up.			"

Shufflepuck Cantina DeluxeRating : 7 / 10This game is a port from the tablet game where it is freely available for some time now. Porting from such devices is normally done quite well but this one has lost some of it polish, especially when it comes down to the interface speed. If you don't own a tablet version, than you have nothing to worry about :)The gameplay has remain the same, and playing with the mouse is far far better than your fingers. As you don't have to hold a device, you really can focus on playing the game, which is downright fun. Learning the moves of your opponent is quickly done and than it's off to your own skill to defeat them. The learning curve is gentle and you're quick into the game. You have 19 different opponents to beat which scale up nicely. Your skill should too so after a while to really notice you can actually beat that dude that smacked you in the♥♥♥♥♥a few hours earlier.Nice about the game is that it rewards you a lot. Either with coins, experience points or achievements, it all adds up to that 'just want to play one more game' feeling.Music and sounds are ok, only thing is that the music from the Hall keeps hangin' on hours after you stopped playing. 1920's music isn't that great but this tune keeps coming back... Overall the game is fun to play and keeps you interested for a while until your skill doesn't increase any more or you just get bored.			"

												I haven't played real air hockey in decades and I'm not familiar with the late 1980s game Shufflepuck Cafe.  However, I found Shufflepuck Cantina to be quite engaging.  It's available on other platforms, but I feel comfortable declaring that the 1:1 mouse control feels immersive enough to call this the definitive version.Some complain about the grinding nature of the game.  I suggest focusing on the main quest which will allow you to consistently gather credits in a variety of matches.  All of them are viable.  By the time I was done, I wished I had toyed with the betting mode more as it's the most freeform in terms of duration and scoring.The OCD perfection of the mini quests is what I find to be the real fault of the game.  The mini quests are all survival matches of increasing difficulty which can't be accessed until medals are earned in duels.  The medals required quickly become gold.  In other words, the mini quests focus on repeatedly winning without allowing an opponent to score even once.  While they offer achievements, I suggest avoiding them or at least saving them for a later challenge.			"

												Excellent remake of the Brøderbund (publisher) game Shufflepuck Café from 89.It takes many elements from the original game like gameplay, characters, music and much more but also expands on it greatly.Overall a great game and if you just play the story part and leave the rest you have a few hours of fun.Issues with the game:1. Minor bugs2. Grinding hell to complete missions / achievements (story is short, 4-8 hours, missions 50+ hours).3. Difficulty is low, at least compared to shufflepuck cafe from 89.4. Game seems built around the pay to win concept but not incorporated.5. Once you buy what you want / need, creditz are useless and will build to huge amounts.6. Mission are bland (it wouldn't be hard to add certain criteria to missions, like ""score ace"", score x within y minutes or whatever).7. Unbalanced creditz, tokens and score, the need for one will shift drastically over time.			"

Good for when you want a quick 5-10 minute  mindless diversion.It loads and installs very quickly, the graphics are passable, but not great, and the control is smooth and very predictable. Some of the missions get tedious - lots of collecting credits to buy/progress, but the gameplay is good enough to overlook that.			"

												This game is surprisingly great. Work your way up a tower battling air hockey opponents as you go. Finish challenges and gain opponent skills as well as their pucks and mallets. It's a solid game to relax and play, requiring only one hand for the mouse. My one problem is that by the time you beat the game, you'll be around level 100 ( at least I was), but an achievement requires you to reach level 200...Except there is literally nothing more to do from that point on...You'd be forced to play hundreds of games of air hockey without reward to get to 200. Silly design decision IMO. Still a decently fun game.			"

												Fills me with nostalgia for my youth playing the black and white Shufflepuck Cafe on an old Macintosh.  The characters are interesting and colorful, as is the setting.  Graphics wise it comes into its own while still appealing to the old aesthetics. It is fun and challenging learning how to anticipate and overcome new opponents techniques.  First playing the opponents on the disco floor and being a bit overwhelmed, but managing to get up to speed with them and finally consistantly winning is pretty satisfying.   However, being a gripey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I have a few relatively minor criticisms:  -The missions get a bit monotonous, as does some of the character animations.  A few of the animations when you win a point over an opponent actually were making me a bit nauseous, as the camera jolted repetitively.  -There are a few game-destroying bugs at the time of me writing this, like the shock-absorber puck you're forced to use with some missions will get stuck to the side of the table and move extremely slowly such that it will take over a minute for it to reach the opponent. -The ability of opponents to block the puck seems random at times, as some of your seemingly most skillful shots will be easily stopped, while some sluggish accidental returns will make it through.  The physics also seemed to be a bit off sometimes, as when the puck ricochets at a strange angle, but it's not enough to take away from the fun.			"

												You play as a space explorer who got crashed into a strange island where you find out some strange people and after you learn what language they speak,you proceed to...finding out how to escape this place. And not so fast! You must first defeat you opponents...via dueling them of course! The gameplay is similar to pinball games,where you control an mallet,trying to score goals against your enemy in order to win. You can use powerups that can be good or bad ranging from bonus gold or smaller mallet size,e.t.c. The mallets also differ: Some are smaller,but has special abilities,some are larger but no abilities and so on. It has alot of humor and good dialogue with those personas,so this game is enjoyable both for story and gameplay!			"

												It can be frustrating but it is also a lot of fun.Shufflepuck Cantina is easy at the start, perhaps a little too easy, but it has charm.  Once you get to the 2nd floor, the training mitts come off and you realize there is some challenge to this game after all.The gameplay is deceptively simple.  The controls boil down to moving your mouse and clicking your primary mouse button.  However, each character has their own special skill, and each round includes its own distractions to overcome.  The progression of this game is actually very addictive, and the only reason I wanted to quit playing was so I could go to sleep.On that note, good night.			"

												Basically boils down to a Star Wars inspired air hockey game, right down to the background music which is clearly based on the music from the Mos Eisley cantina from Star Wars Episode IV. It doesn't actually used any licensed IPs or real Star Wars names, but the inspiration is clear.As air hockey itself is a rather simple game, this game livens it up with unlockable pucks and paddles that have different abilities, temporary buffs/debuffs, and skills unique to each opponent (different ""power"" shots that are harder to return).Beyond the first tier of opponents, the game feels like it gets considerably more challenging, but once you learn each opponent's ""tell"" that indicates where his serve or power shot will go, it gets more manageable. This is still a very fast paced game that noticeably benefits from Lightboosted 120Hz, as it makes determining the location and path of the puck easier. On iOS, this game was actually considered too difficult, and thus they added a ""training"" difficulty level to the Duel match mode. This mode is still available on the PC version for those having trouble.Overall a polished and challenging game, although a bit on the grindy / repetitive side (to actually finish the game would take quite a bit of time, several dozen hours probably), especially before you have the means/perks to win larger amounts of money to buy upgrades and unlocks.

												I'm hella-biased on this because one of the first games I ever played was Shufflepuck Cafe as a kid, but this is fun as hell even if you're unlikely to ever get to ""the end"" because of the insane grind and RNG-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ry involved. You smack around a puck and try to get it past the other guy, it's air hockey in space. The big gimmick is every character has their own trick shots (which you can learn by beating them or doing favors for them), and you can start mixing up special pucks, mallets, etc. to fit your style.Got a few modes, like ""survival"" against your pick of opponents until you lose a point, or just betting on your skill vs. the characters. I like it! I'm just never going to grind out all the spaceship parts.			"

												The Cantina is a bizarre place. None of the regulars or employees interact with one another, most likely due to the fact that this isolated establishment is rife with disfunction. Only when a stranger, you, enters, can communication between the players begin anew. Now, you are the sole pipeline of all communication, like a not un-popular high schooler mixed up in the drama of any number of social groups. Somebody wants to order a drink? You have to play shufflepuck to make it happen. Somebody wants to get a drink paid for? You play shufflepuck. Somebody wants to threaten somebody: shufflepuck. Blow somebody off: shufflepuck. Hit on somebody: shufflepuck. Hire somebody: shufflepuck. Build a spaceship: shufflepuck. Learn about somebody's uninteresting past? Well, some things you just have to purchase with credits.If you loved Sufflepuck Cafe growing up as I did, then you'll probably like the Cantina version. The gameplay for me is fun and engaging, but the story is exceedingly tiresome. The designers descided to expand the game by injecting it with unnecessary hurdles to jump through in order to play the various competitors. The good part is you get access to 90% of the competition relatively quickly. The bad part is getting to that final 10%, it takes a while. A LONG while. The kind of while where you could easily finish two or three more reasonably paced titles in the meantime.So, don't get this game if you don't like the original Shufflepuck or aren't really down with air hockey as a concept. That's all this is. It's got very smooth controls (I'm using a MacBook Trackpad, and it's buttery) and the physics is responsive and beautiful. The game looks great and the characters are fun... until they're not any more. The final boss isn't worth the wait.			"

												 A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, a spaceman stumbled upon an intergalactic café filled with all sorts of aliens and robots. These inhabitants passed the time laying a modified version of air hockey known as shufflepuck. Shufflepuck Café it one of those games that remains iconic due to its quirky characters and the fact that there wasn’t anything else like it. Now a new version of the game has arrived a host of new and old faces to pit your wits against.The plot is that you have crash landed on a planet and need to raise money to buy the parts to put your ship back together. You head towards the nearest building and inside discover a friendly robot, a musical homage to Mos Eisley and the game of Shufflepuck. The original game had you simply picking one of the café patrons to play against from the off but here things are a little bit more tiered.The cantina is set out into a number of floors with a boss character at the very top. Each floor contains three people to play against and they all have their own traits, paddles, pucks and special moves. Your biggest barrier is money as it can be slow to accumulate and you need to pay large amounts to unlock new floors and equipment.To break things up there are three ways of playing your opponent. You can undertake a simple one on one duel, bet on the match to try and increase your winnings or undertake the survival mode. In survival you are simply trying to score as many points without reply as possible in order to earn money multipliers. There are also missions of increasing difficulty to try and complete. Most these involve winning by a clear amount of points but it’s a good attempt at variety in a game where the premise is hitting a hockey puck up and down a table.The modes may be similar but the characters you face are different enough to keep things fresh. Each has their own special moves which need to be learned and countered in order to have any success. Early specials consists of shots that snake up the table or curve but later on they are deviously fiendish to try and stop.  As you progress you can buy new pucks and paddles and win characters equipment by collecting all their back story pages. This then allows you to bring your own special shots to the table and gives you a fighting chance. Shufflepuck Cantina is fairly tough to begin with but once you get the hang of the speed and the way the paddles move it becomes much easier. The biggest problem is that saving up for anything takes a long time and you’ll probably be playing the same opponents multiple times in order to reach the total to go up a floor or buy a new paddle to give you a chance.The game started life as an iOS title and we can see where the in app purchases would have been. There’s none of that here but a lowering of the money required to get things would have been welcome as there are a ton of things to buy and not that many opponents to play against in order to get them. It would have also been nice to ahve the original game somewhere in there but then you can't have everything.Issues with money aside, Shufflepuck Cantina is a loving homage to the original game. There’s a lot of attention to detail and the game plays well. Much like the original we would suggest it isn’t something you’re going to spend hour long sessions playing but it’s certainly great fun in small doses. It’s not the most complex game but what it does it does well and we’re glad to see someone taking a slightly obscure cult hit and creating something that actually deserves to be played. It should put a smile on old fans and people new to the series and it’s really much better than we could have hoped for.Overall 7/10 "

												Played Shufflepuck Cafe on the Amiga a lot so probably a bit tainted by nostalgia here, but this game is actually a lot of fun. In small bursts at least, grinding for achievements on the first floor gets a bit repetitive after a while, but mostly because I overdid it and played for 3 hours straight after buying it. Lots of stuff to unlock, nice art, paddle is nice and responsive. Maybe a little easier than I remember it being, but then again I've only played against 6 of the 13 or so characters available. Not the most epic game ever, but plenty of content for a cheap air-hockey game.			"

												For the period where I was lucid that evening, Shufflepuck Cantina is a straightforward game.  It's air hockey with power-ups, special moves, and unlockables.  If you're into that kind of thing, it would definitely serve you well.  Now, if you happen to be playing it after a few drinks, that's when the magic happens.  It's like you're actually there at the cantina, battling your opponents like the suave space pirate you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ well know you always wanted to be.  The characters come to life.  That little bartender droid becomes your best friend.  The sexy blue dancing alien actually wants you to come hither.  And the adorable fluffball sidekick creature with the speech impediment?  You just want to blast him straight out an airlock.  Live your dreams, friends.  Enjoy it with a few pints of Alderaanian ale, but make sure you play responsibly.			"

												The premier First Puck Shuffler that defines the genre features an intense storyline of thirill, shock, and suspense that is Shufflepack Cantina Deluxe. Taking place in outer space from a distance untraveled before our protaganist crashs in a steller fashion on an unknown world which so happens to have a creature waiting for the astronaught, who is then led to a Cantina near by. Full of life, the inhabitants are all in a blissful mood as our protaganist waltzes right into the lower level. The astronaught is shown around by a robot with eye staring curiously by otherworldly creatures. However our astronaught wants to go home and seeing as the ship has crashed a stranded feeling settles in. The robot maning the bar suggests playing a simple game of Shufflepuck with residents to earn back parts used on repair the ship. Unbenounced to the astronaught this strightforward endeavor would turn out to last years as this game was being played. Little by little a few parts were obtained, with each part, the heart is strained with hope to see family again... who knows when the astronaught will be able to return home again.			"

Gameplay is strong, challengers are actuall challenging and the weird air hockey star wars combo makes me happy.

The memorable quirk ridden characters are now brought to life with full 3D animations, unlockable background stories and many, many, miniquests!What's more you can now learn to embody the characters, use their special trick shots against the others or even against them.  There is added depth in being able to purchase different pucks and mallets with unique characteristics, and even a slot machine game for when the air hockey just gets too intense... and it does...If you liked the Amiga original, you will LOVE this to death. If you never heard of it, and you think you've got fast reactions, come on in and get a lesson!			"

												9/10 great casual.Definitely a worthy remake of the old Amiga classic.Nostalgia hasn't been ruined, the added stuff really does add to the game, all rond great reboot.Absolutely worth it for those of us who enjoyed the original, and worth a pop in the sales for anybody who enjoys casual games or quirky simple games of any sort.

												Did you enjoy whatever the original version of this game was?Do you enjoy playing pong *cough* I mean air hockey?Then this may well be the game for you!This was included in a bundle that I bought for another game and I have been pleasantly surprised by it. There are a variety of opponents, each with a special move, and by dumping cash into them (to buy their biographies) you can use their special moves and even play as them against other opponents. It's very easy to unlock all the floors, however the quest to fully max out each character, complete all their quests, learn all the special strikes, level  yourself up and complete your spaceship is a little grindy... but honestly if you're not enjoying playing the game... why play the game? It's not as though it has massive depth or a particularly compelling storyline. There are three different game modes, first person to reach a score, a betting version that requires you to score a certain lead and survival where one point from your opponent knocks you out. Oh and lots of bad jokes, mostly star wars related.			"

												Wow, what a simple game mechanic implemented so well! There is SO MUCH to do in this game, and really, there is almost nothing to do. Everything revolves around playing shufflepuck (air hockey). Each character you play against has their own play style and weakness and special attack. You have to build up your actual skill (instead of building up stats), but you can also purchase upgrades to make it easier as well. It is so simple and so fun! Why can't I stop playing???			"

												Shufflepuck cantina introduces you an astronaut whose ship just crashed and he needs to find a way home , lucky for him he landed near a cantina where they take shufflepuck (air hockey) very seriously so he can make money and win spaceship pieces out of the vip players.The gameplay is quite simple you need to score X amount of points on the opponent and depending on your results you will get bronze,silver or gold medals to unlock missions, said missions are mostly score X amount of points against someone , during the air hockey matches you can collect more coins on the board, grab buffs and debuffs like double point, bigger mallet, shielded and etc and every opponent has a special shot which consists on crazy spins and bounces in order to distract you, the first times it will be hard to counter them but eventually you will know how to counter them all.The game gets kind of repetetive since you need to complete all 10 missions of each character in order to win their spaceship part so you end up playing thousands of shufflepuck matches against the same people over and over again.Fun game in small doses and tons of achievements to grab , a lot of them are not easy to get though if you're into this kind of game the full price is not a lot considering how many hours you must sink into this game in order to beat it.

												I've played the previous incarnation of this game, named Shufflepuck Cafe, on the Apple Macintosh back when I was a kid.  This is a literal blast from the past brought with a more modern visual and a different goal.Instead of a championship the goal is to build a new ship.  In order to get these ship parts you have to go through some hoops, playing a lot of shufflepuck, in order to complete these objectives.The main aspect, the air hockey, is still the same Shufflepuck.  If you are looking for a game that brings that nostalic feel from Shufflepuck Cafe this game would tide you over for quite a while.			"

												It's a fun little game of shufflepuck with many different ideas involving changing the type of puck and hammer. It also has quite a few sci-fi references such as a alien who buys you a translator (shaped and described like the Babble-Fish from hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy)  and this enables you, a lonly human, to communicate with the many droids and aliens at this cantina and if you do enough missions and get enough money you can win a ship peice off them to help build a new ship so you can fly back home, however you have to build up your way through many, many games of shufflepuck before you get the change to win the parts making this game very long and repetitive, but it's quite fun for what it is.

												I’m recommending this game with one very big caveat:People who remember the original “Shufflepuck Cafe” from Broderbund Software will LOVE this game! It’s a great looking and VERY faithful homage to the original, right down to the broken glass and the music in one of the areas. That said, I’m not so sure it could keep the interest of today’s gamers for long.The game is basically just air hockey. They’ve added a silly stranded-on-an-alien-planet premise, to explain what you’re even doing there, because... you know... that matters!  In fact, the game gives FAR more to the player than I ever would have expected. There’s different game modes, different areas with different opponents presenting different challenges. There’s points and rankings, money, a slots game with prizes, dozens of different mallets and pucks to unlock, etc, etc. There's even a back-story to unlock for each of the opponents you face, with their own little place in the sci-fi universe of Shufflepuck Cantina!I’m serious... There’s a Sci-Fi Universe... for an air hockey game!Ultimately, you’re supposed to unlock all the character’s back-stories to get “parts” for your crashed spaceship. Once you’ve done that, you'll challenge the “end boss” who has the last part, presumably so you can finally leave this charming little Tatooine knockoff!To be honest, even as nostalgic as I am, I doubt I’ll ever actually put in enough time to get that far. But you have to admire Agharta Studio for having put so much effort and imagination into such a simple game. Bravo!			"

You can also purchase additional equipment, like pucks and paddles, that help you in various ways. Leveling up and achievements give you something to work toward, and you can even buy a characters biography to learn more about the cantina and its inhabitants.

												Were it not for its gameplay model, this wouldn't be a bad game. It looks quite good, there's a variety of opponents and it is enjoyable in short bursts. Unfortunately the game is entirely built around grinding. Want to play with new items and against new opponents? You'll have to play the same few early opponents on a seemingly endless loop.To make things worse, they have the exact same animation and sound every time they win or lose a point. Given that to get anywhere you have to win numerous successive points, it means you have to face the same animation and sound over and over and over again.Mindless repetition of gameplay elements is bad enough, but it becomes downright torturous with this lack of variety. It completely undermines any personality in the character design and makes progression downright aggravating.It doesn't matter how many unlocks there are in the game; if getting them is so painful, they're going to go to waste.

												You are a space traveler from Earth, playing your way to earn spaceship parts to get back home, in a planet where opponents from different races challenges you in an enhanced version of Air Hockey. Each one of these opponents have their own mood and equipment - mallets, pucks and special strikes - and you can earn them unlocking their biographies parts.I found this game surprisingly good enough to keep me playing for hours, and at least a few matches everyday since i started to play it. Never heard about that game before i get it from a bundle, but it's definitely not that kind of game you feel worthy just to get this way.Graphics and animations are better than usual in a casual game, the soundtrack is simple and repetitive but gorgeous, sounds and physics are enough convincing, and the gameplay is very good. Almost free of bugs, compelling and challenging, it's a very good and well done casual game.There are a wide range of tasks, quests, a good amount of Steam achievements and a lot of internal ones, which grants you resources to leveling, earn equipment/upgrades, unlock new floors/levels and play to earn more on a funny coin machine. The game have different play modes like duel, bet and survival, and well-imagined systems to enhance what otherwise would be a simple Air Hockey match.I found a single bug, and although is an annoying one, it happens just when playing with an specific puck. I got also some very rare performance issues, but they're shortly enough to not bother you while playing.			"

The  opponents look great and are animated very well. The dont move around the place but still they look great. The game is like air hockey with special moves and paddles. I do have a few nitpicks with the game. The object is to get parts from the opponents winning matches and once you have won a match you get money, with the money you can unlock parts of there biography. However the bios are on the spendy side so your gonna need to win a lot of matches to unlock all 15 bios for one opponent. The trouble with this is kind of two fold. The game takes forever to unlock anything and it gets kind of boring  playing the first 3 opponents you meet for a solid hour or more. There are mini quests inside the game that break some of the monotony of the game. However I have only done one so far. My other nit pick is the size of the table its super small and cramped. I would love it if they opened up the table more on the sides so the table would not feel so cramped. I am recommending this game however its not perfect and may annoy some with the grind it offers.My review out of 10 would be a 7. Not bad by any means however the grindyness and the cramped table is kind of a drag.			"

												A nice shufflepuck game based around a non-official Star Wars universe. I found it's a shame that the game is heavily grindy (and I mean heavily), to the point to make you uninstall the game sooner than you'd want to, especially considering the game is essentially just one big mini-game. If you're willing to spend 100 hours to be able to see the end of a such a game, go ahead.			"

												At first glance, the game looks wonderful. It looks like it's sophisticated, full of content and well-balanced: as you complete one step, then you get resources for the next one. Then time goes on, and you see that the game is rather inflated as a bubble by all these hundreds of tasks of the same type. Its “true time” is somewhere about 5–10 hours, after that it starts to look monotonous and somewhat artificially prolonged. All in all, it's a cool game but its “grinding-centrism” is disappointing.			"

												I only made it to the second floor, and had seen enough.Shufflepuck Cantina is a modern recreation of the classic ""Shufflepuck Cafe"" which I originally played on the Amiga.It's an air hockey simulation where like the original, you have crash landed on a strange planet, and the only way to get the parts you need to repair your ship, is to compete in air hockey (shufflepuck) and beat the various alien players in a nearby cantina.The game builds on the classic 2 paddles/1 puck by adding special moves you can earn through wins, and there are also paddle and puck upgrades you can buy. There's a gambling machine on the ground floor for a mini-game, there are various challenge modes (game types) for the air hockey, and in order to earn the parts for your ship, you need to complete a encyclopedia on each alien/player. There are many encyclopedia parts, and each part needs to be purchased with credits earned from playing that alien ..... and that's about the point I lost interest.I wish there was ""meh"" option for steam .. because this game takes a classic and improves on it. The graphics and sound effects are very good, you do feel as if you are in an alien cantina, the aliens have the same Star Wars vibe as the original, but no matter how many bells and whistles they've added, the game is still simply air hockey, which is fine if you like air hockey and have good reflexes, but from just an hour of play, I could already see what a grind this is. Having to play the same opponent over and over and over to earn credits, so you can use those credits to learn more about them, purchase upgrades, and eventually buy a ship part so that you can move onto the next alien ... If you like air hockey, and the market isn't exactly overflowing for choice, this is a good one .... but you should ""really"" like air hockey, or like me, the grinding will turn you off. Try to pick it up in a bundle or a sale.			"

												Recommend? Well if you can remember the original and enjoyed it, yes. If not then maybe in a sale. It's Airhockey, my only real grumbles with the game are..1. The Airhockey table feels like it's too short. 2. It feels like a Facebook game, in that you have to play MANY games to go up a level. At early levels it's all TOO easy making it rather dull.Apart from that.. Yeah, it's ok. "

												A few reasons why an otherwise fun game made me not enjoy it: - The Star Wars cantina music is blatantly knocked off.- There is NO volume or SFX options at all.- The characters do the same movement and make the same noise every single turn.- The game developers want you to follow them on Facebook and Twitter for achievements.If they stripped all of the gimmicky crap out, this game would be a thumbs up.

												Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a capable air hockey game that is surprisingly fun for the first three hours or so. The AI is respectable and I like how each opponent has their own special trick shot to keep things interesting from one match to the next. The problem is that once you get past those first three hours, the game devolves into a ridiculous grind-fest. If you want to reach the end-game and face the final boss, you'll first have to repair your spaceship by obtaining new parts. To obtain a single new part (13 in all), you need to purchase all of an opponent's biographies via the in-game store using credits earned from winning matches. Earning enough credits to finally get all these needed parts is a process that can take literally dozens of hours to achieve. It basically feels like a F2P mobile game where progression moves at a snail's pace. It's like the developers wanted to stretch out the repetitive gameplay for as long as possible and it comes across as lazy.The core gameplay of SCD is pretty decent, but the time investment required to actually beat the game is just ridiculous and a major turn-off.

												Shufflepuck Cantina is a wonderful air hockey game. You get to play air hockey against a variety of robots and aliens. There are a ton of special mallets and different opponents and challenges that add a lot of variety to what is otherwise a very simple game. It almost never gets boring.The mouse control is excellent. I had no idea this game was available on touchscreens until I read other reviews claiming it was a mobile port. I don't know why anyone would play an air hockey game using anything other than a mouse.Other reviews have described this game as a grind. If you feel that sports games are a grind, because you have to play so many matches; or that racing games are a grind, because you have to drive in so many races; if you like ""completing"" games more than you like ""playing"" games, you may feel the same way.But if you like the idea of playing air hockey against robots and aliens, buy this game.

												15 hrs in game, I start to find it pretty boring, glad I had it bundle, really not sure it is worth its original price otherwise (wich is the main concern of my review).Some very annoying problems with some pucks (shock absorber stuck in the middle of the board to start with) will force you to forfeit to reset, as if the AI wasn't annoying enough by itself allowed to chain it's special anytime it feels like when you obviously can't (without even being ""♥♥♥♥ed off"" affected by the random effect).Don't get me wrong, I still wonder about how challenging this really is, since the patterns are quite basic and patience is the main key from what I saw to wait for the AI to run short after godlike phases.Still interesting if you are a star wars fan, since everything was possibly done to add to this game a nice background and lots to buy and upgrade, to justify the endless grinding through the 100 hrs it will probably take to fully achieve it.Did I have the right to expect more since this is ""just"" an action/air hockey game, I am honestly not sure, still as a player, I do.From what I've read, the devs will add a multiplayer mode (which would have make this defintely more interesting right from the start) if they ever meet a certain market expectation, too bad, as things are, this is probably the main reason anyone would go for this kind of game, to be able to play with friends.Don't raise your hopes, there is none ""yet"" (and maybe never will).Not bad overall, but I wouldn't recommend it out of a bundle.Edit: Since I've been playing this longer just for the sake of knowing where it is going, I can now tell that the last boss should have been harder, even if the idea isn't bad and fits the game overall, and the attempt to make it difficult through the missions putting Bupbup as last boss for everyone (including himself which is totally hilarious somehow) from the 3rd floor was one of the poorest approach I've ever seen. Not that it makes it really more difficult, but you have to endure its annoying animation no matter what. As usual, to get out of it, be patient, wait for the bad AI to run out of stamina as it always does. Ekbar would have been a better/more logical last stage/missions boss since the emissary does have precognition in its background racial story to justify the ""raging"" phases during which you have to ""limit the damage and keep it up"" to see next survival round.Add to that you are forced to use the worse mallet (glitchy)/puck(stucky) combination to make it perfect in every #stage 10 round, if that's not the proof someone ran out of ideas or time to make this decently harder, I don't know what it is. Definitly, not worth the buy and annoying every bit quickly, but I'll go throuh it just because persistancy more than skills is all that it takes.			"

												It is probably the best air-hockey game on steam. It controls well, it has nice visuals a great presentation and the special attacks from enemies are playing tricks on your mind (which is a good thing) but it is an unbearable grindfest.I played roughly 2 hours of it and couldn't even afford a single upgrade for my paddle or my puck, assuming that i would get credz at the same rate i would need to play another 6 hours to buy a single upgrade. This is just not acceptable for a PC game, it seems it was developed with a f2p-payment model in mind. Also the game is just airhockey with small variations it gets repetitive quickly especially because the game makes you replay the same opponents over and over to unlock new Quests/Minigames or else you can't progress.

												Little game that is way too grindy.It was kinda fun for 30 minute then I realised how much of a grind this game would be... The first floor doesn't pay enought to buy anything so I had the brilliant idea that maybe in the higher floors I could make more money... The game is designed in this way, except that without any special strike or better paddle or puck, you get melted even just at the floor just above you. The end result, I don't want to spend 3 hours on the first floor only to get 1 special strike, then another 2 to get a better paddle so I might stand a chance on the 2nd floor... To do this all over again. I regret buying this game, even on sale. The idea was promissing and seemed like a fun little game to blow off steam. It isn't.			"

												Actually not that bad, though this game is not worth $10, luckily I got it in a sale which ended up costing me maybe a dollar in the end (the humble bundle doesn't give prices for each of the games). For a dollar, this will provide a challenge, though at first, all I really cared about was getting the trading cards (not worth much though), I found myself drawn into the game and now, well its not the first game I am going to jump into, but give me a few spare minutes, and no internet, and you will find me playing this games. Its quick to get into and back out, you can exit the game from anywhere in it by pressing esc. So in the end, its not worth the $10 price tag, but get it for sale under $2, (or $1 if you really are conservative with your money, like me :D) and it will be well worth the dollar that would have only bought you a tiny cheeseburger.

												If you have a VR headset then add this to your collection of games. I'd have never thought I would enjoy an air hockey game but I love this and use this as one of my chill out games as even though real air hockey could be quite exhilarating I feel totally relaxed and focussed in VR.The graphics and effects are pretty cool, reminding me of the Star Wars universe and the controls are easy. I do find the opponents seem to be able to use their special abilities fairly easily but so far I am coping heheFor such a small team (3 people) I think they've done a pretty good job. Thanks!  :)			"

												I used to play the old Shufflepuck Cafe for the Mac (actually I think there was a shareware version I played before it became Shufflepuck Cafe). Long time ago. But this feels similar, and that is great, because it is one of the great casual games that you can waste a lot of time on. I got this for the DK2 (works with 0.6.0 fine), and it is probably the best VR experience yet. If you have a DK2 you need this. I have played a short time so far, but love it.			"

												If you've ever wanted to play Pong with grinding and poor design decisions, this is your chance! Alternatively, if you love frustration, this is the game for you!Seriously though, this game has a couple of interesting aspects, but their implementation is terrible. You can ""embody"" opponents, playing as them with special skills and weaknesses. However, these do not work for the quests, switching between bodies is tedious and their drawbacks can be significantly restricting.The worst thing about the game is that it insists on you winning without your opponent scoring a single point. This is such a terrible, terrible design decision which only leads to frustration. This is exacerbated by the fact that starting a new duel requires you to press Escape and click four times. A simple ""restart"" function would have helped a lot.On top of this, it feels so cheap. There is one short looping piece of music on each level. Opponents always repeat the same phrase if they lose. Music and sound can only be turned off, there isn't even a volume slider! And it is quite obvious they make you grind perfect wins and credits to pad the game, which only detracts from the experience.Avoid unless you are a masochist. 2/10			"

												This really is nothing but a shufflepuck/air hockey simulator (with a few special moves added).Amazingly the developers spent a lot of (arguably wasted) effort building a brilliant backstory, economic and levelling system to the game.   All the characters have biographies which you need to spend money to unlock - and of course the only way to make money is playing shufflepuck. Frankly this is the first game I've seen where the menu is AAA+ and the game itself is B-.  If you really really love shufflepuck then absolutely buy this game.   It's family friendly too. But otherwise, being limited to a shufflepuck game, and lacking advanced graphics settings and no hidef support over 1080p limits this game to a thumbs down. I hope the developers make a real game.  The polish and backstory in the menu system really is excellent work.			"

												Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a pong... reimagination... reimagination. Sounds weird, right? Well, it took the old Shufflepuck Cafe, and it has modernized it. With fancy graphics, more opponents, upgrades, backstory for characters, concept art, ... you name it. It has a bunch of stuff! It's also an iOS port. A very poor one at that. I'll say right off the bat: I didn't dislike the general feeling of the game and gameplay itself. That was pretty good, for what it is. But... it's Pong. And it's a really bad port of Pong. I'll get on to why.This was a free game on iOS, with a bunch of IAPs. The computer version has no IAPs, as one would imagine, since it costs 10€. That doesn't mean, however, that the grind is gone. Oh no, no no! If you want something on this game, you'll have to play the same opponent and mode over and over again. I liked the game when I started playing, but it quickly went downhill into a grindfest. That's really unfortunate... and lazy. Graphics look nice. It's not something spectacular, but, for what is is, it looks pretty good. And it delivers its objective, so that's a plus!The music was also pretty cool. It invoked the feeling of the old Shufflepuck, and even Star Wars and Cowboy Bebop in conjunction with the visuals! That was pretty awesome. But the music gets old after a few hours, since you have a looping song per floor. The old Shufflepuck Cafe didn't have much of a backstory told to the player. It was up to imagination. Shufflepuck Cantine Deluxe delivers that backstory for you in very (very) detailed Biographies for each opponent, that you can buy with hard earned in-game currency. That sounds cool, but it's just text. One would have to interrupt the game for a while to read it all. So... It's a cool idea, but I don't like the way it was implemented. They could've voice-acted it after each mini-quest or so... Well, it's too much text that breaks the pacing... if it has any.Let's talk about the gameplay itself.You all know Pong. In here, you can have different discs, each with different special powers to give it different tragectories (and so do you opponents), and you can have different Mallets, and upgrade them to get more in-game currency (credits).This provides a little bit of variety, but it the end, they didn't take it very far, and their effects on the game are far lesser than they could have been.In the game, you have 3 modes: Duel, in which the one to hit x number of points first, wins. Then you have Bets, in which you pay some money, and get more back if you win. Then you have Survival, in which you'll play until you suffer a hit.Duel gives you medals depending on how many point your suffer. Has you unlock those, for each character, you'll be given mini-quests, during which you'll just fighter other opponents with different mallets. It gets very repetitive. VERY repetetitive.Then you have floors, with 3 different opponents in each one. These get progressively harder, but it's nothing too challenging. The problem is, apart from the different special powers, it's always the same game. You're always doing the exact same thing. And the way they've structured the game, was for you to play for about 20 hours (at least) before you're able to go to the final floor, after unlocking everything.Unless you're a really, really big fan of pong or the old Shufflepuck Cafe, there's no point. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, specially on a PC.Why would one play this on a PC, really? And for so long, for that matter. I was going to finish it, but after 9 hours I was just sick of it. It brought nothing new to the table, no surprises, no challenge, no nothing!Now, about the Port. First off, they have 2 separate settings menus. Why the...? Why would you do that? Why not take everything to the same place? Ah well...In regards to audio, there's only Music and SFX. On or Off. No sliders... When to developers learn?Graphics options are very, very poor as well, barely has anything. Gameplay has essentially the mallet velocity and very few else. It's just a very very lackluster port. And even worse, they kept the design as it was for mobile devices. That's ♥♥♥♥ing awful. It's just a time waster, and it's very unfortunate.Gameplay was genuinely good, if not repetitive. But... they've ruined everything by not caring about the overall experience and just following the trend to milk money off their consumers. And, if not money, then time. And not changing that when they made a PC port is just very lazy. This was just a cash-in and it should in no way be on Steam.If you like this type of game, go ahead and get it. But beware, its pacing and structure is as awful as it gets.For anyone else... No, I would not recommend this at all. At least not until the game has been reworked for PC.			"

												This could've been a decent air hockey game, but there's two main huge flaws to this game:1) Grinding2) Awful Mission structureWhat do I mean by awful mission structure?  The majority of the ""missions"" in the game follow a ""score X points in a row against this opponent"" Where X can be anywhere from 4 to 6.  This means you cannot let the opponent score, or else you immediately fail.  This becomes incredibly annoying when opponents have powerful ""special shots"" that are hard to defend against.  In a normal game, the special shots provide a challenge, but having to survive them flawlessly for 6 points in a row?  Screw that.			"

												Probably the most time I've spent playing any kind of pong.The game isn't perfect by any means, but it's most of the way to excellent, with a few small problems dragging it down:- The music is an attraction, but it quickly gets repetitive, with very few tracks.- There is a storyline with an enormous number of missions, but there is only one type of mission - ""win a game of shufflepuck"".- Wacky items play a big role, but there is no gameplay difference between the tables.- The menus aren't quite click economic. Having to leave a dialogue and restart it before every mission is a drag.- It's very hard to see why multiplayer doesn't feature.All in all, it's a good start though and I hope the team makes a sequel with the above problems ironed out at some point.

												PLENTY ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT: The Shufflepuck SequelWith a community of around 50.000 Steam owners, Shufflepuck Cantina proves to be a fairly successful game, especially taken the price of 10 Euro into account. A rational question arising is the price/performance ratio. A way to answer this question is through a comparison with the original: Shufflepuck Café. Doing so, a lot of opposing pairs come into mind, for example what's new, what's missing:What about the game mechanics? You take your mouse and move it from left to right, forwards, backwards, that's nothing new, even the splitting glass when you hit some background is the same as before. The one thing that is new though are the special strikes, but you could claim that they lack of originality. Why is that? They are predictable. Well, Shufflepuck Cafe was predictable as well, to a certain extend, but it seems to be no abuse of notation to approve that Shufflepuck Cantina is even more predictable. For example, a ""noise decision"" is not present any longer as it was before with the magician lady in Shufflepuck Café. You could also claim that Biff was tuffer to beat than Lord Emell is at present. Against Biff, one could only score by switching corners quickly and through counter strikes using the energy he threw into the puck. Emell uses all special strikes of all enemies, and that's it, his defence is not hard to break, one could claim.From this point of view, one could question the philosophy of the game, the ultimate goal besides of earning a living. What's the challenge? In Shufflepuck Café, it was a challenge to sweep Biff, but the predictability of Shufflepuck Cantina leads to more conditional aspects. As a game with Biff was to win or loose 15 points, this element has been transfered to Shufflepuck Cantina in form of the Spaceship Parts Challenges. But there are other types of challenges in addition: Duels, bets and survival mode. But as the special strikes do not really differ from each other, so do these challenge modes. They are all somewhat based on the fact that a sweep is the best way of winning a game in terms of time and points. And the last mentioned is a crucial factor. Like many other games nowadays, the achivement bar tries to keep the player up with the game although he already could have gained the impression of having mastered it. Is it an achivement to do the same things over and over again? That's a philosophical question and shall not be answered right here and right now.But it can, of course, be annoying after some time and this would depend on the individual, one could say. So, there seems to be nothing new and you could easily call Shufflepuck Cantina a remake of Chufflepuck Café, but not as difficult as the original, but more costly in terms of time and money. This summing-up impression rises especially after considering the complexity of the elaboration of the additional features: They are all separated from each other, for example, you cannot combine special strikes and there is only one feature (as shields, double strikes, reduced mallets or pucks)  affecting the gameplay at a time. Combinations in this area would make the game more unpredictable and it would be more difficult to sweep an opponent and one could surely arrange the achivement bars with such a new difficulty level.Therefore, the only excuse left for such a lack of elaboration seems to be the development budget. Is it?Speaking of the price/perforamnce ratio again, the graphics and musics aren't too bad, multiplayer is missing, it could appear to be too expensive after all (75% off would do). It also appears to be no game for someone looking for an effective challenge with more variations in comparision to the original.			"

The developers really took every aspect of the VR world in consideration which means that every text windows as been made perfectly readable for the eyes and no useless motions has been added which could've caused some motion sickness. The graphics are nice and the 3D environnements is quite immersive for that type of simple game. I've heard some people saying that it's repetitive, well it's a shufflepuck game so you definitely have to do alot of shufflepucking hahaha The game still find it's way to make you come back at it with alot of objectives and unlockables.Need more VR games from you guyz you rock!

The music on the bar level is even the same piano riff from the old game. Ah, nostalgia. Thanks for that nod, developers.That said, this updates it nicely while keeping that intuitive mouse control I used to love, and the experience in VR is absolutely top notch. Lots of upgrades and progression to unlock. It it's quite a grind to earn enough money for these, though.			"

												This game has a pretty enjoyable mechanic. The gameplay feels fluid and relatively fun.The variety of characters you face on each floor is compelling to some extent, but the game does get old rather quick. The main problem I find is the grind factor starts to kick in. While the variety of characters is interesting, most of their special moves start to feel same-ish, and there isn't enough variation to the gameplay here to keep things interesting between matches.Add to this the grind of quests (beat this opponent X times to unlock their quest) and I feel like I'm just trudging through round after round of the same thing to unlock more of the same thing.The Star Wars references were nice, but not really that compelling and the sounds and music need more variety - they really started to grate me after not much time.If the game had a multiplayer mode I think it'd be amazingly fun, as the AI getting more challenging just kinda feels like they're being cheap (Spamming their ultimate attack, etc).I'd say this game would be a recommend at under $5, but for more I can't really recommend it.
