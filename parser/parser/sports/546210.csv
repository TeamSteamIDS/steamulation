								Fun little game, has a lot of potential but it is a little limited atm. My only suggestions a) fix the gripping system, in a duel I find that sometimes the grip doesn't work and I come up trying to shoot empty handed. b) add more content i.e. different challenges (defend the town against raiders would be fun)Great game, my favorite shooting mechanics in vr so far.

								Well hang me from a tree and leave me balancing on a cross, this is one hell of a quick draw game. The other I received in a bundle I thought ok but had some things I wanted in the game. This one has those things I wanted, the other one was John Wayne Western, this ones got a bit of Clint in it.The graphics are really really good for a VR game and the game play is addictive even though it's just quick draws and a shooting range. You do feel like you're in the old west style wise, the draws are well done and you feel elated when you take out a competitorThe six gun is fine although more realistic loading would be fun, a couple of the draws I shot the hat off the other guy which I thought pretty clever add to the game.What we need in VR is a full on western game with street shootouts and barfights. Spaghetti western style please with a touch of out for myself and no ♥♥♥♥s given.Anyway received in a VR bundle for $3.49 for 10 games and I got myself a real bargain, well worth the $5 price they're asking. Please Devs of this game think about making a full on western for VR with the style you have in this game.I give this 4 half smoked cigars out of 5			"

								Ok this game is in the earliest stage according to the road map, so feedback is a bit tricky since we are only seeing a part of the game.But that said, the game actually do look promising, I peeked inside the closed saloon and I can't wait to lose all my bloodmoney in poker.The gun play is quite precise, the holster placement is a bit wonky though, I would have liked an option to determine exactly where I wanted my pistols in relation to my headset, but it is not a problem or hinderance at all.I fought a few players and it worked really well, lag doesnt seem to have any effect, and it is fun clapping after being killed, or doing the sunbro when winning, we also walked like eqyptians :)I can easily see this being a fun game to play on and off, the poker is a great way to spend the money from wins, I havent seen any shop in the town, but we will be able to buy other stuff later according to the roadmap, I very much desire pearl handles and a huge sombrero.

								Great concept, polished look&view, fun to play!@Devs: This game has potential to work as great offline multiplayer/party game if you add some kind of challenges like first reaching 1000$ worth of bounty, passing the vive between players after each round or first beating several opponents. There are not enough games out there supporting this approach, but lot`s of people having just one Vive who want to play offline with friends.If you could also change that the revolvers can be grabbed by the side and not in front because of the slim hip of the avatar it would improve immersion.

								Very light on content, but I go the game early on in early access and the price was good. The core duelling aspect of the game is exciting and tense, excellent. The graphics are excellent, especially the initial cut scene. There is a question mark as to how much the devs can flesh this out; there needs to be an underlying story and a variety of modes to help break things up from the duels. As it stands, it is looking promising and I look forward to watching how this game pans out!			"

								Trying to grab the pistol to shoot the opponent is almost imposible. Also, there's no way to calibrate your height right. This game is frustating and impossible to play.			"

Early Access Review
								Fantastic looking lil western shooter.  Can play against other players (small playerbase at the moment but you can help that - yes YOU review reader!) or Bots in order to increase the bounty on your head.  Love the little touches with the wanted poster etc.  Guns take a little getting used to due to the calibration - if you look down at the holster to figure out where your hands need to be then you're gonna miss grabbing them as the holster moves up naturally as you straighten your body - instead look dead on into the opponents eyes and feel for the vibration from the controllers when you put your hands down to the holster, thats how ya get the guns easier :)The games roadmap promises so much more for the future so really looking forward to seeing how it evolves over time.  Biggest problem at the moment is getting a multiplayer game - not because of a lack of other players but because theres no lobby system to meet other players outside of the duel, and sitting waiting for another player to duel you can be pointless as they might all be fighting AI bots instead of trying multiplayer mode.  If you've got a mate to duel with though its awesomesauce.  Once the salloon gets opened up in an upcoming update hopefully we'll be able to actually SEE all the players online and participate in group activities before pairing off for duels :)			"

								Getting to play hold 'em in the latest saloon update will be so fun. This game was a blast to play. Nice gfx, control scheme, fairly intuitive. Wild west dueling! What more can I say.			"

Early Access Review
								Really good game so far, has a lot of potential to be a favorite. I like it a lot so far, however, I would love it if a few things were added/fixed:-The first thing I noticed is that the hands hold the guns in an awkward position to where I dont feel like im actually holding them. They grip the handle a bit too low.-It would also be nice to be able to adjust your stance while in a duel as I have found it is easier to aim while standing sideways.-A lot of the time when you bring your hands up they are empty, would be better if you could somehow adjust the gun belt so that it is in the same stop always-When you look down while in a duel, the avatar bends its knees and the gunbelt moves out of range.-Also the guns sit a little too low, would be nbice to have a waste adjustment.-Would be awesome if you could talk to other players			"

								I'm a huge fan of westerns so I had really high hopes for this one but it was barely playable when I tried it. I will give it another shot in a few months and gladly change my review if it improves.			"

								So far this game is super frustrating.  More than half the time I come up with an empty hand when you try to pull the gun out.  And there doesn't seem to be any option to adjust your waist size or where the gun sits.  Just make it more forgiving when you press grip to pull the gun out.  Is anyone else out there experiencing this if I am missing something I'm happy to change the review.   "
