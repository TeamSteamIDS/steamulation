												Ehh. It's okay. The games are definitely colored a lot by nostalgia. The controls are kind of crap, the speed and timing are decidedly ""off"" on a modern machine, and the graphics aren't quite as good as I remember them being. That said, I'm reminded of how much I enjoyed these games in the past, and I'll definitely sink a bit of time into each one. It's a good chance to play all of these in the Amiga versions as well, which I never have done for all of them, for whatever reason.I wouldn't go out of my way to buy these without either the nostalgia factor or a keen interest in playing classic games. They're not the remakes - these are the originals. They were great at the time, but a lot of the interface improvements and so forth that you're used to seeing just aren't there; these games are 20+ years old, after all. Even so, it's a nice trip into history.I used to work for a company that was an offshoot of Cinemaware, for whatever it's worth; I've worked with several people who you'll see in the credits of these games. It may bias me one way or the other. I'm giving it a thumbs-up, but take that with a smallish grain of salt.			"

												Only recommended for those who played these back in the day, I really don't think they would hold much appeal to anybody younger. The controls can be spongy, the gameplay objectives can be obtuse and a few of them just weren't very good games even in their day. I purchased this primarily with the following five titles in mind: Rocket Ranger and Defender of the Crown (which I originally played on the C64) and TV Sports Basketball, Wings and It Came From The Desert (which I played on the Amiga). Wings and It Came From The Desert still hold up respectably well. I've found that DoC and RR are a bit too frustrating thanks to the squishy controls. TVS Basketball was a fun way to waste an hour, ahh the memories of that darn Cinemaware team shooting 70% from the field every game... but it's not something with any real staying power. So I would give this a tepid recommendation to old school C64/Amiga owners who enjoyed some of these back in the day. Even if I'll likely not spend much more time with this collection, I've done worse for $8.			"

												At the time these games came out there were three types of games: Old fashioned strategy games based on boards games, story games that involved a lot of reading with little possible action and the old standard side scrolling-style action fare. Cinemaware brought about the greatest change in gaming to date with these games. Games that blended, as seamlessly as was possible in the days of CGA graphics, the story with action. It is going to be dated for sure but they are still to this day good stories with a hint of action and/or strategy. King of Chicago was one of my favorites back then. It has a nice bit of randomness to it with a touch of sappy humor. ANd that is the attention to replayability they put into these games. Of course it is still a bit tedious sometimes but that is because of the age of programming. Well look, final verdict... If you are nostalgic for the old days then this is worth it for sure. If you want to learn about the olden days for a school project wait for a sale and if you still are looking forward to being a seniopr... walk away.			"

												If you want to get this for Defender of the Crown, STAY FAR AWAY.  The game is bugged and not how you remember it.  Your home castle isn't even in the same location!  The music is of lower quality as well.. More tinny.  I suggest searching for ""Amiga Forever"" and spend $10  for the Value Edition of their Amiga Emulator.  Then you can play Defender of the Crown just as you remembered it (and you get a working Amiga emulator to boot).			"

I also covered this game on my retro YouTube show.If you're an old school Amiga fan, you probably know the catalogue of Cinemaware, a publisher who released a series of unique games that were technical showpieces for the platform. This is a compilation of some of their greatest hits, with both Amiga and DOS versions of the games available. The DOS versions are a nice added value I suppose but they don't look or sound nearly as good as the Amiga versions. The wrapper on the collection is also decent and offers a few options including save states. It's basic but does the job.One thing to note is that most of these games have not aged well at all. If you have fondness for them from back in the day, you'll probably still enjoy them. However, if you're a gamer who didn't grow up with the Amiga, you'll likely find these incredibly frustrating to play, even if their level of visual and audio fidelity doesn't bother you. This is a collection for old school Amiga/Cinemaware fans and those with a genuine curiosity for what these historical games were about. If you aren't those things, you'll probably use this for a few minutes and give up.			"

												Jacko Rating 8.5/10A pack of old school goodies with both the Amiga and PC versions, thank you Cinemaware for releasing these classics in original format.  Playing It Came From the Desert again made me feel like I was back in high school with a opened Jaw expression due to the top end graphics and game play back then - this was one of the best games of my youth.If you are an old school gamer like me then just buy this now and be done with it :)  A true trip down memory lane to be had here.For those PC lovers out there who questioned us Amiga 500 gamers back in the day take a look at the difference in versions of these games and tell me you wouldn't have gone Amiga for personal home computer during this era of games.  My only hope is that Cinemaware releases updated versions of these as they did with Wings recently, if this does happen I can die a hapy man.Old Schoolers Enjoy! "

												Ten dollars for this collection is absolutely stellar. They are what they are... Emulated classic games, with all the pros and cons of the originals, including floaty controls and lengthy load times. But the emulation is spot on, and the graphics remain surprisingly decent given their age. I would have a tough time recommending it for anyone who had never experienced these games, but for someone aching for nostalgia of some of the best games of the Amiga era, I can't recommend this package enough. Ten dollars is a steal for such a compilation of Golden Oldies.			"

												Wow, I remember thinking these games were great when I was growing up. I am much older and wiser today. However, I am not wise enough to stay away from this one even at at a $1.49 sale price. Seriously, all kidding aside, in my opinion these games as they are presented in this bundle are not very much fun or very playable. There is no sound and no joystick control in the PC versions (DOSBox). The Amiga emulation, while offering sounds and joystick control, are a tad sluggish. There is not much, if any, documentation for the games. I am sure one can find ways to tweak and tune DOSBox and the Amiga emulator to make these more enjoyable as well as finding documentation for the games on the interweb, but I think I am just going to move on to something else. The nostalgia is great but it kind of ends there.			"

												Perhaps to due licensing issues ""The Three Stooges"" is missing from otherwise almost complete compilation and definitively a must have!For the asking price, I expected inclusion of 'gallery of game memorabilia' such as 'orginal box cover art', 'manual' and 'extra goodies'. GOG do offer a bit more than just the core game at considerably more cost being sold individually that ought to be included here. Example of compilation done properly was 2001's ""Atari: Anniversary Edition"".Amiga versions are vastly superior sound and graphically to PC offerings which could've been left out. Owning the originals of quite a few of these games on both platforms, authenticity has been lost as a result of some weird decisions made by the developer. Most annoyingly stripping out mouse support in some games that originally supported them notably ""It Came From the Desert"" series reverting to keyboard control for both Amiga and PC versions. The same game on PC uses tweaked Beeper (Speaker) for digitised sound effects (not music) which is supiciously absent whereas it runs fine from my original in DOSBox with mouse support, music and digitised sound effects.  Only buy it on discount otherwise you may feel cheated.			"

												I used to play a handful of these games back in my Amiga days. After I bought my Amiga 1000 the first game I got was Defender of the Crown. Back then the graphics blew me away. Especially coming from the graphically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Commodore 64 I had before that. (and the C64 was a great computer too.)Several years later after I upgraded to an Amiga 500 I played classics like It Came From the Desert and Wings and more.Today I don't think to many kids would buy this anthology. It doesn't have the appropriate amount of bling-mapping kids these days require and, to be honest, the controls do feel a bit ""off"".No, this collection of games are for those who played them back in their youth and enjoy the nostalgia kick you might get from replaying them. Or, it's for the individual who might play a retro classic much like a film buff might go back and watch an Orson Wells film and appreciate the film/game for what it was and the technical ability to make such a classic.But that's not everybody.Anyway, it's unfair to judge any retro game by modern sensibilities. That is graphics, gameplay, sound and etc. so I will not apply a score. These are simply games that defined a great part of my youth and Iook at them for that and I replay them to relive that.			"

												Not recommended. When I saw this collection I thought you could relive the excitement of the era and Amiga games at the time i could only see in images on magazines. Play them, however, it is another thing. It was not done anything to improve emulation speed and load times or the overall speed, both for grapgics and for the input lag that makes sections arcade virtually unplayable. Maybe are recommended (only) to those who have played in the past, in this case i think will bring to light all the excitement (and frustration) that have been forgotten. I requested a refund.			"

												This collection is too horrible to waste anyone´s time and money on. The Amiga game versions have better graphics, but that´s where the differences end - the games (both PC and Amiga) have terrible loading times (often I did not know, if the game was loading or froze), confusing and/or unresponsive controls (for instance it´s ""great"" to save a steam screenshot everytime you close a game - you do this by pressing F12) and confusing gameplay. I am sorry to say it, but I regret buying this collection. They should have at least optimized the games for modern PCs, for god´s sake! Cheers. :)			"

												For the nostalgic only. All of these games are horrendous by today's standards and have aged even worse than 90s FMV adventure games.Each of these game takes a setup of half strategy game, half adventure game, and has different minigame portions. Each portion is terrible. There is no strategy to the strategic portion, the adventure portions are barely there and feel like they were written by 10 year olds, and the minigames are worse than 90% of any free Flash game on the internet. For example, the minigames in Wings are full of anti-aircraft guns that you cannot avoid. A fatal hit can kill you in the first 5 seconds of a mission. One strafing mission saturates the area with anti-aircraft guns and it's impossible to not get shot down even if you ignore the targets and constantly move around, which is what the manual tells you is the way to dodge AA fire. And that's the BEST minigame of the bundle. Most of them just have you wait and push a button at the right time. One button push. That's it. End of minigame. They're shallow and short to the point of being Warioware levels, except you have to wait several minutes between games.And yes, the waiting. The emulation is perfect in that the load times of 1980s computers is just as long. Every time you change a screen, be ready to sit through 5-15 seconds of loading. Need to hop into your spaceship to shoot down enemies? You have to wait 10 seconds to watch your guy go down an elevator, then another 10 seconds of him running down a corridor. Every time. Several times.Then there's the emulation. You're given the choice between the Amiga versions and the PC versions. The problem is that the Amiga versions lightyears better looking graphics (PC versions are 4 color CGA most of the time, all the screenshots here are the Amiga versions) but the PC versions are lightyears better in the gameplay department. Most the gameplay in the Amiga versions is so bad it's virtually unplayable. For example there's no way to end your turn in Defender of the Crown (Amiga) other than invading a territory or holding a tournament. Attacking every turn before you're ready is suicide, so you have to end most of your turns with tournaments, which means sitting through the looooooong horrible joust minigame every turn. If your character sucks at jousting, your fame and leadership stats go into the toilet. The PC version has much better options and lets you end your turn manually, but the graphics are too ugly to look at (even for someone like me who was around in the 80s) and the PC speaker music beeps make your ears bleed. The other problem is that while the Amiga versions function, most of the PC versions do not. It's like they screwed up the DOS Box configurations. I could only get a single game's PC version to run.AVOID unless you played all these back in the day and are really, really jonesing for a nostalgia fix. Just go watch 30 seconds of gameplay from something like King of Chicago or Sinbad on Youtube to see how truly bad these relics are. "
