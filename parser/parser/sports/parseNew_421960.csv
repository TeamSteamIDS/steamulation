												I love fishing, it has become one of my favorite things todo besides gaming. Sadly this game does a horrible job at even attempting at the genre.I want to start with the most important stuff.. Is this game a cash grab? Or a p2w mess? It's both.First off you can buy items to upgrade your gear off the bat. The market place is full of overpriced cosmetics for your character that looks sorta like a every game from 2005, but cosmetics are not p2w at all. Well there is an ""upgrading"" RNG style that requires items you can buy from the market place for that sole purpose, with the odds of failing causing you to lose a + on said items (+2 Rod fails to +3, turns into +1 Rod etc)Now how will P2W be a problem in a fishing game? Well if all you want to do is fish.. and nothing competitive then sure it delivers that.. oh wait did I mention most items are rented? Including items in the market place that you pay real cash for end up vanishing after 7/15/30 days etc, so it kinda means that if you don't use said items you spent real cash for.. it goes to waste, obligating you to continue playing because of investments.. But then the upgrading comes into play too.. say there are some sort of tornaments/events being ran at the time.. guess who will probably win? The guy who is spending hundreds on his gear and boat etc etc.Now that the important stuff is out of the way lets go into the other non important stuff (my opinion)The graphics are horrible. This game has such dated graphics that it just had to be some sort of cash grab on the fishing market.. honestly get past all those fancy looking screenshots and actually try the game. That's about it for the graphics.The UI is just plain bad and unresponsive, there seems to be lag between anything you want to do. Even putting an item on gives you a prompt to wait for some reason.. (I feel like this game failed previously because of some duping due to this mechanic.)The music well.. it's a fishing game.. you probably wouldn't want to listen to elevator music while you play anyway so expect the same MIDI file over and over.Overall if you can live without the p2w and rented items, and the bad UI.. and you enjoy fishing games.. then by all means go for it. I honestly like the game and am willing to look past the UI but I just can't get involved with p2w games. I also greatly dislike the renting mechanic used in many free games.			"

												Note:I feel Steam reviews have gone sharply down hill with reviews now saying things like ""uninstall/10""""the uninstall button worked""DISCLAIMER:I spent a lot more time on an account on the website priort to the Steam release.Review:While the game had an initial launch issue which caused users to be unable to register/sign in it has been fixed and all should now work in regards to that.When entering the game you complete a simple tutorial which shows you the basic that you need to start completing quests and levelling up.There are plenty of quests to help you along your way joined with daily login fuel means that you are constatntly getting free things.Opening the shop reveal a 2nd currency. ""Pearls"" these are the premium currency which can be used to buy exclusive items (It should be mentioned that these are NOT P2W) such as clothing and as I understand fuel, should you need it. However, while the option is there to purchase fuel for money, there never really seemed a reason to as it showers you with refills at the start of the game and while you are completeting quests. There are also daily quests I think that give fuel refills meaning that you only really need to purchase anything should you want to assist the developers.The gameplay is nice and simple to start with timings and tactits being improved as you play. There are LOTS of fish to get so you can complete the encyclopedia. (Which also gives rewards).Overall I feel that it is a fairly solid MMO for this type of game (Similarly to Winning Putt and similar titles). It also leaves great room for expansion should they want to add more areas in future patches or within DLCs. (Which I wouldnt be too mad at as long as they were a reasonable price. Unlike some MMO's)6.5 - 7/10UPDATE:I have seen some replies from the developer and can agree wholeheartedly that they at times act unprofessional when taking criticisms. Stating that they are inappropriate when the developers are actually just being childish and overreacting.			"

												Created account, created character, click Start.""The channel you have selected is full. Please select another channel""*looks for a way to change channels, finds nothing**Uninstalls*Uninstaller works perfect.Edit: And now I've been banned by the Devs for being unhappy with their clearly broken game. Not a good way to gain players when you're banning reviewers for speaking the truth.My review will stand. Pass on this game and wait for a good fishing game. The devs are acting like the Donald Trump of devs and silencing any dissenters who call out their broken game.I was going to give the game another go since they supposedly ""fixed"" the issues but now I would rather sit on a cactus.Broken game, terrible devs. This belongs in the garbage, not Steam.Go play Fishing Planet instead.

												I was some what excited for this game when I heard about it. Growing up i played alot of the bass pro fishing and it was a lot of fun so when i heard there was a game like it online to play with friends I decided to try it. It seemed promising at first but then it quickly became bland and boring. No interesting places to go fish at and if there is its ""out of bounds"" and  you can't fish there. Under water cameras are in the game but its not always an option you actually run out its not just always there which really isn't that much of a big deal but weird. One of the major turn aways was the horrible boat controls and terrible animation. The ""star fish"" look like sliding fajita scoops. When you catch a fish if you try to keep it its takes about 2 minutes to register that then you can go play again			"

												Dont mind the negative reviews written from people with 0.3 hours,,,this is a nice cool fishing game,first of all, it is definitely the best free fishing MMO, if you want to have fun, just try it for a few hours, then you will see why i say its good.There is a character progression with upgradeable stats, quests, daily free fuel and events to entertain us .PROS-decent graphics-daily quests-hundreds of fish types to be caught-rewarding quests-aquarium to store favourite fish-fish wiki which makes grinding have a sense of fulfillment-plenty of maps-great community, very helpful and friendly-pvp mode great for fuel farming-some fights can take up to 30 minutes with tougher fish-GM's are very active and make events quite often-not p2w, cash items are for convenience-chat is very active and useful to learn stuff quickCONS-nothing i found annoying so far, sometimes game crashes, i had 2 in 53 hoursFishing lovers are going to definitely like this game, great job from the devs keep it up!Edit:Guild PRO_PVP_CLUB is welcoming new members, tips and tricks included , feel free to join us!

												I really enjoy the game but it is not for everyone. If you are into Action games, you might feel bored. If you like Fishing, however, or relaxing sports games like Shot Online and Winning Put, you should give it a try.I already played the web version for few months. In the beginning catching fish is easy but if you progress it will become more challenging (swing, timing, moving boat, right equipment). It was great to catch my first shark and I love my new boat.The game is not P2W. I spend some money and felt it was worth it but you don't need to.			"

												Another Steam game to AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Says it's free to play.. but is it really? Nope. Realistic? Nope. Boring and tedious? Yep. German company that doesn't care about making the game good... only about making money from their 'free-to-play' game. Customer support does not exist. I noticed many players' accounts being closed who say anying bad about the game or simply suggesting that something be fixed. I decided to leave the game because of this. Too many good people were getting their accounts closed for wanting to make the game better. Truly a piece of junk to be avoided.			"

												Don't waste your time and money on this P2W (pay-to-win) garbage created by a bunch of illuminati scumbags called Masangsoft and InselGames. I have about 20+ hours of playtime with the non-Steam version of WoF (because the developer repeatedly failed to release the Steam version since May) and thus I possess enough information and experience to share with potential players.First of all, this game is 100% pay-to-win. Whoever spend the most money on buying, upgrading and renting the best gear and boats would definitely win the PvP matches and tournaments. In addition, those items that you spend real money on renting will *DISAPPEAR* after the rental period (e.g., 1 or 2 weeks). For casual players who aren't familiar with rental systems in MMOGs, I need to remind you that *your hard-earned money will be completely WASTED if you don't keep playing during the rental period*. Therefore, think twice before you invest your real cash in renting any shiny fishing gear. Also, you'll need to spend real money on buying fuel for your boat if you want to play for a long time because the free fuel provided is extremely limited. Yes, that means even if you want to play casually, you'll still need to spend real money on buying fuel. This p2w garbage is just a blatant and shameless cash grab.What's more, I need to warn you all that the developer and the publisher probably belong to the illuminati group, which is a pagan / occult organization notorious for observing Satanic rituals. The tag ""Illuminati"" was originally designated by the developer / publisher on the store page before the game was released on Steam. However, after several warnings were issued to some players about the possible illuminati relationship with the developer, the tag was immediately removed by the developer. And when I questioned about the association of the developer with illuminati, my message got deleted and I was banned by the developer without any explanation. Sounds pretty fishy, doesn't it? You'll put your personal and financial information AT RISK if you make any in-game purchases and share the information with these illuminati scumbags. The illuminati group is notorious for observing Satanic rituals -- I can't imagine how these loathsome morons will use your personal and financial data.Moreover, the programming ability of this developer is obviously questionable. Did you guys know that this Steam version of WoF had been delayed for 5-6 times since it first appeared on the ""coming soon"" page of Steam in May? Since May, the developer had REPEATEDLY delayed the release of this Steam version because they failed utterly at creating a Steam integration system with the original WoF. Those serious server issues (e.g., login failures, unbearable lags) which all players experience now are probably caused by tons of unexpected bugs in their Steam integration program and netcodes. In fact, the prevailing server issues also reflect the complete LACK OF QA (quality assurance) TESTING before the release of this Steam version. Honestly, I really doubt the developer's ability in fixing game-breaking bugs and even glitches in the future. Finally, the graphics of this trash are a joke. The character models, boats, and the fishing environments look like they were created in the 90s. The user interface is cumbersome and un-user-friendly. There's always some LAG when equipping or changing fishing gear, which is extremely annoying and prevents you from having a smooth gaming experience.In conclusion, do NOT waste your precious time and money on this pay-to-win garbage created by a bunch of illuminati scumbags who aren't even capable of creating a simple Steam integration system. Their inability has resulted in the current server issues that are dampening all players' gaming experiences. Of course, don't forget these morons probably belong to the illuminati group, a pagan / occult organization that follows Satanic rituals. Thus, your personal and finanical information would be at risk if you share them in making any in-game purchase.			"

												A great game but when they give you a quest to do and you win a boat, it states 3 days, now under a normal players assumption you would think it would be 3 days but to them it's 3 games playing on any three maps. The fish are great & the fuel you need for the boats are a bit ridiculous.. And the fuel, The fuel ratio is setup to make sure you can not play for an entire day without having to buy the fuel with real cash, no where to buy fuel with shells and in order to recieve fuel you have to login every day / night to recieve 5 ( small canisters ) of fuel which is surely not enough. once you do throw your line in your using up your fuel just to stay with the fish because a lot of the fish are fast paced. If these concerns are addressed and fixed these would be one of the best fishing games on steam otherwise keep looking...			"

												If you make it through the the incredibly difficult for no reason, way to sign up just go ahead and uninstall, this game is not good, i played to almost lvl 18 and realized there was nothing going to get better, the coolest aspect of the game(underwater cameras) are pointless, you cant avoid anything but you sure can stare at a shrimp while u wait , the way they have the perfered bait layed out makes 0 sense , the way the maps are set up is confusing and pointless really i casted anywhere with any bait and caught every fish on the map when u move out further into the ocean they just get a little bigger? to level wasnt satisfying at all the jump from 5 to 10 was the exact same things same color just a little better stats wise , play it to 10 and youve played the game all they do is add bars for the fish and make it harder by making you operate a boat while fishing even if you have a navagator in the chair doing nothing, just scoot back and reel , wow so hard, do yourselves a favor and download fishing planet way better game truly free and 100x more satisfying than this  buggy terd			"

												I really wanted to like this game when I first saw it on steam and it was pending release.  I played early this morning when the servers were overloaded and it took forever to do anything like equip gear and baits.  So the servers eventually got overloaded and needed another hamster on the wheel.  I do a few things around the house and cut the grass.  Few hours had passed and it is now 4:00pmEST and all I can do is get to the character login screen.  I click on my character and then ""Go"" and nothing happens, the button stays greyed like it is still loading but after a minute or two nothing happens.  I can open the create character screen but not login with the character I already made.  Their servers are in dire need of an upgrade to make this game enjoyable for someone just starting out in it.  Due to this I cannot reccomend.  IF they get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together I would reccomend the game, I only got to fish for about an hour of my playtime but it looks like it has the potental to be a fun game to play.Edit:  Looks like they got most of the kinks worked out, this game is a LOT of fun for a casual video fisherman/woman.  Probably not the most realistic fishing game but it is enjoyable anyways.  It's free to play download it and give it a shot, doesn't take up that much room and runs pretty well on my desktop.			"

I wouldn't care so much cause restarting 5 minutes into the game is no big deal, but everytime I have to remake my character for some reason the name I used is now taken. Where are all my characters, and how do I get my names back. The login server always seems to be down as well.  Sorry World of Fishing you have killed my hype in less than 30 minutes			"

												Okay, here's the scoop, it's a fairly fun game at the start, but as time goes along it gets very old very quickly. I hate to be the, free2play but pay2win, guy, but there is a valid argument to be had there. I could live with that but, in all honesty, it's more like pay to play. they do a fine job early on of disguising this fact with free items awarded from quests. the first week or 2 you have access to a few ""pearl"" boats as quest rewards, and plenty of fuel because the quest reward boats (also available for purchase with real world money) get roughly 5 times  the fuel economy of the standard boats bought with in game currency. Once your lvl 30 free ""pearl"" boat disapears, that's it your on your own, and you go from using maybe 1 gas can every hour or so to needing 3 gas cans just to get to the far side of ONE area. You can spend a bit of real money and get a pearl boat and an upgraded version of you fishing equipment, (rod and reel), and then your set right.....I'm afraid not....They have a limited use, they are not ""timed"" as ppl balked at the idea of paying real money for an item that dissapears after 30 days. so instead they have a certain amount of ""health"". When that health has been depleted, it is not useable any more unless you get a repair kit, which only cost about 10 days worth of daily quest rewards, unfortunately it only takes about a week to burn up your equipment if you play many hours daily, which you will  do if you want to accomplish anything. so one repair kit every 9-10 days, which is enough to repair one item about halfway, ...you have three pcs of equipment you can't leave the dock to go fishing without, that all need repaired. it's pretty easy math.... you ain't gonna keep up, of course the only way to get fuel without whipping out the credit card is to use those daily rewards, so you won't likely be able to get more than one repair kit a month.I like the game concept, as i am a completionist and a collector, but the money grab here is just a bit more than i'm willing to get into.I miss the good old days when a game was payed for one time and then you had access to the entirety of the game.I would spend a bit of money here because i enjoy the game, but i am not going to start dumping cash down a  bottomless money pit.I realize that these game companies are in the business of making money, not providing me free entertainment, ....but there are honest and upfront ways to go about doing that, you won't find those here.just my take on things, and others' thoughts may vary.

												Finally a fun fishing game. I grew up playing ""Super Black Bass"" from like 96' on the NES also, Bassin's Black Bass with Hank Parker another old school fishing game. This game has quests, upgrades, looks beautiful, ( I read somewhere that that couldn't play it in high rez) I have everything turned all the way up seems to work and look fine to me. It has some crashing issues and bugs that need to be worked out little laggy at some points but.....its free I'll give them a few days b4 I go saying its not a good game. I don't have a lot of time logged yet so i will evaluate more in the future...idk if there is tourneys or anything of the sort yet, i hope so, if not i hope its added. It has group chat like WOW where you can talk to other people that are playing. **The only 2 things it has lacked to me is customization. I say this in the you cant really pick colors of anything at all which is disappointing because this is an MMO kinda. & There is definitely a lack of information on your person stats but hasn't affect me in anyway.**Catching fish is not too easy, yet not too hard, it requires 2 hands and you to actually play the game but its not over sensitive. **This is Not a realistic fishing game in the wait around sense at all, you will be catching tons of fish, its meant to be fun. **Leveling up my character seemed fairly easy but fun. The quests are a little repetitive but I mean its a fishing game, your catching fish.  This game is great as a free game and has potential to be amazing with paid or free DLC			"

												I wasn't expecting much, especially since it's a free to play game, but I am not only surprised, I'm happily addicted already.  Many times I've wondered what my MMORPG character, from any game I've played, would do on their day off.  Every hero needs some down time.  We get castles, livestock, all kinds of goodies - we travel to far off lands and see so many activities that we would like to partake in...This is what I consider my character's vacation resort.  Relax, fish, listen to the gulls crying and the waves crashing...nice reward for all the hard work of collecting, killing bosses, and assisting the never ending supply of hapless and helpless villagers.Of course, if you have to be competitive, as do I, there's definitely room for that in both PVP mode and free mode.  You'll find a large variety of fish to catch, and it's not just ""sit in a boat and drop a line"", you have to find the dang things...and then hope they eat your bait before yet. another. mackeral comes along.Right now some things load a little slow but that appears to be getting worked on, and I am writing this review while waiting for the servers to allow us all back in - we got mass booted - but overall, this game is relaxing, interesting, fun, and addicting.You can buy things if you want, but you don't have to buy anything.  It's free to play - of course they are going to have a shop - but that doesn't mean you have to shop there...it will just take you longer than someone who buys all of their gear.  What's the rush?  The whole point of fishing is to chill.			"

												Actually a real fun fishing game. Especially once you get used to the mechanics.I've been playing for a few days and just hit level 22. Here's my thoughts and advice:1. The questing system is designed where you must activate (accept) each one before you can fish for the requirements. And there's a limit of 15 active quests at a time.First, activate all of the daily quests. You get free fuel and c-coins.Second, determine where you will fish and accept all quests that correspond with that location.Third, go to the location and open your mini-map. Go to 'quests', toggle each of them off and on to see which area on the map would reap the most quest objectives and drive your boat to that spot.Fourth, go fish.2. Do not buy fish hooks from the store. You can get these from the fortune cards that are randomly rewarded while fishing.3. Do the Sudden Mission quests (the timed ones that pop up).4. Don't try to fish beyond your level. You'll deplete your resources. I focused on the first location and completing the Fish Wiki for it before moving to the second location.And I still have over 60 fuel tanks and countless underwater cams (which I haven't even used since the tutorial).5. When fishing, it's all about timing. The best way to get a catch is to after casting, position your view (with right mouse button) to where you can see the floater. You want to aim to yank the hook right when the floater gets pulled completely underwater.And when swinging, do it in the opposite direction the fish is swimming.If you manage to stun the fish, don't bother swinging again. Just release tension to bring it out of the red and continue reeling.If the fish swims towards the boat try to move out of the way: left side - press ""A"", right side - press ""D"". If it heads straight for the nose... lol. Sorry.6. Another FAQ I see is where/how to sell the fish?To sell fish, you have to be at the dock. At the dock, simply open your livewell and you'll see te option to sell them.Keep in mind that some quests may require you to turn in a fish. Be sure not to sell any of those or you'll have to recatch them.Most quests, however, only require you to catch the fish and are safe to be sold (or released) after catching.7. A personal preference: I turn the music from the game all the way down as I find it a bit annoying.And then I open Spotify and play an offline playlist in the background while running the game.8. A lot of the hiccups the game had on launch were from the understimated demand for this type of game on Steam. The first day, the servers were pushed beyond their limits because there just isn't a quality fishing game on Steam.Since then, they've stabilized the servers and things are running much smoother now.9. One thing I do dislike is having to retype my e-mail and password every time I launch the game to log in. It would be nice if it at least remembered the e-mail.On the bright side, this is a game that a second person can play on the same computer with a different profile without worry of them accidentally gimping yours.10. You'll notice that sessions are on two hour timers. This is undoubtedly to deter people from camping. This is actually a good thing because each room (or session) has a limit of number of players.However, as beautiful as the game is... you're not pressured to fish and you can waste a few minutes just chatting and enjoying the visuals (which has really good weather dynamics and ambient sounds).Two hours is plenty of time, anyway, to fish.Of course, if the timer runs out you just spawn back in the room lobby and launch another two-hour session. No biggie.All in all, I would say that this is a really polished fishing game and I really enjoy it. Two worms up!			"

												First off, this is my first review so if I make any errors please go easy on me. Now for the review: It's hard for me to find a game that I really like that I can play almost daily and not get bored. However, this fishing game has gotten me hooked! (pun intended) Before the steam release, there wasn't a lot of players in WoF and I think that the devs underestimated the amount of players the game would have after release. So I think that is the reason why the servers are getting overloaded leading to bugs and glitches. For that reason, the game is getting a lot of downvotes. Don't worry though, the devs are fixing it as I write this review. One of the best things about this game is the community and the devs. The devs communicate with the players very well. When I first got this game on the WoF website, I wasn't sure if they would make the concept of an MMORPG fishing game work but boy was I wrong. To sum things up, I would definitely recommend playing this game. I'll give it a 8-9/10.			"

												This is my first review just FYI. Excuse typos and what not.I don't think I have to say World of Fishing is a fishing simulator/MMO.The launch was rocky but what launch isnt rocky for an MMO? I had problems logging in for the first few days, same with my friend. Server issues are not stands for a negative review in my eyes since the team wasn't prepared for the influx of users following the release on the Steam platform. Yes the lag was horrendous but back to my first point what MMO had a perfect start with no server issues? There has been many many launches way worse than this one. Again I know it is odd, the thought that a steam realease wouldn't be big but every MMORPG that has had a seperate steam launch has had the same experience. I can't fault them for it. Also they have been quick to address almost every issue.*Edit* Even with the lag issues still going on. There has been improvement. If you play during down times its all good. Thats not a good thing just a little obvious tip. Though games like ToS had worse lag issues for weeks and weeks so again. I can't fault them.Once I did get in game though I was met with a surprising little gem. This game is unique and fun. That's something that is very hard for someone as critical as me to say.The mechanics are easy to grasp (Though the explanation of them could be a little bit better, the tutorial is a little iffy as in I had to figure out a handful of mechanics on my own thankfully I've played almost every MMO out there so nothing too bad. It's all very basic and if you've played any MMORPG extensively you should be able to get it pretty quick)As for the tutorial I hope once the updated voice lines are patched it might make a little more sense. A suggestion I have is to bold key information like areas you have to catch fish in for certain quest etc.The mechanics are pretty basic but is just enough (More than point, click, use skill, click, hotkeys etc) to keep you interested and focused. Having to swing, position your boat and etc actually keep me awake while I'm out there fishing. That's enough for me to give this one a thumbs up for real because any MMO would be a mindless grind. This one is a sort of grind but it's not mindless and you do have to pay some attention. I haven't tried the team battles yet but I'll get to that some time soon. The thought of it though is pretty interesting. I had a surprising amount of fun the first time I launched this game.As for the realisim I can't say how accurate it is. I'm not a fishing person and I have no knowledge of the ocean or anything. If that's a factor for you, they do boast being the most realistic fishing simulator so you can judge from that. It is easy to notice that you can get fuel for free as daily rewards! It is easy to notice that items that you recieve as rewards are timed but you can also get these items as permenants. This is not a new concept. If you simply look around the UI you can find all of these. When you first log in, You get the fuel reward so it's not like you have to log in a second time to even see that feature. If you don't want to spend cash. You're gonna have to play the game. This is not a new concept. I can't say if the rates are fair since I'm still around the early levels of the game so I'm still using my timed items but even so if the prices are high, still nothing new going on here.There's more to get into but as you can see from my game time I haven't seen all this game has to offer. I might drop more info once I get to it.As of now, I highly recommend this game for some relaxing angling fun. TENOUTTATEN..maybe like a 8/10 for real though.			"

												This is pretty much a repackaging / port of an old fishing MMO by name of Fishing Hero. But do not let the failure of the previous title make you think this game is not worth playing because it is strangely addictive and thrilling.Pros: 919 total catchable fish as of the time I am writing this review on 2016/11/15. I love that each fish has its own unique textures and way of swimming / fighting. I absolutely adore the level of details that each map holds. And it has one of the very few music backgrounds that I can listen to for hours without wanting to shoot myself. Extremely addictive trying to catch the biggest fish of each species, and needing to find the best fishing areas for each specific species. The weather varies and brings realistic changes in the fish behavior causing certain species to become more or less aggressive for example. A wide variety of maps to fish each with their own fish unique to that map makes for an amazing experience. Fish bite the bait fairly quickly so no boredom waiting for a strike unlike the real fishing world. PvP is fun rather than stressful because there are no losers as everyone gets awarded for participating. Players do not ""compete"" for spawns. Each spawned fish is unique to the angler putting the bait into the water, and boats don't bump into each other or interfere with each other's catch attempts. An aquarium feature that allows you to save some of your catches and even turn them into a monitor screensaver.Cons: There are some bugs still in the current version of the game, including a nasty one with the Holding feature occasionally causing fish to teleport. There is a deliberate line of code in the game that causes a fish to instantly become insanely unlikely to spawn the instant you accept a quest for catching it even while the fish rarity display will say it is very common to be found. Which in turn forces you to artificially hunt fish in the same location for hours just to finish one quest. Boats become deeper and deeper gas guzzlers which practically forces players to PvP at higher levels since its the best way to earn free gas, and to buy gas you need to pay money. Some of the features that were available for Fishing Heroes end life, have not yet been reintroduced to this new version of the game such as night fishing.Neither a Pro nor a Con: Free players can play the game and enjoy it well into their 50s in levels. However purchasing the game currency of ""Pearls"" will definitely make the game easier for a player since it allows purchase of better statted perma gear among other things. But a free player can play forever without feeling like they are missing out on the experience the pearl players achieve.Finally, I would suggest however that you not put any points into the Endurance stat when levelling up as its a point sink waste. Barely any extra stamina gains from putting points into it, but points in other two stats have a significant impact on damage done or rate that you do damage as well as ""skill"" usage. It has been consistently proven in-game that players who added Endurance equally to the other stats have a slower experience landing fish based on current fishing dynamics.Overall I am definitely enjoying this game and would recommend it to anyone interested in a fishing game. It could be improved, and hopefully will be, but in its current state its definitely a good game to spend a few hours a day in.			"

												Sorry, but this game appears to be a bad mobile game port. P2W model! no, thank you! Game play isn't great. It's arcade fishing. If you want simulation, stick with Fishing Planet. If you want something more social and easy, go for this.UPDATE:And here I find I'm still playing this game. So! Here's what I like. If you ever played the arcade fishing game from Sega, Bass Fishing, and enjoyed it? you'll enjoy this game too. Though lacking on the action since it's ocean fishing but it's mind numbing simple fun. The grind feels easier.			"

												At first this game is amusing, but you wil notice that its a Pay To Win RNG fishing game. the RNG is a big pain, if you get a mission the AI will lower your chances of getting that fish in the RNG, even when you are using the most liked bait in in an area where that fish is supposed to be found. After too many hours I feel that this game with its current scheem of lowering your chances to catch what you are trying is a waste of time.			"

												This game is on a whole other level of amazing. I downloaded this expecting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fishing game to have a couple of laughs at before swiftly uninstalling but I was wrong. I was greeted by  a cluster **** of fish catching stupidity with MMO like mechanics.PROS-numerous quests-graphics aren't utter crap-time consuming quests/gameplay-many items to make your character look more kawaii-infinite fishes (not really)-fighting the fish can be action packed-playing with friends if extremely fun-decent progression and stats systemCONS-begining can by pretty orcaward (Im sorry)-the whole experience can be slightly overwhelming due to the packed HUDOverall this game is a masterpiece 10/10I really don't sea why people dislike this game so much, they are all full of carp!

(THE PUNS CANNOT BE STOPPED)This game really hooked me in!

Posted: September 9, 2016
Since this is a shamefully long review, here's the short version:All-in-all, if you want to try out a fun fishing game with a social element, that doesn't take itself too seriously, then I heartily recommend giving World of Fishing a go, even though it is a little rough around the edges.And the long version:Having reached level 30 in-game (lvl 80 is the maximum), I feel I am now in a position to do a little write-up on World of Fishing.To start off, let me say that I feel many reviews on Steam are doing this game a real disservice.  I wish people could take a little time to play a game before writing it off and taking a dump on the developer's hard work.  It must be infuriating to put a lot of effort into trying to make something fun, only to have it unfairly torn to shreds in public.  Anyway, on to my opinion of World of Fishing:The game is a diamond in the rough.Like many, I downloaded it the day it launched on Steam, and yeah, it was a bit of a mess.  Servers were causing trouble, from what I understand.  Some couldn't register an account.  Some couldn't log in after registering.  And if you did log in, the gameplay was hampered by terrible lag.However, it seems the developers have been working hard, and most of these problems are now fixed.  The gameplay is really smooth, with very little lag.Yes, it is a F2P game, and yes you can spend money in-game for upgrades and such.  However, of all the F2P games I have tried, this is one that doesn't require you to fork out tons of money to keep playing.  There are plenty of ways to acquire the things you need.  Some of which you discover as you go along.  Sure, you can burn through cash if you want to, but it is not a necessity and I do not feel held back if I choose to play on the cheap.(Small disclaimer: I have not yet tried the PvP competitive fishing side, so I cannot say whether there is a P2W element there.  I shall update you when I get around to it.)That said, I have spent some money on WoF, because in the end of the day there are people working on the game and they need to eat and even turn a profit on their efforts.  Let's be honest, game development is not a pro bono endeavor.There is a lot of fun to be had in World of Fishing.  Be warned though, it is not a fishing simulator.The gameplay is very much on the arcade side.  To me, this is a plus.  Personally, I do not enjoy fishing in real life, unless I am hungry.  If you want to wait around for ages for something to bite, WoF will probably not be your thing.I do not mean say that WoF is not challenging.  Once you step out of the starter area, you will quickly find fish that behave in unique ways and put up a real fight.  It can be a blast trying to reel in a tough albacore, for example.  You have to maneouver your boat, watch your line tension, top up your stamina with energy drinks, and pull off various combos to wear the thing down.If you like snooping around, there are special types of fish hiding in lots of areas, which contribute to an element of exploration.  When you find one, you will know the second it tears off with your hook, abruptly changes direction, ducks under your boat and snaps your line in a heartbeat, leaving you gaping and wondering what just happened. But try some more and finally catch the thing and you will feel rewarded for persevering.All of your catches can be sold for in-game currency, but you also have the option of storing your favorites in your personal aquarium to admire for as long as you like.There is planning and character leveling involved too.  Just about everything can be upgraded to give you an edge.  You have to stock up on different kinds of bait.  You earn fuel by fulfilling quests to keep your boat going.  And all of it is very enjoyable.  However, some of it does take a while to understand, and the UI is a little clunky.If you can't wrap your head around some game mechanic, then just ask in chat, or on the forums.  The community is helpful and, despite what some have said in their Steam reviews, the moderators and GMs are friendly and welcoming.  Don't be shy.While I do enjoy World of Fishing, it is definitely rough around the edges.The graphics are outdated.  I wouldn't let it detract from the experience though.  I have played a ton of beautiful AAA titles with state-of-the-art graphics, and I would rather exchange a beautiful game for a fun one any day.The music is very silly, and I muted it in a flash.Lastly, there are only 12 character models to choose from.  6 male.  6 female.  And unfortunately, they all look cartoonish.  Which was a little disappointing.  Maybe the devs can bring out more in the future, who knows?Thanks for reading.  Hope it helps.  Maybe see you on the water!polarnomad			"

												Lets get one thing out of the way first.  About 90% of the negative reviews are from people with less than an hour of playing the game or experienced some NEW game issues that most, if not ALL new MMO's experience and were a little hasty in their review because of frustration from these issues.  With that said, as of 10/10/2016 this game is void of those issues.  I didn't know what to expect from the game.  I do fish and was a little skeptical that a game could really capture the essence of REAL fishing.  Thought it would be arcadey.  Well, this game is fantastic as far as fishing is concerned.  There are over 250 fish to catch acccording to the devs.  If you ever fished before AND like fishing, this game is the best out there.  I haven't played any other fishing game before because of my skepticism of someone capturing the essence of it but, this game has to be the best...EVER!!!  I can't picture any other fishing game trumping this one!!  And if there is such a game, it won't beat this game by much, if at all!!!  I highly reccomend that you get this game if you enjoy fishing.  There are things that you can purchase in the game but, they are not necessary purchase.  The ONLY reason you would is because you are anxious to get to higher levels OR you really enjoy the game that much.  I'm the latter.  I haven't spent a dime on this game.  Why?  There is no need to IF you have the time to play the game on a regular.  If you can only play, like, once a week, then you might have to spend money.  I'm thinking about one of the DLC packs cause I want more of this wonderful game.  Other then that, if you do like fishing, you will love this game i gurantee it.  Only thing missing is the smell of the great outdoors and you.  I would consider this to be a fishing simulator!!!  It is that good!!  The best fishing game to date in my opinion.  Download and enjoy.			"

												I was just one of the many user's who simply could not wait to try this game, downloading their offical client from the website & creating an account, it was truly worth the hassle & the time months ago.(Game experience)The game despite the current problems it was having at steam launch is very different from other fishing game's that i've played with a RPG element & abilitys to help catch them big fish. Boat upgrade's, drive-able boats is always a plus. Fortune cards are almost a gamble base slot machine, landing on a item rewards you with it. You can gather them free within the game catching any random fish. It is FTP & has PTW options. you can simply enjoy this game without spending a dime working you're way to the top adding much more game time. I personnally enjoyed this game & will continue to enjoy it now on steam!I am reviewing this based on my gameplay!If I had to guess, i'd say I put atleast 40 hours into this game or less but throughout this time, it was very enjoy-able. Not only that you can fish in asia, but around the world in most parts. The fishing experience is one of a kind for RPG Fishing.I hope fishing gamers will enjoy this one.However...When it comes to realism, the game is not as realistic as some fishing games out there. The reason I guess would be that it has RPG elements, graphics reminds me of dreamcast, this actually isn't that bad as alot of players enjoy leveling up unlocking new equipment. If you're not into fishing (1st priorty) nor RPG's (2nd priorty)  don't bother with this one. But if you're a curious fishing player who enjoys RPG's, you might wanna check this one out as soon as you can.Good luck fishing!!! :)Graphics: 6.5SoundFX: 7.0 Gameplay: 7.0Funfactor: 7.0Total rating: 7.0Side note's:Performance is just wonderful, FPS in the high's, community fun to talk too.(1st edited reasons)Spell fixes and rating added!(2nd edited reasons)More spell fixes.Cleanup on rows.Added better descriptions.

With all the bad reviews aside.I would recommend it.The game is free so if you reach the point where it is pretty much p2w then try another game.Its gameplay and idea seem very unique and quite the game I'll be willing to play. If you want to burn off time and not be bored then try this game out. Atleast It's free.			"

												Hey there! Wanna know a quick way to judge this game? Here you go.Look on Steam store page, scroll down to ""How to register for World of Fishing on Steam?"" and read it. How on earth that's logical that people using Steam have to use another account?""Ok, ok, that's not a big deal"" you may say...Then look into DLC page and look how to activate it... Too lazy? I'll tell you! You need to open game... click ""Pearls"", browser pops out, then you choose PACK, enter voucher code and it's price gets decreased (if you choose properly then to 0).Not scary enough?Then let me tell you they have terrible ""text ability"" - meaning that you can notice typos and/or lack of spacebars etc.Also, accepting quests and completing them is uselessly long. First, it takes couple seconds each time to do any action (delayed communication with servers) and second, you need to click like too many times, to accept/complete quest.Let me actually count for accepting: click ""quests"", click person, click quest name, click accept... close window, choose other person, repeat... (remember, it takes couple seconds, before you actually get the quest).Urgh...It's really boring game - you know how you fight fish? Well, check tutorial video on youtube. (Find it manually or check comments, posting it here was making review unable to post)if it does make you say ""wow"" - play this game now!It's designed to rip off money and it's easy noticeable. "

												I decided to give this game a try looking for fishing games, and after playing Fishing Planet until it became stale. Fist thing i noticed and hated were the cheap asian graphics and anime style. I braved through the tutorial where i found that casting and fighting fish was crappy at best. In this game you have to damage the fish in order to weaken it enough to catch. Where i come from we dont damage fish lol as it is frowned upon. Anyway i got on my boat and started 'fishing' as it were. The game gives you cheap disposable underwater cameras to see the fish. Tis is where i noticed STARFISH swimming by my line as well as swimming crabs. STARFISH DONT SWIM!!!! I played for about another hour and died from boredom. I would not recommend this game to anyone who loves to fish in real life. It is highly unrealistic and just plain crap.			"

												I've spent countless summers fishing in my childhood and finding a f2p online game about fishing seemed rather exciting.I think the reviews in here are extremely unfair for this little relaxing game and beside the server issues after the Steam release I don't have any problems anymore to play.I'll go as far as comparing this game to Euro Truck Simulator: It's a great way to unleash some pressure after a hard day at work. There is no apm, raids and the community is nice and rather polite. It's a breeze compared to all those online titles filled with angry 12 years old (Look at the negative reviews for a good idea about it, glad those people are not in game).			"

												This is an arcade fishing game where you handle your boat with one hand while fighting the fish with your right hand.  The fish get progressively more difficult to catch in higher-level zones.If you're looking for a realistic simulation of boat fishing, ""World of Fishing"" is NOT it.  It has too many aspects that ruin the illusion.  For one thing, some items are limited to a single use such as underwater cameras, fishing lines and hooks.  Some quest rewards are time-limited which disappear after their time is up.  You can't choose how to fish, such as fly fishing, trolling, bottom fishing, custom rigs, net fishing, nor can you adjust the distance between your bobber and bait.If you want an arcade game that involves saltwater fishing from a boat, this game is for you.  But if you're looking for a fishing simulator where you can put your real-life fishing skills to use, this game is not for you.			"

												the game is fine if you only have an hour or 2  play after that you will spend a small fortuen on fuel canisters to do anyting. there isnt much content after 50 and is a gind a fest with crapy fishing mechanics to attempt to frustrate you into buying timed premium or consumables that you go though in an hour. i would delete this game from exsistance if i had that power. The Devs need to focus on bug fixes and implimenting some actual conent into the game and get away from micro transaxtions to support the game it may actually do better if it was fun play and some real content to work on ( such as tournments, an actual reason to join a guild, more then a basic line tension damage system with hold and stun). Most of the time you feel like your playing a boat driveing simulator .... i came to fight the fish into the boat not drive the boat around and spin it in circles so i can mash a mouse button to do damage.your account gets autodeleted if you dont convirm your email. i never do i dont want all the ad♥♥♥♥♥♥in my email. this game and its devs can go ♥♥♥♥ them selvs			"

												World of fishing is a free to play Sport Fishing simulator with MMORPG elements.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, sounded ok.  Looks like you can play this game for free for a long time.  Has a PVP system also.  Has a good tutorial and help system.  You can play on a server with 8 players.  You do get gear from completing quests and achievements.  It makes fishing more exciting, faster and easier.  You have a huge variety of fish to catch in each area.Try it, if you like to catch fish.For more info:

												Hahaha! This game is so bad I almost recommend it. I mean, you have to see it to believe it. From the horrible voice acting to the cheezy music that must have been ripped off a 1980's p0rn0 flick. The interface is clonky, the graphics is laughable and there are more bugs than in the Amazon. Playing the tutorial is more than enough. And don't even get me started on the Pay-2-Win rubbish. If something is free, YOU are the product my friend. So I'd rather fish for piranhas using my wiener as bate than play this garbage. But go ahead, waste some bandwidth and download it. At least it will give you a laugh or two.			"

												Garbage game.......  Just stick to fishing planet and you will be way better off. This game is just a quick cash grab game and just down right boring. Graphics are horrible. Phsyics are a joke. Economy system is a complete disaster. This is your typical PS1 clone fishing game.  This game is just an arcade style fishing game. Takes no actual skill to catch fish. I expected to play a game like this in the early 2000's.... The shop is so highly limited in what you can buy. Pointless game. Uninstalled.... So glad this game was free or I would be getting a refund. Wish I could get a refund for that hour of life wasted.Here is a fish pun for all of you!This game will FLOP right out of the water and beach itself like a fat diseased whale.			"

												Haven't played it long as of yet, however after my first session I have come to the conclusion that it has a few faults already. The main faults that I have seen so far are; When I have caught a fish, it comes up with the details and a couple of options (Release, Put in Livewell) I click the Livewell option and nothing happens, click again, again and oh I guess - again! Then after about 30 secs it disappears! Also at first driving/steering the boat to where I wish to go it was fine, but shortly into my session it wouldn't allow me to go forwards/backwards with using either of the W & S buttons, however I was allowed to use the auto-drive button - NUMLOCK to do this (weird, but true) then when clicking onto a few things you get this box saying if this persists notify somebody (I forgot now what it says ok) anyway it stays there on the screen for too long imo. The fishing is sort of good, but not that good really. So for me I don't like it that much so far, looks very similar to a mobile phone game that I have on my phone called Real Fishing, and that's slightly better than this imo.			"

												I was really looking forward to play this game as I was following it on Steam, but judging from the size of the game I had my doubts already ,as most games with loads of content, graphics etc. are bigger than a few Gigabytes.There is some customization, levelling unlocks new stuff, daily login rewards, arcade-style fishing overall.It does not take much time to understand that sadly, it feels like a failed Wii game ported to PC and working as a mobile game. This game is more of a caricature of fishing.  "

												Everyone seems to be saying this game is either bad or that it doesn't work/can't log on/etc.I don't understand why though, because if you listened to what the devs were saying, they fixed the problem and now it works fine. Personally I'm loving it, sure, it was a bit complecated at the beginning, but after a while, when I had figured out what everything was, it was amazing. The freedom of driving around the ocean and finding new fish everywhere to catch was honestly exhilarating.Now, I know there a people who don't find fishing fun, and that's fine, but don't review this game as bad just because you didn't personally like it.If you don't like it, just don't play it.Everyone who does like it can then enjoy it to it's fullest!

												Very tentative recommend, under one condition: Ignore the progression systems.It's enjoyable if you don't sweat the progression. Very casual, though. The only decision you make about the fishing itself is what bait to use. There is other equipment but it provides stats rather than determines what you can or can't catch.I had the most fun trying to catch stuff way above my level, where the (completely unrealistic) angling mechanics actually do create a fun gameplay experience.The game wants very badly for you to pay money to progress. Typical MMO progression trappings here in full force. Free fuel is limited, and if you run out it'll take hours to travel across the various maps. Real money equipment is far superior, ""upgrades"" offer random chance to destroy your progress without additional paid ""support"" items, and even paid items seem to be subject to a durability system (repair kits are--of course--paid items).I again suggest to ignore the progression systems, and just enjoy the fishing part for what it is--a fun casual game.

Mój stary to fanatyk wędkarstwa. Pół mieszkania zaj***ne wędkami najgorsze. Średnio raz w miesiącu ktoś wdepnie w leżący na ziemi haczyk czy kotwicę i trzeba wyciągać w szpitalu bo mają zadziory na końcu. W swoim 22 letnim życiu już z 10 razy byłem na takim zabiegu. Tydzień temu poszedłem na jakieś losowe badania to baba z recepcji jak mnie tylko zobaczyła to kazała buta ściągać xD bo myślała, że znowu hak w nodze.Druga połowa mieszkania zaj***na Wędkarzem Polskim, Światem Wędkarza, Super Karpiem xD itp. Co tydzień ojciec robi objazd po wszystkich kioskach w mieście, żeby skompletować wszystkie wędkarskie tygodniki. Byłem na tyle głupi, że nauczyłem go into internety bo myślałem, że trochę pieniędzy zaoszczędzimy na tych gazetkach ale teraz nie dosyć, że je kupuje to jeszcze siedzi na jakichś forach dla wędkarzy i kręci gównoburze z innymi wędkarzami o najlepsze zanęty itp. Potrafi drzeć mordę do monitora albo wypie**olić klawiaturę za okno. Kiedyś ojciec mnie wk***ił to założyłem tam konto i go trolowałem pisząc w jego tematach jakieś losowe głupoty typu karasie jedzo guwno. Matka nie nadążała z gotowaniem bigosu na uspokojenie. Aha, ma już na forum rangę SUM, za naj***nie 10k postów.""""Jak jest ciepło to co weekend zapie**ala na ryby. Od jakichś 5 lat w każdą niedzielę jem rybę na obiad a ojciec pie**oli o zaletach jedzenia tego wodnego gówna. Jak się dostałem na studia to stary przez tydzień pie**olił że to dzięki temu, że jem dużo ryb bo zawierają fosfor i mózg mi lepiej pracuje.Co sobotę budzi ze swoim znajomym mirkiem całą rodzinę o 4 w nocy bo hałasują pakując wędki, robiąc kanapki itd.Przy jedzeniu zawsze pie**oli o rybach i za każdym razem temat schodzi w końcu na Polski Związek Wędkarski, ojciec sam się nakręca i dostaje strasznego bólu dupy durr niedostatecznie zarybiajo tylko kradno hurr, robi się przy tym cały czerwony i odchodzi od stołu klnąc i idzie czytać Wielką Encyklopedię Ryb Rzecznych żeby się uspokoić.W tym roku sam sobie kupił na święta ponton. Oczywiście do wigilii nie wytrzymał tylko już wczoraj go rozpakował i nadmuchał w dużym pokoju. Ubrał się w ten swój cały strój wędkarski i siedział cały dzień w tym pontonie na środku mieszkania. Obiad (karp) też w nim zjadł [cool][cześć]Gdybym mnie na długość ręki dopuścili do wszystkich ryb w polsce to bym wziął i zapie**olił.Jak któregoś razu, jeszcze w podbazie czy gimbazie, miałem urodziny to stary jako prezent wziął mnie ze sobą na ryby w drodze wyjątku. Super prezent k***o.Pojechaliśmy gdzieś wp*zdu za miasto, dochodzimy nad jezioro a ojcu już się oczy świecą i oblizuje wargi podniecony. Rozłożył cały sprzęt i siedzimy nad woda i patrzymy na spławiki. Po pięciu minutach mi się znudziło więc włączyłem discmana to mnie ojciec pie**olną wędką po głowie, że ryby słyszą muzykę z moich słuchawek i się płoszą. Jak się chciałem podrapać po dupie to zaraz 'krzyczał szeptem', żebym się nie wiercił bo szeleszczę i ryby z wody widzą jak się ruszam i uciekają. 6 godzin musiałem siedzieć w bezruchu i patrzeć na wodę jak w jakimś j***nym Guantanamo. Urodziny mam w listopadzie więc jeszcze do tego było zimno jak sam sk***ysyn. W pewnym momencie ojciec odszedł kilkanaście metrów w las i się sp***ział. Wytłumaczył mi, że trzeba w lesie pierdzieć bo inaczej ryby słyszą i czują. "

												This is the worst piece of ugggh I've ever tried. The controls seems unresponsive and the voiceacting sounds like something a student had made. I had low expectation to start with but the game actually managed to go below what my imagination could provide and made the experience to be not the slightest amount of fun.I hope this is a one man project because if it was it might be just somewhat of an accomplishment.

Don't let this gem of a game get lost in down vote oblivion just because of some launch day server issues, there is too much fun to be had!			"

												Was expecting a MMO version of arcade fishing games like a lot of the older Rapala releases, or the Black Bass series.  It's less of a fishing game and more of a MMORPG system, where you don't fish, but rather ""fiighht"" anything that bites your hook.  No strategy, no waiting, just cast your lure, wait a few seconds, then hold your mouse button.It's fun in it's own right, but if you're looking for a genuine fishing experience, don't expect to find it here.

												Best fishing game on Steam. There isn't much to choose from, and I don't fancy myself as an avid fisherman nor fishing game guru, so take that with a grain of salt. The gameplay itself has a bit of an arcade element to it, but really, what is an ideal fishing gameplay model really? The fish bite often enough to keep you focused, but not so often as it's back to back to back. Graphics look great and there's a very large variety of fish. It's rare you go on a spell of catching the same thing 2 or 3 times in a row.As you fish, you earn currency by selling your fish back to the store. Sure it's a free game and sure, you can pay for premium things, but YOU DON'T HAVE TO. The in game currency works just fine for outfitting your character with enough equipment so that they look unique and have stat boosting equipment. Love the RPG element to it by the way. You build your character up, and as they get more XP, they gain more levels, and get access to bigger, better, fish.The only thing I can really naysay at the moment is the lag/crashing/etc that can be expected from a recently launched title. Aside from that, I could see myself playing this for awhile. There's a good in-game community and what appears to be an attentive development staff. TLDR-Worth your time. Just dont mind the ""recently launched lag"" that most launches have these days.			"

												World of Fishing is not bad, but then not good either. It is a very simple fishing game in which you cast a line and then spend a while trying to tire out the fish so you can reel it in. The fishing is not realistic in any way, so do not expect a simulator.That said, it would certainly be nice if it had some more depth to it, at times even literally depth- Your bait is always at roughly the same depth, and fish all swim at the same depth. Not that you will notice much of that, you only get limited uses of limited time to look underwater, which is not even useful to you because you have no control over what happens once you have cast but before the fish bites.It is quite repetitive, with almost every fish the same but at a varying difficulty. You cast your line, swipe once and then the fish is hooked(or gets away), at which point you have to try to manage your line's tension to keep the fish struggling. But if the fish gets too far away, or too close your line will immediately break. That said, it is not bad, and you can amuse yourself by turning on some music and just fishing for a while.You can keep fish in your aquarium, so you can look at them any time you want. But your first fish from the tutorial will be released. After that you can keep your fish, but aside from a few very specific quest fish it almost seems pointless- These fish are all similar.Speaking of- Another thing you need to be aware of when you decide to play is that the odds are most likely manipulated when you play. If you get a quest for 3 fish of a specific kind, it will take over 50 fish to find the ones you are after, even if those you are after are marked as very common and you use the perfect bait for them. Not that the bait matters most of the time- As most fish you encounter all take the same bait you generally don't see results from changing it. Overall, the game has a feeling of not letting you effect things, you can only hope for the slightest of chances that things go your way.Since it is free, you will undoubtedly want to know how they make their money. Simple enough, they sell premium items. You may not like the idea, but I can tell you that they are not essential and must-haves. You will not be locked out of things when you don't want to buy them. But that said, they have a noticeable effect compared to your basic free stuff, and quests will provide you with enough to give them a try without having to buy them. Cosmetics wise there is essentially nothing. It is very basic, and you will look similar to everyone else.All this is, essentially, nothing too bad. There is not much to be had here, but also nothing really terrible. If you have time to spend and are bored then give it a go- You won't lose out on anything, but it isn't going to be amazing either.Worth a try sometime to see if you like it, but don't get invested or expect much.

												Great game if you are into fishing games! I have almost 13 hours into the game and I am at level 17. If you are looking to relax a bit after a hard day working with a beer and a game you might want to check this one out. I know it's not for everyone.The graphics look great on my computer. I am running a evg GTX1070 FTW and the Asus monitor and things look really nice.About the only con I have found is there is a bit of a learning curve but that is about the norm for any game nowadays. As I run the game it is only using about 1.6gigs of video resources which really isn't all that bad. I personally have not had an issue on their servers. There has only been on time that the servers and that was so they service them. I have had an issue with the audio in the game but it's not the game it's when I record for youtube videos. The issue is that there is a bit of the BG music that is copyrighted, but there is not on the DEVs and I have found a way around it so I don't get flagged for copyright infringement.You really don't have anything to lose with this game seeing how it is a FTP game. The download is not all that big compared to a lot of new games that are coming out that are over 40gigs in size. I hope this might have helped a few of you if you are reading the reviews here before you download this relaxing and not a resource pig.Take a few minutes after you download the game to check out their website, this will help out in regards to game play and the controls. It will also help you learn about the live well, fish tank, how to find what fish you want catch, what bait to use, and the different game play modes.I will be putting up a short video on Youtube as well that will explain some things. I will be uploading it if a few days and make it live so it can be watched.Note: The video that I am going to upload is not to promote my channel, it's just something I enjoy doing....			"

												FINAL UPDATE ON GM RIDICULING THE CANADIAN FLAG INCIDENTThe discussion thread I had posted, which included the Review update section below, has been removed from the game forum here on Steam, but I will sum up what transpired after I posted the incident of a GM making fun of the Canadian flag and Canadians.The first reply to my post was from a developer representative, and it was a nice apology which owned up to the incident.  To me it was an adequate apology and I would of accepted it with a reply, IF NOT for the following 3-4 posts from GMs and CMs, including one from GM Dublette who had made the inappropriate and ignorant comments.An apology that includes ridiculous excuses to trivialize the very poor taste in humor and place some of the blame on me was not acceptable, and shouldn't be by anyone.Suggestions of misunderstanding what they meant because of it being an online interaction, or that I mistook the 'joke', or left the chat too quickly to hear out the rest of the reply has absolutely no bearing on what was said initially and for the next few minutes before I voiced my displeasure and logged off.How many ways is there to mistake 'Canada has a flag? Thougtht they would just hide under the US flag.'.  Please, I'd like to know.  I imagine if it was a face to face conversation the result might of been a little more than just me voicing my displeasure.  No matter the online environment or context of a chat discussion, people think they can say whatever they like without being called on it or made to explain themselves.  Conduct yourself online like you would if face to face with that person.================================================================REVIEW UPDATE FROM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVEThe game is real fun and kept me playing for hours catching all kinds of fish species that I enjoyed collecting for my fish wiki.  Actually, loved having the coolest specimens in my own virtual aquarium which doubles as a working screensaver on the computer.BUT I QUIT PLAYING instantly over the totally disrespectful, unprofessional, and inflamatory comments posted in chat by GM_Dublette while GM_Hemingway was there as well.Someone asked why there wasn't an American Flag in the shop along with  European country flags like from the United Kingdom and Germany.GM_Hemingway replied by saying they geared the launch of the game for Europe and didn't anticipate a North American release that quickly, which is fine.  The American flag is supposedly going to be available soon enough.Then this is where things got real nasty for me.I asked in chat about the Canadian flag, and GM_Dublette makes the most deplorable attempt at humor by immediately replying 'Canada has a flag?  I thought they'd be hiding under the U.S. Flag'.I was livid, and still am.  I should of told them to stick their German flag up their behinds.  Having had family fight in WW2 against Germany, and knowing how amazing, brave, and effective our troops are in any conflict they fought in made me want to start in on this GM and pointing out that Canada help beat Germany in WW2, so they're lucky to still have a 'Germany' and flag to call their own.Canadians are laid back, understanding, friendly, and open to all....the Maple Leaf and Canadian Flag is well known around the world.  Only a total fool would even pretend to not know about it and ridicule a Canadian of hiding under a U.S. flag.=================================================================ORIGINAL REVIEWTLDR?  Well, your loss.  Seriously though, just scroll to the bottom of this very long runon sentence of a review I made.  It's still probably a long TLDR, but that's the shortest I can make it.  I talk too much... I know.I've played pretty much every fishing game I came across on various game platforms since my Vic-20 and Sega Genesis days, and have a fairly good background in various types of Sportfishing.  I also specialized in Fish & Wildlife Management Technology in College after graduating from the Forestry Technician program at Sault College in Ontario, Canada.  All that should suggest that I REALLY enjoy fishing and studying various fish species.I was hesitant to download and try World of Fishing, until last week that is.  After playing Carp Fishing Simulator, EuroFishing, and Fishing Planet in the last year I wasn't all that interested in trying a cartoon-looking Fishing MMO with combat and pvp.  Say what?.  Boy, was I ever wrong about the fun factor of this F2P Fishing MMO, at least the FreeFishing Style which is all I've played to date.  There's team play, team vs team, or 4vs1 if you are Poseidon or the Kraken.You really don't need to buy anything at all to enjoy playing this addictive fishing game.  But if you end up enjoying it as much as I have (like playing 6-7hrs straight at a time enjoyment) you will find it real easy to validate spending money to get some of the extras you can buy.  But again, if you don't want to spend a dime, you still will have some serious fishing game fun, I can guarantee you that.Make a character, choose the look with gender, clothes, fishing gear, boats, and even some helper navigators.  You'll need them for boating and sailing around the HUGE oceans and waterways across the Globe.  That's right!  There are areas all over this lovely planet of ours in the game with so many varied species of fish, some I'm sure you've never seen or heard of before.So many quests and areas to unlock with either completing questlines from zone to zone as you progress, or just jumping ahead once you attain the level required.  A great challenge when your Lvl.18 character goes up against fish that are lvl.49 or more while using Lvl.15 gear.  Not too difficult to master if you use the 'attack swings', hold techniques, and of course your boat to close the gap or increase that gap with the fish.  It will still be a great fish battle and when it's over, you'll have tons of XP and one hell of a fish to put in your personal aquarium.  Feel free to embelish your fishing stories also, I know I do.Any aquariums you ask?  Yes indeed there is.  Probably the 2nd biggest factor that has me hooked on this game.  As you fish, level up, upgrade your boat's livewell amongst other things, you'll want to start a nice collection of the most impressive and big trophy fish you've caught.  There's so many fish species in the game that you'll be creating and building your own 'Fish Wiki' as you catch new and bigger specimens, including secret and rare ones.  Lots of room for them in your aquarium, and you can sell the specimens you don't wish to keep anymore, directly to the fish market from your aquarium menu.I've also noticed that there are actual GMs on all the time, and they launch surprise GM Events all through the day including XP Boosts, or much higher drop rates for Lucky Cards which give you a chance to roll on 1:5 random store items.I have so many more details and personal online fishing experiences to share from my short time playing the game already, but this ""Review"" is already a hefty blah, blah, blah fest, so I'll leave it at that for now.The TLDR version of this is:Awesomely addictive fishing game (fun GAME... not simulator per say) that will surely have you playing at least for 2hrs real time each time you log in, or 6hrs with the 2x 2hr extensions you can add to your fishing trip.  Of course nothing stops you from going out on another trip when the current one expires.  Although, you will get friendly reminders on how much time you've played and will be advised to take a short break.  After a 7hrs straight stretch on my fishing trip, the game was basically begging me to stop playing and to go for a walk or something. heheIt's FREE 100% fun...but you'll want to spend some money just because it's fun as hell and want the game to continue on and on.Thanks for reading, and may your line tension be steady.

												didnt play past the intro.Codes didnt work - Bad Gateway. Numerous tries and such and still nothing.Uninstalled and thumbs down.Seems there is an issue with codes bought as in unable to get them to work, just get bad gateway error (i am not the only one having this issue). Some have said that the game is chinese and runs through there and gets locked out alot, which would mean that the game would be worthless if IP's outside china get blocked, where this game is based.Thats what i get anyways from scouring countless forum posts (had nothing else to do) and decided i would be a sad person and scour forums to see if others or where the game was based. Thats what i found out.Review may change if i decided to re-install the game and if these issue's are fixed, right now there are alot of issues like mine + ppl being locked out, game crashing/closing, IP's blocked because your not in a country thats registered (UK, NA).I would not risk spending any money on this as of yet.

												Alright so clear things up a little bit, i've played this game through the primary client for some time now (probably close to a year at this point with a little less than 500 hours in it.) And need to make a few things very clear about getting into this game. IT'S NOT A FAST PACED GAME! Do not come into this thinking it'll be a quick and adventurous thing! If you do that, then of course it's going to feel like crap!*Boat controls are sluggish, much like a real boat's reaction time when it comes to pontoon vehicles, *there is drift, *off limits fishing zones, *slow trips to the zone you're going to, Level-based (edited)***limited baits for those that aren't paying customers (which is fine if you're not a severe fan of fishing and only play for fun.) All bait is indeed purchaseable with ingame currency, it's just a question of patience and devotion to keep playing if you plan to keep up with demand when it comes to bait up-keep.*It's a bit tough to get started in this game, If you've played the fishing minigame from GaiaOnline (or played the mobile game ""Ace Fishing: Wild Catch""... or hell ANY fishing game from the last 20 years, including from the old-school Sega system, Rapala, Cavela's, Championship Bass etc.)  then you're already pretty much prepped to play this game. Your best bet is to take heed to the tutorial, take a bit in a public lobby and just chat while you fish. It's always better to converse with others than sit alone. :)SIGNING UP!Signing up for this game is a little more tedious than others, as there is no ""connecting"" Steam to the primary, which means you'll need an account either on the actual account, or an account on steam (or in my case now, an account on both but only one is my actual account now.) This doesn't mean that it's hard to make an account, you just need different accounts for Steam and the actual launcher :/ so if you play through Steam, use the account you signed up using the ""register"" button in its sign-up page of the launcher.If you signed up through the launcher that is downloaded from their website or through their main website page you'll need to play through their actual launcher/game. not steamNow another thing that needs to be addressed is the lack of a help desk. Yes, this is an issue. And so is the issue with no way for disgruntled players to really get help in this game. Forums are always negative due to the fact that no one really takes the time to think before they type (as many of these reviews show.Do i suggest this game? Of course! :) It's a great time-passer. If you prefer mobile games though i suggest ""Ace Fishing: Wild Catch"" (albeit that game relies on a daily energy limit but it can be ignored if you got plenty of friends to send you energy, since you can overload the limit ;)Edit: Adjusted some mentions in this review due to my poorly written comment about the bait, added a bit to the starting out part as well. I'll look to add to the review as i settle back into playing it now that i've switched over to Steam from the standalone launcher varient. But for now? it's time to sleep. happy new-year everyone <3			"

												There are 50% negative reviews on this game, yet most of them haven't even put 30 minutes into the game itself.For a free game, I would really recommend it due to the enjoyment factor that comes with it.Understandably, fishing isnt for everyone, but for people looking into this game to play who would actually enjoy a fishing game, then I would recommend this game 100%Yes, there are A LOT of microtransactions in this game, but the thing is is you dont need to pay anything to the game to get a good few hours of fun in. From writing this review, I'm 3 hours of game time in, and I have just unlocked a few new areas, with that in mind, and the amount of areas there are to unlock, I'd say for a free game, you can get around 30 hours of play time where it would still stay fun!It's free, so dont base your judgement on reviews of the game that have no time put into them!

												TL;DR THE ♥♥♥♥ING REGISTER BUTTON DIDN'T WORK FOR ME. IS IT JUST ME THOUGH?i was WAITING for this game, EVERY WEEK i check. And after it came out and i downloaded it.. DESPITE EVERY SINGLE negative review. I did not care, yet after i downloaded.. launched the game.. got to the main screen which says REGISTER and LOGIN. I CAN'T EVEN REGISTER! I read that if YOU use the STEAM version, you need to register FROM steam... USING InselGames account. Okay, then i wanted to make InselGames account so i can play it ON steam. YET ♥♥♥♥ING INSELGAMES.COM DIDN'T HAVE ANY ""REGISTER"" button. I AM COMPLETELY TRIGGERED AFTER WAITING FOR ♥♥♥♥ING WEEKS AND AFTER DOWNLOAD, I NEED TO UNINSTALL AND DOWNLOAD THE GAME OUTSIDE OF STEAM? It is not a big problem, but AT THE ♥♥♥♥ING LEAST MENTION THAT ♥♥♥♥ING REGISTER BUTTON DIDN'T WORK SO I CAN DOWNLOAD IT OUTSIDE OF STEAM. AND PLAY IT.I am triggered, and i'm giving it a No. I will probably enjoy it outside of steam(because i like fishing games), but this is a steam review and i give steam community the review about THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ steam version.

												It's like a clicker on steroids.  I look forward to seeing things smoothed out a bit, gameplay is a little clunky, and the opening dialogue is terrible (high school drama project failure terrible) actually worse than the advert with the guy fishing in a sandbox.The game itself is beautiful and has all the foundation for being something much better.Once you get past that, as I said, it's a clicker on steroids.  Progress is slow, the quest system is practically ripped out of a clicker, and the game will dump you for no reason.On top of infrequent, inexplicable crashes, dunps, whathaveyou, every transaction carries the threat of imminent relogging to find out if anything was lost.  Constant, nagging, almost belligerent reassurance that if anything goes wrong customer support will be right on it.Overall I wouldn't recommend it because I don't like giving people headaches.  Once it's solid, then I might.			"

												These Folks DON'T Know jack about fishing games.. I'm ashamed for evening trying this.. heck I can't even put words to describe this.. there no full screen, menus over lap, esc key doesn't close windows, constant pop up alerts and menus even when your fighting fish. the actual fight control are... well they feel empty, I move the mouse while reeling, and short while later the fish is""stuned"" and it reeled in.. then insert flashy windows that remind me of the old windows netscape pop ups.. I want to play this longer then I have.. i really do... I know its not fair to judge on such short play time.. but really.. every time you change windows theres all these white pop tabs that only go away once you press tab.. done fishing, press tab to see anything, change inventory, press tab to remove the white info pop ups.. done checking mail? press tab to remove white pop ups.. even the basic rewards. heres 30 underwater cameras.. USE THEM NOW.. EVER CAST USE IT... let me put THIS BIG A** FLASHINGLY ANNOYING ARROW  pointing to it so you can use it.. have you used it? cast again .. nope still must use it.. don't play the game just do what we want you to.. okay sorry.. just Dam..there so many flashy bits, glitter everywhere.. and as a guy who likes fishing games.. this take the cake.. so much visuals that you start to feel dizzy, put off and out of sorts.. Please my recomendation and opinion is simple - go to Planet Fishing...may not be as ""flashy"" or MMO ish as you would like, but there nice folk there, decent catch system and yea even a few bugs there working on.. but even then it's more playable, and satisfying..

												Although a very immersive game full of items, areas, and different fish to catch, I quickly grew bored of this game and havent went back. I give it a 5 out of 10. Graphics:10Audio: 4Playability: 1Sorry. For a free game, its worth it if you love fishing, but I would be very disappointed if I had to pay for this game.			"

												Relaxing, yet fun game you can take at your own pace.  The community is very friendly as well.  This can also be a very exciting game when your pulling in those rare fish or record breaking monsters.  The game is Free to Play but by no means does that mean you are at a disadvantage if you don't pay.  This is not a Pay to Win title but investing in the pay products can help.  No worries this is not a grind fest either, you can easily progress by following the quest, you will be leveling up in no time.  See you on the water.			"

												Ok, so lets start out by saying that yes, i played maybe 5 min before thinking of uninstalling this game, and no, it wasnt unresponsive servers at all.I thought it might be a nice fishing game opposite of say Fishing Planet, and honestly expected a similar realistic gameplay. Instead i got a asian styled arcade game with bad character design and even worse voice overs. The tutorial made me imediatly kringe when the voice over started telling me how to play the game, and when i finaly did cast out and caught a fish, it started saying how awsome i was for catching a scripted fish in a tutorial, KRINGE. As for the rest, reeling in a fish amounts to nothing more then watching 3 status bars and managing them in order to reduce the fish his StreetFighter'esc stamina(health)bar down to zero, all the while the actual fish not moving at all in the water. Arcade, thats what this game is, a arcade like fishing game. So yeah, to sum it up;Graphics: 4/10Graphics are terrible for this age, even for a mmo. Screenshots above do NOT represend the true graphical scale at all, since bellow the watterline there is absolutely zero interesting textures, just plain sand coloured contours of the bodem. Sure, it isnt something like Jedi Knight series of games bad (check them out on google to get a picture) but hardly up to standard for a mmo these days. Infact, ive seen indie games with better graphics design than this. Gameplay: 4/10""The most realistic fishing MMO of the world"" it says in th trailer. If thats the case, then i supose that next time i go out fishing in RL, i actualy need to only watch out for 3 bars that tell me how tired the fish is while its just hanging still there in the water. Yeah, not realy realistic, sure tention, fish stamina, it is all part of real life fishing, but the way its implemented here, there is no thrill in pulling in a big fish.Music: 1/10First thing in i did was shut the damn music up. Given, i usualy hate the loud repetetive music in most games, but this was realy bad. Voice overs: 3/10Like i said in the above paragraph, the voice overs are kringe worthy. The actor who spoke the tutorial part just sounded like he read his lines from a paper sheet while bored out of his mind. It had no actual feeling in it, like he was forcing himeself to do the lines, but realy didnt like doing it. Character design: 3/10You can create your own character....................but you cant realy customize it at all. Sure you can buy hair and clothing, but you cant truly change how you look. Per sex (Male/Female obviously) you have 5 presets to choice from, then are promted to give it a name. Thats all there is to it. Oh, and the clothes and stuff, yeah..........your stuck in an ugly shirt an shorts untill you fork over real money for those, cause they are bought with premium coins called pearls. This is not even mentioning the cliché npc's that can contact you for quests. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So bottom line, this game is not a good game if you realy like fishing to be more then a arcady styled anime cliché, but are more into realistic fishing simulaters. Which is also where i say, that the claim they make to be a ""unique mix of Fishing Simulation and full-fledged MMO"" is a complete farce.			"

												Albeit the unique game, an MMORPG about fishing, it is quite repititive. At first glance, it would be a fun game, but as you level up, you'll find that most gears to catch certain fishes in the quests are ""cash"" gears, and as most MMORPGs have micro-transactions. You could still have fun using the basic gears and the free gears from the quests, but after catching them all, what next? There is also some laggy issues when you have caught a fish and choose whether to release  or put in your tank. The gameplay mechanics is relatively easy for a fishing game. In my opinion, it's still lacking the feeling of a real fishing game, unlike the Bass Master Fishing series on old console gaming.All in all, it's worth the try, but I wouldn't recommend it for long time playing.

YouTube™ Video: First Impressions | World of Fishing 

			Views: 167		

			We take a look at the first hour of the new Fishing MMO 'World of Fishing', free-to-play on Steam. Website: http://www.2PLYR.com Watch Live: http://twitch.tv/2PLYR Twitter: http://twitter.com/twoPLYR...		

World of Fishing is a fishing 'MMO', a very interesting and unique concept. Although free to play, I haven't yet hit the typical paywalls or daily limits that usually come with F2P games. The main limiter here is your boats fuel which is used to drive from area to area looking for the different species of fish needed to complete quests. While not exactly an MMO in the sense of grouping with people towards a goal, there are some player-to-player interactions available.Pros:Fun and relaxing.Very unique and original concept that is well thought out.While the skill/stat tree is basic, there seems to be an abundance of options as far as items go. Clothing, accessories, rods, reels, boats, aquariums and more are all available for purchase with in-game money (Shells) or your own money (Pearls).No heavy paywalls preventing further progression each day, barring you don't play for more than 3-5 hours per day.Cons:Since launch there are some server issues and lag in-game. They are actively working to bring on additional servers to handle the load however.Some items, such as underwater cameras, only appear to be purchasable with the cash shop currency instead of earned in-game currency.There are some grammatical and spelling errors that can make it difficult to understand some aspects of the game's features in the beginning.Overally, definitely worth trying, especially as a F2P game. A very unique and fun experience. "

												2 obvious reasons why you shouldn't play this garbage:1. Pay-to-win: If you wanna stay competitive in ranked matches, you must spend real money on buying / upgrading / renting the top-tier fishing equipment and boats. I played the original World of Fishing (i.e., the non-steam version) for about 12 hours and I can assure you that all top-ranked players in competitive matches have spent hundreds of dollars on their fishing gear and boats. In addition, if you don't wanna spend money on buying boat fuel, be prepared for ridiculously long and repetitive grinding. This game is just a despicable cash grab.2. Developer's incompetency: Let me give you a brief overview of what has happened for the past few months, which reflects the inability of the developer thoroughly:-- May 2016: World of Fishing was announced as ""Coming Soon"" on Steam's homepage; 3 weeks later, developer delayed the release to June due to unexpected difficulties in integrating the original WoF with Steam.-- June 2016: WoF's expected release date became ""June 2016""; 3 weeks later, developer delayed the release to July due to unexpected difficulties in Steam integration (again). -- July 2016: WoF's expected release date became ""July 2016""; 3 weeks later, developer delayed the release to August due to unexpected difficulties in Steam integration (AGAIN). -- August 2016: WoF's expected release date became ""August 2016""; 3 weeks later, developer delayed the release to September due to unexpected difficulties in Steam integration (AGAIN and AGAIN). -- September 2016: WoF is finally launched on Steam with tons of registration, log-in, and in-game crashing issues. Obviously, the Steam-integration middleware created by the developer is still buggy as hell. The above development history convincingly shows the developer's incompetency in integrating the original WoF with Steam and in fixing game-breaking bugs.    I'd *NOT* recommend anyone play this contemptible cash grab which is still infested with tons of serious bugs and glitches. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if the current server / Steam-integration issues take several weeks for the inept developer to resolve.			"

												I have to admit that I was curious what to expect from a game about fishing when it was shown on the steam front page and since it is for free I just tried.And it is kind of fun. Graphics are a little bit, well, retro, but somehow this also contributes to that sim feeling.From what I can tell it seems to run quite stable, no severe problems, sometimes loading seems a bit slow, but not to a serious level.Tutorial is easy, maybe a little too easy, it seems a little sarcastic when you get plaudit for moving the boat for five secounds in whatever direction, but well, better too easy than too difficult or even no tutorial at all.Maybe nothing to hook me for hours in a row but worth logging in for some relaxing now and then.

												It's a little too ""new"" for me. The load times are crazy, and after the tutorial, it just wasn't that appealing. I just wanted to get in water and fish, but I had to spend twenty minutes in the tutorial, another twenty learning what in the crap everything basic is, and then find a server. When all's said and done, after the crazy wait time, it tells me the only bait I have isn't for the area, so I'm sitting dead in the water.I'm not bashing the game by any means. Anytime a f2p game pops up on steam with barely any microtransactions, it warms my heart. But it is very new, with some server issues, and I'm sure they'll make the game a little more user friendly overtime. This is something I'll come back to.5/10 for my personal preference, it's free and probably won't melt your computer, so give it a try! It is cool, just not for me right now.			"

												Started playing this game as a joke, thinking that I wouldn't really get too much enjoyment out of a Fishing MMO... Well sir, I was wrong. Game's really fun. Really nice mechanics for catching the fish and a surprising amount of depth*.Safe to say, I'm hooked*.When the game was released for Steam it had horrible server issues due to the unexpectedly high load of new players but that seems to be gone for the most part. The devs dropped the community a line* by interacting and responding frequently to keep everyone informed of the situation.Games free and most definitely worth a try.*all puns intended			"

When will we see a white water fishing game? you know... walking upriver the banks of a creek looking for calm spots behind rocks where a trout may hide to catch a bait going down the current. Put on long fishing boots and stand IN the river using a fly fishing rod to get a trophy salmon.

												This game is filled with a bunch of nerds who think they're going to get a million dollars for enforcing their stupid rules or something. GMs will witch hunt you for the smallest infractions, obviously this game is filled with a bunch of pathetic virgins. Don't play it, and don't support them. Let them starve and die.			"

												My boat drove off during the tutorial and I slowly garroted a red snapper.  That wasn't so bad but then it made me release it.  MY FIRST FISH.  Poof.  Gone.  F you, game.  That was MY fish that I strangled to death.  No one can take that from me.uninstalled/10**EDIT:  I will gladly change my review to positive when ALL my fellow snapper stranglers are rewarded with their BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS to keep and cherish and honor their first fish.The first fish is the most important of all the fish. It sets the stage for all the future fish. World of Fishing stole my fish. I don't want to be compensated for my scaly loss; I merely wish that future generations not have to struggle under the yoke of an oppresive, snapperthieving, developementatorship! FREEDOM!			"

												Its a fun game updating my first opinion on this game after so many hours trying all the features im now gonna grind to be level 70 plus it will take time lolfortune cards are fun ive done a video of me opening 50 plus of them to give you an idea of whatyou getthe mechanics of the game are fun arcady and easy to figure out buying rare bait is a must to get the XP up as is levellingthe cost of the starter package is a little lacking value wise I think as most items are overpriced but i did score a fast boat and decent bait to get the xp levelled up and to get passes to other maps so that was good the game is fun to play  not a game i play 24/7 but a nice relaxing game thats not pay to win heavy IMOtry it its free and fun and most importantly addictive as hell

												Awesome game for being free, it is no P2W you can easily grind the same items as if you paid for them. Through a bit of time you can have best items. To really hit on the aspects the fish varieies are fantasic, the realistic of the open world areas. This game is defintaly worth a bit of time and enjoyment. Please go check this game out if your a fishermen or want to learn / experience fishing! Fish on my bros.			"

												I really like this game. It's not 100% ""real"" but its definately not something you will get quickly bored with. i assure you. I personally always play this game, because, well, it's very addictive, lol. It's a really good game if you love fishing, and just cant always get on the lake, or, if you just want a fun game, with plenty of other players, that will give you a challenge! definately recommend this game!

												This game is absoluty BS. You can only really play if you pay to win and the gear you buy needs to be repaired and yea, you can buy it for cheap and there are c-coins but those are hard to get and sure, the repair kits last long but basically everything is expensive and can pretty much only be achieved through paying. Get something other than this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like world of fishing.			"

												Normally i do not like to write negative comment , i try to respect the effort of people work . But for this game i have to , game seems fun , but if you able to get in server . Only 30 min i could play in all day , it was my free day and all day i try to get in , this was a horrible effort . Hope in future they manage to solve problem .Edit After 2 weeks play :After I read other comments about the game I try the game by downloading from developers site (steam account do not work over there , you need another account) , while I have a problem to login and play with steam account this option work smoothly , from now on I play from that account and there is no problem at all .About the game , this is a addictive game but not for all , if you want a challenging game it does , if you want a relaxing play it give that also , but if you are looking for a hack and slash game or core team play it wont .Cons: Very cool environments , nice scenery , lot of fish , game do not force you to purchase with real money , most people are not sticky , GM's are helpful .Pro : After some further play it is somewhat repetitive , at advance levels game do not set properly , you can feel in some levels without target (if you play very smoothly) . You can not block some annoying people while they chat by yelling , even if you block them they keep yelling in general channel .Suggestion : After some beginner levels if players force to and able to create their own maps (instead game give them the location of fish) game would more challenging and real . Also if we have to use some fish as bait (which we hunt by our selves) high level and low level people would see each other more often in game .In general I give 7/10 , try it if you like it you will get addicted , else would uninstall it in a day .

												Fun game that keeps you engaged.  The only problem is the 'free to play' aspect is VERY strong in this game.  All of the free gear is very basic.  For the nice gear and equipment it doesn't even give you the option to grind the game for free to save up.  Everything good you have to pay cash for.  The game becomes repetetive pretty early on but... that's fishing for you anyway.			"

												Best game ever, able to buy shark balloons for about $5 or so. Oh and don't forget the flags!But seriously the game is fun to play for a while. However, it's not really worth your time as there are other amazing free games out there in the world.EDIT: After spending a bit more time on the game, I would actually recommend this game for a moderate amounts of positive reasons:-It has an arcade-like gameplay which means you can easily jump in and start playing-The graphics is alright for modern standards, works with low-end machines as well-There is some form of customization-Background music is OK-Loads fast and the servers are always up for me (creating an external account literally took seconds)However there are some negatives to the game:-User interface is kind of chunky, some of the text on the displays are partially misplaced-Despite having some customization, it's level based and it shows the same product but just with better stats?-Like most F2P MMO games, the good customization needs money-It gets boring when you play by yourself-Physics; this game is nowhere near realisticIn the end, the game is not actually that bad, and it's fun to play. However, I would like more varieties to flags though.			"
