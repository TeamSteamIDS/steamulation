												I just tried my new VirZoom out for the first time. The bike is surprisingly solid, except for the buttons on the front of the handlebars which feel a bit cheap. Maybe for this reason, none of the games in the VirZOOM arcade right now seem to use these buttons at all. From what I can tell, only the right and left triggers are used. The games feel a bit like something a talented kid made over summer break: there's nothing wrong with them but they're quite simple, the graphics and sound design feel decidedly--well, home-grown would be a nice way to put it, and they seem to be pretty bug-ridden. That, and the UI is clunky and sometimes unfriendly. But the foundation is all there, and it's solid. You can pedal to move, and lean left and right to steer. It works. And hey, it's a new idea and even giant development houses still come out with stuff that's much worse. Right out of the box it already has a bunch of different games to play, which is something, even if the games in this first batch are not amazing. I think with time and polish, this could be something great. I fully expect there to be a killer game for the VirZoom sooner or later. I'm imagining a game like Euro Truck simulator where you take a cross-country bike tour through real places with real scenery. Or something that looks like Hover Junkers where you fly a pedal-powered helicopter around an open world with realistic (but forgiving) physics and the propeller actually synced to your pedals. The potential for there to eventually be something really fun that offers more than ""collect the boxes and earn the points until the timer is finished"" is great enough for the investment to be worth it, I think. Today I played for 40 minutes on my first test and went through the tutorials for all of the included games. After looking at them all, there are none that I'm really dying to play again, but I also wasn't too tired to continue. If I had been pedaling on the bike normally I definitely would have given up before 40 minutes. With the right game or environment to keep me engaged I could easily ride this thing for hours. Playing games and getting exercise at the same time, what could be better than that?			"

												Not a gimmick - in all my years (59) and all the exersize equipment I've purchased and hardly then never used.  THIS IS THE TICKET. It's a workout that keeps your mind off working out.   Working out is no longer a chore of boring.  When I'm done because I'm mass of sweat..  I WANT TO DO MORE - but I need to dry off and cool down.  I'm then excited to get back into it and do more. Pros:1. support staff is UNSURPASSED. I chat dialy with them like friends. They're very interested in feed back and implimenting it.2. EASILY setupup the unit and INSTANT auto connect to the computer.  I just plugged in a little USB dongle.  No syncing no bs... just said pull both tiggers to get started.3. Games are good... they do what they're desired to do.  There is room for improvement but they are working on it. (stats displayed during play more varied options etc).4. REALLY works and makes workouts fun. 5. has learderboards  and the reason I bought it... has  STRAVA.COM  link/sync.  I use strava extensively for my real world cycling. 6. WELL BUILT - has good tension feel...  setup easily in 15 minutes without opening the instructions. Cons: 1. Software needs more polish, menus are often blank or repeat the same things over and over. (they're working on that) I beleve this is to ""LEAVE SPACE"" for more games!   Instead of blanks they list the same game on all 6 sides of the rotating VR menu. 2. I'm not totally keen on LEANING to steer.  I think I can live with it if it were made more sensitive. (I requested they add that or a option so each person can adjust sensitivity).3. At this point none of the 8 buttons are used?  But better than being short buttons.  They haven't needed to be implimented yet.  Tiggers are all that's really used at this point.4. ITS YOUNG just released and will take a few months to really polish up the system.5, Games are (mini) but surely we can't expect 8 AAA titles in a few months this has been in development. The concept is not to GAME - but to work out without thinking about it. They do that... I like TANKS the best, the HELO 2nd best.			"

												The games are simple, but entertaining. The bike offers a lot for a fairly low price which is great considering how much you already spent on the compatible headset. The only thing I can really think to complain about is that none of the games really have a sense of momentum (except when flying on the pegasus). One part of riding on my real bike that I really enjoy is pushing myself super hard and simply riding past other riders without touching my pedals. I like the feeling of speed that carries me forwards. Instead on this I feel like I'm 100% of the time going up hill. If I stop pedaling I stop moving. That doesn't feel right to me, but you know what? If I want a better feeling game, I can make one, because their Unity compatible SDK is openly available on their website.			"

												It's good way to lose some weight and get fit through cardio. I wish the gameplay was more competitive multiplayer but being in its infancy I see the developers taking kindly to many suggestions and with early adopters of this VR/Fitness combo, support is fantastic so far.  I would say they have a good mix of support, user base, and game play for the time being. Obviously this game doesn't have thousands of players becasue it requires a 2 pieces of expensive proprietary equipment. It's well worth the price, they are adding heavy duty bikes to it which I would really like to stand and pedal but that seems pretty taxing on this mediocre standard bike, and I  am sure more developers will think of clever ways to make awesome games for it. Like Excite bike or moto cross tracks, if anyone is an old school PC gamer maybe you can recall Road RASH!  - You know what I am thinking already don't you?  Maybe Ice racing like they do in europe/russia!			"

												Fun game with a lot of potential.  Have already ridden distance from Boston to NYC.  Often end up drenched in sweat when I get off.  Still needs some polish in the games and more options, but definitely is keeping me exercising when I would normally not want to.			"
