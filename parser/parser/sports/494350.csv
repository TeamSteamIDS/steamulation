												I haven't had much time to play around with this yet, but I enjoyed what I've played. The game does an especially good job of simulating how bad I am at bowling in real life, too!			"

												I really dont want to leave a negative review because I can imagine a lot of work has gone into this and I wouldn't leave a bad review if it was in pre release but it's not. The game is not finished , the ball does not behave all that well getting stuck in the middle of the lane spinning backwards on the spot sometimes . It needs some atmosphere the sounds that are there clip and dont match the current actions . it needs to be more emmersive. It definitely has potential			"

												A mildly enertaining bowling game, but so little content it should probably just be free. Choose between 2 lanes (basement or space), a surprising number of balls, and bowl. Thats it, the controls are what you would expect, wonky until you get used to the feel of no weight in your hand.I really wanted to like this game but there is just so little to it, no challange mode, no skill shots, there is couch co op but that is tedius with having to swap the vive headset. Also curving works extremely unaturally with bumpers. Not the most important thing but just interesting to note, if you have any curve, and it touches the bumper, it will just bounce against the bumper for the rest of the lane.			"

												With the recent improvements Bowl VR is most decidedly the premier bowling game for VR. The basement environment is very realistic, the space lanes are really cool but most notably, it is the best bowling game for VR because it is the only one I've played that has very good spin mechanics, applied with a simple turn of the wrist. The only issues I had were taken care of and made right. Buy it.			"

												UPDATE:It looks like a good chunk of my concerns has been addressed with patch 1.1. I can now say that I would recommend this game. Good job dev!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I really was looking forward to a VR bowling game, and this seem to fit the bill. Unfortunately, after trying it out, I can't say I'm satisfied with the experience. Here are my findings:- The sound of everything was just wrong. The ball rolling sound was just a very short ball roll sound on loop. The pin being hit sound activates regardless of if you hit the pins or not. - Menu was clunky. The slider mech just didn't work very well and entering your name is a nightmare. Perhaps a bigger keyboard or a pointer mech of some kind would be better.- Game placed the play area in a way where the room bound was the start of the lane. Although this make sense in practice to avoid people from walking up the lane, it doesn't feel very natural bowling-wise. It's more intuitive if the room bound was set a little into the lane so you can walk all the way up to the start of the lane and throw your ball without hitting the wall with your controller.- Player adding is not intuitive. You have to press the + button or else the player isn't added. If no player is added, you're still allowed to press the Bowl button that starts a game, but the game doesn't do anything. If the name field is not blank when you press Bowl, that name should just automatically be added, especially if it's just one player. Also, the Bowl button should be disabled if there is no one in the list.- Ball mechanic is buggy. The ball can potential be stuck in the middle of the lane if thrown too slow. I know there is a button to reset the ball, but the game should just do this automatically.I will change my review in the future when these issues are addressed. Although I fully support the developer in his effort and believe the game has potential, in it's current state, I can't say I can recommend it.			"

												Great game. Plays a lot like real bowling, meaning I suck at it, and any skill seems to require a good bit of practice. The physics simulation is solid, spin works, etc. The space level looks really cool but freaks me out a bit as I'm afraid of heights.Not sure what else to say about it, kind of like wii bowling, but with way better graphics, in VR, and with way better controls. Definitely a great game for VR parties or the like, I don't know if I could get into it playing solo but for having friends over I think it's going to be really fun.The only issues I had were some menu buttons don't register well, and the sounds are a little basic. I don't know if there's really anything an indie dev can do about the sounds though, you really need a sound studio + proper sound guy which isn't cheap.Edit: Rereading this I felt there were really some more things I should comment on.Pros:-The game plays a lot like real bowling. You get a ton of gutterballs until you get used to the controls, then you're score will quickly start matching up with your real life score, if you ever go bowling (mine is just as awful as in reality!)-The UI and graphics look slick. The space level floor is a little basic, but otherwise I have no real complaints. My fear of heights made me avoid that level anyway. D:-The overhead screen overcomes the issue of not being able to see the pins because they're so far away and VR resolution is too low.-The scoring system is solid and allows for multiple players on one headset handily.There's not too much else to comment on there, it's everything I would want from a basic bowling game that looks good and plays like real bowling.Cons:-UI can be a little unintuitive for some of the thinner buttons. The controller ""clicks"" from the center, which works fine on most of the large UI panels like the options or entering your name, but some of the back buttons are a little thinner and if your instinct is to dip the tip of the controller into a button, it won't work. You need to go slightly farther forward so the center goes through.-The ball gets stuck in the lane if you don't throw it hard enough. You can reset it though, and the developer said he'd fix it today so maybe it's not even an issue.To be fair to other reviewers, I didn't play the game until after the 1.1 patch so a bunch of the stuff people complained about never existed for me.

												Very fun game to stand up and play. I had no trouble jumping and getting right to a couple games of bowling. My first game was an abbysmal 80 points, but once I got the hang of it my next game was 149! Very satisfying, affordable game. Seems like a good entry point for VR and a nice way to spend 20-30 minutes of game time doing something semi active.			"

												This game is a solid bowling experience! It feels very realistic, you can control the ball well. For the price you'll be hard pressed to find a better option. The controls took a bit to get used to, but aren't too hard to get working. Sound design could use some work but is good enough to get the job done. Can't wait for multiplayer!			"

												I cant really recommendthis as I didnt even get to play game. The whole menu system is broken and you have to keep retrying to select an option.So i eventually managed to select basement, lane and new game. Except no ball appeared so couldnt even play.The orientation is also flawed in that the flexibilty as to where your bowling lane appears is kind of fixed. so you could be bowling along the width of you space rather than the lenght, Will have been useful to be able to rotate the lane to face where you will be looking . sadly i will be refunding this but looks like its got potential.

												Very enjoyable game.  Initially couldnt hit any pins but soon found my form. The only annoying thing, enteriing names on the virtual keyboard is very hit and miss and trying to get the volume slider moving was seriously frustrating. But definately worth the four quid I paid.			"

												Really was looking forward to a good couch co-op bowling game.Unfortunately this isn't it. I couldn't even roll the ball down the lane it was stuck to the controller.  Do not buy this game it is still way to buggy!!!!			"

												This game is alot of fun. All of the menus where smooth with no issue and the sound was spot on in my experience. It took some getting used to as far as throwing the ball and how to put a spin on it but once you get the hang of it your hooked.			"

												I was looking forward to a bowling game in VR I love bowling in real life would be nice to save the money and just do it in vr though! Too bad this game is horrible, very unsatisfying. Very basic and generic sound effects and mediocre setting just make this game horrible. I am hoping it improves over time I am no longer eligible for a refund, else I would collect one immediately if I could. Do not buy this game....wait until it improves if it ever does. Has been a while since the last update.....			"

												Really wanted this to be great. It has the potentual, especially when you think about how much fun was had with the WII bowling game. Unfortunatly it just feels like it's missing the final pieces.

			In this super exciting video I show you just how bad I am at bowling in the brand new VR game Bowling VR. Its good, but perhaps needs some tweaks!
