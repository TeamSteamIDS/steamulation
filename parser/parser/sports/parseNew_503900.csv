												Basically a ""fruit ninja"" type of game in VR.  However, it's ultimately ridiculously simple, and has almost no replayability.  For the asking price ($9.99), you won't feel like you got your money's worth.  If the price dropped to a couple bucks, I'd guess mostly people wouldn't mind playing it for 10 minutes every week or so and padding out their VR library.			"

												A blatant copy of Fruit Ninja, and with almost no replayability. Timer starts, and you must destroy flying candies that are fired from cannons in front of you. Some of these fly outside your playarea, so if you try to hit them, you are going to hit something in your room. I know I did.There is only one gamemode, and nothing else. Game works and runs fine, but I wouldn't buy it.Fruit Ninja VR is the same price, and it is way better.			"

												Discount Fruit Ninja. Store page doesn't specify required room size so beware. Even with my 3.1x2.8m room scale, I still go out boundaries and accidentally hit a wall.There's no boundary or indicator on where's the limit on the candies you need to hit. Dev needs to restrict the space where the candies fly off. This game also suffers with poor hit detection when moving your controller fast enough (happens on some sports game where you hit a ball)I got this in a bundle so whatever, will only buy this full price if it was priced around $3. If you want a better game, get fruit ninja, if you want a hardcore version, get zenblade			"

												This game is very similar to fruit ninja, but its done candy instead. The game works well and its still very much fun. There is room for improvements to make this game better and different if people would offer some constructive critacism. Nothing wrong with competion, which might make these games better.			"

												This best described as a Fruit Ninja VR knock-off that wants you to smash your TV/monitor/everything in your room that you didn't want to smash. I got very irritated at how much they aim the candy to be launched OUTSIDE of your VR space. Seriously? ♥♥♥♥ you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I am not swinging for a piece of candy outside of my VR space and breaking all the stuff in my room.That has turned it from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fruit Ninja VR knock-off to an unplayable POS game that I don't want in my library.
