												I gave  2K15 a good review and that was after a couple Patches that made the game usable. 2K16 came around and it's the same engine, basically the same game but with a ton more flaws and issues and i don't know how that is even possible. I mean in 2K15 for example the Lakers had their real arena light, that means, all the lights on court while the crowd area is darkend. In 2K16 it's the same bright lit arena like everywhere.But that's just one of the more superficial flaws this game has. So far i encountered:  - During Games the commentators stop working, that was a problem in 2K15 but is even worse here now with the commentators stop all the time, in every match be it a mycareer match, a online match, myteam match, all the time- Sound effects and Music also stop, you play one match in Mypark with the Music, all sound effects and the next match you only have the sound effects of Park itself, like the Bird and Sea sounds on the Park or the Steel mill sounds on the Rough Riders Park but you won't hear the players, the ball or anything else.Now of course one could argue that sound is just one thing but there are many other problems- Invisible players, that happens everywhere be it the park or an offline game, sometimes player get invisible but they still play, making points and everything- You get fouled out (6 fouls) but you can still play- Players shoot at the wrong hoop (happens with the AI)- AI players don't know how to behave and resemble more a bunch of scared chickensThere are more issues all around, i have a screenshot of the Store where rings are displayed as pants, that's not fixed one month later. - Random crashes, unable to invite friends, connection problems, disconnections in the MyPark, connection errors (including crash to desktop) on MyCourt when you invite friends do exist. 2K's servers are notoriously bad and have been bad for the past few years over console generations and now on the PC. It's baffling they don't fix their crap which leads me to the next point: - Microtransactions. With 2K15 2K introduced  VC to the game, you earn VC by playing matches, be it online, mycareer, mypark or whatever which you can invest in shoes, jerseys, shorts or use on the MyTeam mode as with always, microtransactions on a game that costs 50€ (at least, the MJ edition was 69,99€) is questionable, while you can earn them, you can buy them with real money and 2K this year made sure you can't get enough VC without paying for them. MyTeam has Card Packs that cost 7.500 VC, there are shoes up to 15.000 VC, Jerseys up to 5.000 VC and regardless if you unlock shoe contracts or not, the shoes you design yourself in the main menu outside the career cost you 7.500 VC, regardles of a shoe contract and if you want to proudly display the jersey of your team you play in career in the online park you need to get to a certain park reputation and on top of it, the jersey is another 5.000 VC. Last year those Team Jerseys in the Park were free, now even for that 2K wants your money. The positive things, are the new things: Team relocation in MyGM and MyLeague are fun and in MyTeam you can use the same features about getting your own Logo (better make sure to not use any trademarked stuff becuase apparently even using and old Team logo that is not available can get you banned and the game only supplies you with the regular 30 NBA Team Logos, despite having classic logos and jerseys available in MyTeam but you're not allowed to use them in MyGM/MyLeague, so you can upload them yourself but you risk getting banned because it is actually a breach of their TOS)Speaking of MyTeam, it's a grind through hundreds of the same cards and the same old challenges, in fact, it was a lot more fun last year where you could chose between Current and Classic Team Packs, now you only have 3 current packs and at the moment a Rookie Card Pack that can net you anything from a rookie to a silver to an amethyst card pack but most of the time you get the same guys over and over, i got 3 times the same blake griffin rookie of the year card. It's like the game is trolling you and just wants you to waste your MT Points or VC on crap. Talking about that i want to mention more bugs people had: - No Keyboard support, while i think playing a sports game on Keyboard (i haven't done that since FIFA 96 personally) is kinda dumb, i think a PC game should support the Keyboard. NBA 2K16 doesn't really, you can't configure keys and the pre-made layout is apparently made for aliens with 3 arms and several more fingers- In MyCareer you might receive MyTeam Cards through connections...at least that's the theory. I unlocked a few, never got the cards- Same with the rival day on MyPark, the second week me and some friends helped the Sunset Beach securing a victory and despite constant ""Claim your reward on the kiosk"" messages, we never got the promised VC and reduction of Boosts. And now we come to the big hype this year: Livin' da Dream - A Spike Lee JointThe premise is actually fun: You start in High School, play College and then go to the NBA. Certainly better than the ""Not getting drafted story from last year"" but: You can't really customize your player, you are from Harlem, your nickname is Frequency Vibrations, shortened to Freq and you're basically forced to create a black player because otherwise it's absurd to have black parents and a black twin sister. So you start in High School which consists of 3 games followed by College (you can select 1 of 9 colleges but it makes no real change at all) which lasts for 4 Games and after than you're in the NBA, after you got drafted your rookie season consists of 8 games (and 1 playoff match, if you're lucky) while the rest is simulated. The game actually acts like you should have a choice, like teasing a decision about wether you do a second college year or go straight to the NBA or later ""state your oppinion about your shoes"" which was mistaken by many to be a shoe deal which it isn't, it's just cutscenes you have no influences whatsoever and most of those scenes drag on for too long (some are over 10 minutes) and you sit there and wonder ""is this a badly written movie or am i still playing a game?"" only to realize ""i'm stuck in a badly written story full of cliche, annoying (and sometimes racist) characters and plot holes (like your player constantly switching between a 3 time and a 4 time all-american) in a game full of bugs that make me play matches for the sake of seeing more stupid soap opera like cutscenes""Once your after the rookie season you start MyCareer but it's still not your Career as mentioned above, you can select a ""secondary nickname"" but the PA and the Announcers as well as the Pre- and Post-Game Show still call you Freq all the time. It's highly annoying. I could go on and on with the flaws, how 2KTV makes the game crash at random times in the main menu, the performance is abysmal because it's a very badly optimized game, how disconnections, crashes, glitches and limitations hinder everything and 2K doesn't care and of course how the online mode is filled with cheater on the park or the obnoxious ce-quitters in myteam and of course that even the music while being a great diverse soundtrack with various styles and some truly great songs is censored to the point where songs consist of mostly audio drop outss, the worst example being NAS - Made you Look which is so horribly butchered that the finaly 10 seconds only consist of the word spit because everything else is erased because it contains ""filthy words"". So all in all, while the basis of the game is still a good basketball game, it has too many bugs, glitches, flaws, cheaters with 2K apprently only caring about saving their precious microtransactions and nothing else. So all i can say, is: Don't buy the game and don't support 2K because they simply don't care.			"

												Before I go into the gameplay, let's address the elephant in the room. Spike Lee's My Career. I have a big problem with being forced to be black for the story to make sense. Not because there's anything bad about being black (full disclosure: I'm a black man), but because its lazy writing. Spike seems to want to tell his story of a struggling black kid from Harlem, New York making it to the NBA. That's great for a movie, but this is supposed to be a game. And the best games give the player the most choices. Choices are why Western RPGs like Dragon Age:Inquisition & Skyrim are more popular right now than Japanese RPGs that force you to play through a bunch of set pieces as their stock protagonist. I'm opposed to any game mode that removes choice from players, especially when those choices existed in last year's game.With that out of the way, NBA 2K16's gameplay has improved over the past two iterations. Defense is more effective & physical. You can't just bully your way into the post with a random SF anymore. Shot selection seems to be even more important this year & fastbreaks actually seem fast this year. The 2K Shop, however, is another matter. They're selling virtual Gatorade now?!? C'mon man...that's just a blatant cash grab. Everything costs VC this year. Designing your court would be great if they didn't nickel & dime you to death for accessories. I know that you can earn some things through My Career, but its still ridiculous to charge 500 VC for different colored nets.Overall, I enjoy the gameplay more than ever. But 2K needs to stop letting outsiders write stories for games & be a bit less greedy next year. Pick this up now if you're absolutely addicted to sports games. Otherwise, catch it on the next Steam sale.			"

												When you play NBA2k most like the Story mode, NBA2k knew that so they brought in somebody who knows Basketball and how to put together a good story, Spike Lee. This game proved to me that my assumptions about Spike Lee were correct. He cant write a good story, the only city in this mans mind is New York, and there is only 1 race in Spikes world, Black. If you enjoy personal player customization, than this game is NOT for you. Pike Lee stereotyped this game all over the place, if your Asian, Russian, White, Mexican, etc, than im sorry, but according to this game, your now African American, but you can choose what shade of African American, so thats good I guess. There is only 1 voice for your charactor. If you try to make your charactor look as much like another ethnic group as possible, you then have to deal with the fact you have a black family, which is fine, I can do the adopted thing, but wait, you have a twin sister who is also black. Now, your name, you'd probably like to have your very own name wouldnt you, too bad, you are now known as ""Freq"", which is short for Frequency Vibrations. Oh ya, you live in the projects in Harlem, nowhere else, you cant choose LA, Houston, Canada, London, nope, its Harlem. Your best friend is a drugged out loud mouth, your sister wont give you any privacy. How about choosing a college to goto, that you can do, aslong as your favorite school is 1 of the 8 they give you to choose from. Now, im not saying thoe entire game is junk, its not, infact the only part of the game thats junk is the MyCareer mode, all the other aspects of the game are fine. Well, except for those who pre-ordered the game and didnt get what was promised for those who pre-ordered, ugh!			"

												Much was made about the Spike Lee directed Career/Story Mode but I found it really lacking and hugely disappointing. The biggest problem I have with this was the absolute heavy-ham-handed scripting which instead of adding to immersion actually kills it completely.Firstly, My Career has always been about creating a player that is you (or that you want) regardless of race. Spike Lee pigeon-holes and shoe-horns you into poor black kid growing up in the projects in Harlem. Cliched much?My Career tries to present two of the fundamental choices/problems that blue-chip college/young NBA players have: such as whether or not to go one-and-done; whether or not to stick with your homie who's had your back forever but is a bad influence or to ditch him for the good of your career.So much is made about these problems and how hard it is to choose. Your character literally agonizes over each choice. Then the game/story goes ahead and makes the choices for you. Well duh ... if you're going to belabour the point and make it such a big deal, and if it really is MY career, then I would like to have a say in it, wouldn't you? I honestly only started enjoying the game a bit more after the script ended. Also another pet peeve is the big deal they make of your created player: high school phenom, blue-chip prospect, once in a generation talent, etc, etc. And you come into the draft with a skill level of 55? This may not be a big deal (and actually fit with the last edition where your player went undrafted) but the disparity is so immersion-breaking. From having 'boosted' stats in High School/College where your 7 foot centre can literally hit 3-pointers from everywhere to missing 2 feet lay-ups in the NBA ... i should think that if I'm actually good enough to be drafted top-20 in the NBA draft i should be at least be able to make a jump-shot or two.Also, because of whatever reason, your rookie season is abridged into eight games so that Spike Lee can turn your rookie career into a blurb. Which means you only play 8 games (i.e. compared to the regular season 82 you would have played in previous editions - meaning you literally miss out one entire year of skill points and never have a chance to break into the starting line-up). It also means the whole Rookie of the Year target which most players set their sights on is pretty much impossible/redundent.   Game-wise its generally more of the same with better animations. A more robust blocking/swatting system is much welcome. But generally the AI appears to be more tepid and less intelligent this edition. The point-guard hogs the ball way too much and makes really bad decisions/shots. The transition game appears better and fast breaks are a lot more viable but the PC-controlled teams appear to have a huge edge in the transition game (most of the time your team are not even back in their half-court set when the other team pushes the ball back up the court for an empty lane). tldr: Spike Lee's story kills the immersion and the real game/fun only starts when it ends. They should have made the story-mode a toggle on/off feature when starting a new career. I feel that 2k15 plays a little better and is more immersive.			"

												This review is mainly slated towards MyCareer.It's really upsetting, I played a lot of NBA 2K15 and after spending a majority of time finishing MyCareer and MyGM/MyLeague, I definitely got my money's worth after 300+ hrs. NBA 2K16, however, got pretty overhyped when regards to their MyCareer, which seemingly got worse.I think most people were under the impression that after all the positive feedback 2K14 and 2k15 got in regards to MyCareer, and how they enjoy a story around your character, 2k would finally go all out with one this year by hiring Spike Lee to direct it.Somehow, they went backwards. Even though 2k never had a white voice actor, hiring Spike Lee to be a ghetto visionary and make your family black and growing up in Harlem sort of ruins any illusion that most of the white players could relate to, which btw, alot of your audience is.As for the customization people were hoping for, it some how becomes even more linear with Spike Lee making a strict storyline with choices you can not choose. Literally, the only choices you can make in MyCareer is Choosing a High School (1 of 3), choosing a college (1 of 9), and at the end of 8 games played (of 82) you get to become a free agent. Meaning if you wanted to play the 2015-2016 league, you only are playing 8 games against the legitimate rosters, and then enter free agency.How did this happen? Outside of actual games, MyCareer lasted a total of maybe an hour. After completeing college and moving into the draft, Im finally in the NBA, next to top draft picks that have overalls of 78 and 77, meanwhile I have 55 overall and am somehow considered a top 10 pick. Where's summer league? Training camp? Where is anything that can allow me to actually progress without having to spend VC on attributes ? Most people do NOT want to start the NBA with 55 overall and don't want to have to spend money on VC to stay competitive.As for what they did right, High School and College felt legitimately realistic. You're a high school phenom, and as such your character is seriously OP. You can steal and run the ball and shoot better than everyone, and as you progress towards the NBA, games get harder in college. Unfortunately there was no real culture to talk about with colleges, the only differences is the uniform and logo, and High School + College combined are over very quickly.Edit: More time put into MyCareer and gameplay is still solid, and now that the mediocre story is over, the grind for getting badges and practicing in the gym is actually enjoyable. Connections would be more interesting if they were more indepth and you weren't able to exploit them, but overall a nice addition. Still disappointing overall.Another annoying thing to point out is the fact that during creating MyPlayer, while height and wingspan actually matter in this version of 2k ( which is a good thing ), the fact that choosing inside/outside/balanced position when creating your character limits your possibility as a player, and can't be changed. As a balanced 6'6 SF with maxed shooting, my 3 pt is below average that of another SF in the league.			"

												Having pre-ordered NBA 2K16 (following the hype train, woot-woot!), I got the opportunity to play already, and I was able to quickly form an opinion on the in my eyes most important mode of the game, the MyCareer mode. I’m one of those who basically bought the game for this mode alone, where you take control of a new player in the NBA and lead him to greatness.By now, I’ve played three quarters of my rookie season, after leading my player through high school and first year of college. I’m blown away by how much of a blowout this game is. “Hold it right there for a second,” you might say, “the game isn’t out long enough for you to have played so far ahead!” If I didn’t know better, I would agree with you on that. The problem is, however, your “rookie season” is 8 (eight!) games long.Yes, you’ve read right. I was shocked when I got to the “gym menu” and read that it was the first of eight games I would get to play in my rookie season. It’s frustrating. The game doesn’t give you any option to change this. This is not a basketball simulation anymore, it’s a farce.I want to lead my player through all 82 games of a season (plus even more in post-season, if possible), and in full-length at that. Maybe I don’t get much further than my rookie season until the next game comes out, but I’m with my player all the way until then. When the commentators praise my last game, I want to have been there for that. Why should I give a damn about what the AI made my player do? I don’t get any credits for that to spend on my abilities, I don’t get any chance to rise to starhood early on, and I don’t get any sort of information how I’m doing outside of the commentary for the next game I’m playing, or at least I haven’t found it in the cryptic menu structure.“Featuring a Spike Lee joint” is the worst thing they could’ve done. You’re forced to suffer through one of the most annoying stories I’ve ever played. And I’ve been through all of “Dying Light”. They praise it in the trailers with “Be The Story”. Guess what, that’s all you get to do, because you can’t make one on your own.I didn’t know what to expect, so my player is pretty much me. Every NBA 2K game I’ve played before gave me the opportunity to “be myself”, which mostly meant, a white guy with a similar name (so the commentators don’t just call me by my nickname) and “College” Germany (and a different height, depending on the position). In 2K16, that means a 7ft tall (Center) white guy has a black twin sister that seems at least a foot smaller, has no similarities in their looks whatsoever, and stays bland throughout the story, a problem all characters have in this. You don’t get to choose anything about yourself beside the appearance and some on-court details. Everything but the teams you play for is pretty much set in stone; and the teams you play for do not change the story a bit. You follow a story of some random dude, instead of forming him yourself. There are some major crossroads he just barrels through without you being consulted. But hey, you can choose to go to UCLA instead of UConn. Congratulations.Even when you think you can choose something important (what a heated discussion in a cut scene about staying another year in College or agreeing to enter the Draft builds up to), he just says, “here’s what I’m going to do…”, cut to black screen, and whoop-de-do, welcome to the NBA Draft 2016!I feel no connection to Harlem. I feel no connection to the family. Suddenly I have a girlfriend, and I have no idea why she’s here (when I first saw her, I was like “Hey, who’s that? Oh, she looks nice, and she’s in an important meeting… she might be my girlfriend. Oh her name’s Yvette? Cool.”). My so-called best friend is always up to no good and I spend six-figure sums in lawyers and settlements to keep everything quiet about him and his escapades. My agent (who I obviously don’t get to choose, either) is a New Yorker, a self-proclaimed “Shark” with italian roots, where every “Mobster cliche” bell in my head starts ringing like a shot clock. I have no say in this at all. The story tries very hard to create drama (to the point where it’s hard for me to suspend my disbelief), but it fails miserably at making me care, because it lacks decisions where my actions would have any sort of impactful consequences. If this was a movie, I wouldn’t see it in theatres, I wouldn’t rent it, and wouldn’t even waste my time on it would it be on Netflix.Technically, the game is up to snuff concerning the simulation part, even though I despise getting fouled out in the third quarter because of the mechanics for setting picks (and for calling illegal screens). Otherwise, it’s ridiculously bad. The menu structure is horrible, you don’t find anything quickly. A training option where you get to train the moves one by one is completely missing, instead you get four instructional videos with instructions read by NBA stars who can muster about as much enthusiasm as if they were reading a recipe for sour cream cheesecake - or dubbing a 70s sex ed video. In the few hours I’ve played, I’ve had about half a dozen Back-To-Desktop crashes, without the game freezing (it just closed the window). Other than that, the servers aren’t the most reliable, but that might be because the game isn’t even officially released yet. Oh god, I dread what it will be like in the week following the official release...Graphically, it looks very good, but that’s to be expected. There isn’t much more to improve graphically, anyway. Last year’s NBA 2K looked great, too. My PC isn’t the best out there, but it manages to give a decent image.UPDATE: As one of the comments so helpfully pointed out, the game ""reverses back to normal"" in the second season. The so-called ""story"" only ruins your rookie year, but oh boy is it bad, and cheesy, tacky, and all sorts of wrong. I write fanfiction for a hobby and I would've been able to write a better story on a tipsy saturday evening. After now going strong in my second season, the game does get better; but I still can't bring myself to recommend it, most of all not at full price. You lose the probably most important season of your career to a joke of a story.Bugwise, it's playable, although for me there's one recurring thing: it has a kinda useful feature telling you things about your opponent when you come into the game (at tipoff or from the bench), but sometimes it fails to load that overview (only showing the player in idle animation), and the game takes about 20 sec to skip that screen and go back into the game.TL;DR: It’s not a bad game, per say, and perhaps you’ll find joy in it if you don’t care about the MyCareer mode, but in that mode, it dumps all its negative points right in my face early on although I usually like the NBA 2K franchise. I will continue playing it at least until after my rookie season, and maybe pick it up again once they bring me a patch that fixes this abomination called “Featuring A Spike Lee Joint”. Until then, keep away from this because no way this is worth the full price.TL;DR: UPDATE: Got to second season. Story over, so game got better. Rookie season still ruined. Don't buy at full price.

												Been playing NBA2k games since 2k12 and I've noticed this year is pretty ridiculous. I generally play MyCareer as it is the most popular game mode, but I do occassionally play the others.Pros:- The game looks great visually- Easy to adapt to new controls- Harder to do certain things that wasn't exactly basketball-like that older games had- Overall very smooth with decent cpuCons:- MyCareer is a racist joke: I ain't black so why is my twin sister black. Stereotypes everywhere. Spike Lee was the worst part about this game.- Not new user friendly: Be ready to throw your wallet to get any sort of decent start because your mycareer starts with a sub60 rating.- HOF Cpu is cheese itself: Wide-open jumpers fall 98% of the time. More shocked when it misses.- Some players just don't make sense: Bench players in real NBA and with low ratings in game plays like Kobe shooting over three guys.- AI defense is horrible: 80+ rating 3pt rating guard that can't finish on the outside? AI leaves him open. Pick and roll switch up? Non-existent. Basic man-to-man? How about Otto Porter Shaqtin a Fool every game. 30 RPG as a team and your player point guard has 8 of them? Why not.- Moving like you're on ice: Your player slides and glides like he's on ice and occassionally gets stuck when defending. Absolutely ridiculous.- AI passing: Have fun with turnovers because your AI teammates can't do jack.- MyCareer is a joke: Spike Lee is the worst part about this game. Oh wait... I said this already.- Certain players are just overpowered: Stephen Curry is a prime example.- Certain players just don't match with their stats and tendencies: Lebron is like the easiest thing to guard and Jeremy Lamb shoots over anybody and everybody. James Johnson shoots threes with a crap rating and low tendency which essentially means a turnover if he catches the ball near the three. - Refs are walking picks: I run into the ref on the fast break cuz they just on the court. I called for a pass and that thing ain't stopping until it gets to China.- Player does its own thing: Getting stuck in animations, not being able to do anything in certain situations (dive for ball and catching it, spin move and it starts pole dancing), and hyping up the crowd when opposing guard goes coast to coast for a dunk.- Get rid of the coach: He's annoying. How you gonna tell me score more inside when the only baskets we get are dunks. - WTF timeouts: They don't make sense *PERIOD* You get subbed in and a timeout comes immediately after they score. 10/10 trash programming.- Bounce passes: Slow, clunky, and receiver thinks its a booger and runs from it. No more fancy passes guys, stick with pick-n-roll and hope they don't do some superhuman sh** and intercept it outta nowhere.- Opposing HoF Defense is hax: Melo jumped over 8ft into the air to swat an alley-oop pass. Checked it in replay and Anthony Davis's head was under his feet. I broke up laughing at how sh** this game was when that happened. Wasn't even mad. Oh yeah and every player has whips as arms since they block passes out of their range.While a lot of these cons are persistent problems in the 2k games, it's just getting worse. Hyping up the MyCareer didn't help; it just added a sh** ton of backlashes.			"

												Ok...

You cant play in your rookie season...well... you can like 8 games. I liked the highschool and collage part but the story is just simple Sh** , you just want to skip it, dialogueis cringy as hell, well it was written by Spike Lee nothing more to expect... i like the off days option to do things you would like and i like the ""Live practice"" but one thing is missing from that... you cant improve your attributes by going to live practice like you could have in 2k11, you will just get a boost and xp thats it and you can earn a little vc like 50. Upgrading attributes- i hate it, those upgrade bars or what ever you call it , its stupid, bring the simple old one.-Gameplay- has so many flaws , pick and rolls are the worst , and each update they try to fix it before updates it was good enough you could live with that , 1st update broke every AI play would reach on pass and you couldnt get the pass trought on the 2nd one they made it great again, 3rd one i dont know, and now i think 4th its bad , seems like noone can set a screen , Noel, Cousins,Okafor or any other center cant do a screen they will catch contact with like 5th screen every  one who plays basketball knows if you set a screen you have to catch the player so the defender will switch, but dude sets the screen away from the player so the defender would go over the screen untouched, like what the hell and if the screen works the bigman would run away from the basket and wont get into position, so pick and roll is not effective at all.-Should be more options to get VC, by playing MyGm for example.-Passing should be fixed if a dude is wide open next to you and you point at him and pass the pass will go across the court to another dude that is defended by 2 defenders ... like why .....MyTeam wise the game improved alot and its soo fun to play, but this might be the worst MyCareer experience ever, it will make you more mad than happy... Didnt try MyPark yet, but when i upgrade my player i will.Overwall just for updates that simply doesnt add alot, for bad MyCareer, for stupid AI , for cringy story and for most of all this game costs 50 euros and at most this game should cost 25... so for all that i will give it a NO. BUT.... BUTT... ha butt .. But if it costs 16-22 euros buy it its worth that, play MyTeam mode and live happly :)Just Updateing for Event.			"

												MyCareer character is so weak in the beginning, weaker than in any previous 2k. Only a 50 rating. 2k clearly tries to force players to spend extra money on buying vc. Beware, VC cheese is coming.Rookie year is the most important year in my opinion for a basketball player, however, 2k clearly doesn't see it this way. You are only allowed to play 8 games in total, meaning that you will not be a starting player in your rookie year. Too much Spike Lee and too little NBA.			"

												After so 27 hours of playing, i can definitely say, 2K games screwed up pretty badly..Story, gameplay, optimization, VC... This is not my first NBA game. I've been playing NBA games since 98 and this year i got very excited about 2K16, but it really ruined every expactation of mine. First of all My Career. Are you serious? Spike Lee did this? I mean i don't have a high opinion about Spike Lee but this much?! Let me tell you guys, You are gonna watch series of cutscenes till you get into NBA. These cutscenes feel very very dull after watching some of them. and story is one person's dream. Not Livin' Da Dreeeaaammm. It's Spike Lee's Dreeeaamm... Damn..... So called Livin' Da Dream (My Career) is this. Cutscenes... Cutscenes.. Cutscenes... Optimization. I won't even write about it. If any official from 2K reading this, this is not acceptable.Pre-order bonuses. Unacceptable.I will definitely not buy 2K17 until i see reviews and youtube videos next year.			"

												Spike Lee was the absolute worst thing to happen to this game. MyCareer's rookie season is useless and the story is completely static and the same every time. You don't want to be a hard-luck baller from Harlem? Too bad. You want your family to be white, Asian, Latino, or just not black? Too bad. Spike Lee has to make a stereotypical Italian guy who talks about pizza and says capeesh. Your family MUST be from New York and living a rough life. This is terrible. I really hope 2k17 has more options for the backstory of your player.			"

												My honest thoughts about NBA2K16 and the NBA2K franchise:NBA2K16's gameplay is great. The overall presentation is very smooth and the graphics have really stepped up its game since 2K15. I don't think the controls are as great as it was in 2K15, but I don't really have any complaint about it. No more ripped jersey shorts when players are dunking. No more of those alien-esque eye contacts when camera pans in on the players' faces. Also a lot less shot-clock cheese.MyCareer this year has given me the most emotional turmoil, ever. I really disliked the story, as you probably have heard everywhere how Spike Lee tried to add in his 2 cents to 2K, which resulted in the your player's family being African American regardless of what color skin your player has. I do enjoy the many accolades your player is able to achieve and how quickly you are able to level your character up to at least an all-star level. One of the things I hated about the previous NBA2K MyCareers is how little of VC earnings you get after every game, but 2K has fixed that issue in this year's release.MyTeam is a mode I enjoy very much. Every week 2K releases packs that you are able to buy and every week it has a different series of challenges that you are able to compete. 2K has really increased the amount of variety of player cards that you are able to receive. For example, for every NBA player there are multiple player cards such as the player's default card, dynamic ratings card, moments card, playoffs card, TBT player card, all star card, MVP card, and many more. Each card by the same player has different ratings depends on the type of cards, and it really adds in some flavor in collecting your cards and makes it exciting to open up packs because it always catch you off guard on what cards you may get. My personal favorite: a bronze Sim Bhullar rated at 69, but is an absolute beast in the post both offensive and defensively in the game.MyPark in my opinion is... ehhh. The gameplay is really great and all, but a lot of the times the park is either empty or is just a bunch of people who have formed cliques, or squads, to play against each other. If you are just trying to play a game by yourself, good luck finding a match because ""you can't sit wid us"".Now, onto the franchise. Ronnie Singh aka Ronnie2K, the NBA2K public relations and the main spokesperson, is probably the biggest joke in the gaming industry. The guy has very limited NBA knowledge and is terrible at trying to attract gamers to come back for more NBA2K. I remember sometime in April when @NBA2K on twitter reached 1 million followers, Ronnie2K promised every gamer will receive a gift as a thanks to such an achievement. So what did some gamers get? A simple T-shirt for MyCareer, a knee-pad upgrade, or bronze players for MyTeam. What did I get? A 71 Rating Kendrick Perkins. Yeah, what a joke. This really agitated the NBA2K gaming community and as such, the community started a #Unfollow2K movement which trended on twitter for a couple of days. The very next day after it reached 1M followers, the follower count was at 989K followers.I honestly don't know if I would recommend this game, or any of the NBA2K releases going forward. Unfortunately 2K is dominating in the sports games with no other competitors in near sight (Yeah I said it, EA), so I might consider buying some future releases... keyword 'MIGHT'.Thanks for reading this review. I hope you find this review helpful on making your decisions in purchasing this release or any of the new NBA2K releases.			"

												Have you ever just wanted to pick up a sports game and make your own character and dominate the game? Well too ♥♥♥♥ing bad loser, you have to sit through an eternity of Spike Lee's explosive diaherria disaster of a story that drags on and on and on and garuntees you will never care about any other character except your own. Seriously, this story is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow and boring, and the characters are so annoying. I honestly don't care about the backstory of my player. I just want to play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. I did not spend money to watch my player get abused by an italian american sports agent. But the tremendously long cut scenes are not the only problem, however.In addition to cutscenes taking forever, it seems whenever there is a time out you are forced to watch your team walk to the bench, which takes around 5 seconds, but again, I don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ in 2k14, as soon as i heard the timeout whistle i'd just skip it and start playing again. That's all I want to do. Play. I do not want to look at the atmosphere of the game or any of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Just let me play.Lastly, however, when you are playing and finally get into the NBA, you can only play about 8 games or so your rookie year because of the stupid ♥♥♥♥ing cutscenes. So essentially, Spike Lee is cockblocking you from developing your character his rookie year. Also, your player ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. Can't make a jumpshot to save his life, can't get into the paint without forgetting how to dribble and losing the ball, and, if somehow you do get in the paint, you will be swarmed and the ball will be smited out of your hands. The absolute only thing you can be good at at this point in the game is free throws, and with your miniscule minutes, you will only get about 4 a game. When you finally get out of the trainwreck that is your rookie year, you can finally play a whole season without Spike Lee's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brain child of a story groping your asscheeks. You enter free agency and can essentially join who ever you want. I joined the Knicks, so I don't know if this is true for whatever team you join, but your teammates are actually braindead. No one moves on their own. Everyone just stands there and moves in the direction you move. The AI are so bad in this game, I think I'd rather have Kwamwe Brown on my team than Robin Lopez.Also, what really annoys me are the Halftime report, and the post game show. I honestly think that the developers thought that we would actually want to watch them. My record for number of times I've pressed the A button to skip it must be around 3,000. Seriously, no one wants to watch that stupid crap. I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME.Spike Lee cannot write and should not write ever again			"

The entire rookie season is totally ruined, the story is totally unnecessary and obnoxious. Buy 2k15 and download rosters, or wait til 2k17 and hope they get rid of this nonsense.			"

												I (actual me) play as an average size/weight forward-center in Australia. I used NBA2K10 previously, and found that after playing it I was more conscious of my court position and defense in real games. Shocked! Playing from third person perspective made me focus on things that I hadn't really nailed on the real courts. I actually spent a whole season playing 2K10 for a couple hours before every game.Overall, I think a guy like me is in a pretty excellent position to judge the gameplay here, so I think I owe it to everyone to review it.I made myself in the game - Average size center. 7'0, 260. Though real me takes few jumpers I opted for all-around.So far, the good stuff;I love the post movement! It really echoes the way a lot of new players are being taught to post - not thinking about individual moves but thinking about position and response - You make a move and shoot if your defender wasn't able to respond, step through if he responded too hard, and make a second move if he responds smartly. It's very fluid, it's exactly how I think about my real post movement, and I like it. The second season (Takes a long time to get there...) is much, much better than the ruined first season. You have choice about your actions. You are coached... (it's rudimentary but at least it makes you think about changing your game up). You get to train (awesome!), doing some drills that might look familiar to organized ballers, and there is plenty of variation so you don't just do the same drill every time. So far, the bad stuff; The main reason I'm not recommending this: It's freezing. Sometimes it locks my computer completely, sometimes it merely quits the program mid-game. The first few hours this wasn't an issue. Today it seemed to be happening every game or two. I really don't have time to screw around with this kind of issue, and I'm sure a lot of you don't either.Skipping training is a smart thing to do in season 2? Plain stupid. Since you literally buy your skill, practice is now just a waste of valuable marketing time. I actually liked the training drills - especially as a guy who is new to playing virtual-basketball and using a game pad. In shootaround at training, you can't go back-to-basket and do a post move. What? I guess my guy is afraid of getting hit in the back of the head by a bricked shot. ♥♥♥♥♥. Let me post like in the home court screen. It matters to me, I'm a F/C. I don't want to shoot 3-pointers.     Slow players jump unreasonably high. Head crashing into the backboard but I can't change direction. In real players, vertical leap is pretty closely related to the general speed of the player on his feet. Very noticeable in 55OVR F/Cs.   Starter F/Cs react so slowly that there's no way they could ever play NBA. The slow CPU centers easily bust past 2 step sags.     Guards tend to misuse my screens - use me to shear off the defender! They are afraid of brushing my shoulder.To make up for this, 2k have put in some STUPID AI/animations where the screened opponent will go out of his way to trip over you. I've had a guy constantly changing direction just to trip over me while his man is 40 feet away making a layup. Insane stuff - it feels like cheating. I've counted guys running into me 4 or more times, long after their player has made his move. Sometimes they run into me even though their man is cutting away from me. They WANT to hit the screen.     I have my stats elevated by crazy bursts of speed when I go for blocks and rebounds from way out.     There's no context to the actions - player never seems to bail out of a rebound when he should.     Forwards aren't ready for rebounds. They seem to set feet after you tell them to rebound, not when the shot goes.     At least one 3-sec violation per game because he refuses to move after ignored call for pass. UNFORGIVABLE.The lack of depth perception (Not 2k's fault, but still a problem) means it's impossible to judge where a lot of shots will fall, limiting your ability to be ready for rebounds. CPU always gets the rebound on short airballs. Always. I'd say center is unplayable at 55ovr, but it gets a lot better once you up your stats a few points across everything. Pretty irritated about the amount of time it took for it to be playable though - I shouldn't need 10 hours of gameplay to be able to change direction and make a freethrow. Put me on an even footing. I don't want to dominate, I just want to be in the game. I am not able to believe I wouldn't get benched after 20 minutes shooting 20%, with a plus/minus of -15.As for the rest - you heard it in every other review. The first season is completely ruined. You aren't actually in any control until the 2nd season, so I guess it's NBA2k17. What were they thinking? The game runs as badly as my player does. Tutorials are garbage. A white guy will have a black twin... Everything bad anyone else says is probably true. Oh - and it's pretty hilarious to have my own shoe after half a season making 8ppg coming off the bench. 10/10 for comedy value. (And it's♥♥♥♥♥ugly. Didn't previous versions let you design them?)

												Only buy this if you mostly play MyGM mode. The MyCareer is even worse than last years. MyCourt JUST started working. Play now online is also broken as half of the matches or more will end after halftime. MyGM is really good, not much improved from last year though. You still get annoyed all season by players and coaches bugging you about training intensity. VC is also a joke, and its needed to enjoy sections of the game. Also, why the ♥♥♥♥ cant you change your uniform color once youve found an opponent? Thats so dumb. ive had to quit multiple matches just because both teams ended up wearing black or red. the graphics dont look like the trailer either - i have max settings on and it looks like a shiny, oily version of 2k13/2k14. Only worth off key sites for discounts and for MyGM mode. otherwise, until alot of stuff is fixed, its not worth full price to anyone.Also, 2K, PLEASE bring back individual stats in MyCareer and stop making it dependant on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ VC. Why cant I make a guy that can hit the midrange but not threes? what if i want to play a slashing power forward who has a post game? I still will play 2k14s career over this one or 2k15.edit:Now there are even more gamebreaking bugs. The commentary, AGAIN, stops after the first half of the first quarter, then doesnt come back at all until the end of the fourth. and oh no, not just for mycareer this time, but for EVERY GAME MODE IN THE GAME. ♥♥♥♥ing christ 2k. ive bought your♥♥♥♥♥♥since 2k9 and im refusing to buy anymoreupdate 12/1/15 - game has crashed on me 10 times in on week. ♥♥♥♥ing christupdate 5/5/2016 - the game seems to run very solid now. Havent had a crash or D/C in months. Im still leaving this a thumbs down as the more you play, the more you realize how broken and annoying the defensive controls are in this game. stay away unless youre a hardcore NBA fan, or you see this game on sale by some miracle.update 6/19 - still crashing again now. ♥♥♥♥ you 2k.

												MY CAREER ONLY REVIEW ONLYPros:--EDIT: Had to change this section as more crap was changed.  Less pros and more cons I am afraid.--The game is 60% SOLID GOLD when it is not fudging things.  It rewards you for hustle and punishing you for playing stupid D.  That is how it should be every game.  Unfortuately there is the other 40% and makes you want to throw your remote through the monitor.  There is nothing worse than playing a game and feeling like you have no outcome on the results.  Hmm...come to think of it...sounds just like Spike Lee's garbage.  OOPS!  Sorry...that was a rip in the PROS section.  Sorry!--The second season is how the game should be.  You have a lot of options to make money/points.  CONS:--I don't think I have to elaborate much on the utter BS that is Spike Lee.  He makes the first part of the game so painful that I am DREADING having to do it again.  I know you can skip things but you should not have to live through one second of it.  As other says....it's brutal.  What's funny is that if a white person had done this 'first year' he would have been called a racist.  Since it's Spike its ok evidently.  Add to it that you have ZERO control on ANYTHING that happens.....just f-ing brutal.   A cut scene where the parents talk about how they met?  Are you MENTAL?  OMG!!!! Who the SH-T gives a flying f-ck how his parents met?  Seriously?  If I wanted to read that I would steal my wife's romance novels.  STOP THE MADNESS!---The game is 'fixed' to an extent, worse so on the higher difficulties.  If you shoot 65% from the field the Ai will simply 'adjust' the game so that the other team will get multiple offensive rebounds (even if they are the worst rebounding team in the league), have 10+ points more from the free throw line (in one quarter) and of course the old faithful game 'balancer"" the 3 point shot.  Listen, this happens every F-ing game!!!!!  Its not a 'every once in a while' thing...the computer WILL make you miss/turn the ball over/<insert thing you did not do>.--As you play you will be ""throttled"".  In this I mean that in 'real life' the chances of you going 10 for 10 from the field is pretty slim.  Well, this is just a game of code so you WILL be forced to miss shots.  I am ok with missing shots...its just missing the WIDE OPEN LAYUP or DUNK....TWICE IN A ROW....that I can not tolerate.  If you are not throttled there it will happen at the beginning of the game (especially in game 2 or 3 of a playoff series).  You will 'magically' start only making 1 or 2 out of 7 shots.  That happens right? The problem is your shots are of the wide open layup/dunk variety.  I just roll my eyes becuase I KNOW that I will 'struggle with my shot'...and then magically make the next 12!  This exact situation has happened MANY times to the point that I can predict it after 3 shots in the game.  --I duped a guy in the post.  I went up for a layup (not sure why a 7'3"" guy would do a layup when he can DUNK while standing on the floor) and just...missed it.  Can't this happen?  SURE it has happened.  The problem is that it happens EVERY F-ING GAME!  This is 10 fold the story when you play the highest difficulty.  I passed to a streaking Jimmy Butler who was a few feet ahead of his guy...aka a BREAKAWAY.  He could have dunked it with his mouth if he wanted...but he does a layup and almost missed the whole rim.  Why?  We were past the magical number the computer said we could be ahead because it must REMAIN CLOSE!-- By this time last year I had almost 250 hours in game.  This year...pft!  I pick it up once a week, play a quarter, get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and then rage off.  Double teaming is worthless for applying pressure.  Its only helps with contested shots.  Pressure, the guy just passes out of it with ZERO problems.  Then I stand in front of the guy I am guarding with my hands up.  He just throws a ball that flies right over my head to the guy under the basket.  The Ai can pass like that all day and there is NOTHING you can do about it.  Steals only happen if you jump the lane...but if you are standing IN THE F-ING LANE the ball goes just in front of your face..and the second guy...and the third...to the one under the basket who will F-ING NEVER miss the shot.  --They adjusted the passing so that if you are in an excellent spot to intercept a pass...and you are not allowed to steal it because the other team is on a run or if you have too many....the pass will move at 3x its normal speed so you are late.  Happens EVERY GAME.  This goes 10x for trying to intercept the ball on the inbounds.  It just simply goes faster so you can't intercept. --They adjusted the game so that if the ball touches ANY PART OF THE OTHER TEAM'S players it you will lose the ball.  Now, this seems to make sense right?  Yes and no.  Yes it makes since but no it does not because IT DOES NOT COUNT AGAINST THE Ai OPPONENT!  You dribble on a guy's foot..turnover (remember, you won't get 90% of loose balls).  The Ai will dribble the ball where it goes THROUGH your HEAD and CHEST as your arm goes through it as you try to steal it.  The ball will then go through the two defenders next to you and they will score.  This actually happens MULTIPLE times EVERY game.  Even had one game Kyrie dribbled through my legs and lost the ball...or so I thought.  It went 10 feet away, changed direction in mid air and then shot back into his hand so he could power dunk on me.  --Went on a run.  Did a pick and roll in which both guys tried to trap me.  Great right?  I bounce passed to the open guy 3 feet in front of the basket.  He catches it and...layup?  No! Dunk? NO!  He gets ready to jump but then just pauses until the defender 10 feet away makes it over.  Then he tries a REVERSE LAYUP...that goes INTO the defender.  This shot got...BLOCKED!  I know!  Shocking!I don't know why I bother playing this game.  I guess its for the 60% solid gold part.  Its the 40% FOOL'S GOLD part that make me quit.  I am quite sad as I know next year will be using 90% of the same code as this year.  It will end up the same and I just can't do this again.  They have lost me as a fan.  :-(			"

												I do recommend this game for any basketball fan out there, but NBA 2K16 has its pros and cons. I'll break it down. Pros:-Smoother Animations-Dunk Animations are a lot better-Improved MyCareer-Defense movement has been improved-Rebounding has also improved (Thank God)-Stunning Graphics-Shoe Deals are now gone so now you don't need to wait like 30 games+ for a shoe deal (Thank you lord)Cons:-Frame Rate Issues (Usual with early release games due to NVIDIA Drivers or 2K Sports optimizations not done correctly)-Where are the bonus's from the Pre-Orders?-Animations seem to stutter once in a while-Without the shoe deal, it requires you to purchase them with in game VC (Although this is a lot better than waiting 30 games+ for a shoe deal)-Default graphics processor is Intel's Integrated GPU (WTF?)With all that said,NBA 2K16 isn't a bad game and it's definiately a better basketball simulator than NBA Live series that EA is trying to bring back. It just requires new NVIDIA Drivers or 2K Sports to optimize the game. Gameplay and all is fine. Just the lag is just killing me.			"

												What a piece of junk. -Terrible, cheesy, racist and stereotyped (Thanks Spike) story for Mycareer.-Forced to play 7 meaningless games in high school and college for no VC.-Your player has no choices at all during the story mode-Your rating of 55 when you enter the league makes you an instant scrub, the lowest rated player in the league. -Offensive player movement is lethargic, and you literally stick to the defensive player when you have the ball.-Shooting is hit or miss, literally, even when you execute a perfect release, because they lowered the accuracy     percentage for open 3 pointers-Player avatars are laughable and some bear little resemblance to the real life player.

Make sure you have a controller however.To expand on my review a little bit, 2K has made strides to keep the community happy, while this hasn't always worked, the game keeps its consistency. With other modes then just ""PLAY BEEEBAALL"" like MyGM where you manage a team and can go as far as set ticket prices and keep players happy, to MyTeam which is a mode similar to Madden Ultimate Team where you gather cards to make a team to do challenges to get more cards and virtual currency to spend.I do have one con however, if you're looking for a constant online group to play with, this might not be it. In my own experience I can never get matched with people online, and when I do my connection gets dropped instantly, this includes all online modes such as The Park which is like a free for all basketball mode, allowing you to hop in a street game on command. I'm sure its different if you have friends that are willing to play, however I do not so I have to matchmake.My verdict is 8.9/10Also if you're interested, there is mod support that 2K likes to keep under wraps, check out the NLSC forum for HD mods for players, stadiums, and all other sorts of enhancements.

												Banned for playing the game normally and can't even get a response from customer service. It's a good game, but the multiple bugs related to online and the complete lack of care from 2K is really concerning. They care more about milking people for money from microtransactions than their actual game.			"

												Same crap, different year. For everything 2K fixes, they break another thing. For every feature they add, they remove another. As always with 2K PC ports, you can tell 2K put minimal labor and effort into a proper conversion. Paying full-cost year after year for essentially the same mediocre game has taken its toll on me and I think it's finally safe to say I'm abandoning this franchise.			"

												Pros:- Improved responsivness on defense- Removed some of the cheese from 2k15 (charge cheese and zigzag 27 foot threes)- Improved post play- Off days in MyCareer (ability to get MyTeam cards from MyCareer)- More realistic reboundingCons:- Minor improvement over 2k15 (They were saying that they removed the cheese in 2k16, but they actually created it in 2k15 with Patch #4. 2k15 just needed some sliders tweaking)- Hyped up MyCareer story didnt deliver- Short highschool season (3 games with 2 minute quarters)- Short college season (4 games with 6 minutes halftimes)- Only 8 games in rookie season- Not being able to play on custom designed arena in ProAM- Proam doesnt work most of the time (""Friend has changed park..."")- Blocking is way to easy, even with 6ft pointguard- Stealing is too easy, especially stripping players on fastbreak or under the rim- Big men (PF/C) have no ball protection in the post- Midrange shots go in 90+ % of the time, even with terrible players- Baseline midrange jumpers go in 100% of the time, even heavily contested- Post fadeaway still cheese- Hackers, hackers, hackers (even though they had one attempt of banning them)- People banned because of the developers lazyness (account rollback/reset would make more sense than BAN)- Real hackers still running around hidden as fake 55 overalls- Hackers in MyTeam/Gauntlet that make your game freeze and give you 80-0 loss- ""A problem has been encountered that prevents gameplay from continuing. This game will not be counted."" --> Caused when you press pause in 1st quarter and sometimes caused by CE users. Still rewards a loss even though it says that game will not be counted- Ball tangibility still not good (ball going through players, floating in players hands, ball teleporting dribble)- Poor AI for both your teammates in mycareer and cpu opponents (cpu still more effective because of HoF cheese)- VC harder to earn than in 2k15- Over agressive CPU defense (not that I like last year Nba Jam, but this is way too much)- PnR way too effective- Brick wall knocks down players on every 2 screens- Awkward automatic fadeaway on contested shots that arent that much contested- Barely any graphical improvement over the last year- Performance issues (havent encountered them personally, but many people with high end GPUs have them)- Invisible players in every game mode, even Park/ProAm- Same terrible upgrade system from 2k15 that they tried to ""balance"" adding stat caps. Grouping attributes in categories prevents players from specializing in certain areas and therefore all the players are the same. (cant make a player that is good at freethrows but sucks at 3 pointers etc..)- Inability to configure keyboard controls- Controller settings often reset (boxout assist strength and defensive assist strength)- Took them 10 days to give us our preorder bonuses- Players missing from MyTeam collectionsTo sum up: Definitely not worth the full price. Get it in a month or two after few patches and on some discount.			"

												Online is garbageIf you love the NBA, get the game.If you want pure basketball simulation, do not buy this game.Do not buy this for the story, if you are a 2K fan, if you have a console, get it on there.Because 2K is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥es when it actually comes to the PC crowd, they do not care.I am in EU, so I have to rotate my ♥♥♥♥ing stick around for 5 minutes, or else my main controller will be my keyboard instead.Because 2K are that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that they remove the ability for mulitple controller inputs, so I have to unplug my keyboard if I want to go in and get cheesed in their horrendous MyTeam mode.The MyTeam mode has not changed since it's launch years ago, nothing has really changed in terms of gameplay.Some tweaks there, if you own 2K11 on pc, you could get some mods and get it to look just as good as this.I wanted this game for the online, which I do regret now, I can't play any fun team without facing the ♥♥♥♥ing Cavaliers every game.I just find it annoying that 2K used to be the good guys, like back when ESPN 2K5 football was like 20 dollars when Madden sold for 50, now they are just that bench guy in the NBA who keeps on getting checks even though the person is damn near 40.I hope something changes, I would still not recommend this game to anybody, because the PC version is such an obvious♥♥♥♥♥♥show like it always is.We are the minority when it comes to money, so they have no care for what we need or want.I have had this controller-lock problem for years, I have contacted Ronnie(♥♥♥♥ you), Chris(you are kind of cool but you seem like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ and 2Ksupport. None of them have resolved the issue, even though I have spammed them and they have passed it on to their subpar devteam.The biggest most marketed feature of the game was the single player, well the first season is just horrible, just skip the cutscenes. It is like He Got Game, just like a thousand times more horrible, whoever even thought that it was a good idea to have a linear storymode be called ""YOUR STORY"" is just dumb.Just another marketing scheme to get the buyers to get it, I can safely say, that I won't invest in any VC or another 2K preorder until things have changed.

Maybe after a few hundred hours of trial and error you will be decent at the game.You have to spend many hours playing to upgrade you MyPlayer, or cave in and buy VC to save yourself time.PC community isn't that large so have fun trying to find a game in MyTeamPC gets less love than console for 2K16, so some bugs will never be fixed.Pros:It's actually kinda fun.TL;DR - Do not get this game if you've never played a 2K basketball game before.

 2K abuses their dominance if not their de-facto monopoly on basketball gaming, as they would never dare with their other devs such as Firaxis (civ):    Microtransactions on a fully priced game, intentionally affects pacing: While on the first MyPlayer you make on 2k16/2k15 you will tolerate it, somewhat, any subsequent player will be a total grind if you don't buy VC  Unskippable cutscenes, or cutscenes that need delay before they can be skipped: entering a timeout, exiting it, half time breaks, news cast at the end of the game, etc.  Either you have to wait before skipping, or you can't skip, a nightmare.  Exploitable animations have only been fixed at the time of this review (mid May 16), just an example of the low update rate of this game  POOR PC support, now NBA 2K always disrespected PC, but this is nuts, delayed patches, less care for PC only bugs, and their history of bringing engines late to PC  These are just a small sample, did I say an abusing monopoly?

												Everyone gives this game a lot of negative reviews for basically pointless stuff. I've been playing NBA 2k since 2k11 and I can personally say I've had as much fun now as I did back when I first started. What everyone says about the MyCareer is not FULLY true. Yes the story is boring and pointless, and yes rookie year is a waste. But, after rookie season you are in regular MyCareer and it is actually very fun. There is no more pointless hour long cutscenes, and its basically classic MyCareer. Besides the start of the MyCareer, this is the best basketball game to date. The crowd is amazingly realistic, the graphics and atmosphere is great, and the game runs very well.			"

												This game is mediocre at best. Rebounding works good, thats the only praise I will give this game. Story sucks, character creation sucks, customization sucks, pay too win sucks, gameplay sucks and can be incredibly frustrating to the point of wanting to punch a hole through your monitor or smash your game pad into a thousand little pieces.  Honestly, this game just sucks. Below is what is broken.-CPU STEALS (Good luck dribbling in a straight line, the cheese cpu steals are real with this one, guess how many times cpu gets called for reaching in? NEVER)- ISO MOVES ( Also ties into the cpu cheese steals, I call it the turnover stick now. Even with the absolute setting and a decent playmaking skill half the time you will do a random move and often multiple random moves which results in, you guessed it, turnovers)- SHOT METER ( So you know for a fact you got a perfect release? Well 2k doesnt think so. So many times I've stoped the slider on the left of the bar only for it to magically appear on the right)- USER STEALS ( So youre hand goes straight through the ball and you think you've got yourself a steal? Think again, the cpu steal cheese does not carry over to your abilities, you're more likely to get called for a reach in. Many times the cpu will run right through you and it wont even phase him, you try to do the same? TURNOVER)- CPU DEFENSE ( So you just pulled off a sick spin move without turning the ball over and you're now 6ft away from your opponent with an open lane to the rim? Well too bad! The cpu wizardry will warp the player at light speed and stop you in your tracks mid dribble)- USER DEFENSE ( Good luck playing any sort of relevant defense as a guard if you dont have near max athleticism, you could play defense just as good as the computer but the cpu will most of the time either glitch right through you or run right around you with ease, and good luck getting back on defense if you take one wrong step because youll be stuck there for about 3 seconds)-CPU SHOT SELECTION ( So you just tossed Joakim Noah the ball right on the baseline with an easy driving lane to the hoop and you're wondering what kind of mystical dunk he is getting ready to perform? FORGET ABOUT IT, he's going to stay planted and shoot a fadeaway 12 footer and miss badly, costing you an assist and some points on the board.- TURBO BUTTON ( So you're mashing the turbo button because you see something in the defense you can exploit? Well too bad for you because it will take at least 2 seconds, if at all, before your character decides to start sprinting into a cpu player who wasn't there 2 seconds ago which results in more turnovers. I know I'm forgetting many more flaws.PLEASE, WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT SUPPORT THE DEVELOPER WHEN THEY CONTINUE TO RELEASE BAD GAME MECHANICS YEAR AFTER YEAR AND DO NOT RELEASE ANY SORT OF RELEVANT PATCHES. STICK WITH 2K15 OR 2K14 FOR THAT MATTER, AS EVEN THOSE GAMES ARE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THIS TRASH. DO NOT BE A SUCKER AND WASTE 60$ ON THIS GAME, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. DONT EXPECT TO PLAY ONLINE UNLESS ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS PLAY BECAUSE THIS GAME IS DEAD, MY PARK IS EMPTY. ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU WANT TO AVERAGE 8 TURNOVERS A GAME WITH YOUR MY PLAYER POINT GUARD.IF YOU TAKE ANYTHING FROM THIS REVIEW IT SHOULD BE DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!			"

												A review from the most despised guy on the 2k16 forum right now coming live and free of charge (no VC here) right to you:It's hard to actually find somewhere to start guys and gals because there is just so much wrong with this game. Maybe let's do it bit by bit:General:- good ol' VC is returning and damn it's good to have it back. I so missed flushing 50 bucks down the toilet for a game and then being charged for any and every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t item. The prices have gone up and are now really insane while how much you earn, even on HoF has actually gone down.- lack of technical support makes a return as well. Yeah like always the PC community is again the but of the joke because again we are desperately waiting for technical issues to be solved and are waiting and waiting and waiting. 4 weeks after the pre-release the PS4 patch is out for 2 weeks now and we still haven't seen♥♥♥♥♥♥or even been given a possible release date.- lack of support also makes a comeback. Yeah for a game that costs you 50 bucks or more you will actually have to wait  up to seven days to even get a random answer which does not relate to your problem at all and which, even when you press them, offers no help whatsoever because they either don't know or they aren't allowed to do anything.- commentary of the game cuts out like every quarter. It's unbearable.- there is a bug that displays players naked or makes the invisible. They are invisible yet they pass, dribble, shoot and score on your♥♥♥♥♥all day long.- 2k TV regulary crashes the game.- the audience is barely audible. During freethrows and timeouts it's basically like you are playing a pickup team on a farm in Iowa... no sound at all.- you have around 10-20 seconds before the actual timeout screen sets in allowing you to change settings and setups and you can not ever skip those 10-20 seconds. So have fun with that one especially when the stupid A.I. calls 2 timesouts back to back.- basically anything above Allstar Sim is getting close to unplayable because of all the incredible cheese the A.I. pulls off- defensive A.I. of opponent improved while the defensive A.I. of your team is absolute garbage in every situation- still too many animations in which your player gets sucked intoMyCareer:- hyped to no end because it's a Spike Lee Joint and because people were complaining about the player basically being chosen for you (background story and all) they produced a hillarious video in which they claim that you can ""be yourself"" and make your own story. I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on that one. You play a guy called Frequency Vibrations, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, nickname Freq. This is the name you will be referred to in game even though you have the option to name your player and the announcers will, at random times, call you by it. That no one thought to tell Spike Lee to ♥♥♥♥ off and that not even the actors themselves thought it is beyond stupid that anyone would call anybody Frequency Vibrations is just... well I can't find words for it. You are also forced to be African American because your family is black as is your twin sister and obviously everyone around you apart from some overhyped agent who speaks and acts like it's 1930's Chicago south side and an Asian girlfriend who seems only interested in your money. Yeah... you heard me.- you do not make any decisions in your career until you reach your second year in the NBA. Every cutscene is an overlong piece of film that you are forced to watch (some lasting 10 minutes easy) or skip. You choose no answers, you make no decisions and that stuff is so corny like someone actually tried to make a bad comedy out of ""He got game""- you get to play 3 games in Highschool which last all of 2 minutes per quarter in which you play against dwarfes ( I believe the tallest player might be Tracy McGrady's height and that guy plays center) while you stroll around in your up to 7'3 glory. What a joy. You can do everything, run fast as the wind, shoot threes and what not even though you are only rated 55. Once you get to college the real NBA stuff applies and unless you are buying VC (because guess what you don't earn any in Highschool and College) you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 55 rated player even though you are hailed as the next Madonna or some such.- your first NBA season is 8 games... with a 55 rated player unless you buy VC... yeah what fun. At the end you get to actually go into free agency even though you are a first round rookie so should have at least a 2 year contract plus 1-2 years team option. Oh yeah and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ end to the story happens.MyGM:- legacy issues like having to manually adjust every gameplan instead of the newest global gameplan being taken into account without having to delete the old specific gameplan for a team. broken player promises: even if you kiss the guys♥♥♥♥♥and do everything he asks you to, he will still return a day later and tell you that you screwed him over and lied to himn and doesn't like you anymore. Guys who put up 0,5 ppg in 1 minute of gametime will come to you asking for a starting spot etc.- no list for team names in relocation so you might end up with a team that has no name the announcers can pronounce- players still develope too fastOnline:- full of cheaters and yes I'm saying that even though I moderate a thread for the CE tables to this game. Funny enough the same♥♥♥♥♥♥as last year is still working and even more horrendous VC farming is possible. Now 2k swung the banhammer and guess what? Even though lots of people claim that they removed the cheaters, they actually only removed the guys who used VC glitches because of course it costs them actual money ;)Positive:- defensive A.I. seems improved- post game seems improvedEnd of story:As it is it's a pile of garbage. You want to know why? Check above... it's because the devs and producers were busier explaining♥♥♥♥♥♥that makes up 0,1% of the whole game in dope♥♥♥♥♥videos than actually improving last years installments. Buy 2k15 or even better... don't support 2k ever again.			"

												I really want to like this game but there's too many problems and when i bought this, i couldn't expect it'd be that bad.1. Spike Lee's my career story can only be described as utter trash.2. Crashes to desktop with no error. Almost everytime i finish a game in my career, the game will ctd with no error. This is not a problem of my computer, if you read other reviews you will notice that its actually a very common problem. Wtf 2K, fix your game before making a new one, you cashgrabbing monkeys! 3. Cutscene simulator. Seriously, i don't want to watch the cutscenes, i want to play the game.4. Microtransactions for my career.5. 2K clearly doesn't care about the negative feedback this game is getting and this is the most annoying thing. Seriously, just take a look around the forums and the reviews and you'll notice a plethora of people complaining about ctd's and bugs. Why do they expect us to buy the next game, if it's so hard for them to release some patches and fix their current game?Still, this game is the best NBA sim on the market and despite its flaws (which are too many) is quite fun, especially (when it doesn't crash) and when playing vs your friends.

												I guess Spike Lee thinks the only people that play this game are urban kids from Harlem. How annoying!!! The story mode is ridiculous. It's called ""Livin Da Dream"" for goodness sake. I understand that may appeal to a particular demographic, but I've been playing 2k for years and it seems I have to go to the ""hood"" and take some vernacular classes to know wtf my character is even saying. It is very frustrating and I figured it would be as soon as I learned Spike Lee was working on this. NOT EVERY NBA FAN IS A HOODLUM. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the fact that my family is black, but could there at least be an option to make them not say things like ""Man dis bout to get twisted, yo!"". Who really talks like that? ♥♥♥♥ing no one, Spike. Livin Da Dream????????? UGGGGHHHH. The actual basketball seems ok so far as long as you don't mind listening to what amounts to a cheesy episode of The Proud Family to get there. Or maybe more like Fat Albert. I wouldn't know becuase I've never watched either of those shows like Spike thinks. ♥♥♥♥ it's frustrating. Why can't I just be white!!!!!! Nobody in production ever said ""Hey Spike, what if someone that isn't black wants to play the game?""			"

												Overall the gameplay is much improved from NBA 2k15(which i put almost 600 hours into) between MYGM, and MyCareer modes. There are more animations and they feel smoother and more realistic. Dribbling and using the right stick to crossover and perform other moves is still very satisfying. The shot meter is back and feels the same helping you to guide shots into the net. Defense even has its own meter that shows how close to the defender you are and how much pressure you are producing on him.  There have been some small control changes since 2k15. Now the face buttons of the controller allow you to perform bounce passes, or lob passes alongside the standard pass. This helps you feel more in control and turn the ball over less. Centers and other big men down low feel more like you are playing their counter parts. Slow, not very good ball handling but big tall bruisers who use their size to their advantage. Defense has been slightly improved and shots are harder to make, as you are less likely to be wide open. This more realistically portrays FG % in the NBA and feels less cheesy online. Graphics are improved as well, with 2k adding in new body scans. Carmelo Anthony now looks substantially different than Lebron James. As mentioned before animations feel smoother and more realistic. I have experienced some crashing issues when in game and navigating menues. There are also some random glitches in game that detract from the overall experience. For example there is a new feature when your my player is subbed into the game.This feature shows the player you are currently guarding or being guarded by. It shows the players strengths and weaknesses. There is a problem that occurs randomly however when the players strengths/ weaknesses never appear and you are stuck looking at a semi frozen image of the player for 30 seconds. After playing last years version im sure the bugs will still be there months later(none are gamebreaking save for the infrequent crashes, just minor annoyances.)There is no ability to configure keyboard controls. 2k literally gave no thought to the PC gamer with this port. Crossfire is terrible but with my one AMD r9 270x i am getting 60 FPS with very little stuttering, so i am pleased with the optimization especially over last years version.There is a wide plethora of game modes in this years game, i have never dabbled in My team because i hate pay to win. But MYGM is fun and feels improved. The real reason i cannot recommend this game at full price is the changes to MYCareer and to be specific the changes directed by Spike Lee. Livin' Da Dream is a joke.You create a character like in past iterations of the gamemode however this time you dont get to choose a nickname because that persona has already been created for you. Spike Lee has dubbed your character Frequency Vibrations or Freq for short, sex toy or porn star either way the name is terrible. The story revolves around your character and his family, you are born into a african-american family with an african-american twin sister. If the story following all this was actually good and well written than maybe i could excuse my white character who looked totally out of place and confused as to why his mom had never told him who his real father was. Honestly its not a big deal, things like this have happened to other races and games in the past and i could get over it, the problem is the story is absolutely terrible. The story revolves around your friend VIctor Van Lier who is supossed to be a bad influence on you and you are warned multiple times by the team owner, your twin sister, and your characters girlfriend who comes out of nowhere sometime in college.   You dont get to make any choices about how your story unfolds besides the choice of High schools (1 of 3) and choice of colleges (1 of 9). The story is so melodramatic, people arguing over your image or multiple refrences to friends and family using you as a meal ticket. Choices of team do not affect the story any. Minor details like your characters celebratory dance ""freaking and vibin"" as well as interviews of family and friends during the cutscenes do nothing to add anything to the terribly written farse that is Livin' Da Dream.  Spike Lee seems to believe that people from Harlem have the same terrible vernacular that he embodys in his titles. This terrible story mode takes away your rookie season as well, which is something that 2k really seems to enjoy in MYCareer the last two years. You get to play 3 Highschool games where your character is truly OP and 4 college games but not earn any VC for them as well as not be able to change the game lengths. Your character than is forced to be a one and done player and go to the NBA draft with an overall rating of 55, which is terrible. You are heralded as a top 10 draft pick, i went number 7 but the other players selected around that time are 77-78. By design 2k makes you either a terrible player or have to open your wallet just to keep up. Your rookie season is only 8 games (instead of the 82 in a real NBA season) with Spike Lee's terrible 20 minute cutscenes in between. Also you can change the Freq nickname after your rookie season but for some reason announcers/ pre game show will still sometimes refer to you as Freq. After your rookie season MyCareer returns to its roots allowing you to play any games along the season you would like while also introducing a new days off feature and allowing you to select whether or not to go to a ""Live practice"" or hang out with teamates/fellow Nba players or go do endorsement deals. This is where MyCareer should have started. ""Live Practices are fun and really the draw in this mode is building a character and watching his career progress rather than slated cutscenes of melodrama.  Somewhere along the way this mode lost all its basing in realisim as well because after your first season the team owner realeases you to go into Free Agency where you can choose three teams that have varying levels of interest in your sevices and negotiate Money and minutes. I think Spike Lee tries to rationalize it with your friend Victor causing you to get fired. Honestly though has anyone ever heard of a top 10 pick being dropped because of a friends actions? Spike Lee just took the easy way out as he did with most of the other parts of this mode. Tldr: Really i cant recommend the game even though gameplay is so much better and graphics improved because of how much the Mycarrer mode has declined. I still find ways to enjoy the game, but get it on deal since this is turning into a yearly cash cow akin to EA's.			"

												NBA 2k16 has incredible graphics, gameplay is generally very smooth, and server performance is vastly improved from recent years.  However, there are an insane amount of small issues that add up and these have all been here since release, that makes gameplay very frustrating.  Many features are incomplete, or just dont work.  Directional passing for example, there is no way to pass to a player behind another player without manually selecting that player and allowing the defense time to react.  every second counts in basketball.  VIP Stats (their online stats program) shows in depth tendencies and stats about the opponent you play at the loading screen, but there is no way to see any stats besides PPG and Win/Loss for your own profile, when they obviously have the information available to them. Whenever a stoppage of play occurs there is a period of time where you are stuck just watching a cutscene, no matter how badly you want to skip, you cannot.  This happens at literally every single stoppage of play, and for me is the most infuriating part of the game when I am trying to play a fast paced game.Play Now Online allows players to choose their own jersey before they match up with another player, so if a player chooses a white home jersey before they match up with me, gets the Away team, and then doesnt change their jersey I will have no idea that he is using a white jersey instead of what should be a colored jersey since he is the Away team.  This means both teams in game have nearly identical jerseys and the game is so frustrating to play when you have to really stare to see who is on which team in transition.MyGM and MyLeague have a multitude of options, but lack very basic NBA rules such as the veterans minimum, and protected picks, the latter completely destroying any hopes of a MyGM or MyLeague with the Lakers without cheating and force trading their top 3 pick.   You can sign Steve Nash for 725k or so but in real life he cannot be paid less than $1.49m if he were to sign a contractAt times gameplay AI seems random, for example there seems to be a 50% chance that on a transisition you pass the ball to your teammate he will either stand still and catch it or keep running and theres no way to know what will happen.  On offense the AI actually sometimes feels like it is rigged against you, with your players playing either unrealisticly or flat out refusing to obey controller commands.   Example:  shooters that have a wide open 3 go inside the line and when I try to get them to go behind the line (and this has happened many times for me), they literally just wont go behind the line I dont get it. Defensive AI feels the same way.  Double team is set to manual but they still decide to leave their 3pt shooter wide open to double team someone who doesnt need to be double teamed, and wasnt told to double team2K puts no effort in updating hairstyles of players, with the majority of players having the same hair they had in summer 2015 when they got scanned, and there have been lots of changes during the season.  Allen Crabbe is one example thats not even close to real life anymoreMyCareer is terrible the first season is garbage the High School and College experience comes off as annoying and tedious since none of it matters at all there is no story that changes its the same thing every time, so after youve made your first player its just annoying to go thru it all over again to get to NBA.Cannot stress how bad MyCareer is we were told that we were going to Be The Story, and that couldnt be farther from the truth.  Its Freq's Career by Spike Lee for the entire first season, you only get to play 8 rookie games!!Every single game of Online play you will have to change your settings, they just do not save and there is no way to get them to default to something else.  This functionality does not work and has not worked for years.  It even changes the camera angle so if you dont get the first possession you have to play in Broadcast mode until you get the ball. In MyGM, MyLeague, and MyCareer, your gameplay settings (length, difficulty, sliders) all have to be set every single time you make a new franchise/career no matter what the default settings are.  The default settings seem to only make a difference in Play Now offline. Getting locked in animations.  Just ridiculous there are so many long animations in this game ESPECIALLY after scoring a bucket and celebrating your opponent can run the ball up court while you watch your player dancing and celebrating in the backcourt.   Just terrible.  Awful.   My controller actions are not suggestions they are commandsIf your controller gets disconnected during online play, you cannot reconnect it under any circumstances and have to restart 2k in order to be able to play it further.  This will always result in a loss unless its late in the game and you have a comfortable lead and waste the clock playing with your keyboard.  But idk even 1 control for thatMyCareer doesnt allow Draft classes.  cant think of any reason to not include this.  It also doesnt allow GM sliders so the trades and Free agency are unrealistic in MyCareer modeOverall this is a very good basketball game, but the tiny problems make it infuritating to playAs we unfortunately have to ask every single year in the 2k community, PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME			"

												I was so excited that they got a director to do the My Career this year, i saw it was Spike Lee.I just have to say that the My Career storyline was a good effort but sucked either way. Its like watching a cheap drama indie film. Ok so this review is more about the My Career mode so lets see some pros and cons.Pros- 1) Cinematic Experience  2) Tiny bit of character development 3) Engaging start ( the highschool-college thing was great and authentic)Cons- 1) If you aint black you will find it weird since you are born in a black family with a black twin. Now  thats not a huge problem but it destroyes the beliveabilty of the game and the connection you feel with the player.2) The bugs/crashes and VC missing have been fixed but still its not excusable for a big company to make such mistakes while asking for full price.Do not buy the game yet. Wait for a patch and even then give it a second thought			"

												Best basketball sim on the market... but mainly because NBA Live sucks that much. NBA 2k16 gets revised controls, slightly better graphics, and a new story mode. If you've played an NBA 2k game in the past you know what you're getting into. Sadly, this includes a lot of the AI frustrations you come to expect. Instead of playing intelligent AI the way 2k  ramp up difficulty is making you miss dunks, layups and making the computer intercept passes like crazy. Tough to recommend due to the poor AI, but then again what choice do you have as a basketball gamer? Also, who wants to see all those useless inbounding and timeout animations? Everyone is just tapping A like crazy to try and skip it... Also where is the ability to save different GM files? The new story mode has such a long and boring beginning it's hard to get into as well. Maybe I'm just being old and grumpy, but the 2K series is getting too cinematic for its own good. How about 2K focus on making the core basketball gameplay better and get rid of the fluff.			"

												Preface this: Been buying and playing NBA2K since the beginning... And 5 years straight on Steam. I put in hundreds of hours each year. I love NBA2k. But......This is the worst one. Ever. That's really all I can say. I really don't want to go back to NBA Live (hey that was the only option back in the day) but this PC launch is rough. Buggy. The menus werent ported, no proper key binding, a painfully awkward career mode where my bench player is a superstar... The awkward key assignments... ...How do you manage to actually REMOVE menu options from one year to the next? ...And I have to ask... wtf is that intro movie with the cartoon characters? Outsource your intro? I love NBA2K, but this is sad. I was so pumped at the prospect of playing highschool, college then going pro... but this untested, unoptimized, poorly ported mess is the most dissapointing basketball game I've played in a decade... And that makes me really sad... Patch this 2K. In the meantime I'm going to go checkout your competition because clearly the PC market isn't worth your time.			"

												so I play the 2k series since nba2k8.I say this first before i'll write my review, i keep playing this game most likely.So i start with the Pro's first-Great Graphics, awesome faces etc-mycareer,myleague,mygm and myteam are nice and well done-it runs very smoothly on my rigso cons, well where do i start ?Lets just start with animations, while animations on its own are sick and look awesome, Ingame they are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥You'll get stuck in movements you don't press. while my PG is a 89Rating, he seems to forget sometimes how to dribble(which is weird with playmaking above average). Passing is pretty easy, but sometimes the players are getting into a movement right before you pass, those passes fly anywhere but not to a teammate( it seems to me this happens because the game has overall big problems with input lag). Input lag is annoying af, i tested it now on several configurations and two different rigs, as well 4 different controllers. Its always there and always affecting things on court.If you're an attacking pg, this game hates you then, while you drive to the basket and have a path like moses, everybody on the opponent team will catch you( not matter how fast you are)i witnessed it a lot that a sf or sg just kinda teleported to me and blocked me, while i was getting stucked in some weird layup animation i did not choose(i have the steph curry layup pack, which rarely applies). Big no go is also defense. Enemy Teams always defend like pros (which is actually nice and challanging)BUT your Team defend like a new born child, this is especially in mycareer annoying. Im sure that withour those animation stucks and rigged scores this game would make actually a lot of fun, ofc the input lag should be fixed(this seems like its pc only, as i watched many youtubers and streamers and they never really had it)one thing to the mycareer, while i like the idea its poorly made! hey they got spike lee and some actors WoW! the story is boringand never really interesting, also never really a surpise whats happening( besides the talk that im a superstar when i only play 12 min per game(12min qtr). its way to short as well.so this game seems to be only for addicted nba dudes like me, new guys wont like it. the controlls are way do difficult. and no help for new guys when they start a career or do something else, they have to search for help(yeah i know tutorials are boring but for new players in this type of a game, needed badly)my final conclusion is:if you love the nba and the nba2k series you most probably already have it, if not you may pass on, on this one.its way better then nba live(which tbh is not very hard)but since they got ""next gen"" it did get more and more a type of game that looks and plays awesome for the first 2 weeks, but if u know more of it and understand everything it starts to fall apart. i have also a lot more i could go on about but those things are in the series forever so i do not believe they fix it ever.ps i forgot about mypark:mypark is kinda fun but on pc their're a lot of cheated players (99ovr) which are mostly pretty bad but a lot of 2v2 groups are out there cheating their ways to the top. Also a lot of ballhogs and wannabe kobes,lebrons,kds,mjs. "

												Not until the bugs are settled. It's strange how other games play perfectly with no need to fiddle with the video settings , while 2k is beyond a mess. The breif moment I was able to play the game with sound was great. Pretty much binged played MyCareer. The story was a bit much , but it was pretty fun when the game worked (that one time). Ever since I had to update / uninstall anything to see if this game would work like it did before. 2k release a patch please!!			"

												I have played almost every NBA 2K game thats been sold, but this year I can't even bring myself to play against this year's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cheating AI, ♥♥♥♥ so annoying being up 10 and suddenly your defense just stops defending or you stop making open shots, while they drain contested up the♥♥♥♥♥3's. This year is not simulation AT ALL, this year the AI will handicap you to make the game play the way they want, pretty much scripted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it doesn't matter how well your rotations are or how good you are at shot releases, made and missed buckets are based on some kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t momentum system, its simply impossible to score 2 jumpshots in a row even with the likes of Curry.Before anyone questions my skill lvl, I've reached GOAT league on online play like it was nothing with 100-20 record, and msot of those losses came from invisible players or early in the game, I know how to use freelance and zone defense to shut down the paint or perimeter, but none of that♥♥♥♥♥♥works against the CPU, it doesn't matter how good you are on your rotations in defense and if you have your hand in their face, they will make the shot if they haven't made, say their last 2-3 shots, complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this year, and completely unplayable for me, which is why I've stuck to online play for a while until there is a patch to fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This is my review of NBA 2k16(aka Skinner Box Simulator 2k16). I think NBA 2k is consistently the only worthwhile basketball title every year.  I love it mostly. But I was unable to even connect to this offerings server. It also follows a sad precedent that appears to be taking hold in the video game industry, especially in the regurgitated yearly sports titles. I named myself B F Skinner and wanted to get online in 2k almost as a ironic statement of protest, but wasn't able to. Back in the days, a guy named BF Skinner put hamsters in a box and studied their reward response through a small lever and a treat that was dropped upon pressing it. He figured out that when they press it and instantly receive said reward, they will eat the treat and lie down. But when the reward was randomly dropped they would continuously press the button to exhaustion. This is the basic underlying element of MyTeam. If you don't believe it, watch any of the pack openings on internet video sites. What you are witnessing is the highs and lows which stimulates the brains chemical response mechanisms. When the user taps the button(buying packs) he will repeatedly get cards he doesn't like leading to depression/frustration. When a gold/whatever other stupid color special card drops, they jump all over the place with glee, brains flooding with endorphines. This is troubling if one understands the mechanisms which are involved, considering real money is being spent. Seems to closely resemble the same involvement of drug abusers and their crack of choice. If doubles where eliminated, or if VC was more readily attainable, I guess it would seem more acceptable. It also seems to be marketed directly to minorities, which is another thing that may or may not be okay to you. I have also seen that when one shows a willingness to spend money, your myteam players seem to perform worse then they should. I can recall in 2k15, getting Steph Curry(Mr three ball cheese) and lighting it up with glee. All of a sudden he's hitting 2-30. Same with KD. etc etc. ""Gotta get more packs,,,, Next one is Mike,,, 50 dollars,,, just one more,, awww kostas kodsafjiosdfjioasdg? Emerald Dirty Ballscamp??? Double, double, double,  C'mon!"" <-- sound familiar? You've been gamed, boys and gals. Next time you needs a sammich, think of all the gold cards you can't sell. This may or may not be okay to write, as I'm sure this is not the info that peeps want you to hear. Could possibly get the business for sharing it. But they don't teach B F Skinner usually. I'm sure some may know, but it feels wrong when others are fleeced for their dollar and coin. Buy a game with some integrity, which actually has value, made by people interested in putting out a quality product. People who value your business, and respect your intelligence. Less taking selfies with millionaire b-ballers, less cute spokesmodels, less ""oh snap, a penny!"" <lunges to the floor to grab>. More community support, more involvement in production, more beta testing, more originality. An added bonus would be to consider the fact that the people you are taking money from are human, and may or may not be able to afford your digital heroin. Just my two cents. Honestly, I loved this game for years. Just feels so wrong on so many levels. My recommendation, skip it until they decide to make changes. This is the only way change happens. You keep forking over your dollars, it will keep getting worse.  "

												There are mixed reviews for this game, but now that it's on sale (as of Mar 16), I feel obligated to leave a review for those who may be thinking of buying. Ultimately, if you love the game of basketball, you should get this game right now. Notes on MyCAREER:- There are a &#$^ ton of people giving it negative reviews solely because of the subpar MyCAREER story, but if you can look past that it's still a solid basketball game. - highschool + college years are really fun albeit short- your MyCAREER players all share the SAME appearance that you define in the myPlayer menu, so you can change it at will if you wish (differs in height depending on your position)- You can keep playing with your MyCAREER player after you finish the main story, and even use your player for MyPARKNotes on MyPARK: - If you're planning on playing this mode, I have found from personal experience that the Sunset Ballers is the most populated with more active players.- You do NOT need to spend money on VC to be able to play well - Sometimes you'll come across players who won't play with you or drop out when you enter a court queue because you have a low rating -- don't let this discourage you just keep looking and you'll find some nice players who will play :)- Not sure if this is the case for everyone, but there is a tiny button delay; just be aware of it --  Also if you find that your controller disconnects when you enter a game, try restarting your game in Steam Big Picture modeMyGM: - Many sliders and options to pla around with to manipulate your team's playstyle- Enough control- Stat-heavy if you're into that9.5/10			"

												Carrer mode is awful. Seriously, Spike Lee made everything worst, the story is total bs and full of cliché. I've skipped half of film sequences because I really had enough of that ♥♥♥♥. It's boring, and stupid, and useless. And it's strictly scripted. It's a movie and has nothing to do with a videogame. F%uck  Spike Lee.Gameplay has worsened, shooting is inexplicably harder (even if the player is alone) and passing is inaccurate (half of the time it will launch the ball across the court when you were looking for the guy near to you).

												The MyCareer gets boring at times and its the only game mode that I really like.It left the immersive side of 2k15:-no more interviews after the game (at least for your player)-no more talking with your teammates other than practice with them which is not really that immersive-the introduction of all-stars is still not enough for you to get hype of (I mean come on its the weekend!)-I can't see the social media even if you can edit your social ID (you can't view the reactions of your fans)-the connections are boring (I expected cutscenes but was disappointed)-the free agency is boring without interaction from your agent-no more cutscenes from free agency-the team manager is also non-existing after the first season-you don't even have the time to visit your family on summer-no summer camps which is really really important to add immersion for the next seasonI mean they added the wishlists from last year such as the jersey pick and such but they removed the other immersive stuffs like WTF? If they just invest their time on expanding the story rather than hiring Spike Lee to do a short and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ movie that would be great.			"

												If you have 2K15, don't buy this at all. Whatever mode you want to play, 2K15 is better.The gameplay is worse this year, and sticky defense comes back with a vengence. You can't even take 5 steps without the defense bodying you up.Worse than that, turbo is broken. Players who are slower are catching faster players regardless of attributes, and everyone can defend like Scottie Pippen 1v1, regardless of attributes. Not a fun experience.MyCareer sucks badly. I got tricked into buying the game because of the so called story, but there isn't one. It's the same  damn thing as 2K15. Essentially your entire rookie season is condensed into a cutscene where you watch stuff happens, stuff that you won't ever do. Also, no more custom nicknames, you're stuck with Freq. Forever.Online takes the cake, though. Cheaters are rampant, and the people who ends up banned are the ones like me, people who accidentally discover bugs in the game and report them. I got banned for simming games, trying to upgrade my MC.PC support sucks. XBone and PS4 already got patch 2, and not even a mention of PC.Don't buy it. Don't even accept it as a gift. If you get it as a gift, trade it in for store credit and go buy a decent game instead. Fallout 4 looks to be decent, grab that.			"

												To add-on to many of the other reviews.  The whole ""Livin Da Dream""  Is a complete waste.  While some aspects are nice, I.E free agency and player interactions after year one.  All in all not worth the time.  People want to play ""themselves"" not You cookie cutter version of what a nba phenom should be.  Gameplay is ok, player movements are still clunky to say the least but its the best out.  One thing that is still frusterating but will not change is the pay to win approach.  Gone are the days were you played games and practiced to improve and build your character.  I would be lying if it didnt feel like the certian ""speed bumps"" in gameplay werent introduced to nudge you towards spending more.  Servers have always been an issue with online play, so wont beat that dead horse.  My franchise is fun but again, C.R.E.A.M.  money = wins.  Hope this helps.  Dont get me wrong NBA2k is the best basketball game out right now...and the only one so.			"

												I really wanted to like this game but it's just not fun. 2k forgot that it's a game, myplayer is rubbish, the story detracts from the experience I was hoping for. You have a choice of where you go to college but thats it and after the rookie nba season (8 games) you have a few vc to spend on attributes to go from useless to still useless. Effectively you start the game with a skill level that would not get you signed with any pro team in any league anywhere in the world, let alone the nba. You're to slow, cant pass, can't shoot and can't play D. The controls feel sluggish compared to 2k15. It might become fun sometime but I don't think I'm willing to put the ""work"" in because unlike previous games it's not enjoyable. Back to 2k15 for me.			"

												Mycareer mode story is not even close to as imersive or nice as 2k15. You can select a nickname after your first season, but you will still be called Freq. The story has no choices until second season of pro, at which the game is the same choices as 2k15. The main character is likeable, but most of the side characters are not. Your best friend is an unlikeable jerk, your manager a stereotype, the owner is the devil, your twin sister and parents may or may not match your skin color(honestly those characters are cool), and the girlfriend is kinda just there. The Mycareer mode now has game days and offdays, which is a nice change added to break up games. The new way to get upgrades by consistently going to practice on off days is also nice. You can also see upcoming endorcement offer to plan accordingly. All in all improvement from 2k15. This is also the only not online gamemode I have played.The online is full of blantent hackers who get away with murder. If you want to fight them legit, be prepared to farm all the badges and atribute points you can. They seem to not be doing anything to stem the flow of hackers. I had personal issue with their customer support taking forever to reply and giving me the run around, until eventually saying they can't do anything. At least the courts are nice to look at. Between the Rough Riders, Flyers, and Ballers, only the ballers court seems to stay full.Gets 6/10 for Bad online and mediocre story, but extra points for trying to improve. Do not buy on PC if you plan on playing legitly online. If you plan on playing by hacking, please unplug you computer and walk away.			"

If you are interested in only playing modes such as MyGM then go ahead and buy it, but if you are interested in playing online I would reccomend getting this game on a console.			"

												This game is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ Seriously, it is one of the most frustrating experiences I have ever had the displeasure to have. The controls are completely unresponsive, as in you just can't dribble the ball to the direction you want to go. Almost every time you try to change direction or a crossover move, not only does it take more than 1 second for your player to respond, you're either gonna bounce the ball off of the defender or he's just gonna stop you and you'll be stuck in a stupid animation where even if you're pressing to go forward the controlled player is just going to stop. 9 times out of 10 you're unable to get by the defender. I've had situations where I had Russell Westbrook with the ball and I couldn't drive by Jose Calderon. Yes, Russell Westbrook can't get by Jose ♥♥♥♥ing Calderon in this game. Now, I've been playing basketball simulation games since NBA Live 07 and NBA 2K8. I'd like to think myself as a decent player. In NBA 2K16, however, no matter your skill you are going to have a bad time scoring.And defense. Don't even get me started on defense. You'd think you would be able to defend the AI, since it can lock you down no matter what. But, of course, that's not the case. Unresponsive is the defining word of this game. It only takes one change of direction, one little crossover for the AI to get by you. Seriously, your controlled player takes around 3 seconds to change direction, so you just get left behind almost every time in defense. The AI just effortlessly gets by you.The AI is terrible, and in MyPlayer your teammates' AI is even worse. They often pass the ball to you at the worst time, lose the ball in a stupid way or try to do a tough fadeaway shot when they're being guarded by 3 defenders while you and the rest of your team is wide open. They NEVER box out, and there are times where you literally have to guard everyone in the court only to see your teammates allow an offensive rebound and easy score for the opposing team.The game forces you into the worst animations possible, making you miss the easiest shots possible.I could go on about the terrible Spike Lee story and dozens of other issues, but you got the picture. This game sucks. Don't waste your money on it. ♥♥♥♥ 2K Sports.			"

												Supposedly one of the greatest sports game in history is actually one of the most bs games in 2k history. Controls are all changed from what everyone is used to. The pick and rolls are now even harder to perform as the center or power forward takes a while to get into position or sets a screen for only a miniscule of a second. Shooting is disgusting because even the tiniest bit shy off of a perfect release or over would result in a miss, even in a situation where it's the most wide open shot. Passing is the same as usual, you try to pass to one guy but will pass to someone all the way across the court. Zig zag cheese is not gone as the CPU now zig zags you into their picks. In conclusion, the new mechanics of the game is what is actually ruining the gameplay and improvement was mainly focused on the different modes rather than gameplay itself.			"

												First and foremost: They gameplay is awesome and anyone who loves basketball will love NBA 2K16.So why would I NOT recommend this game?Publisher 2K simply doesn't care about its community enough. The MyTeam Domination mode is not working for pc players for about 2 weeks now because of a problem on 2K's side. There is 0 information on if or when it is going to be fixed. 2K won't even admit publicly that there is a problem in the first place. The support team is unable (or unwilling) to help and the community management absolutely fails to communicate with the player base. And that's only the icing on the cake. Since the beginning, there are a lot of cases of players losing their MyCareer character because of a corrupted safe file and not getting any compensation even if they bought their VC with real money or heavy lag online which basically persists since NBA2K13.So sadly I can absolutely not recommend NBA 2K16 even though it is an incredibly fun game simply because 2K gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about its playerbase.

I'm writing this on the official release day of 9/29/2015 and STILL have no bonus content. Has anyone who preordered this got their bonus content? If so, how?PC optimization is also bad, I have a GTX 970M that can run Witcher III on medium ~40-50fps, I can't run this mess on medium everything without stutter that's killing my eyesGameplay-wise the dribbling feels much better, more fluid and elusive. The quick substitution feature is weird. Why is MyCareer so strange this year? It seems like you can't make any off-court choices that influence the cutscenes!! The story has no impact to me not only because I'm not from Harlem but also because developements just seem to appear from nowhere!! When did I get a girlfriend? Why is my best friend such a bum? When did I pay my lawyers to bail out my bum friend? WHY IS THE ROOKIE SEASON ONLY 8 GAMES LONG??? Why is myPlayer only rated 55 but is a top ten draft pick???Overall I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it until they fix the optimization.			"

Don't buy this game !First off, this game is buggy as hell and poorly optimized for PC but that isn't even why you should't buy this game... You shouldn't buy it because after hours of playing, you will get hit with an awesome bug that won't allow you to connect to some 2k servers and you'll lose all your saves. And reinstalling the game won't do it. Checking the game cache integrity won't work either. And don't lose your time trying to contact 2k support as it is inexistant... I would advise you to buy a game that isn't as buggy and unfinished. It shouldn't be too hard to find a game less buggy than this one ;-)			"

All the crappy things you were hoping they would fix, well, they didn't.The whole Spike Lee movie thing gets boring very, very, very fast and the lines and scenes are embarrassing at best.

Playing defense is pointless at times, especially when you are above at the scoreboard and the opponent starts scoring like crazy when the game moves to its end. You can't drive to the basket without getting blocked. Centers make stupid moves at the post, just to get blocked.Games almost never irritate me, though this game never failis to make me mad every time I play.And this started last year. Up to 2k14, there were never issues like these.Moreover, the multiplayer is useless, as there is so much lag you have to completely readjust your gameplay.			"

Do not buy if you only play MyCareerComing from a longtime 2K Sports fan, I have mixed feelings on this entry of NBA2K. However, just because I have it not recommended I suggest you read the entire review to see if you would like it.I am not going to get into day one issues like crashes, bugs, and server issues because frankly basing a review off that this early before they can fix things is stupid. But there are issues I PERSONALLY have with the game. But I'll say a few things this game offers over 2K15 first.ProsImproved animations definitely.Finally readded create-a-team for MyGM, MyLeague, MyTeam, and other online modes. (And its actually really good)Tattoos are freaking amazing and you can place them all over your body.These were a few off the top of my head I was pleased with.The IssueHowever, as I mentioned before I had a huge gripe with this game. In my personal opinion they seem to have taken a step back when it comes to MyCareer. Others apperently like it but I was extremely disappointed by the fact the ""story"" was stereotypical, thoughtless and not enjoyable. I expected more from Spike Lee & 2K. So with giving us an actual story (if you want to call it that) they severely limited how we can play. This isn't OUR story. It is Freq's story. Yes the protagonist has a name and even if you had a simple name like Joe Johnson they will still say Freq regardless. You do not have a choice to be called something else like in previous MyCareers (my personal choice was ""Silky"" Johnson) If you want to play a white, asian, hispanic or really any race that isn't black you have to suspend your disbelief that your family is black and you are not. To make matters worse you have a fraternal twin sister so you really cant think your mom cheated on your dad either. You can't win Rookie of the Year because you can only play a few games in your rookie season. The ""story"" is insanely short, badly written, predictable, pointless and a waste of time. They took away more of our choices and options so they could waste our time with that?You may be saying, but wait! Didn't they let you play through high school and college? That sounds fun. At first yes it was interesting to just destroy the high school competition and finally see some college basketball, but its exactly the same as a normal game just reskinned. You only play a few games of high school and a few of college then you get drafted. And after a handful of years MyCareer has been out, THEY STILL HAVENT ADDED A REACTIVE DRAFT. Meaning if you get drafted first, guess what? The Timberwolves get two number one picks. You and Karl Anthony-Towns. So the draft is basically pointless because it's always the same even though you are in it no matter what your position is. Sucks for you if you play PF and you get drafted first because you're gonna share minutes with a guy who shouldn't even be on the team. Teams won't draft based on needs either apparently, in fact its hard to say for sure what they'll draft on. But if you're a center for example expect Detroit, Utah, Sactown, and Orlando to want to draft you even if they have a franchise center because why not. Same for playing any other position, they will draft you regardless. They should have just placed the MyGM/MyFranchise draft AI into MyCareer so we could get SOME chance of being surprised even if they arent that great as well.Once the story ends, its basically MyCareer as last year.I feel so ashamed of 2K and Spike to have made this game mode such a huge selling point of the game. If you are considering getting the game because of MyCareer, do not get the game.If you don't care about MyCareerThe other gamemodes are solid, if you can can see past the cheesers, hackers, etc in online modes you'll have a lot of fun in ProAm, MyTeam and other game modes. Personally I play mostly MyLeague/MyGM and I enjoy it throughly even though I was hyped to play MyCareer. The relocation aspect of MyLeague/GM was sorely needed in previous entries and they finally added it and its actually good and not bare bones. You can upload images to use as the team's logo, court logo, advertisements, arena name. You can edit the court exactly how you want it, all black if you want to. You can also do this in online modes, create your own team and court which is what it needed. The animations are fluid and smooth. They changed the passing mechanics a bit and a few of the controls so it's an adjustment. Still slightly disappointed that 2K still hasnt revamped the draft prospect aspect of League/GM because its still extremely generic. They could at least pull a Madden and give the prospects a storyline and allow us to actually grow attached or get hyped for a prospect. I was also going to say they could give the random generated prospects faces but they still use the team jersey portraits (say if you trade Damian Lillard it changes from showing his real life counterpart to some nasty ultra low settings doppelganger) so there goes that. Overall however, aside from MyCareer its what you can expect from a yearly sports game release.			"

												Really disappointed in the MyCareer mode, which is the only mode I played in this and 2k15.  It is a huge regression from last year for a number of reasons due to the way the story was put in place.  The biggest issues:1)  In your rookie NBA season, you only play 8 games.  After those 8 games, you move on to your sophomore season where you can then play a full 82 game season.  At this point, the game has sent players all over the place in free agency, so the teams are totally different than what they will be this season.  So for instance, I cannot play more than 8 games without Tim Duncan retiring.2)  The story is really stupid and feels forced upon you.  ""The team isn't sure about signing you because you are friends with Vic.""  Are you kidding?  And no matter how well you play, you get this way over-dramatic storyline that detracts from simply being a rookie trying to make it in the NBA.3)  There just simply isn't enough content in this game that responds to how you play in your games.  There were plenty of cut scenes in 2k15 that would cater to your performance.  For instance, the coach would call you in and congratulate you for your rebounding effort or how you distribute the ball to your teammates.  In this game I haven't seen any of that (though maybe I just haven't played long enough to see it).  All of the cut scenes in 2k16 play out just like a movie (a downright terrible one).  I play games for an immersive, interactive experience where my play affects the outcome.  This game is not that at all.			"

It worked for 2 weeks, and was a great game. However an update caused the game to crash and be unplayable, and invisible players. The latest patch fixed the crash, but invisible players still there.

												Don't buy this game in its current state, it is ♥♥♥♥ing broken. I haven't had to deal with such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t since BF4. This game has a cliched story to go along with MyCareer from a mediocre at best director, Spike Lee. The story is the polar opposite of what MyCareer is suppose to be; its not your ♥♥♥♥ing story. They should change their slogan from ""Be The Story"" to ""Be Spike Lee's Slave"". The gameplay isn't bad, but it is definitely rage inducing at times. The defenders stick to you like glue, then you can't guard for♥♥♥♥♥♥ Your teammates are ♥♥♥♥ing useless, they just stand there and when they get the ball they can't make a damn shot. It seems like no matter if you play the Sixers or Cavs the other team is just made up of juggernauts. If you play MyCareer, you're teammates are ballhogs who can't shoot or defend, and in MyTeam you entire team is just♥♥♥♥♥ The gameplay throughout all gamemodes is obvioulsy scripted, but the worst part about all of this is just how much 2K doesn't care. They took the money and ran, but what's new? An American company butt♥♥♥♥s the consumers again, what a surprise. Getting caught up in the hype, I preordered the damn game thinking it will be different this time, I was wrong. I normally wouldn't preorder a game, after this game I am staying true to that. If 2K would just patch the game(it would be quite a large patch) everything would be good because that means that they are finally listening to the consumer, something that is rarely done nowadays. Save your money, do not invest.TLDR; The game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ don't buy it.***I WILL UPDATE IF ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE MADE***			"

												Every year, basketball games like to brag about how much smoother and more fluid the game is. I think this is the first time it was very clear that a lot of things did improve. This is quite honestly the best basketball video game I have ever played.I haven't run into many performance issues, and the game runs much smoother for me at even higher settings than 2K15. Your mileage may vary, though. This game was designed with a controller, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a keyboard. The pro stick (RS) is essential to playing this game, and keyboards just won't offer you the same level of control.Most of the game modes in this year's game are pretty much similar to last year, but with more meat. In MyGM and MyLeague You can now relocate your team if you wish, and your owner can now give more dynamic goals (in GM). Also, AI logic is heavily improved and makes building a perfect team much more challenging, if not impossible. MyLeague also now has an online mode where you can play a League with your friends, similar to The Association Online from a few years back. MyTeam, along with the game modes present in the previous year, also has a new game mode called the Gauntlet, which is a 3 vs. 3 game against other MyTeams.The game now also has more online features than ever. MyPark makes a return from last year, which is pretty much the same, but now you also have a customizable MyCourt where you can invite your friends to play on. There is also the 2K Pro-Am mode which is similar to the Jordan Rec Center in the previous game, but not hidden behind the MyPark system. It also has a proper matchmaking system, which makes it much easier to get 10 people from around the world to get together to play a full 5-on-5 game. There is also Play Now Online which is basically a ranked online game mode where you can advance through different ""leagues"" which represent your skill level. Pretty similar to most other games' ranked matchmaking modes.MyCareer is in a weird place, where the game actually have already built a whole backstory for your created player. It has some weird quirks as I created a white player living in an African-American town, with African-American parents and an African-American twin sister. That takes the immersion out of the game mode a little. However, it is interesting in the way that you get to experience a custom curated story, unlike previous years where you're mostly just playing to increase your stats. You also now play through high school and college, which makes for an interesting experience, instead of just being thrown straight into the league.The presentation is also much improved. The menu interface is much slicker and more accessible than 2K15. The actual game also now has pre-show, halftime and post-game shows featuring Shaq, Ernie Johnson and Kenny Smith. The voice of the third commentator (replacing Steve Kerr) is awesome. There are also lots of player interviews which helps the atmosphere that you're watching a live TV broadcast. There are 50(!) in-game songs that make up the soundtrack which almost guarantees that you won't get tired of the playlist. Genres range from the standard rap/hip-hop to rock to pop and even some Spanish and one Korean song.And those are all great, but the best feature this game has is really how much better the actual basketball game is. Drives feel much smoother and traffic congestion within the paint is now no longer a problem if you run proper plays.  Defense is also much smoother and as a defender, I haven't found myself being left behind by the ball handler unless I make an actual mental error. The controls have changed, and there are now 3 pass buttons (seriously?), but the post trigger (LT) is a great idea and if you get used to the new controls, it actually feels more natural than the previous games. And of course, learn how to use the pro stick for best results.I'm sure if I play more hours of the game, I'll start to notice some annoying quirks. However, 5 hours and counting with the game and I can say that this is the most fun I have with a basketball video game. Even when you're losing, you're still having fun because the game doesn't feel like it's forcing invisible walls for you to get through.If you're interested in basketball, and you haven't played a basketball video game in a while, NBA 2K16 is the one to play.

												Honestly, I don't understand why people are complaining about this game. This game is EXCELENT (apart from the Spike Lee Story mode smh). The gameplay is one of the best and I'm a 2k player since 2K10. It is balanced very well, I love it. The negative reviews probably come from the bad myCareer story, but once you get past that story, it becomes a normal MyCareer mode again. I really love the online modes (MyPark, ProAm, MyTeam, etc) so I had to buy this game, and I'm glad I didn't listen to the bad reviews on steam, because the game is excellent, it's running on 60+fps, having no problems. Maybe the bad reviews came after Update 1 and Update 2 (they fixed alot of bugs). If you love BASKETBALL and GAMING, 100% this game is for you. "

												Crap game to be honest. It seems like every year they are taking away features that are essential for this type of a game. Let's talk about MyCareer. Older NBA games such as NBA 2K13 had the interviews after each game. That was pretty fun and enjoyable, since the questions changed according to the way you played the game and the result of that game. Feature got cut. NBA 2K15 - interviews at halftime/after the game with the player - feature got cut. Talking to the GM about the team/playstyle of the team? Feature got cut. Almost nothing changes, exact same commentary lines every year, barely any new animations, ♥♥♥♥♥iest shooting release ever. If you couldn't be asked to read (which I know I wouldn't) - don't buy this game, an honest waste of money.			"

												This is hands down the best Sports game EVER created. Every game mode leaves you wanting to play more (offline). I personally enjoy more of the REAL life, simulation ball... and Pro-am fills that burning need for me on so many levels. The TWO things I don't like about this game.... The MC story is a joke and seriously racist... My other problem with this game is a HUGE problem... once again 2K has fully supported the console versions of this game, protecting their users from having to play with Modders or CE hacks... and again they fell short when it comes to the PC platform.. this SERIOUSLY ruins many aspects of online play. If it were NOT for the Hacks.. I would rate this game 10/10.. but do to the high numbers of CE users and 2K's blatant lack of  caring about it.. I am giving this game 5/10.			"

If you're considering purchasing this game right now I'd recommend waiting until the 3rd or 4th patch comes out to resolve these issues that somehow keep coming up in every iteration of this game. Really trying to like this game, but it's very difficult with the bugs and some of the design decisions. Plus the storyline with myCareer and Spike Lee really came out of nowhere.

												Well, after one day of playing the 2K16 I can say there aren't as many changes as I hoped. There is also a HUGE RACIST issue with MyCAREER mode. I play a 6'8"" WHITE dude, but still - his twin sibling is a black girl, which would be possible if their parents were an interracial couple, but they're both black too! If the issue was the opposite, you'd want to play a black kid and both parents and his twin sibling was black, there would be a HUGE scandal for days now. Don't know who to thank for, I think Spike Lee could say something about that - I remember him complaining that Clint Eastwood had failed to include a single African-American soldier in his films Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, both about the 1945 battle for the Japanese island. Eastwood justified his choice of actors, saying that those black troops who did take part in the battle as part of a munitions company didn't raise the flag. So I suppose that Spike Lee defied reality and made white players to have a black background. It's just stupid and ignorant. There's only one world in his mind - New York City (Harlem especially) and only one race - BLACK. Keeping up with the story makes you facepalm twice an hour. Nevertheless, the game itself is almost pretty good, the tracklist choice is AWESOME. For now, I give it a strong 7/10. If you have NBA 2K15 you can easily stick with it. Still, if there will be NBA 2K17 next year, I certainly won't buy it before the official release and then some solid opinions form other sources.			"

												Let's set this straight, the gameplay itself is fun and well polished when it's working.  However the amount of bugs along with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MyCareer really forces me to not recommend this game.  The online works fine for the most part, no real connection issues, ProAm and all of those things are a nice addition.   I had a HUGE issue when I first started playing the game, I went into the graphic options and messed around.  I DISABLED V-sync and dynamic V-sync along with all of this, after applying the changes, the game froze and crashed.  So I then restarted the game and it began to run at 1FPS, luckily I remembered that 2k15 had a similar problem albiet less intense.  So I went into appdata/roaming and opened up the config file, only to see that the v-sync options were still enabled. I disabled those and launched the game again, now running at 200fps.List of bugs I've encountered:-FPS issue above-When subbing back in during MyCareer the player info pane never appears, forcing me to quit to the menu and reload-Player is litterally stuck in an animation when a pass or rebound is taken away at the wrong time.  You have to wait till the possesion is over-Some freethrows count for 2 points, then resulting in the team shooting to get the ball back.-The menu when you choose to either hang out/train or advance get's stuck on screen DURING the gameIf 2k patched out those problems the game wouldn't necessarily be better, just less annoying to play.  MyCareer is♥♥♥♥♥♥ no real choices like they advertised, and you still have to pay for ♥♥♥♥ing accessories like socks with VC.  I only bought this game because it was on sale at GMG.  If it was full price, no way in hell would I have bought it.  There are just not enough changes to justify the full price for this game.			"

												The game mechanics are good, what kills the game to me are the hacked players online, the long grinding to unlock new attribute points (even if you zip through games and practices), and the fact that the promised VC for people who pre-purchased the game never were delivered.So if you stay away of myplayer and mypark game modes, you will probably enjoy the other features.Plus that Spike Lee joint was cheesy and a loss of time. I got really tired of being called ""Freq"" in the games and see that celebration ""vibrations"" after a play...I still play the game from time to time, but i would not recommend it.			"

												What even is this game... awful narrative, awkward writing, and impossible gameplay (for new players). There is quite literally no tutorials to help you learn the game or explain how the shooting system works and then it throws you into this plain awful career mode that makes absolutely no sense if you have a white character created as you have an entirely black family. No explanation of the controls whatsoever mixed with impossibly hard gameplay doesn't bode well.			"

												This game is trash but it's the only sports game on steam that isn't managing or cartoony. A summary of all gamemodes:MyCareer: Absolute rubbish until you finish Spike Lee sucking his own♥♥♥♥♥♥ You don't get to make any choices for yourself even though the tag line is ""Be the story"". I don't know why anyone drafted me when I couldn't play well in college. I wanted to stay there. Nope.You lose points for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You lose points for leaving assignment when it might change playes on you out of nowhere. You get your shot blocked, lose points. Some guy dunks on your teammate? Lose points. The ONLY way to get better attributes is VC, which is easiest to get by PAYING.MyGM:Manager. Plenty of other games for this.MyLeague:See MyGM.MyTeam:P2W and unbalanced. Domination pits your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starter pack players vs a max chemistry pro team. The Gauntlet puts you against any old chump playing the game (for instance, my first game was vs 2 amethysts). PROFESSIONALS miss casual layups and they even miss DUNKS!!!!!!!!!!MyPark:Cheaters and cheesers in every game.I still will play the game., but I'm not paying these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s a dime.			"

												From what I have seen this game simple is a worse version of NBA2k15. While there are actually quite a few possitive changes to the gameplay mechanics they are completely overshadowed by the the fact that this port is even more buggy and even less optimized than the previous iteration even though it is clearly made in the same engine. Just to top it off the Spike lee directed storyline is uninspired and frankly just lazy. I when you make a Myplayer of an ethnicity other than black or a mix of black you still have 2 black parents which would still be acceptable except for the fact that they were so short sighted as to give you a black twin sister which is 100% impossible. Considering that the Online play just god aweful on PC the only reason I bought the game personally was for the single player experience so in my opinion you should just save your money and buy 2k15 when is goes on sale if you really are craving a basketball game.

												The game is pretty chill; character customization is suprb! This is my first NBA 2k game so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I bought this game for like 6 bucks and decided I needed variety in my life. My career mode is very...odd. I feel like I have no free will in the game at all. I am fine with the family, and having a twin sister, because well I’m black. Spike Lee directs the story of a black kid coming up from the slums of the projects just trying to get into the NBA. While on your way to fame. The story mode only caters to one race. Spike Lee being who he is still created a very deep story for your character that will leave with ""Oh damn"" When everyone refers to you though they just call you 'Freq’. Secondly, the game feels more like a pay to win game. If you want to upgrade anything you have to put some real life cash into the game to get their online currency of VC. -Shooting at certain distance never guarantees you a shot for some reason even if it was TIMED PERFECTLY-Teammates will forget how to shot- The opposing team will become 3pt good out of no where.With all this in mind and the price they are trying to sell it for, I can't recommend the game.

												The ""story"" by Spike Lee is just stupid.- you create a caucasian player, but your family is african-american- your twin sister is african-american- your name is Frequency Vibrations............I did not get past my draft, because I couldn't even laugh at the story anymore.Everything in this game is very cinematic. You press something in the menu - whoosh whoosh baaam Steph Curry shooting for 3 points and then you can do something.There are so many cinematics in game that you cannot skip. Someone fouls, you have to watch the cheerleaders for 3 seconds. Someone gets fouled, something has to fly over your monitor before you can shoot. Oh, and then you get to 4th quarter.4th quarter in this game is absolute hell. Timeouts every 10 seconds, which means that you can't play for another 10 seconds, because the timeout animation can't be skipped. This happens maybe 3-4 times 4th quarter and some times before. And if you play a close game, then the players start fouling each other, which makes sense from a basketball point of view (probably), but I get pretty irritated when my players do something I did not tell them to do. Last 30 seconds of 4th quarter take about 2-3 minutes to play out and after 3 games it becomes a drag.If you want to play some basketball on PC, you have no other choice. And sometimes the games can feel pretty good, but everything in this game apart from the actual basketball is just dumb.			"

												At it's current state, I don't recommend this game, not even if you get it from a gray key site. No, not becuase ""This game is racist because my family is always black and BLAH BLAH BLAH"" (those people need help if the really feel like that's racism). I don't recommend it because of what really matter: the gameplay.Now the game has made some improvements over last year, like some animations are better, it's not as easy to make shots as it was in the last game, slightly better player customization, the rival of MyCrew via the new ProAm mode (even if we can't play on our courts yet), MyCourt, some bugs/glitches fixed, etc. However there's a lot of new issues in the game, incuding some from the old game. For example, Demigods and hackers are back on MyPark. People have had 99 overalls since the day came out for people who preordered and managed to get things outside of their rank (skateboards, shirtless option, mascot gear, etc). Speaking of MyPark, the servers are very hit or miss. Either it runs smoothly or everyone lags the entire time and the game runs like a slideshow. Also there's an issue with the Got Next spots that sometimes happens that prevents anyone from getting on them. Also, that 1v1v1 mode they have in MyPark is kinda lame, but that's just me nitpicking.Moving onto MyCareer, it's also kind of a mess. The story is lame. I understand them wanting you to feel like a high school/college phenom, nad those games were fun, but once you get drafted is where I have issues with it. You're being being drafted amongst player that have ratings in the upper 70s (probably some in the lower 80s as well) but your overall is at a 55 to start, and yet the characters in the story talk about you potentially going lottery pick in the draft. The rookie season is only 8 games, which isn't that bad, except you basically get no VC at that point so you don't rank up that much going into your 2nd season. Also they advertised the new MyCareer story to make you think it's all about choices, but you really don't until you finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t story. The only choice you get is the college you go to, and even then you only get about 10(?) choices for schools. Once your rookie season is over is when you actually get to make choices, which I enjoy. I like that you get to choose how you spend your off days, even though I wish you'd get more VC out of endorsements (since it doesn't seem like you make that much in games, regardless of how wellyou do).The biggest issue I have with the game, however, is the stability. Whenever I do MyCareer or Play Now games, my frames drop a lot, the game stutters, and the game crashes a lot. The game sometimes switches from full screen to windowed mode for no reason no matter what my settings are. All in all, I'd say just wait for a patch before you buy the game.			"

Posted: December 31, 2015
												I play the NBA 2k games every year because basketball is my favorite sport and NBA 2k is, unfortunately, the only halfway decent sim on the market.  The problem with this is that they have no pressure to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together.I gave this game a positive review after playing maybe 10 hours because some basic issues with NBA 2k15 were fixed.  The movement feels more fluid than in that game.  NBA 2k15 is without a doubt the worst NBA 2k game ever made.  This is probably the 2nd worst game in the franchise though.  A new review is being written after playing many more hours.  I only play so many hours because I assume problems with the game are my own lack of skill for a bit, until you really get to notice specific problems.  I also just love basketball and keep getting fooled every year.  And it's such a shame because NBA 2k14 on next-gen console, not PC, had such great potential to be improved dramatically in the following years.  They removed all their progress for God knows what reason.The big draw is that Spike Lee did the MyCareer mode, and frankly it's by far the worst career mode in any sports game I've ever played, or any game with any mode even remotely comparable.  They put you in a Spike Lee film basically, except Spike Lee was obviously not allowed to make something like he'd actually put in a film (most of his films are R rated and this game is E rated, so you can imagine all the things he'd have to censor himself about).So they make your character's background be this incredibly stereotypical borderline offensive plotline, something which would be called racist if Spike didn't do it because it'd be called a parody of black life in New York.  You use 90s rap slang in a modern setting and have all kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t happen which doesn't actually move the plot of you being a basketball player forward.  I'm shocked Big Daddy Kane didn't have a writing credit.  You play like 8 games, 4 high school 4 college, to determine your draft slot.  Not a terrible idea by itself.  But they paint your character the whole time as being this godsend of a player.  Think of the way Lebron was anticipated as a kid out of high school.  Yet, if you spend no VC on your character before the draft, he comes in as a 55 overall.  This makes your player the worst in the league, literally.This is problematic for 2 major reasons: (other than the absurdity of being painted as Lebron and then coming in to be the worst in the league by far). 1) College and high school games are a complete waste of time.  Draft position couldn't matter less in any context, just your own role playing.  I normally care about draft position in these games, but they also usually care more about how I play during MyCareer in return.2) You cannot skip this for new players.After you're drafted, they only let you play 8 games of your first season.  It's abysmal.  Also, Spike's story actually has nothing to do with your real NBA career, i.e. the reason you're playing.  All it does is give you 2 hours of cutscenes interspersed between the pointless high school and college games.  There's hardly any actual story once you're a bonafide NBA player, which defeats the entire purpose of the mode.  The only thing you get are ""meetings"" with some select few famous players, and that's not actually anything more than clicking on menus and seeing some kind of a stat or VC boost at best.The MyGM mode is plagued with the practice time issue.  It becomes a nuissance immediately.  The mode itself is pretty easy, it's nowhere near as complex as something like Out of the Park Baseball is, obviously, but it's probably as bad as its ever been.  The trade logic, despite promises to the contrary, is equal to how bad it always is.  There's always so many dumb trades you can pull off.  It boggles my mind that the game allows such game breaking trades to be made.And the gameplay itself: again, the game feels better than it did last year, but not better than 2k14, and not better than almost any other year before that.  The shot meter is the one thing I like, and even that is bad half the time because you'll regularly miss perfectly aligned shot meter shots.  It defeats the purpose of the meter if you miss midrange jumpers with an 88 overall player on a perfectly in the green shot.The game feels like one of those old hockey tabletop games where all the players are stuck to the floor and you can only rotate them to shoot in a puck.  The players feel stuck to the floor.  They are moved against gravitational logic into positions to contest shots in ways which, after watching replays, make you want to tear your hair out.  The AI still cheeses with the shots it takes and makes.  The teammate AI in the MyCareer mode is, honestly, worse than it was even last year.  It makes it so that on high difficulty you can average over 40 a game and a triple double and still lose by 20.  How am I supposed to win when I get double'd, pass it out to open guys who can't hit shots that I'd make in real life?  2k NEEDS to get their act straight because the game suffers immensely.On PC the multiplayer modes have low populations.  The one mode which doesn't, where you take your MyCareer player to the park, has strange limitations.  If you don't choose to rep the park with the beach and the aquarium, you'll basically be left all by yourself in the ironworks park with no one to play with.  That mode has tons of hackers and cheaters in it, based on the complaints on the forums as well as what I've seen myself.  I haven't done much of that mode because the people who play that mode play almost exclusively that and you'll get killed repeatedly.  I'm really good at full team vs team basketball but the population is too low to rise in rank on that mode, all the people who play that regularly are already all at the top ranks.  You aren't allowed to play with higher ranked people for some reason in spite of population issues, it's a terrible design choice.And the VC gouging.  Everything costs more.  More money.  Pat Riley talked about the disease of more, where people wanted more playing time and more money for themselves to break up a potentially winning basketball team.  Who knew that you could also apply it to a video game franchise about basketball?  This game feels like the biggest cash grab yet, and that's saying a lot given the antics of last year's game.  They kept the terrible ♥♥♥♥ing system of upgrading stats in blocks, and now you have even stricter limits on your player's ability to rise in rank.  I'm stuck at 88 overall, I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do to be allowed to go higher in rank.And come on, 1000 VC for a ♥♥♥♥ing headband?  It's disgusting.  Absolutely disgusting.  I'm a fool for buying the game every year but I just love basketball so damn much.  If the Out of the Park guys made an NBA or even fictional basketball manager sim, I'd buy that in a heartbeat.  All the games that exist of that nature are awful, I've looked, so don't point me to that terrible basketball manager game that's on Steam.  And if those guys are reading this, you too should get your act together because there's money to be made and a complete void in this market.  If somebody came along and gave us a good basketball game, we'd all play it.P.S. It's a game where the players in real life actually are able to do better things than in this game.  It's a basketball game where you can't ever actually dunk on someone because of the flawed defense system.  There's still problems with height advantage in this game, a basic ♥♥♥♥ing concept in basketball.  This game is about a 55 overall, same as the rating they start your MyPlayer at.  But if they spend money, they can pay me and I'll upgrade their rating.  Or maybe just work on the gameplay this year?  And yes the 2kTV girl is hot but is 2kTV really a necessary feature?  It's just a waste of resources that should be going into the actual product.			"

												If you want to play with friends, MyGm, MyCareer, there are no problems and you will have a ton of fun. Easy 10/10 Get it.When it comes to online, MyPark does seems like the only real playable mode. Rarely lags(on a lucky day at least), and good performance.But boiii... if you try to get on MyTeam, prepare to play on trasha** potatoe-lookina** servers. 1. The servers are SO trash, not even oscar the grouch would wanna live anywhere near them. You will lead by 5/10/15 or even 20 points, the connection to the fu**in' 2K servers will die, and you'll get an L  because the other guy is playing on some kinda rain forest bamboo-broadband type connection. And guess what? Exactly, he'll get the W.2. No voice-chat. Basically 2K not giving a **** about the PC-Community.3. The online 3-point cheese. Your opponent will -> hand the ball to his point guard -> call for a screen -> drive to the basket -> the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI-Defense will switch from peremiter-defense to the dude driving to the basket, even though you're chasing down and there is no need to, since there is still a defender in the paint -> he'll pass to the now open peremiter-shooter -> threes on threes on threes. You can excessively call 3-2, 2-3, Man-to-man etc., the AI wont care. It'll leave it's assignment whatever you do.Conclusion : This game is easily the best sports game if you have friends to come over to play local 1v1/2v2/... , MyCareer, MyLeague or MyGM. Solo : Recomendation.When it comes to online multiplayer on PC, think of DeAndre Jordan slam dunking the 2K servers into the trash can like he did on Brandon Knight.Edit: Was leading a game by 3 points today, disconnected, got handed a 0-0 L        Was leading a game by 2 points just now, disconnected and, take a guess, got handed     another 0-0 L. Both in the first damn half.2nd Edit: I live in Germany and got100Mbit/s, so don't even think of telling my that I'M the one with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet.			"

Posted: August 3, 2016
Summary/Overview NBA 2k16 is the most recent in cutting edge technology acclaimed for a decade now by fans, critics, game reviewers and writers as the premier and ultimate experience for a pure basketball simulation that remains bar none to its other former competitor, NBA Live made by Electronic Arts. Gameplay (Features, controls, graphics & mechanics) Features  Game Modes    There are so many game modes that for the sake of the review length limit I am allowed to produce on Steam, I can't go in-to-depth on all of them. Thus, I will discuss the game modes I have taken time out to play. Those are Play now, my Career & My GM.    The play now game mode is what all of us 2k sports consumers have grown to love over time for those of us that have played 2K basketball before. However, for those of you that have never played a 2KXX game in your life, it is synonymous with quick game where it gives you the option to play in the NBA today matchups which update every single time the NBA season as a whole progresses and then the most common game mode being where you choose a team and then choose who your opponent's team will be if you are playing against the computer.  Presentation in Play Now    The presentation has improved over outdated NBA 2k games such as NBA 2k12 and even now NBA 2k14. It is much more realistic showing pre-game rituals, pre-game warm-ups, half-time shows, a message time to time from a player with their thoughts on things when they are interviewed and finally a post-game analysis with ShaQ, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson. The reflections upon the light reflected off of the court is accurate to a tee representing the hardwood floors in an exact 1:1 replica portion of the real thing in the NBA. My favorite part overall of this is when the public announcers announce all the famous cliché sayings all of us have grown to love over time. These include sayings such as, "" Rockets ball"", ""Detroit Basketball! "" and so much more.    Growing up in Houston, Texas half of my life at my current age of twenty-three, my Dad would win off of the radio many NBA tickets in the various states we have lived being Houston, Texas; Oregon and even Mississippi to see the Memphis Grizzles. I used to appreciate the announcers the most because of their personality and charisma. I still to this day while playing 2k sports national basketball association games, absolutely love teams that have a good announcer with a great personality, the way that they are able to craft the names is what still brings me in. My favorite teams currently based on their announcers alone in the way they say player's names in order are: Detroit Pistons, Denver Nuggets, Cleveland Cavs, Houston Rockets and the Miami Heat.    Now I will get into my primary disappointment within NBA 2k16. They took out some of the signature animations they had put in NBA 2k14 and other ones near that year such as when LeBron James goes over to the mat near the sideline to wipe off his feet while rubbing lotion together as it disperses in the air during his famous pre-game clap. I miss this so much. Another example are some key points dealing with Kobe Bryant. Some of his same signature behaviors we have come to know and love have now been eradicated, null, non-existent. For example, if you want it to be accurate in a 1:1 ratio, Rasheed Wallace, yes I know he is retired now but we will just use him right now to illustrate this example along with Metta World Peace (Formerly Ron Artest). Rasheed is known as a class clown that picks on teammates and is very displeased when the referees call something that goes against his favor.      He should be seen in-game with behaviors that promote foolery and arrogance. Ron Artest on the other hand, now still currently active in the 2K series and known as Metta World Peace now should have his signature move of patting his teammates on the butt, because he always does that often and it is unique to his personality and character upon the court.    Through this review, I have only had the opportunity to thoroughly try out two different teams in quick match, the Milwaukee Bucks and the Houston Rockets.  1. The Milwaukee Bucks    The Bucks play just like they do in the actual national basketball association. Each team is designed in a 1:1 ratio to play based on whether they are a team that shoots the lights out normally from mid and three-point range (e.g., Warriors, Cavs, Heat, Spurs & Thunder). Other teams that are excellent defensively but slower down the court offensively (e.g., Celtics, Bulls, Pacers, Hawks & Grizzlies). The bucks are a primary offensive team, they push the ball up the court fast, usually nail buckets from mid-range and even three-point range pretty easily and always get toward the free-throw-line. 2. The Houston Rockets    The Houston Rockets are one of the safest teams to use all around in NBA 2k16 and beyond and here is why. Since the Rockets have acquired Jason Terry, James Harden and Dwight Howard, they are a good threat, and force the defender to know the mechanics it operates under.  I have been playing the Houston Rockets so long in NBA Live and NBA 2k, that I now fully recognize how the whole team's chemistry works despite what players they have. They share the ball like the Spurs do, dominate you in the paint, work it out to mid-range and push the tempo at a steady pace to get up in your face and make you question the team's interior, exterior motives. I won't lie, I do miss not having Kevin Martin, but, instead, now there is James Harden on the Rockets which perfectly takes his place and he is much healthier.My Career Mode    My career mode is a brand new edition this year by the direction of Spike Lee in order to include a storyline for the first time in a simulated basketball game. Highlights: Production quality matches Grand Theft Auto V voice overs, graphics and emotion. You play in the life of a guy named Freq surrounded by his twin sister, Cee-Cee and his best friend, Vic (Short for Victor). Freq is a straight A student out of high school distinguished by honors and is from Harlem so him and his friends use urban slang in their dialect. GM Mode    It is best defined as a mode in which you become the general manger of any team you want while controlling finances, assets, accounting, projections, recruiting new free agents, players on your team and signing them to contracts. You work for the owner of your team and are not allowed to disappoint, you have to learn responsibility, resource; time-management and humility in order to survive the simulated life of what real-life general managers in sports face up against daily, weekly and monthly.Pros & ConsPros•Excellent atmosphere, production quality, storyline, new features, new game modes, presentation and graphics•Fun, easily enjoyable and endlessly replayable•It can replace the NBA for those that don't keep up with the games on television any•Accuracy in character models, the 2015 NBA draft selections, team dynamics, player tendencies, behaviors and reactions•The best 2k game since NBA 2k7 and NBA 2k12Cons•Online matches crash often on the PC, so be wary of that•Laggy online connection when playing online with others normally•Some player's signature behaviors through non-verbal cues have been taken out but have been replaced and made betterOverall- 10 Key1-3 = poor4-5 = ok6-7 = good8-10 = amazingFor more objective non-biased reviews, please visit my other account TheDragonsNiche (2)Alternate Steam PC Account Link: https://steamcommunity.com/id/InsightfulJourney "

Also, my PC fits the system requirements that you have posted on your web page, however, both the graphics and speed performance of the game are horrible. I very much hope that you will fix these issues soon. I had such a nice experience with NBA 2k15, please do not ruin your brand.			"

												It's not that NBA2K16 is a bad game, it's just not a really good game. And when they're charging AAA prices for it, I can't really recommend it. The pros:- Interesting and plenty of online and offline game modes- Good graphics (if you can run it)- It's better than NBA Live and one of the only sports games left still available on PCCons:- Clunky controls and animations. Even in offline mode the controls are clunky and feel unpolished. Animations finish slowly even in high energy situations like when youre on a fast break or when youre stuck in the paint trying to pass the ball. I constantly deal with things like my player receiving a wide open pass on a fast break, but he takes the pass with no urgency so by the time the catch animatino is over and my jump shot animation begins, I'm covered. There are many many more examples of clunky controls and animations getting in the way. I could go on for paragraphs. Very frustrating.- Mostly luck based. Want to do anything besides post up cheese? I hope youre feeling lucky. Drive the basket? Maybe you'll do an awesome move, freeze your defender and score, maybe you'll get blocked. Jump shots are by far the worst. You can never tell when they are going to drop. Wide open, fully contested. There seems to be little rhyme or reason to them. I understand real life basketball can often be like this as well, but trust me.... in this game it's very difficult to develop a strategy besides get a guy open and pray. Or just cheese up the post.- Lag. The online lag is often unbearable. Sometimes it's good, most of the time it's not. They rely on p2p connections which can be confusing to some players causing lag for everyone in the match.- Buggy. Never remembers account info. This game tells me every other day that my account is expired and I have to re-enter all the information. I get my account back, but it's a process. I have tried everything on the support page to solve this. It also happens in the mobile companion app.- Buggy. I literally have to change my controller setup every game. The pro stick by default is used for dribbling and shooting so I turn it to dribble only plus absolute. Every. Game. Every game after I hit it and notice it's reverted back resulting in breaking up my play.- Buggy. Every single day when I play guantlet, the first match I can't move. Like my character literally can't move. I have to alt+tab, kill process, try again and it's fixed. This means every day I have to start my online play with a loss.- Buggy. Many random and lazy bugs. Like your character not putting his arms on the table in interviews.. they sort of oddly float. I have no idea how that passed QA. Your arms or jaw will just random shake when on the bench. And many more things like this.- Spike Lee. I won't even elaborate on this as it's been done to death. Just google ""LIVIN' DA DREAM"" and you'll know what I want to say since nobody has anything good to say about it.I could easily go on with the cons. Yes, all games have bugs and minor problems, but in NBA2k16 they seem to stack up. They stack up and weigh against very few good things about the game. Considering this is your only option to play Basketball on PC, I guess I could recommend it based on that. If you could live with or whithout a basketball game though, then I would recommend you save your money.			"

Posted: August 5, 2016
												2K Games’ NBA series has proven to be the basketball game of choice over the last few years, much more popular than EA’s Live brand. One of the main reasons behind this is the constant drive to evolve and provide memorable experiences. Some have entries have been excellent, like the previous NBA 2K15, while others, such as 2K14 left a bit of bad taste behind due to various constraints.NBA 2K16 isn’t the biggest departure from 2K15, but there is one major difference and that is the change to the MyCareer mode. Film director Spike Lee has brought his experience to the mode and added a story that has a big impact on the rookie season of the MyCareer mode. In this mode you control a person called Frequency Vibrations, or Freq for short – that isn’t his real name, which is left to you as you create the player. If you have saved data from 2K15 then you can import the player from that game, though only his appearance will transfer over and not attributes.The Spike Lee directed portion of MyCareer is called Livin’ Da Dream, and sees you go from high school, to college and then the NBA. It is a different approach to what we saw previously, as you shape Freq’s choices, such as the university he goes too, so that I ended up at the University Of Kansas. The acting is well done by all that were involved, and seeing your player’s history unfold in such a fashion is an interesting idea.However for Livin’ Da Dream to work, a major component of MyCareer has been cut down, and that is the rookie season in the NBA. It is still there, but it’s been reduced from a full 82 game season to just eight games from different points of the season, with a couple more at the end if your team reaches the play-offs. I honestly don’t know why 2K chose to cut such a major piece of the game, especially since the story doesn’t make up for the reduction.The rookie season has traditionally been where a lot of player growth and development is done. Each match can see you improve as you acquire more points to increase attributes with, and if you’re good enough, you can even compete for Rookie of the Season. At least, you could. Here there is no chance to try for that accolade, and the fewer games mean that in the second season of MyCareer your Freq is much lower rated than others players at the same point in their careers within the game.There have been other additions to MyCareer which do add to the experience of being a pro basketball player. Your agent helps you get endorsements and you can also hang out with players from around the league. These options are available on your off days, so you can get some points shooting a promo or potentially do some networking should you decide to spend the day with others. You can also choose to train on your off day and try to improve skills from there. However, these options are only available from the second season onwards, due to the Livin’ Da Dream being the most important aspect of your rookie season.As before, the best mode for play with an entire team would be MyGM, in which you control everything from team roster, the way the budget can be allocated, and the action on the court. Each team’s owner will have different goals for you to achieve with the squad, be it making the play-offs or winning the championship. You’ll field press conferences too with the answers given affecting how the team see you, and how the media views you.NBA 2K16 does play well, with team movement seeming to be more fluid, and the way the ball is passed about a lot more. The AI is challenging but not to the point where it is frustrating, with each team having their advantages and disadvantages. Neither opposition AI nor team AI is infallible and occasionally mistakes will be made, like a pass being thrown too early or the ball being stolen leading to a turnover.Team mates will usually run into the correct lanes so you have an easier time of passing around, or defending when needs be. Fouling also seems to be less of an issue than previous games too, allowing for the matches to move forward with fewer interruptions, and you can choose to call a time-out and manually sort out substitutions, or allow the game to do it automatically for you.On the multiplayer side of things you can play locally and online competitively. MyPark allows for you to team with other individuals to play matches against others, while MyTeam is the mode where you can collect players through opening card packs or obtain them through picks after winning certain games. The goal is to create a highly rated team as well as collect every card possible, which will take quite some time, since there are over 2400 of them. Online leagues are back too so if you have a group of friends to play NBA 2K16 with it is definitely worth setting up.NBA 2K16 isn’t a huge jump over NBA 2K15 in the graphics department, but it remains an incredible looking game. The commentary also continues to be the best of any sports game so far, and with the addition of the pre and post game shows to MyCareer, you get much more analysis of players and teams through the game.

												I've always been a fan of 2k. It's my third year buying the game, but this time they got it all wrong.The game is full of bugs: naked people, invisible players, comentators stops speaking for no reason, game crashes for no reason, nobody is playing online, a lot of cheaters and lack of support from 2k that didn't solve any of the issues yet (it's been more than a week). By far the best engine of the history of the franchise, but by far the worst game of them, it's almost unplayable at this point. Don't waste your money on it like I did.			"

												Good Game, but the bugs and crashes are terrible. I have a good computer that exceeds the recommended requirements. However the game is full of crashes, you will crash in mid game. Often times the game will start then crash right away over and over. My Player Mode is terrible in 2k16, Spike Lee ruined it. He needs to understand that not everyone that loves basketball is from Harlem with black twin sister. It makes no sense for my character to be any other race than black, if my twin sister is a black girl. It is not MY PLAYER, its Spike Lee's Player. Can't even choose my own name, I have to be called Freq (Freak) all the time. Character customization is terrible.			"

												Recently the game started crashing after every other MyCareer match, At the end of the game it just crashes to the desktop and none of the progress gets saved. When you load it back up you have to play the game all over again and it makes progression impossible. Also MyCareer was just plain bad this year. You have no control over your Rookie season. They let you play 8 games and the rest are simulated so you can't even be rookie of the year. I know this review is a bit late but even if this game is on sale it's not worth purchasing at this point because the crashing issue makes it pretty much unplayable.			"

												I'm a huge Fan of the NBA 2K title's, but this year - i don't recommend it!YES - NBA 2k16 is still the best Sport Simulation out there imo! YES - it provides fun for 1000 Hours!But why I shouldn't buy it? Simple reason:First of all, Spike f*ing Lee? Yeah, you guessed it. This year MyCareer is a total disaster. I hate every second of this ""Story"" ( yeah its actually a Script Story ). For me MyCarrer starts after the Rookie Year. And then? Its ok I would say. Nothing special after the Rookie Year.Other negative Points:- A.I. is a joke this year. Every Difficulty under HoF is too simple to beat and HoF itself is just cheating around ( hitting every contested 3 Pointer in Clutch situation f.e. )- Perfect release can miss- No free agency after Seasons ( MyCareer )- Spike Lee Story- 2k Servers are still pretty pretty bad- Connection Timeouts in Multiplayer- On release so many Cheater ( i think there are still in the game )- Framedrops ( not PC optimized )- NBA doesnt keep my Settings- Spike Lee Story- Still VC SystemAND NOW ladys and gentlemen, my favorite Point:2k doesn't save your progress on there Server! What does this mean? F.e you spend 100+ hours on one player and maybe some Money too.If your File got corrupted or ( in my case ) you reinstall NBA (without Cloud activated), your progress and spent VC are lost. You have no Chance to get anything back. And thats ridiculous! I tried to contact the support and they are just said ""you accept our EULA and we can't give VC back""What a great way to steal your Money!GreetzFetzL			"

Basically an old opel astra with  ferrari coating. I bet 10$ that 2k17 is exactly the same. I do not recommend this game or any future NBA product for full retail price from 2k studios. If you can grab it for 5$, which is what its worth imo. Then its a very nice gamePS.♥♥♥♥ you spike lee.			"

												First and foremost, ""My Player"" and ""My Career"" got deleted because I didn't respond to a confirmation email from 2K that didn't exist.  So about 40 hours of gameplay down the toilet.Gameplay was buggy, frame rates very choppy on high end computer (Core i7, 16GB, GTX 970) @ 1080p.The ball frequently travels through players bodys, controls have massive input lag, Lots of frustration because of unskippable portions of gamewasting presentation ""features"".  I was willing to deal with it and continue playing my player in singleplayer, but after a few days I was greeted with the message ""Your player not available due to non-confirmation of online account through email"" (paraphrasing).  I looked through my email in both junkmail, deleted, and the normal inbox with no confirmation email received.  So there is no way to get my account confirmed, and all that time just went down the toilet for what is STILL a $60 game as of March 11th 2017.  Oh, and if you were trying to play online, forget it.  There is literally nobody online in any of the game modes.Please don't repeat my mistake.  Stay well away from this hot garbage.			"

												The game has it's flaws. The graphics are gorgeous. But the gameplay has become intolerable. You spend most of the time trying to get the player to move where you want them to move. I don't know what it is, but when a path is open and you push that direction, there is no reason for that player not to move there (no matter how bad their stats are) So instead you will continuously press harder in that direction (don't do this, eventually your controller will break).My biggest gripe is the ""My Career"" mode. It's not moving in the right direction drama-wise. Before I bought the game, I read all of the criticisms regarding the Spike Lee story and didn't think it could be that bad. It was BAD. It was basically a bunch of LONG cutscenes that are incredibly boring, there is nothing interesting about the story. I remember Spike Lee movies having a little oomph to them but this story was vanilla and played out like a Tyler Perry story. Painful. Besides that, it is the same ol' become a NBA player and get mandatory endorsements (I would rather endorse a cheap shoes like Starburys) and become a corporate shill, just how the NBA is supposed to be.  But those things aren't the worst part about My Player, it is the slow pace that you get VC. They intentionally gimped the amount you get to entice you to buy some online. Like a free-to-play game.  And you almost have to buy it because your player starts off awful stat-wise. My character was a  pg whose stats are so bad it is painfully obvious that they don't belong in the NBA let alone have teams competing for their services. No rookie of the year possibilities (I'm not even sure if it's possible)When your stats are bad, your passes go to the defenders. While playing defense your character automatically RUNS AWAY from offensive players. Opposing defenders don't allow you to effing MOVE and when you try to move (spamming turbo)... turnover. (same crap as the other version) so nothing different there.  Boring post game press conferences supplant the obnoxious cut scenes in season 2, it's just not worth it (in MY Career at least)  Fun!I am a huge NBA fan, and would like to play a basketball RPG for once that I could relate to, but year after year, the same basic premise and actor. The direction they take My Career is so far removed from who I am IRL, I lose immersion. Instead of changing the formula up, they double down on the formula. Who asked for this? So, be warned. Then again, this is just my opinion.			"

												Okay, I feel obligated to actually post a review from the standpoint of someone who actually enjoys the game. There are many positives to the game if you play it with the correct mindset. However, with that being said, there are a few issues that are rather annoying when they pop up.MyCareer- Spike Lee screwed up the mode quite a bit, but once you get past the storyline, it is better than ever. BUT the storyline, is absolutely hilarious due to the fact that I am a white Point Guard who acts not like the average black man, but the average ghetto, uneducated thug. Good for a laugh for sure but definitely a bit unrealistic, considering that you have a black twin sister. It is just a story mode until the end of your rookie season, and then the choice is all yours as to how you do things. MyTeam- Great gamemode if you put enough time into it. Any game you play will have one or two players who bought their way to skill. There will always be that one guy who just dumped a bunch of money in the game and therefore is automatically at an advantage. The other big problem with player vs player is the fact that there are many ways for you, not neccesarily to have an advantage, but play in a not so polite manner. Spamming three pointers is very easy especially in modes like gauntlet so beware because most people do it. The same goes with Zig-Zagging and other tactics that lead me to question the amount of fun that they might be having. Also the computer is infuriating at every turn. The game is designed to make it challenging, so you will end up missing wide open three pointers and dunks but the computer, somehow dunks on everyone and shoots threes fading over centers. Sucks, but deal with it because there is nothing that you can do to combat it. No matter how good of ball handles your player has, you are prone to suddenly dropping the ball at random points. Game Quality- So despite the problems I just mentioned, the game itself isn't that bad. If you have an older computer or a lower quality computer, than you may have to lower the game settings in the menu. Does it suck, yes, but you get used to it. Most of the people who have lag and framerate issues are trying to run the game on max settings on a computer that has the gaming ability and power of a microwave. Don't blame the game for your bad computer. Overview- Worth the buy for sure, but like every game has its issues. You will enjoy the game if you have regular expectations. I love the game and we need more people on the online servers so the game is worth the money.			"

I'm not being racist, but come on,  it was hilarious. Dont buy this game now, wait for a patch for the lag and don't buy this if you only play MyCareer mode.			"

												Got this game as a part of the 2K Humble bundle. Installed it with a bunch of the other games and started the career mode which was fun. Stopped playing for a couple days while I tried some of the other titles. In the meantime Windows 10 updates to the newest version. Come back, unable to play the game. Do research, find out it's due to the Windows update. I'm like, ok, I'll wait for the devs to get a patch out. I'm still waiting like 2 weeks later... Right now the game is an unplayable brick on my hard drive. I do not recommend this game to anyone who actually enjoys playing the games they purchased. I do recommend it if you simply collect games and never intend to play them. It fits nicely into the N catagory on your alphabetical list.			"

												NBA2K16, the game and series as well, truely expresses my love for the game of basketball.  Basketball is actually my one true passion in real life, aside from playing video games.For me, it is an escape and it is unlike any other sports video game.  Like, if I could I'll play this game for 24 hours in each day, I would but I shouldn't coz that would be insane. My very first ever basketball video game was Double Dribble on console and NBA Live 97 for PC.  From then on, I've gotten a hold of every NBA Live basketball game on PC up to 2008.  NBA 2k9 by 2K Sports was my first game fom the company and it change everything for me BIG TIME.  Compared to EA Sports' NBA Live, 2K Sports' version of the game is the best bar none.   No. No, I don't want to hear your NBA Live argument. It's the best basketball video game and that is it for me. 2K Sports' version got it right for me in every single way.  The speed, fluidity of movement, the level of player detail, the shoes and accessories, etc. This video game is almost the same as real life basketball...not really LOL.My only rant about the game is when you play MyPark.  I am pretty much an average player but most players there should learn how to play like a team and learn how pass the ball specially to the open guy.  ""Hey!!! Look I'm open, are you blind, WTH?""  Moreover, most if not all should definitely learn how to play defense.  More often than not, your teamates only knows one (1) play, and that is, pass it to him  and get out of his freakin' way, again WTF.  Sadly, that is not how to play the game.  But seriously, NBA2K16 for me has become a channel for letting go of my life, my thoughts, my worries and my burdens.  I cannot complete my day without playing this game.  In real life, I cannot go more than a week without feeling the touch of a basketball.  For pure hoop fans, I recommend this game.NOTE: I play basketball on a keyboard and if you ever been beaten by yours truely, just keep that in mind - again by a keyboard player.  Peace out.			"

												I love the 2k series and this one was the buggiest they have ever released for the PC. In one case, I had to play the same game/opponent 3 times before the game finally let me finish it without crashing. Every game, the announcers will stutter and fail. Every game.Otherwise, this is the best in the series in terms of control, playcalling and over all feel. Unless they fix the crash bugs, I do not recommend this one. The frustration is just too much.			"

												Well best basketball simulator if you play offline. Well AI sometimes still do stupid things.Worst arcade basketball game if you play online.Just pick Cavaliers and choke those threes whole game, and at the end of the game you get your win.No skill needed, sometimes it looks like this game based on scenarios. Tie game? Last seconds? There is big chance that someone get clutch points to win a game. Or if you alone at the three point line you have big chance to splash that three. Specialy if you playing online. If game start to get laggy you can't defense seems like other players just  freeze watch and how opponent go straight line to youre basket. "

												For the ones that are really in love with the game of basketball and like to spend some good time playing offline, this is the go to game. If you are planning to go online, i warn it you in that in any Nba 2k game will not be a good exprienced, the servers are laggy and despite that there's a huge number of cheaters around MyPark and AM's.In terms of gameplay speaking, this is not the best NBA 2k in that aspect the offense seems kinda slugish and you will feel, especially offline, a huge struggle to go past defenders without having that Ankle-Breaker badge, there's some problems around defense as well, but with some time playing you will get the touch of it and it's pretty functional when you get the point. Be sure you set your controllers configuration for Absolute this will change the feel for the game, becoming more fluid and less frustating than camera relative.During my time playing the game i do not experienced any crash issues or controller bugs during the time i bought a new pc.

												Disclaimer: I almost exclusively play MyCareer and MyPark so that's what my review is about. After finishing incredibly boring and distasteful first season (Spike Lee shenanigans), it turns into a pretty good game. Rebounding is seriously improved over the past few editions, and park is better balanced (still not perfect, of course, but at least it's not full of 7'3 people). Stat caps are serious business this time around, and they really help that balance. However, it does mean that you hit the wall pretty early in terms of progression and then it gets really slow afterwards. Graphics are really nice and the game works fine for me in 4k on a single 980ti (60 FPS, no hiccups). Bit of a downside is that MyCareer still doesn't offer proper challenge and balance at higher difficulties. For example on Superstar, my team will simply lose more games than on All-Star, but I am still able to average around triple double (31-11-9) on my All-Around SF in 2nd season. Seems that increasing the difficulty just makes your team miss more, and other team hit absurd shots. But then again, this is really no different than before.			"

												I've been a player of NBA 2K since 2K10, I really like the way it improves every year, graphics, controls, realism gets better. They removed setting up your own bench, quick, defense etc lineups, so subing in people is a little time consuming, no vocal controls. Other than that I really love the way this one turned out, I'm not really a MyPlayer person, but it's pretty fun.I fully recommend this game for any type of basketball nut or casual player. And as usual I recommend for any game this expensive... wait for it to go on sale LOL!			"

												Extremely too difficult.I understand you want a realistic basketball sim, but this is ridiculous. I have the difficulty set to pro and I have yet to win a game in MyGM. The AI makes all of their wide open shots, while even if your player is wide open and you hit the shot timer as close as you can, you will still miss. Even if you manage to build a small lead, the AI immediately becomes unstoppable for a few possessions just to even everything out. Making adjustments makes absolutely no difference. The passing controls are garbage, if you are running a play and you try to pass it to the open player it almost never goes to the right player.I want a realistic basketball game, but I don't want to have to watch youtube tutorials for two weeks before I'm even able to become decent at it. Tone it down 2k.			"

												This is an amazing game, if you can deal with the issues that sets this game a step back. First of all, gameplay is great. Most of  the player movement is realistic but there are few animations that are apsurd and some exploits that some users take advantage of, and of course cheaters. MyCareer was interesting when played for the 1st time but it is very repetitive and boring at times. Pro Am is fantastic, in somewhat ways. The worst part of it is that if you want to play Pro Am solo is very difficult to find players, especially during day because it has really terrible matchmaking. This is the worst part of the whole NBA and is needed to be addressed in future releases. Making something like general chat in each game mode is the key to improving the gameplay for players.All of the above said is really a small part of this game and is ignorable because this game has so many great features which you will enjoy like never before, and I am saying this after playing since NBA 2k9.

If you try to cross up the computer you will be unsuccessful and the ball will be stolen by a big man, which leads to an easy fast break every time. Writing this doesn't show one bit of how angry and frustrated I am about this game.			"

Not totally optimized for competitive online games on PC._______________Steam Optimization as of 18/09/2016[tested with Win 10 Pro - 64 bit - Version 1607- OS Build 14393.187, MoBo MSI Z170A Gaming Pro - FW Build 1.B0, Intel i7 6700k, Gigabyte GeForce GTX 970 Xtreme Gaming Edition - Driver Version 372.70, Kingston Hyper X 8x2 GB 2666 MHz, game and steam client installed on Western Digital Blue 3TB model WD30EZRZ-00Z5HB0]As usual when talking about NBA 2K games, the title faced technical issues throughout the year. Some issues were promptly repaired, others required a longer period to be fixed (remarkable was an online-breaking bug following the Windows 10 anniversary update which impeded almost all the players to connect to the servers for more than one week) while others were never totally resolved (such as the above mentioned online cheaters issue). All in all a well optimized and supported game which, however, didn't really favor the players who wanted to participate in competitive gaming.			"

												I'm just gonna get to the point here since this is my first time on writing a review for any kind of game, so I'm gonna keep it short. Lag, Random Crashes, and disconnections in MyPark are just a FEW of NBA 2K16's glaring flaws. You would think that after all the money 2K makes from their microtransactions, that they would atleast fixed most of the mistakes in their previous games. But Noooo, they decide that it's a waste of time and resources to fix problems on a single game in an annual released series. I swear, 2K is becoming EA in some ways. But 2K maybe worse, mainly because of the fact that unlike EA, 2K doesn't bother fixing any big glitches/bugs. They are only in it for the money. Whoever reads this, please save your money on games that are worth your hard earned money. If we all stop supporting 2K, or any developers who don't care about their fanbase, we can make them change their money grabbing ways.			"

As a gamer myself, I know this experience can be extremely annoying and discouraging. We appreciate customers like you who have the best interest of a fair game in mind. However, here at 2K technical support, we do not have the necessary administrative tools to ban players. But not all are bad news, the developers are aware of unfair player’s and they have procedures to ban those who cheat.You can report unfair players to Steam through their support page. Naturally, if, at any moment, you would like to report someone who's not playing fair, you can always come to us.I hope this clarifies your question, but should you have any other doubts or concerns, let us know and I’ll be happy to assist you.Good luck on the courts!Kind regards,Flora R.2K SupportTo sum things up, if you wanna play with cheaters and have 2k do nothing about it then buy this game, Cheers.

												If 2K fixes the bugs, I'll make this review positive. Maybe..  ""Contains spoilers""MyCareerFirst of all, lets talk about Spike Lee's ""Livin da dream"" story to MyCareer. The story is stereo typical on the highest level possible. I made a  white player, but my whole family is black. Slang words in every sentece is frustrating to hear and watch(subtitles). Conversations are so unreal, stupid and too long.. And you cant even choose your own nickname. So prepare to be called one thing and only ONE THING. The story starts in High School which is pretty cool. 2K tries to add an nice atmosphere, and it's actually decent. After the High School games which are apoximately 4 games(2min quarters), you are getting offers from several Colleges around the country. Then you choose the college you want to attend to and 8 college games later, you are littereally in the NBA. I dont know why 2K want you to rush through theese stages. They should allow you to choose between how many games you want to play, aswell as how many minutes the quarter should last. Because in the end, it doesn't feel real at all. After you get drafted to the NBA, your first season will likewise only be 8 games and then you become a free agent. Luckily after you have chosen your new team, during free agency the main story ends and you can move on with the game and your career. Your second season in MyCareer is where it all falls back into place. It feels like home again and I was actually starting to enjoy the game because I could play throughout a whole season, making endorsements, connections and so on for my player. Pro-Am New to this year's 2K is Pro-Am. I have been looking forward to it, and it was one of the first things I tried out when i started up the game. This game mode is better than ""MyPark"", and especially if you have a couple of friends to play with. It's a 5v5 game, where you control your MyPlayer amongside others, either you team up or you simply just join and wait for 9 others. This game mode has a unique feature, where you can build your own team from the buttom and have friends to join in and play for it. You are able to design and UPLOAD!! your own logo, shirt, arenas and even the scorer's table advertisements! I have already made my hometown's team ""Aalborg Vikings"", designed their jerseys so they look 100% as they do in real life. Costomized their homecourt aswell, and added real advertisements. Let me just say, that I cant wait for my friends to join in!			"

												The game is great, when it works, but constant issues make the game unplayable for extended periods of time, whether it's having  the commentators going silent almost every game, or objects like the crowd, players or the bloody court disappearing altogether, CTDs while loading on the loading screen.  And those are only the minor things.There's also issues with the servers, ""bugfix"" updates that seemingly fix nothing but your ability to successfully launch the game - i.e. CTDs about 2 seconds after the game is launched.To be fair, 2K sports games on pc have always been really buggy in many ways, but this year the variety and consistency of the bugs are pretty damn egregious.  This is the first year that I have actually been frustrated by NBA2K.I would advise caution when purchasing this game if you are anything close to an impatient person, because this game can and at times WILL test your resolve.  I per-ordered the game and I am really disappointed in myself for not waiting for a sale.However, all that being said...When it works, the game is great.			"

												2k just doesn't care about the PC community and well, I can't blame them in the sense that it's not as big on consoles but it doesn't make me want to purchase the game next year. Optimization seems to be good now. Game keeps crashing. I love 2k I've been playing it as far as I can remember but it's sad to see them not giving a F. But let's focus on microtransactions shall we ? Pay $20 to have your played maxed out why not ? The mycareer just seems like a big joke. What were they thinking hiring a racist prick like Spike Lee ? Cmon now. After the latest patch they fixed the PNR cheese but now you can barely make one. I don't do them often at all but when I do, they never work. I'll keep playing this game and you will see my hours increasing because I love basketball and because EA is just a joke (not sure why they keep releasing games) but it would be a lie if I told you that I would recommend this game. Dissapointed (once again).			"

												I'm as white as a polar bear and people call me homie. I'm feeling like Eminem. Anyway, my negative review is about not having customisable pc controls (I haven't even found how to efficiently defend yet, because I don't know the keyboard controls) and it's also about the lack of options in My Career. You know, Spike told me that I'm going to feel like this is real and that I'll have many options in My Career, but I haven't seen anything like that yet. To conclude, I don't recommend this game.

												This game crashes and bugs out more than any game I've ever seen. I play a lot of MyTeam. Every game is a minimum of 25 minutes. I constantly get arbitration failed to load, or the game just crashes. Then I have to give up the win, the MT, and the 25 minutes i wasted. It's funny how their games are like this every single year. Do not buy this game unless you like wasting your time.			"

												This is a tough review to write because there are some things that are really great about this game and others that are really bad.  First of all, if you don't have a new nvidia card then dont even bother because it is not optimised for anything else.  I have a gtx 970 so i can play it pretty much maxed though.  I am going to talk about the my career mode mainly since thats all I have really played and it is pretty much what I buy 2k for.  The problem with this game is the story kind of ruins it.  Your family is black even if you make a white character and the story is really cheese and you don't actually get any choice in any big decisions for your character.  The cut scenes are 20 min long even though they could be summed up in a 1 min scene.  The story definitely affects your character too much.  You don't get to decide what type  of person you want your player to be- spike lee decides that for you.  He also decides that you will leave college after your first year even though they make such a big deal over what a huge decision it is.  One of the biggest issues is that you dont get to play your rookie year.  You only play 8 games and you have no chance to make the playoffs.  Also, your ratings in this game start out at the lowest ever.  only about a 50 overall.  And best of all, you make no vc at all for the high school or college games.  And since you only play 8 games in your first season, you pretty much go into your second season with that same rating.  I think that this is just greed on 2k's part trying to get you to buy vc because if you didnt preorder the game for the extra 10k vc and you are just playing from the starting rating it is really brutal to try and progresss.  It is basically like taking a middle school kid and throwing him in to play with professionals.  It is really annoying to see this happen in a game that I paid 60 bucks for.  And, after all this hype over the story, it ends after the first season.  The story really ♥♥♥♥ed up this game and I really think 2k should just give you an option to skip it entirely and just play your first season as normal.So that is a lot of bad stuff so you would think that this would obviously be a negative review however there actaully is a lot of good stuff as well.  Mainly in terms of the actual gameplay which I feel is what matters most.  2k has fixed a lot of the cheese from previous years and I really do feel like the game plays a lot smoother now and all of the animations look a lot better.  The high school and college games are actually done extremley well even though you dont get to play many games.  There is a lot of little details that they took the time to add that really add to the realism of the high school and college games.  You also have a lot more options to customize your player.  The practice mode and the other options of how to spend your off days is a really nice touch except for the fact that the practice mode is stuck in a side view camera that you cannot change (2k PLEASE FIX THIS) which makes some of the drills pretty much unplayable.  I also really like that you have the ability to see contracts from 3 different teams and try to haggle with them to get more vc and minutes.  Another thing I will add is that, in my opinion, the music in this game is a lot better than in previous 2k games.All in all, there is a lot of bad in this game but I do think 2k pulled through where it really matters which is in the actual gameplay.  And I think that the gameplay is actually so much better than every other 2k game that it makes up for the storyline cheese which is why I gave it a positive review.			"

												New year, new NBA 2KXX...Ok, let's be brief and let's forget for a moment the most devastating, racist and stupid story ever produced for a videogame... also, let's forget the simple fact that the game is, at the end, an NBA 2K15 version with some absurd and useless ""improvements"" (like, the pre-match, the post-match, a lot of cash-grabbing useless accessories...).Is it the game fun? Quite, not as I expected.The control system is still a real pain, too simplified and too difficult at the same time.The animations are... strange! Sometimes they are decent, sometimes they're terrible.Just an example: if you manage to get past some useless story chapters, you'll see a scene where your ""mother"" has exactly the ""smile"" of Alien!Look, not kidding...Also, the game suffer for an incredible list of poor design choices and strange behaviours, that, for example, let you with a terrible shooting system (and, sadly, this is a problem that got worse, with this season game).At the end, not really worthy his price.

												The people in this god damn mother ♥♥♥♥ing game are idiots. Spike Lee's storyline is total crap. It makes you an African American in Harlem, New York, no matter what race you are, and only has one story line. The highschool and college aspects of the game are trash as well. You get 3-4 games in each, and thats that. They only have 10 ♥♥♥♥in colleges to choose from (I only had ♥♥♥♥in 9). You also get 8 NBA GAMES PER ♥♥♥♥ING SEASON. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ 2K!!!??? WHY WOULD YOU LET SPIKE LEE RUIN ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR MODES IN YOUR ♥♥♥♥IN GAME. This game also has 2 other modes that are absolute trash (because of the game itself, and all the ♥♥♥♥ing idiots that bought this game). My♥♥♥♥INGPark is god awful this year. All the idiots that go on for the PC can not ♥♥♥♥ing play at all. And when there are courts open and there are three other people in the park (if you're lucky) you might be able to play a game of 21 with them. But what do the ♥♥♥♥ing idiots on mypark do when I'm on. They go to other ♥♥♥♥ing games that have 4-6 player slots when there are 3 ♥♥♥♥ING PLAYERS IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. Also the Pro-Am is complete trash. There are never enough players that join the games to EVEN GET THEM STARTED. I only bought the pc version because I knew it was moddable, but after this, I am considering switching to my non-moddable PS4 for NBA 2K games. DO NOT BUY!			"

												It has its issues. MyCareer story was awfuly bad and cheesy. VC earnings are to low for the rating your player is when you enter the NBA. I don't mind having a 55 rating but come on 300-500 VC a game will take like 2-3 seasons to hit rating 80. Other than that gameplay is excellent as always and smooth as well. So if you are looking for a solid basketball game you can enjoy this is it.			"

												Being a huge Basketball fan I gotta say this game is a real disapointment, 2k really needs to take out there earbuds and just listen to the fans feedback and maybe they will be able to make something worth while. As you can see I played this game for over 100 hours which shows you my love for Basketball and lemme tell you a few of the many problems I've encountered. One some of the shots in this game is ridiculous, Playing as Michael Jordan he missed 12 out of the 20 shots he took in the game and all of his shooting attributes are over 90 which just adds to the ridiculousness. Also playing as Allen Iverson (the god of Ankle Breaking) he hasn't broken ankles barely at all no matter how many dribble moves I do. And don't get me started on the Small Forward and the Layups in this game, Even on Pro (Medium Difficulty) the opposing players play as if it were the playoffs, It's near impossible to get pass the defense hence you have to shoot 3 or mid shooters and like I said before they will miss easy even if you are WIDE OPEN and have a 90+ overall at shootings and even if you get a near perfect release, I man heck I missed a few even with a Perfect Green Release. Not only are these the issues but the game crashed a lot and I have a Windows 10 Alien Ware so I should be good. MyCareer is not as good as last year although there are some good aspects to it. If you try to send a ticket to 2k support they will mostly likely tell you the same thing they tell everyone else, Verify the Cache or redownload the game. All in all the 2k support service is trash. Now that I got that out of the way lemme get to the Pros. The graphics are amazing 2k does really well at graphics and there are a lot of things you can do such as play as a bunch of classic teams and players such as Jabbar and MJ. Really that's all the good stuff I can think of off the top of my head. All in all in conclusion the Cons outways the Pros and as you can see from the reviews above from User Reviews people will probally agree. I suggest you get 2k15 or just wait for 2k17.			"

												This game is complete garbage, it's not worth reviewing so I'll list a bunch of problems I have with it.The shots are a complete gamble, whether it's a wide open layup or a contested 3 pointer. It doesn't matter if you're Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry, or Joel Anthony, you'll miss pretty much every shot. Even if you're wide open for 3 with a 99 overall 3 point shooter, you'll miss it most of the time. The AI literally shoots through you, and don't bother trying to defend the shot, you'll get a foul. According too 2k, players like Leandro Barbosa can make 360 layups THROUGH players like Moses Malone. It doesn't matter what your layup rating is, you'll miss them all. The. Time.My Career is complete garbage, you're forced to play as a stereotypical black guy from ""Da hood"". Even if you're white and make a white character, you have a ""twin"" black sister and black parents. You're forced to interact with a typical loud mouth black guy and you can't say ""Hey! I hate this guy! I want nothing to do with him!"" There's no choices in this god awful ""story"" so thanks piece of s**t Spike Lee, the only world and dream in his mind is all black. You're not ""Livin Da Dream"" you're living Spike Lee's stereotypical race obsessed world. Stay the hell away from 2k. And don't give me the whole ""Most video game characters are white"" because in this game, you're supposed to create your own character and play as him. I don't see any games where you create your character and you're forced to play as a certain race. Thank god you can skip most of the cutscenes and it only lasts one season. Speaking of the one season, it's your rookie season which is wasted since you only play 8 games. You also can't skip these games, or the high school/college games, so if you've played MyCareer before, you have to do the same thing again.The game is filled with hackers and 2k is doing NOTHING once again, people should stop supporting this terrible company. Say what you want about Live, but EA is actually improving the game. Sadly it's ""cool"" to hate EA so the biased ""reviewers"" give it a 5/10 or ignore it, and the blind sheep bash it. MyTeam is completely dead, I started Road To The Playoffs after completing Domination, and of course I can't get out of the 9th seed because the mode is dead. It's bad enough that I can't do a ""Head to Head"" and use my very good team, instead I'm stuck with dog s**t bronze players (they're the worst in the game) even though I have 6 amethyst players the rest being gold. I only managed to play one game, and it lagged like crazy! The shots were delayed, the FPS dropped to 30 during free throws (which were also delayed) and timeouts. It felt impossible for me to play defense, it felt very loose. The servers still suck, SURPRISE! As I said above the servers STILL suck and 2k isn't improving them.The animations are clunky, slow, stiff, and unresponsive. When you go up for layups you will either (A) Miss and your character slowly walks AWAY from the basket instead of grabbing the rebound, or (B) Miss and you jump multiple times because this god awful game can't register movement properly. It's impossible to play defense because the AI EASILY blows past you and you can't turn around in time to catch them.DON'T BUY THIS GARBAGE GAME EVEN IF IT'S $10!!!! STOP SUPPORTING THIS GREEDY COMPANY OR THEY WON'T IMPROVE THE NEXT GAMES!!!!EDIT: Another big problem with this game is turnovers, if you try to dribble near a defender they'll steal it most of the time.

												Bought the game when it went on sale on Jan 30, but have not been able to enjoy the game for 2 weeks.  Everytime I finish a Domination game on MyTeam I get an ''Arbitration is taking too long' error and I lose my game progress BUT I still use up my contracts.  I thought it was a minor blimp, maybe some server problems with the increase traffic because of the sale.  So I tried another game, and another, and another, and another...all still with the same error.  I tried to get a refund but was denied by Steam because I played over 2 hours on my each attempts.  I set up a ticket with 2k Support, this was 2 weeks ago when I started to have this problem, and they still have not came back with an answer, just running me around.  If you look through Reddit  or the Steam forums, you can see this is common for the PC version.			"

												OVERVIEW:Graphics: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10MyCareer: 3/10MyPark: 8.5/10MyGM: N/ASTORY A.K.A MYCAREERWhat a story. Not. You don't get to play every game which is a huge negative (not sure how it was in other NBA games, but that's a big turn off). You only get to play eight games in your rookie season. I mean, what? Sorry? Nah, get outta here. Three quaters of the time I was on the bench, too. The actual 'storyline' wasn't too long either. However, the overall story was, how can I say it? Average. I've seen better stories, but I've also seen worse.As for the gameplay - top notch, can't fault it. I lag a little bit because of my specs, though. Anyone with good enough specs should be able to play this game at a high frame-rate no problem.Being as MyCareer is a big part of the game, I'm giving this game a negative review because it didn't stand up to expectations and could have been improved a lot more. The creative teams need to think long and hard to improve it for 2K17. However, everything else runs alright. What I have noticed & encountered are a lot of cheaters online. Which, again, is a big put off. If you want it just to play occassionaly, such as quick games and whatnot - go ahead. For the story? I wouldn't buy it after playing it. But hey ho.			"

												I love the 2k series but I'm seriously considering not buying for PC next season if at all. First of all this release is extremely unstable and as usual 2k is slow to fix the bugs. I've been dealing with framerate issues from launch. They've patched it and now the issues seems to be isolated to playing career mode where the game fluxuates from running fine to speeding up to slowing down. I've tried playing the game with all of the graphical settings on low and I'm seeing the same results. Aside from the technical issues, I wasn't very happy with the opeing of career mode either. Going from high school to college then the NBA was cool but being forced to watch Spike Lee's preach story was not. I was forced to watch a 20 minute cutscene that I couldn't skip or pause? Ridiculous. I feel that the story had a good moral but came off as forced and preachy. Not to mention the game features another stereotypical portrayal of an Italian American with questionable character that Spike Lee is now becoming known for. I as an African American male can't support all of his views.On the gameplay front, 2K is still top notch. Controls are again improved. Excellent game on that count. However I'm hoping that another developer starts making A+ basketball games as 2K hasn't been forced to step it up since they have no competition. They need to stop releasing unfinished products.

												This game tried to do so many cool things but all of them are buggy as all hell. You'll jump for rebounds and half the time it clips through you and goes to the guy you boxed out or the AI will just throw you behind and them even though you're in front of them.Also, if you like them to poke out the ball in the most ridiculous ways that make no sense along with more clipping to go along with it to help cause that problem.You'll also miss good shots all the time. Like too much of the time. I've missed 16 shots in a row that were all great shots that were in my strong zone.I just can't give a good review to a game that has so many issues as much as I play it. it's bugginess is just bad....Also the Turnovers from the AI ARE TERRIBLE!  They literally are telepathic mind readers just an FYIYou're character also has a lack of hands. half the time the balls just bounces through his hand without grabbing the ball at all. Bad mechanicsAlso the refs are blind half the time. Especially when it's a player with a decent rating they will get away with a lot of fouls. In a game? right? idk explain to me why I hear a loud smack on my player and the ref acts like nothing happenedAny player considered good also will make you miss 90% of your shots. Just by staring at youThere's LITERALLY an Endless list of♥♥♥♥♥♥wrong with this game. Buy it on sale if you absolutley have to have it.There's a reason that this game's negative is above 50%. They got really lazy and just plain pooped on their good ideas.The controls are terrible.Your guy will fumble about like a bumbling ♥♥♥♥en retard every time you try to do something. NPC's will steal the ball off of clear fouls or just complete ratchet design			"

												I've recently got really into the NBA during the NFL off-season so thought I'd give this game a try. I got it for £9.50 (about $12) and I'm loving it so far. I've mainly played the MyCareer part of the game along with the MyGM. I also managed to get the NBA2K16 Companion App which works very well with this game, the extra VC from using it is very useful. I first started playing through the MyCareer using mouse and keyboard and really didn't like it so the next day I went and bought an Xbox360 wired controller (The afterglow one) and it made the game so much better. Special moves and tricks are much easier to perform with it and it just generally makes navigating menus so much easier. The graphics are nice. The players look great and gameplay is mostly smooth (only lags sometimes during the loading of the game during the pre-game show that plays before every match to keep you entertained while the game loads). The customisation of the player and the MyCourt is good. My only gripe is that during the MyCareer, you get to connect with NBA stars who give you rewards when you spend off days with them. Some of these rewards state you get a special jersey/shoe, which I (and many others by the looks of it) presumed you could wear, this is not the case. Some of them you can wear, but most are put on display in your MyCourt which, although looks nice, I think I would have liked the option to wear them. The actual story of MyCareer is... meh. It's very generic and some of it dosen't make for an authentic experience (yes, I'm talking about the fact that even if you are paper white, your parents and sister are still black) which feels odd. Also, I'm not too keen on the voice of your MyPlayer. I would have much preffered them to have a customisable voice which better represents you or what you want your MyPlayer to sound like. I heard quite bad things about the soundtrack for this game and, when I listened to it myself, it's not too bad, but, the thing that lets it down is that, as quite a large amount of the songs are censored, you often end up with lots of 'breaks' during each track as it is just muted out. Some songs have tonnes of censored words in which makes it even more annoying. The soundtrack is redeemed for me as it has some good songs on it such as 'Cult of Personality' which I was quite surprised by.    In conclusion, you would definatly benifit from having a controller with this game. The customisation of assests within the game is great, and once you get past the cutscene parts of MyCareer and start playing full seasons, it's really good (the 'story' part should only take about a few hours to complete so it's not bad). The NBA 2K16 Companion app is very much reccomended and it's fun to play when you're not at your PC. I would reccomend this game to anyone :)			"

												Easily the worst NBA 2K to be released since 2K12. The dribble moves this year are awful and useless, pick and rolls don't work most of the time, plays are clunky and bad, and the AI defense is godlike. MyCareer is bad, once again you just get lackluster teammates and you can't do anything useful without buying VC or playing other gamemodes for hours to earn it because your character starts at a 55 overall which is a joke. Not bothering with this game anymore, the gameplay is simply terrible and anyone who states otherwise is playing on Rookie or Pro difficulty. I wish I could get my money back for this; I've been playing every NBA 2K game since 2012 and this one is genuinely the worst.			"

												In an interactive media form such as gaming, the my career story has no level of interactivity.  The other characters say that the choice for certain things is all yours but in the end, Spike Lee makes the choices for you and you are just along for the long drawn out CGI movie of a story mode. ( the story is actually a watchable movie at the end.)   Once I saw that, I knew that none of my choices would change the story at all.  This story mode was a bore to play.  Mechanics of the game are good but I guess no one had the courage to stand up to Spike and tell him that the story mode was just straight up bad.  Story Mode: 3/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall 5.5/10I'm going to not recommend this game at the full retail price.  I got it for half off so I can't complain about that too much but for $60, I don't think enough innovation has been made to justify that.			"

												Bought it today because its on sale.. HUGE bball fan and a big gamer, This game is awful. The detail and graphics are great. But thats all I like. So far Ive encountered serious interface complexity, and in game bugs which ive had to troubleshoot. I havent played much, a few games.. but in my 3rd game the court was not a court. It was a black rectangle i was playing on.. I checked and found that its a bug that has been reported for quite some time yet nothing has been done to fix it, also found a control bug which wouldnt let me exit the game, had to ctrl alt delete several times.. Basically super messy and buggy. 2k cares about getting paid but doesnt seem to fix issues which they are aware of.			"

												Game is beautiful, runs well at 4k resolution and the classic teams are great as well.I liked the game from what I played of it.  If you are a fan of the current NBA roster and teams might be good for you to pick up.However, for me, I'm just going to stick to 2k11.  As I'm not a pro at the game, and I'm not interested in my player, just team vs team and doing franchise seasons of 83 games 2k11 works for me still.That game runs at 4k, still looks quite good, though not as realistic as 2k16.I'm too casual of a player of NBA games to jump to this version. It piqued my interest because of the Michael Jordan edition, however for an MJ experience 2k11 still wins in that regard with Jordan challenges and the teams included.I usually buy a 2K bball game every 5 years as usually enough has changed by that time for the game to feel very fresh for me.Maybe I'll buy 2k17 next year, depends on the changes.

												What do you get when you buy this game? The same exact game as last year. MyGM, MyLeague, and the rest of the modes are exactly the same right on down to the graphics in the data screens. The only difference is the MyCareer mode they did all the advertisement on with Spike Lee, but it's really really REALLY bad. Literally the worst♥♥♥♥♥♥ever. I had a feeling the Spike Lee thing would fail hard and it did. No choices at all for you to make in a mode that is supposed to be ""MyCareer."" Spike Lee wrote a script and they force your player down the road of his ill-written gibberish. They don't even allow you to choose the NBA team you begin your career on, taking away some of the freedom you had in the previous game. And the first 7 games you play in High School and College go 100% unrewarded. You don't get any gold to improve your player and drafted out of college you are the worst player in the NBA alongside being the worst rookie out of your draft class. The first NBA season of your career? Lasts 8 games. And you are rewarded with very little gold, forcing you towards microtransactions even harder in order to make your NBA player be able to compete with the rest of the League.This is the first game I'll request a refund from in my life on Steam. I'm disgusted and ashamed. 2k has really dropped the ball here.			"

												This game is such a disappointment in terms of the MyCareer mode, I was so hyped leading up to release - I think people have vented that thoroughly, and I agree with them - so I'm not going to bash that aspect anymore.The other part of the problem for me are the bugs, crashes and overall tardiness of the game. For PC via steam, expect the game to crash.. a lot! My commentary regularly drops out, The scouting and assignment screen sometime just lingers without any actual report coming up, the halftime locker room is sooooo slow to progress, and you can't skip to the evaluation - it skips the whole lot. Trying to skip through timeouts, or substitutions is a nightmare, it takes FOREVER -  and a lot of the time you just have to suck it up and wait through the whole process before getting back to playing.I do however like the physics of the game, and even enjoy the new controls.. I generally play a big man and use a lot of post moves - so the post up trigger is really working for me. The controls do seem sluggish compared to 2k15, but it may just be the limits they have now put on responsiveness and speed for bigger players. Dunks seem to be easier to perform, my player even with a 55 rating was posterizing everyone. I also have fallen victim to purchasing the MJ special edition - and played my entire rookie season without any boosts or help with VC... still no indication on when my VC will come through - it's the 29th, I waited till release day.. still waiting. The game seems to rely, HEAVILY, and I mean HEAVILY on you PURCHASING VC.. the my NBA 2k16 phone app hasn't come out, opportunities to earn VC in other ways are limited... It just really sucks. especially after shelling out for the special edition.I would recommend everyone stay away from this game until they fix all the bugs. Most ppl are going to hate the MyCareer story I feel - If they fix all the gameplay bugs then the game may be worth purchasing on discount so you can play with your online friends. REFUND REQUESTED!			"

												The pre-game show, the interviews and pretty much any ""story"" or non-gameplay element in this game really drag it down. You cannot take this game seriously when each game starts off with some crappy analysis by a horribly modeled Shaq with unsynched voice over. Hell, even the tutorials are basically videos of gameplay voiced by unenthuastic pro players reading off a script. You can't understand what they're saying because they're basically mumbling. The money they spent getting pros to do voiceovers would have better been spent on quality programmers, because the game runs like crap, the online is unplayable and none of the instant replays, ""slam cams"" or Man of the Game cut scenes work. With that said, the gameplay is pretty solid as usual but nothing new from the previous NBA2K games.			"

Posted: August 29, 2016
												Seeing as how I have 850 hrs in 2k16, I feel I have played the game to warrant a full opinion and review on this product. This review will cover multiple aspects of the game, and will hopeufully serve as a guideline so that others can refer to it when necessary. With that being said, i'd like to stress that this review will focus heavily of the woes of the game, particularly for the PC audience. This review will cover 3 main topics: Gameplay, Gamemodes, and Community, as well as final comments and extra's. Each topic will then be scored out of 10, and at the bottom will be my conclusion as well as a TL;DR statement. Lets begin.Gameplay: While the game's movement system is flawed at times, for the most part your controlled character is able to move fluidly and resembles the real thing. In game controls differ slightly from previous 2k games, but its nothing you can't learn relatively quickly. In regards to animations, the game claimed that ""you would never be locked into an animation again"" but that is simply not the case. there are countless times when you go up for a dunk, but your character will just throw the ball across the backboard, resulting usually in the other team grabbing aan easy 2 points. Animations can somethimes go a bit wonky, but for the most part it looks good. the same options that are available in previous games are available, and the game can be customized to fit how you want to play. There have also been multiple patches to the game, most of which are needed to fix game breaking bugs (See reviews below regarding Win10 bug) the gameplay is solid, but it leaves a bit to be desired. my score for the gameplay would be a mediocre 6.5/10.Gamemodes and Online Functionality: NBA 2k16 features a plethora of gamemodes, each providing a different and fun experience... to console players. PC contains the same features that are present on console, however, with such a small player base, it is near impossible to find an online game in any mode other than MyPark. Modes like MyLeague (Previously Association), MyTeam, and Play Now Online all contain an online aspect, but it is barely played as there are not many players that aare participating ONLINE in those gamemodes. (These gamemodes are still fun in a local setting, but you are not playing 100% of the game) It is because of this lack of online functionality that I didnt fully enjoy my purchase. The gamemodes in 2k16 are great fun, earning an 8.5/10, but the online sections of the modes failed miserably, earning only a 2.5/10.Community: Many players within the community are extremely helpful, and some can offer great advice and have a strong opinion regarding the state of the game. The PC community is paricularly special as we don't condone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from devs.  if your game sucks, we will tell you.however ther is a section of the community that spols it for the majority, and that would be hackers and cheaters, of which there is a significant margin of players that do so. Hackers ruin the game for so many, an its a shame that they exist, but the main cause that they do is that the devs have a terrible anti-cheat system, sometimes even banning those that did not commit any sort of unjust act. in addition to hackers and cheaters, there are also scammers that will attempt to trade with another member of the community, just so they can cheat them out of a card. iit is because of these types of people that the community is not where it should be just yet, and why i have to give the community a 6.5/10.TL;DR: All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone wanting to pickup a basketball sim. Rather, I would suggest you acquire this game by other means. If, at that point, you decide that you want to play modes such as MyTeam, and MyPark, even though they have a dwindling player base, then purchase. As of right now, this game is not for PC players, because it lacks suport in that area. I hope this review was able to inform potential buyers. Peace out ganstas.			"

Don't you dare make me play highschool games, college games, and then go into the leage at the same skill level throughout all three. EVERY YEAR THEY GIVE YOU A POS PLAYER TO PLAY IN THE NBA!!!

												NBA 2K16, on the PC.Well, its a amazing game.  I played NBA 2K since Iverson was on the cover.The graphics are amazing on this game.There's MyCareer, people are giving this alot of hate because if you make your Player white he still is sounding as an African American. I dont have any problems with this and I dont know why people are making a really big problem of this Just get over this. Are you playing 2K16 for the sound of your player? Or do you want to play some basketball. MyPark is good actually. I thougt that if you're playing on the PC, you will not find any players on the park. But there are some people. But I recommend you playing with friends. Ofcourse you can play with randoms, but I can guarentee you that you will rage. Since people dont pass and have no teamwork. And think that they are Stephen/Lebron or ma boi Paul George.Dont even think that you can hoop in my park alone and dont even pass to your teammate. Be a nice teammate and help each other and dont do things solo. If you want your Rep dropped. There are some annoying things in MyPark... 1. Its really hard to find a game if your a Rookie, since everyone just leaves if you join the 'next spot'. They think a rookie cant hoop.2. There is lag/glitches.3. This is my opinion but the taunting is really annoying, If you take a L ( Loss) on my park all your opponents are going to be in front of you and just taunting you. And you just have to accept it :(.MyTeam:What else can I say? its actually good really fun has a nice FIFA Ultimate Team feeling.Pro-Am: I never had a chance to play it on PC. But I played it on XBOX. The problem with Pro-Am is that its actually really hard to find some people when I join Pro-Am I just see 2 people. Or is that me? I'll update this when I get a chance to play it.You can customise everything.You can change your player from head to toe, you can even change your Court.PlayNow: What can I say?Performance: No problems,  some lag on MyPark and the other Online modes.Should you get it?:NBA 2K17 is coming out soon, and If I was you, just get this game cause if you really want a good basketball games just get this and play MyPark till 2K17 comes out. Dont even try Live 16. Just get this. At full price: No :(.Finisher:I give this game a 8/10, fix the glitches/lag 2K.  "

Going down the court side to side with someone or even infront? Nope hes bodying you the whole way slowing you to the basket. Career mode is probably the worst thing I've ever played in my life. Just wait til draft. It's five minutes of them drafting til you can continue. Why is there so many unskippable cut scenes???? Seriously?

												MyCareer 2k15>2k16Ok, so I bought the game on the release. It didn't work. I couldn't play the game for atleast a month. I had to be in touch with the customer service with 3-4 diffenrent people which got annoying during time because I had to explain what I had done etc. to each person. The fault was 2Ks. They fixed the bugs after awhile so I could play and I was disapointed.I am playing MyCareer only and loved the nba 2k15 MyC, it was visually good, gameplay was fun and you could be the hero who made the shots that were ment to actually go in. This year I desided to make a Shooting Guard, who was just focused on shooting. My SG is now 81 overall, 85 shooting, 50layup, passing 40 or something.1. Shooting (85). I can't make any shots that are open. This shooter shouldn't be in the nba, fact. I haven't even tried to do contact shots since I can't even make open shots. (tried different animations Kobe, Klay and some free ones. Didn't have any impact. Simulation, default, casual doesn't matter. I tried if the sliders worked, nothing. And I'm playing on Superstar, im no rookie, HoF in 2k15)2. Layups. This guy should definetly not be in the nba. This guy misses every layup even on a fast break alone and he manages to miss a layup. 50 layup shouldn't be that critical on that point.3. Passing. Man I can make every pass. Don't boost your passing skill since it is useless. (Unless you want to make traffic lobs)4. Dripple. It's so sluggish. Dripple is extremely hard because the guy doesn't follow your controls at all. (Can be fixed with dirrenent animations, maybe? But if this is true, 2K, delete the rest of the animations because they are useless so stop making more of them)Spike Lee start off was kinda boring since it didn't have any inpact on the gameplay, just some random cutscenes.2K, You really don't have to make the game more ""realistic"" with the scoring % because it makes the game extremely unrealistic when you can't make buckets that even I would do under preassure and exhaustion. I don't even play basketball. 2k15 to 2k16 was just a cheese fix patch.If you are considering buying this game, don't do it. Online is fun but if you want to play MyCareer it will♥♥♥♥♥♥you the f off. 2k15 was great and I'm going to start playing that instead of this. Maybe 2k17 will be better, who knows? Listen to the community before you buy it though. I wasted my 50e and I actually regret it.NBA fan from Finland			"

												Was really enjoying the NBA My Career mode. However, after you finish the storyline part and begin the meat of the career,  a major issue occurs. When playing the games in My Career, you will get to the end of the game and choose Advance to get to the next day of the season. Unfortunately, this causes the game to crash for me. When you restart, you have to play the game over again....and...another crash. There is a major thread on Steam and appears related to the latest patch. Unfortunately, it is still unresolved as I write this (started in May, now it is August). So while the gameplay is fun, the features are limited and ultimately leads to a thumbs down.			"

												I have to say, the overall gameplay is good, i like the court atmosphere, it feels more alive, more dynamic, but there are things that bothers me such as the commentator sound would suddenly stop in the middle of the game, and resume after the quarter has finished. As for the my career, I can't argue much, the overhyped storyline turns out to be a dull storyline afterall. As for now, I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

												Ya know, after NBA 2k15 (which was IMO the best basketball game made in a long time) I was very excited for this game.  I read the reviews, which a lot of them were negative.  Well, I have major regrets that I didn't listen to the reviews.  THIS GAME IS FLAT OUT HORRIBLE!!!  It seems like the devolopers spent all their time on the story portition & no time at all on the actual game play of the game.  The game play is just awful!  The players move very slow, which means you will lose your guy on defense very easliy (even in turbo mode).  The controller settings are a little different from 2k15, so you'll have to get used to them.  When you pick your player on the court, it feels like you're a robot & not a player.  NBA 2k15 was much different.  You felt like an actual player on the court and were a part of the game, not just some robot running around (slowly) not doing much.  I was going to return it, but I thought maybe I was being to critical, so I gave it more and more chances.  Now I can't return it, and I will most likely go back to NBA 2k15.  This pisses me off, because I want the roster to be up to date, but I guess I gotta sacrafice a new roster for better (a lot better) gameplay.  I don't know what the developers were thinking releasing this crap.  Next time I'm going to listen to the reviews...  ;(			"

												Overall, I enjoyed NBA 2K16.I played NBA 2K13 on my WII and I was amazed, but 2K did much more in NBA 2K16.My Player-The story is okay, which is different from most reviewers that hated the story. I liked the aspect of having a family and all, but, I'm not a racist or anything, you don't choose the color of your family. My character's color is different from his family. Also, you can only play 8 games in your rookie season. However, you do get to play in high school and college.My Team-I never played My Team on NBA 2K13 on my WII because it wasn't a feature. I did like My Team, but it encourages people to spend more money to get better players. It challenged me because I don't have a controller so no perfect releases for me. It was good, though. I do have a terrible team, but it is a money grabber.My GM/My League-I don't know how many of you watch CSB YT, but I do. I really have wanted to ""rebuild"" teams in NBA 2K16. I'm an avid basketball fan, so I was really excited. It's easy to do but it is very fun and creative to give you a simulation of what it is like to be an owner of a team. Who should you sign? Who should you trade? Who should you draft? Etc. I really enjoyed My GM/My League.Play Now-I liked Play Now. I enjoyed playing as my favorite teams online against other people and their favorite teams. I notice that most people choose the Cavaliers or the Warriors, but I like playing as low seeded playoff teams or non-playoff teams like the Bulls and the Jazz.Online-Heck yeah! Online is great! I was able to download new rosters, new draft classes, and was able to play online cleanly! You could do a lot online!Overall Score-This game was very good. It's not a 10/10 game, but I would rate it 9/10! Very enjoyable and fun!			"

												This game is huge. There are lots of different things to do, different playmodes, everything from single player to multiplayer, to fantasy draft teams and realistic seasons.EDIT: I am changing this review into a negative one, because a recent patch to fix an exploit broke the player icons, where they stopped showing. It is now impossible to do icon passing, pick and rolls and other passing as there are no icons indicating which player you are emphasizing on. Actually game-breaking.Why I like it the most is that it seems as a realistic simulation of a basketball game. It's hard, but in a rewarding way. You can learn and get better: there are tactics to take care of, learn how various players play best, practice complex offense and defence strategies, learn how to do combos to score. There are seemingly endless possibilities, and the customization of every single match-up seems endless, if that is what you want. The story part of the game is a little weird though: you can customize your character, but no matter what, you will have a twin sister who is black. If you chose a different race, it can take away some of the immersion..The game crashes a few times in the menus, and a few of the cut-scenes were a bit laggy. But the game plays smoothly and fine, and I haven't experienced anything game-breaking. Note that it is absolutely essential to play with controller. It also works really well to do local coop with two controllers. I suggest it to every basketball fan, without any doubts.			"

												Honestly here's my advice... wait for 2K17 and hope for the best...Or buy 2K15 for dirt cheap. At this point 2K16 isn't worth it.Here's why:-It's buggy... to put it simply, it has more performance problems than the previous year-Commentators cut out randomly in games, music sometimes plays and sometimes doesn't, and honsetly... while I'm talking about music... the playlist is pretty weak at points-The players respond to your actions and commands soooo slowly... you flick the stick right and ♥♥♥♥ing curry responds like hes stuck in the mud or he's as quick as my 92 year old great grandmother. -Btw I love the spin move. This game will make you dislike it, loathe it, hateeeee it because of how slowly it responds. -Shot timing is considerably slower and harder to get used to then on a console-2K added cool features for this year's game, but then cut tons of corners in places like arena design and other things -The Spike Lee career mode story was cool, interesting to follow, sure, but I have two major problems. One: (nobody go and cry about this now it's a fact) the story mode is designed and intended only for a black audience. Typical Spike Lee ladies and gents. I understand exactly why he was chosen to do this, but cmon. There's a huge audience that gets the story mode ruined for them because it makes no sense at all. I've got a pastey white, blonde-haired girly boy point guard who has a ghetto twin sister and speaks like DMX taught him the language. Second major problem with the career mode: IT SKIPS THE ♥♥♥♥ING ROOKIE SEASON. Any player development, records, acheivements, personal accomplishments, forget it, all of it gets condensed into 8 unfulfilling games. The game lets you play 8 games of your rookie season while bouncing back and fourth between the games and the Spike Lee story. The Career mode is amazing after the stupid Spike Lee distraction is over. I ould have a much less sour opinion if it didn't bite a chunk out of the actual game...			"

												First of all, gameplay-wise this game is excellent. Control over the gameplay feels smooth and especially playing with friends is great fun. The problems are mostly with the online experience and support for PC..I'm not going to go into the problems the game has had during launch and all, but will focus on the current issue - This game does not work with Windows 10 Anniversary Update. I have over 300 hours played with Windows 10 x64, but after the Anniversary Update NBA 2K16 stopped working (every other game remains unaffected by the update). The support from 2K to PC players remains awful (you can see that if you browse any discussion related to this issue), so I assume I will not get to play this game ever again since 2K17 is going to be released soon. And I'm afraid to buy that game because of how badly 2K supports PC players :(e. THE ISSUE WITH WINDOWS 10 HAS BEEN FIXED! A positive surprise from 2K that they actually did fix it. This is not enough for me to recommend this game on PC though, because this has not been the only problem with the game. Move your gaze to 2K17, hoping it will have better functionality on PC.			"

												Worst MyCareer ever. Most linear storyline with absolute no choices. No emotion attachment to any characters, in fact making me hate most of them. High school and College ball part were pointless since no matter how well you did, once you're in your rookie year, you get♥♥♥♥♥♥on. No minutes, teamates don't pass, your stats are trash and the flow of the game is terrible. It is a pay to win in order to do well in MyCareer as you need at least half a mil of VC to even do decent at the game. Frequent crashes, especially in MyCareer, having won a game, then game crashes and have to replay game just to lose. 2K wtf are yous doing?			"

												If you have the latest version of windows 10 do not buy this game and do not buy/pre-order nba 2k17 until this issue is resolved. The game is completly worthless without online connectivity. No current rosters, no draft class, no online modes, and yes even carrer mode is handicaped by this. Worst part is 2k has yet to respond to any of this, they ignore it and are still trying to hype up nba 2k17 with a couple screen shots and a video that you could have made with nba 2k16 graphics. Other game companies do not get away with this neither should 2k. Do not release a ""new"" game with a 10 year old engine when your current game STILL selling for 60 is not working for the majority of your customers. Finally all we can hope for is the return of EA Live so this 1 game market♥♥♥♥♥♥ends.			"

												Absolute trash. If you want to spend money on a basketball game, get 2k13. I'm not quite sure how the algorithms work for this game, but in My Career mode, as the Golden State Warriors, we can cream the cavs or pacers or clippers, but when it comes to playing the bucks or 76ers your team cannot even hit open jumpers! I was up 15 points at the half, I got out of the game for 6 minutes and we were down by 10. 6 minutes!!!! This game is also trash because when you get caught in an animation there's nothing you can do, if yopur guy decides to cross twice, he'll just lose the ball to a center. Absolute trash, these devs were only worried about flashy content, not stuff that would actually improve gameplay. 2k blows, I wish I could have a refund!			"

												Having been a huge NBA 2K fan (I have put in more than 100 hours into each iteration for the past 6 years), this years is a HUGE disappointment.  The new soap opera that is My Player is beyond corny and unrelatable.  The one thing that this games is supposed to be about is basketball, however in the first season I was only allowed to play 8 games and had what felt like 3 hours of unwatchable cutscenes.  The lack of playing has left my player still in the 50's as I am unable to improve the player if I can't play with him.  I've only played this game for a handful of hours but I am ready to uninstall and spend my time on something that I will actually enjoy.  I kept coming back to this series due to the MyPlayer mode, however this year you have the least control over your player and they made it a joke.  Unless this changes goodbye NBA 2K.			"

												A really fun game to play with friends or solo. However, this is probably the 3rd or 4th year in a row that 2k has had release issues with the VC purchases not working at all as well as the pre-order extra VC not being added. The graphics are amazing on the PC and the modes are fun. BUT, it is sad to see 2k fall short and not be 100% ready on launch day. We pre-ordered for a reason and paid for services that have not yet been provided by the mfg... some might call that fraud. I am hoping that 2k will resolve this issue quickly, if not it might be time to go back to NBA live or stock to playing a college title. My recommend is yes/no. Just like last year it took them a while to fix most of the issues, right now I would hold off on the game, but if you love basketball I would check the reviews and 2k website in about a month to see if all has been fixed and then get the game.

												Bought this game expecting a lot more than I actually got. I expected the graphics to be a lot better, but they are actually pretty bad, it doesn't run in 1080p which bothers me because there is a lot of pixel work you can see. Also the game is really buggy and it's hard for me to get through cut scenes in the game without it glitching or freezing. There is also a lot of bugs in this game, like the sound cutting out and the commentators voices stop playing. Also the online portion of this game is absolutely horrible, majority of the people hack on this game and you have to face people who are taller, faster and stronger than you and it just sucks. Basically, I bought this game expecting it to be better and I just really didn't like it at all. If you're thinking of buying this game, and are looking at the reviews for it, I suggest not buying it. It is a waste of money to buy on PC. If you are really in to basketball and like the NBA series, I suggest buying it for console, it would be 10x better. I was one of the people who read the reviews but yet still decided to buy it, don't be like me and waste your money. This game is not going to be anything like you expected it to be, DON' BUY IT!

												Updated:  Dear NBA 2k16,     ♥♥♥♥ you too.  I pre-ordered the Jordan Version for 80 dollars....  They did not provide promised pre-order bonus because apparently they can write whatever they want on the store page and than not deliver but that's ok apparently.  I have owned many versions of your product (this is my 3rd just on steam) and let me tell you this will be the last.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  This company is a bunch of lying scheming scumbags who ♥♥♥♥ over people who buy there product.  I WANT MY PROMISED PRE-ORDER BONUS YOU ♥♥♥♥S.  I also want MYCAREER not Spike Lees trashbag story.  No offense to Spike Lee and go knicks but you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s have ruined MyCareer mode (my favorite ofc) and turned it into a trashbag story mode full of hammy cutscenese with NO ABILITY TO DECIDE.  Even the couple of schools they offer you are always the same.  I want to play for Duke or Kentucky but ofc I can't but its ""My""Career right?  Hardly....  Now the bonus for the MJ $80 pre-order...  I got 30k VC Pablo Prigioni, Nene and some other♥♥♥♥♥♥player... WTF????  Wasnt I supposed to get Emeralds????  Really? ♥♥♥♥ing Pablo Prigioni is a pre-order bonus? Even the Jordan they give you is crappy for Jordan.  Literally I feel like NBA 2k went out of its way to hose players.  In summation ♥♥♥♥ YOU TOO 2k....  You want to♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥over your best customers (the ones I shelled out $80 so you can bend them over and ♥♥♥♥ em good dont be surprised when NBA 2k 17 sales fall flat.  I honestly was a lock to buy this game every year but having been ♥♥♥♥ed over this hard they are on my♥♥♥♥♥♥list w/ Sony and I will not be purchasing any more of there products.  So ♥♥♥♥ you 2k and ♥♥♥♥ you Sony (had to sneak it in they ♥♥♥♥ed me a few years back and I have not forgotten and sold my Playstation and all games).  P.S.  If you actually stop being toolbags and give the players the pre-oder bonus THAT YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S promised (my missing emerald cards and VC and crap) I would consider buying you product next year.  NOT Pre-oder mind you as this was outright a FIASCO but if you make amends and reviews come in strong I would consider.  But if stays as is than ♥♥♥♥ YOU TOO I will never buy anything you make.			"

												Wellcome to the bad ports of 2015 ""the home stretch"". -bad optimization-Cheats/hackers-Buggy buggy buggy beta.-my career controversy.-TL;DR; Bad port, buggy, bad servers, dont buy until patch or serious saleIts not new for nba2k to value PC gamers the least. We get almost no support, no online control to stop the 99cheats. Dodgy servers and from nba2k15 they started to Optimize the game for pc pretty awefull. I am running a pretty deasent geforce gtx 970 4gigs, i5 cpu, 8gigs ram gaming rig. This game tanks with standard settings, you have to go in turn of vsync super sample, and buffering to get something playable (still hard to maintain that 60fps). That combined alot of people are reporting crashed and freezing games with loss of progression. I myself are having a lovely bug that a reinstall wont fix, where i have no commentators after 1min of play every quater, and sometimes the crowd goes away also, it gets a bit... silent on them 12min quaters. Lastly alot of people is complaining about mycareer being diffrent, the big issue here is that the story is designed for this 1 specifik guy, and not you. They could have easely made it so that you family changed race depending on you, made you choose your own nickname.. all that said and done, the player progression and ranking on winning highschool games, to get diffrent scholarships, and playing well in colledge to get draftet higher is one of the best way the game has handled the preseasen i think. and after your rookie season you get the nba2k16 mycareer with alot more features, so concluding that mycareer is the best it has ever been, but 2k needs to know that a movie directer, havent got a clue what makes a story good for a video game.

												It's not a terrible game, in my opinion its quite good. But the gameplay seems a bit choppy and the lag is very odd, one half it lags when I'm playing on defense and the next half when I'm on offense. That can be fixed so its not that big an issue.The MyCareer story is a bit much. I'm not black, but I was raised by a black family, with a black twin. I enjoy MyCareer actually having a story line, it gives it a sense of creativity, but it would be better if it can relate to other nationalities. It's weird being Asian and being surrounded by a black family, calling me ""Freq."" So far I just decided to commit to Kansas State, #Jayhawk lmao, so I don't what else to expect from the story. 2K is taking a step in the right direction with the story, instead of the straight-foward: play the rookie showcase for your draft stock. Once 2K can make a better story and not ♥♥♥♥ up w/ lag, they will truly make a work of art. But so far, NBA 2K16 is just eh.			"

By far the dumbest thing to be in a basketball game I've ever played. Spike Lee is an idiot.All of the other features in this game are great and i'm getting a lot of playing time out of them. But i have always enjoyed MyCareer and I didn't make it even halfway through my rookie NBA season before i stopped. Based on MyCareer mode, dont touch this game with a 20 foot pole. If you are ok with not playing MyCareer, the steam sale right now is an excellent deal.			"

												Day 1 of release (will keep my review updated for a bit)I was expecting so much from this game only to be let down.Cant play this game on maxed out graphic settings which blows... Spike Lee's My Career Story Mode thing is meh... I feel its focused so much on cutscenes and the story instead of the gameplay. This is the first time i bought NBA for PC over console and i regret it lol. Alls I can say is. Its been almost 10 years since I played a NBA Live game and I think it might be time to give it a try again....Update 9/30/15After getting through year 1 of career mode of spike lee's trash story I am finally starting to enjoy the game. They added a lot of new features since I last played this series (2k14). Still not worth $60 tho			"

												Cant figure out the reasoning behind the bad reviews. The visual are gorgeous, animations on every level are top notch, controls feel fluid, my team mode is great and even season mode is cool. The only things I dont like are that you cant use a controller on multiplayer matches which is understandable I guess but they should give the other player the option to make that decision. The story/my player mode is fun but very bland and you have to build your player up from nothing. Overall though its the best basketball game to date.sorry after some peoples help you can use the controller for multiplayer in big picture mode			"

												NBA 2K16 is definitely one of my favorite basketball games of all time. I'm a big NBA game fan, but I stuck to mostly NBA Live up until NBA Live 15 on Xbox One (extremely disappointing) so I never touched 2K until 2K14. However, this is basketball simulation at it's finest, with high quality animations, textures, lighting, sound, and more. It makes NBA Live look like chump change. Graphics:Best I've ever seen in any SPORTS game, and I'm big into sports titles. The aforementioned NBA Live, NHL, Madden, MLB The Show, etc. don't stack up to what Visual Concepts was able to accomplish. I'm playing the game with everything maxxed out with 4xMSAA and it runs fantastic at 1080p/60fps on an i5-2320/R9 390 gaming rig. I especially love the sweat effects and jerseys realistically bouncing off the player.Sound:I love the sounds in this game. The way the ball bounces is just oddly satisfying every time, and you have the crowd, music, and announcer ambience that go with a realistic NBA presentation (more on this later). This soundtrack is arguably one of the best you'll ever hear. You have a blend of select tracks by DJ Khaled, DJ Mustard, and DJ Premier and I love the tracks, especially ""We Takin Over"", ""Bugatti"", and ""All I Do Is Win"". Makes modes like MyGM and MyTeam feel more ""baller"".Gameplay:As I said, it's the finest basketball simulation that you'll ever play. You can't just drive to the basket every time and make it 100% of the time, you have to work for it. Strategy is actually decently implemented into this game, and like in real life even if you get a ""perfect shot"", you still have the potential to miss it. Defense is strange though, I can have Steph Curry block someone like Roy Hibbert, so minus points on that.Presentation:NBA 2K16 is very true to life like when you watch a broadcast on TNT. You have Ernie Johnson, Shaq, and Kenny Smith on the pre, half-time, and post game shows and their chemistry is fantastic, as in real life. Arenas look the way they should, and the cheerleaders are a nice addition. Additional Game Modes:MyGM is still really fun as always, plus the new soundtrack on top makes it even better than last years. You need to take your team to the NBA Finals and win, while staying under budget and keeping fans, staff, and players happy at the same time.MyCareer is great, yet the name is really misleading this year. It's not ""MyCareer"", it's ""FrequencyVibrationsCareer"". Spike Lee tells an excellent story through this, and all the actors have great chem with each other (especially Freq, his twin sister, and best friend). However, it would have been nice if they included even a stripped down version of last year's ""MyCareer"" so you can write your own story.MyTeam is just your standard card based game where you need to build the best team possible and be the best in the world. Nothing too much to write home about, just like Ultimate Team.I didn't really touch MyPark or MyProAm, so I can't tell you much on that. Closing Thoughts:When the game first came out, I was afraid to purchase the game because I heard tons of negative things about it (optimization, realism inaccuracies, weird defensive balancing, etc.) However, it was in a Humble Bundle so I spent a couple extra dollars to get it. NBA 2K16 is definitely a game worth getting, especially if you're into simulation or sports kinds of games. I give NBA 2K16 a 9/10.			"

												You know what I’m not even gonna be nice to this game. The story line makes no sense, the characters are dull and annoying, people keep calling your character Freq which makes you feel like you’re not playing as yourself but some dumb ♥♥♥♥ guy with a dumb ♥♥♥♥ nickname. Your whole rookie season is practically wasted, Vic and his crazy idiocy just makes me want to punch my monitor. Your character’s sister is ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, she wants to control everything, she even called Freq’s girlfriend a GOLD DIGGER when she herself is making money off her brother. Speaking of Freq’s family, they are all ♥♥♥♥ing black and so if your character is white you’ll have a ♥♥♥♥ing twin sister who’s black, what were they thinking? When you go from college to pro you’re agent kept talking like you had a choice to stay in college if you want to. The cut scene ends with Freq saying I’ll think about it but next, BAM you’re in the ♥♥♥♥ing NBA draft. This year’s draft was horrible they just went through it with pictures of the drafted players. Then everybody around you keep talking about how Vic is a bad influence but they don’t give us a choice to continue to be friends with Vic, they ♥♥♥♥ing killed him off for Christ sake, what’s the point of those cut scenes then? There was one scene where Freq had a long talk with Vic in the car and NOTHING ♥♥♥♥ing happened! They talked a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥which ended so awkwardly and makes you feel like what the ♥♥♥♥ have I just watched for 10 minutes??? WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? Everything about this story sucks! Most importantly how are some people ok with that ♥♥♥♥ing Frequency Vibration ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? I thought this is supposed to me MyCareer, all we got was a ♥♥♥♥ing Freq Career or some horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ I had absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing say for my character. I’ll be honest this is the WORST MyCareer I have ever seen! To sum up, the entire story was nothing but lama♥♥♥♥♥♥talk, the characters were boring and ♥♥♥♥ing annoying, the cut scenes were so long and pointless, the ending was that your ♥♥♥♥ing friend died from a car crash. What is Spike Lee trying to say? 	Aside from the story, the gameplay in MyCAREER sucks as well, you start off as pretty good player in high school, then in college you might start experiencing some difficulties to play as good, then in the NBA you’re a complete ♥♥♥♥-tard who has a 55 overall rating. I had to redo the game, buy a lot of VC and boost up my player to about an 80 overall. I play as a 6’8 small forward and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I can only max out my speed to a 70. Like really bruh 70, Kevin Durant’s way taller than 6’8 and he don’t run that slow. ♥♥♥♥ing 70 man how am I suppose to chase down a fast break or something. One ♥♥♥♥ing thing, I had this 80 rating before my first high school game. And in high school and college I was fast, but after I got into the NBA I suddenly became slow as ♥♥♥♥, what the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with the people who made this game. How can a player suddenly decrease so much speed when they transit to pro, where’s the logic. And ♥♥♥♥ if you’re teammate is wearing then number you want to wear you can’t ♥♥♥♥ing wear it like previous installments. 	2K, I have never been so let down and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥playing your game. I am writing this review because I’ve been playing since 2K7 and I really have NEVER EVER EVER been so disappointed. I genuinely love NBA 2K but seriously what the ♥♥♥♥ happened this year, you guys completely took the hype and♥♥♥♥♥♥on our faces. This is the worst MyCareer I’ve ever seen you guys don’t even let us choose our body types anymore.			"

												I've played it in the free weekend, and I have to say it's a lot more fun than I had expected.Yes there are some bugs. For example I got stuck in the sub bench when there was a goal scored and my player ran of field. I glitched myself out and luckily my team was attacking, else we would've been a man short defending which is a big problem with basketball. Gameplay is really good, although I really don't get the hang of the defending and good dribbles. But that is probably my own mistake by being not experienced with these NBA games for a long time. Also I didn't play with actual teams a lot, and started out with a self made player. So that's probably a big factor as well.The story line in my career is pretty fun, but I got really tired over the pre game shows and after shows. First few times it's not that bothering, unless you play a few hours after each other. Yes it is nice when they talk about you, but I just want to play. All in all I think people who like basketball will like this game as well. I think the biggest bugs are solved(?), since the sub bench thing only happened at the start of the play and then never again. Didn't really experience any major bugs further or crashes. So yeah, I'd reccommend this game if you're a basketball fan, if not you should wait for the next sale.			"

												Story was good, totally new way of showing how a player gets to where he is as an NBA player. GFX and moves improved and became more fluent. New online Features and improved game modes. I loved playing it for a long time. But the Devs struggled with every Windows Update. And now 2 weeks after the new Windows Update, they still haven't helped out the PC community and i decided to delete it from my harddisk. Sad and I guess I won't go for another NBA2K after 5 Years of consecutive gaming their titles as a PC Gamer. Would the Service for PC improve, I'd be back, but it has gotten out of hand. Maybe because they want to sell 2K17? Who knows.			"

For instance you may stand next to another player and which are you to guard yet you still receive a ""leave assignment"" penalty. The commentators will remark you had a 4.0 GPA. How is this?

												I've only really played MyCareer so far so my review is based just on that.The Spike Lee storyline thing is just a colossal waste of time I just want to make a player and start my rookie season I don't care about the boring story or the corny acting it just ruins the first season by not letting you develop until your second season. Once I got to my second season the game became a lot more enjoyable... until the game developed a habit of closing without warning after games, forcing you to replay them.			"

If (When) it cashes it will boot up at the beginning of the game even tho the saving icon completed when you finished the game before it crashed.

												Just like every other 2K they make strides in some areas and then make dumb decisions in other areas. They felt the need to redo the passing and changed the input for the controller and made most of the buttons passes. After a couple hrs you get used to this one. The one that most people hate is the pick and rolls in this game. Man did they mess up. 80% of the time of getting a teammate to set a pick messes up. Half the time the ballhander will get free but fumble and pick up his dribble. The other half of the time the player coming to set the screen completely misses the defender and then just blocks the driving lane. The amount of changes that made the game better are completely overshadowed by the mistakes they made. It still is fun like every year, but i have almost broke my controller a dozen times by wanting to throw it against a wall after stuff happens in the game. Lastly the thing that i hate the most at the moment is how broken the paint play is at the moment. The amount of time your front court lets passes get past them for an easy layup is ridiculous. I give up more than half my points because of this even though i tell them to protect the paint and make them sit down in the post. Verdict: only buy if it is under $20 otherwise you will hate yourself for paying full price for this.			"

												This is the most racist game I have ever played. It portrays African Americans in a negative light by having the main characters be blatant stereotypes.  I've literally only met one person who acts like the people in career mode.  It's a travesty of video game developent and story telling that they tried to include a derogatory social agenda with what could have been a decent game.			"

												The game breaking bugs I keep encountering are extremely frustrating and seem to be experienced by numerous people.  It's too bad that you don't really get to play much right off the bat, you'll spend most of your 2 hour return window watching cut scenes...  Right now I cannot recommend this game to anyone.1st MyCareer character won't go past the 1st press interview of the second season, which is really sad because I read that's where things get fun and interesting. You get to plan your off days, choose who to befriend and what sponsorships to take.  I was really looking forward to it.2nd MyCareer character crashes to desktop when I select a College.// Review follow up.  Loving the game now that the problem has been figured out.  All of us that were experiencing the crashing issue simply replaced our .exe with the Patch 5 version and it works!  They screwed something up in Patch 6.They still get a thumbs down from me, as they don't seem to be eager to fix it with 17 right around the corner.			"

												I've only really played MyCareer so far so my review is based just on that.The Spike Lee storyline thing is just a colossal waste of time I just want to make a player and start my rookie season I don't care about the boring story or the corny acting it just ruins the first season by not letting you develop until your second season. Once I got to my second season the game became a lot more enjoyable... until the game developed a habit of closing without warning after games, forcing you to replay them.			"

												My Career is a joke.  They give you no chance at being semi decent in your first season, and the 'practices' in the second season are garbage.  Spike Lee's story doesn't add to the value, especially when it is obviously built around you being a member of the black harlem community and the character you build does not fit into that scheme, *cough* *cough*.  Defending a player is terrible, you will be playing perfect defense for ten seconds and then the guy somehow blows by you and the 'my career' grade for the game is destroyed by one misstep.  It also dings you for not covering your guy when the arrow at the bottom of your character is changing its mind every 1/2 second as to who you should be covering.  But heaven forbid the arrow is pointing at the character that ends up making the shot, thats your fault.The gameplay in general is still good.  It just has weird quirks on defense			"

												2K Servers suck would you think that they needed to use the same ports as an Xbox One on a PC and even when forwarding those ports therefore while playing this game, my router doesn't open the ports for my Xbox, the 2k servers still fail to load in my team, I have 200mbps download and 20mbps upload so my internet doesnt suck infact based on my internet you wouldn't think that these servers would be so laggy and awful.My team in pc has a glitch where i literally only spent 13$ and I bought 2million vc( I could of used Cheat Engine, but I was to lazy). WTF How can this game be so broken? My team doesn't work in pc as errors occured like failed to initalize results please wait awhile then it tells you to cancel results of game making you lose your time and contracts. CPU in every difficutly plays defense like the 85 Chicago Bears and every team shoots  like the Golden State Warriors( except your own team). Any player misses wide open threes unless they are like 92 overall Diamond Steph Curry or Larry Bird or the CPU. This game has good graphics. Studders occur even with a gtx 980ti. I only got it for 25$ buying it from a site that probally stole this key and even then I OVERPAID. THIS PC PORT IS SO BAD, BUGGY, AND BROKEN THAT I WOULD HAVE MORE FUN PLAYING ♥♥♥♥♥♥FIELD HARDLINE(Hardline is the worst Battlefield ever) THAN THIS CRAP.EVERY NEW PATCH THAT COMES OUT FOR THIS GAME BREAKS THE GAME EVEN MORE. 2K PLEASE STOP TRYING TO BE EA SPORTS STOP IT PLEASE. EA SUCKS EGGS STOP IT 2K. TAKE TWO INTERATIVE YOU GUYS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THIS REALESE AND YOUR LUCKY THAT NBA LIVE 16 IS SO♥♥♥♥♥♥OTHERWISE NO ONE WOULD BUY THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥ STOP IT 2K. 2K14 WAS FINE, 2K13 WAS FINE, 2K15 WAS BROKEN AS WELL AND YOU DID NOTHING TO MAKE 2K15 BETTER INFACT IM PRETTY SURE THAT 2K16 IS A BETA VERSION OF 2K15.I RATHER HAVE A GAME THAT PLAYS LIKE THE BEST BASKETBALL GAME EVER AND HAD SERVERS THAT WORKED INSTEAD OF THE GREAT GRAPHICS. IF THIS IS THE FUTURE THEN I'M NEVER BUYING A 2K SPORTS GAME EVER AGAIN.AS A SPORTS GAME THIS GAME GETS A 3/10 DONT EVER GET IT UNLESS YOU PIRATE IT BUT IF YOU PIRATE IT YOU CANNOT PLAY THE GAME ONLINE WHICH YOU WONT MISS ANYTHING SINCE LITTLE TO ANYONE CAN GET THE ONLINE TO WORK ANYWAY ON THIS GAME MAYBE THE MYPARK WORKS WHERE EVERYONE HAS 99 MYPLAYERS BECAUSE THEY USED CHEAT ENGINE.2K YOUR SERVERS ARE SO♥♥♥♥♥♥THAT XBOX ONE'S SERVERS AND PLAYSTATAION SERVERS LOOK LIKE THE BEST SERVERS EVER. EVEN THEN YOUR SERVERS DONT WORK IN YOUR CONSOLE GAMES EITHER. DID YOU BUY YOUR SERVERS FROM EA SPORTS.			"

												EDIT: i just wanna add that the reason the game is designed the way it is is so that users get frustrated and end up spending real money on in-game credits called Virtual Currency to help upgrade their in-game teams and players. today this is a very common method in the gaming industry. it facilitates the siphoning of extra money out of consumers. they prey on the young and on those with disposable income who are not too proud to pay to win. sadly, improving your players' skills with VC does not necessarily imrpove your winning record or the game's fun. sincere advice: if you are unfortunate enough to have purchased this, then whatever you do, do NOT EVER purchase VC. it would be giving in to 2k's predatory business tactics and you can earn VC by playing the game (trust me, don't play the game). as gamers, we have to come together if we want to stop these actions by boycotting microtransactions and games that seek to make microtransactions necessary to fully enjoy the game. successful microtransaction sales result in innovation-free, content-free half-games like this because developers start to think that they really don't have to put as much effort into their products in order to yield satisfactory profits.would you go to a movie thater which had coin slots at the seats and asked you to put in a dollar for better sound, and another dollar to continue watching beyond the 60 minute mark, etc?terrible game. my friend and i have been playing it for a few weeks and it is extremely dissatisfyng mostly because it uses bad AI to cheat you out of certain(most) games. it has many problems that can make you want to break your computer. for example, when the CPU possesses the ball, it can handle it anywhere and the ball will noclip through any object necessary for it to complete the scripted play and score points. yet, when the player has the ball, he will lose it any time it collides with any part of an opponent's body. the cpu has a good chance (FEELS like 60% and in certain games more like 70%) to make any shot from anywhere, but in order for you to make a shot you must have no opponent within 6 feet of you AND make a perfect/near-perfect shot release, or be very lucky. i can(could, before i uninstalled) make about 1 in 20 shots that dont meet those criteria. the cpu constantly pulls off magic johnson/rondo-style acrobatic passes from everyday point guards like trey burke. but if the player tries to make a good, normal chest or bounce pass then there is a chance your target will quickly move into the way of a defender, forcing a turnover (this is a self-proclaimed ""sim game"" PUNISHING players for making a good real-life basketball decision). on the other side of the same token, the AI is just so bad overall that your best option on offence is often to pass it straight into a bigman in the middle of the paint despite traffic. the CPU defence can anticipate every dribble move and lead pass you make, but chuck it into the key where all the defenders are and you'll probably get an assist. you have very little control over your successes/failures especially in the higher difficulties. mycareer is unplayable because any team mate of yours that is controlled by the cpu suddenly has a very low IQ, will run out of bounds, leave assignments(very prominent and game-breaking), take stupid shots or refuse to take/fail to make great shots, however the opposing AI is usually psychic and is able to react to your actions immediately (it simply reads the button inputs, it feels like when you control your player you are controlling the opposition at the same time). yeah the game doesnt look that bad, but thats where the praises stop; theres a bunch of gimmicky BS in the game like a shoe creator, a bunch of corporate endorsement-inspired activities, (by the way 2k youre not fooling anyone, this adds nothing to the game gameplay-wise so its a cheap, blatant wat to start stuffing advertisements into our  games, like seriously how much more money does 2k need) and that stupid new mycareer thing they call a ""movie"" which basically only forces you to watch/skip through annoying cutscenes and to be this stupid personality, giving you minimal life choices, completely destroying the immersion aspect of mycareer mode(the only thing that made it more fun than a reguar exhibition match) and is an eyesore of a stain on spike lee's legacy. the voice acting is awful, cutscenes look like an xbox/ps2 gen game(i thought cutscenes were supposed to look better than the gameplay, wtf??), and the script overall is just meaningless and painfully cliche.its really clear that 2k is just trying to sell $60+++ updated rosters every year and the quality of their releases doesnt mean much to them as long as theyre raking in the bucks. year after year 2k has failed to produce an impressive simulation game. 2k10 had me intrigued with its innovative myplayer mode at the time, but 6 years later this is a monumental disappointment. seriously, in terms of realism and AI this is on par with previous 2ks and the maddens of the early 2000s, only more frustrating because even if you anticipate every action of the cpu it doesnt matter because, if it has to, the game will basically make your player move like each of his feet are submerged in 3 gallons of wet cement. (yes thats another thing i forgot to add, if you manage to outsmart the cpu it'll just heavily slow you down and delay your control inputs)i could rant about this maddeningly pathetic excuse for a sim game forever but ill just stop here by saying i really regret this purchase, but i am relieved that  got it during the summerr sale for only $12.

												Just got this game as part of the Humble Bundle and enjoyed until Windows 10 Anniversary Update. Since than it´s impossible to connect ot the servers which breaks at least half of the game! I know this is bad coincidence but as far as I heard this issue was well known by Windows Beta testers and must have come to attention to 2K before which leaces me with the conclusion that 2K just doesn´t give Fs because of the upcoming 2k17. I´m waiting for an update since two weeks now... Hands off!			"

												By far the best basketball (for me even sports game) there is. The controls are easy to learn but hard to master, the animations are realistic (sometimes buggy but that's no big deal) and the graphics are really good. Skilling your player and playing with your favourite team in the MyCareer mode can be big fun, even though sometimes the rating system can sometimes enrage you if that is something important to you. You can change the looks and style of your player and you can even design your own court. MyPark and playing with friends in general is extreme fun, either online and offline. Pro:-good sounds, graphics, animations      -multiplayer is much fun      -progressing in the career mode is encouraging af      -you can change almost everything cosmetics wise      -good and long soundtrack with famous songs such as ""0 to 100"" from DrakeCon:-keyboard controls are quite bad (as they are in every sportsgame)       (-short career mode (not that important))       -the rating system in the top right corner is sometimes pretty unfair All in all a 8/10			"

												I'm a huge basketball fan which makes me invest 60 dollars a year (usually) in the new addition of basketball games as little changes usually make a big deal. This year's addition was definitely an improvement in gameplay yet the PC port was♥♥♥♥♥♥poor and little effort or comittment was made for the PC. It's inferior in a lot of ways that the consoles don't experience. I get that it's harder to optimize for multiple systems but my expectations are heightened when I pay 60 dollars for a game. The same price that someone on console pays, I expect the same quality and you don't get that here. I can't even play the game anymore and I refuse to support them on PC as of now. I'm honestly done with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The only way I'd pay for it was if they knocked the price down upon RELEASE. Either that or take the route WWE went and release the game at a later date than on console for a more polished release. As it stands, I do not recommend this game to anyone on PC...			"

												I was thinking whether to give the game a positive or a negative vote.  I've played a lot of basketball simulations and in this case, NBA 2k16 is certainly one of the, if not THE best game ever to be released. Why the hesitation, then, u might ask. Well, 3 months have passed since the release of the game and it's the first time when it's fully playable (in my terms).  What's happenned? Looks like 2K Sports decided to give us an incomplete product and made us pay for the beta-testing of it. I'm pretty mad about this fact, and I'm not sure if I wanna' do it again. Probably not. Not to be baseless, I'll give you some examples of my negative experience with the game:-invisible players, not allowing me to do almost anything against them since their actions are unpredictable(on- and offline)-fps drops-sound stopping in the middle of the game, not returning at all, or after a few quarters-lots of connection problems with the servers-black, instead of colourful floors of the arenas, 3pt line not visible-gameplay things like still being defended hardly after passing the rival in animation.And I haven't even played the MyCareer and other modes than Exhibition, as I'm not that much interested in them, so I've got no clue how many errors are awaiting me in there. After all, the gameplay is really, really nice (but that's what we got used to when playing 2k sport games). Nonetheless, this is the first time when those errors have occurred, and I suppose I can't give the game a positive vote. Maybe next year. Maybe...			"

												NBA 2K16...Well, whats to say apart from the obviousPros-Defense is improved-Optimation is relatively good for a console game (others may disagree)-Graphics have been improvedCons-The all aclaimed MyCareer is very short and gives little choices-MyCareer is built around you purchasing VC-Other features are relativley the same			"

												Played my first full 12-min per quarter myCareer game, after finishing the game I hit advance and it crashed. Relaunched the game and played again. Crashed after hitting advance.. again. I tried looking for a fix or workaround and people from the forum said to wait till it's done saving before hitting advance. Played again, waited for it to finish saving. Crashed. I'm done. I downloaded a cracked version of the game to ""test"" it out before getting it, by the way. Played about 50 hrs. Never had issues.Pirates = 1Devs = 0And the ""story"" by Spike Lee is just, I can't even think of a word to describe how awful it is.			"

												 First off I would like to say that this game is extremely racist. The game also encourages you to spend another $60-$100 or more to upgrade your player from a 55 overall. Now the biggest problem with this game is the crashes... The game just recently started crashing after every other MyCareer game, and the hundreds of people on Steam forums can attest to this. Suprise, no comment or response from 2k.... They just copy/paste some generic troubleshooting response blaming Windows or your graphics card. I believe the ""crashes"" are a marketing scheme from this money grubbing company to get us to buy 2k17. Think about it, they put the game on sale for $12.99 for the Steam Summer Sale then about a month later these ""crashes"" started up after a recent patch. Now also consider that 2k17 comes out in 2 months. Coincidence? Don't think so... DO NOT BUY!			"

												I don't understand all the negative reviews for this game. Yes, My Career sucks. There's several other games modes for you to enjoy outside of the ""story mode"". The game play is absolutely amazing. The graphics are amazing. The commentary is really in depth. The soundtrack is amazing. Everything about this game is amazing. All the aspects of the actual game play are stellar and make you feel like you're not just playing a basketball game you're watching a basketball game. Does that make sense?Great game.			"

												Just got this game as part of the Humble Bundle and enjoyed until Windows 10 Anniversary Update. Since than it´s impossible to connect ot the servers which breaks at least half of the game! I know this is bad coincidence but as far as I heard this issue was well known by Windows Beta testers and must have come to attention to 2K before which leaces me with the conclusion that 2K just doesn´t give Fs because of the upcoming 2k17. I´m waiting for an update since two weeks now... Hands off!			"

												Positives of NBA 2K16...ummmm...some of the music is okay...Negatives of NBA 2k16. The story is mundane at best, it's meant to be gripping and draw you in, personally found it boring and more of an inconvience since I could of been playing a match(Thankfully you can skip them).Not much of a graphically update from 2K15 slighty better but not by much, gameplay is pretty much the same from 2K15 not many major tweaks but now you can miss wide open lay ups (hurray), Myteam is literally a carbon copy from... you guessed it 2K15 (seeing a pattern yet?) Mypark is Mypark you have to have a certain build and badges and stats to do anything, oh yea and if you're a rookie no one will play on your team (in some cases no one gets on till the rookie, gets off) extremely grindy for badges the game really doesn't like new player's since the higher rank you are the more benefits you get on court like higher steal rate, shooting and such, no one for new player's to really enjoy MyparkOverall I believe this game to be hardly worth the £40 or £60 price tag but if you really want it get it when it's on sale.

It turned out to be a racist, smug and just as pathetic as Jimmy Fallon when he tries to make his guests funnier by doing that patethic gestures while laughing at thier bad jokes.Pathetic typical-hollywood pice of♥♥♥♥♥♥The rest of the game, excluding 2kTV is good though.

Posted: October 4, 2015
												Coming from someone who put around 600 hours into 2k15, NBA2k16 is the best and most complete sports game I have ever played. It has it's bugs and issues, but it is the most real to life version of NBA 2k ever.PROS-2k did a great job this year of reducing the ""cheese"" in every way (It is VERY hard to draw charges, run baseline for an easy 2, or pull up for a contested 3 and knock it down for example)-You feel like you are in complete control of your players much more than last year, mainly because you rarely are ever stuck in animations-It isn't easy to score. This might sound bad, but this makes the game so much better. As I'm sure some people remember in 2k15, RT+X to the basket or shooting a 3 with any half decent 3pt shooter gave you a free basket.-Excellent graphics, the best looking sports game I have ever seen.-Fluid and varied gameplay, overall fun to play with many different modes, difficulties, and playstyles-Much better connection to servers/lag issues than previous years-Music/overall atmosphere- pregame/postgame show with Shaq, Ernie, and Kenny is great. The music is a wide variety of genres and cultures, mainly hip-hop and rap however so if you arent into that kind of music you can turn it off-Lots of settings/options, very customizeable and in some gamemodes you can even adjust gameplay sliders (percentage of 3's going in for example)-VERY ACCURATE RATINGS. This is so important, because many cards last year had extremely over-boosted ratings, which contributed a lot to the ""cheese""CONS-Some framerate issues, especially in cutscenes, but I have a 750 ti and I'm doing fine framerate wise with some medium, some high settings-""BE THE STORY"" except all you do in mycareer is follow the exact storyline Spike Lee has laid out for you, rarely being able to ever make your own decisions-Sometimes the game can be frusturating, players missing wide open shots when it seems like you should make it or things like that-Lots of bugs unrelated to gameplay, cards having the wrong ratings (Rookie vince carter has the same ratings as the 15+years later vince carter) and other things like that, but im sure these will be fixedOverall- 9/10, I really recommend this game to anyone who remotely enjoys basketball, I don't watch the NBA all that much but I love me some 2k.

												Im for real, i only play/watch football but i always loved basketball. Never watched it, didnt care about it, but since this game was for 10euros i should give it a try.Was the best thing i did, seriously. Im addicted to this game.Now i care about NBA, now i watch NBA, now NBA is ""my sport"".This is maybe one of the best games ive ever played in my life. I have fun, its hard, its competitive, you have an objective to conquer and you have to work hard for it. I only play MyCareer, the story is not 10/10 but i would give it 7/10.The gameplay (since its my first NBA game) isnt that hard but isnt that easy, i would give it a 9/10.The graphics i would give it a 8/10, 2K should really work on those faces.The only thing i have agaisnt this game is that i cant find any players in MyPark, maybe cuz im new to the game and i dont understand how to connect, idk, and when you finish a game ( Only happens to me on MyCareer) sometimes the game wont save and it will automatically shutdown and you have to play the game againIn general this game is a 8.5/10 but seriously, BUY IT if you have a chance or if you want to try it. You will have tons of fun			"

												2016 is a mix of the good and the bad. The basketball is good and worth the 12 bucks I paid for it.The bad... 2K, change your number and never let Spike Lee look at another 2K product. Living DA Dream? If you can't English, you can't direct. Be less racist! Some of us white people like basketball too. Your story is VERY exclusive. Not that it would be a very good game, but it would be like making a game about astrophysicists and making the family white or Asian and Neil deGrasse Tyson playing it and saying ""WTF? I'll take my degree in physics from Harvard and my doctorate in astrophysics from Columbia and you can take a hike!"" The only way you can salvage it is pretending the sister is your hot girlfriend and her parents just have an unusually close relationship with the main character...Also the intro is too long and can't be skipped. Last night I made a second player and instead of sitting through it, I did laundry... doing laundry is better than the intro.... think about that for a moment....I like the GM mode.

												Let me start off by saying the reviews for this game are really unfair. Yes MyCareer has flaws but not enough to cause all these negative reviews. (I just started playing on PC, I've played console mostly) Here are the pros and cons imo.Pros1. Graphics look amazing. I have a 400$ laptop and if not for my screen resolution the game would look really nice. I have to run it on fairly low settings though.2. Gameplay out of this world.3. Presentation is just so good. Feels like a real NBA game when playing.4. So many customizable options. MyGm allows relocation and customizable stadiums with tons of options. You can even create your own shoe. The amount of options are almost over the top.5. Gamemodes are fantastic. MyCareer lets you play as an actual college team and play in the 2015 NCAA Championship against Wisconsin (and they have Kaminsky and Dekker lol)Cons1. You are basically forced to be black in MyCareer. Your Family and biological twin sister are black. And if you do choose a white character it looks kinda wierd.2. You are called Freq all the time and on game commentary. It would be nice if we could choose between a few nicknames at least. (I get that if you were called by your players name, it would be hard technologically speaking.3. 8 Games your Rookie season in MyCareer. Worst part of the entire game. Forget about impressing as a rookie. 2k forces you to sim most of the games. Pathetic thought process by 2k. 4. Your stats are terrible to start out with. During high school and college you are hyped to be the next NBA allstar. However, you enter the league as an 57 overall. Makes no sense.5. MyCareer in general. I still find it as a fun gamemode just because I like sports but I can see why people hate it. (Plus I have a low attention span to stick out through full games.In conclusion, as long as MyCareer isn't the only reason you play the game, there are still so many more options and gamemodes. My personal favorite is MyGm.			"

												This is a very well put together sports game. Graphics are great, and it has good audio quality. However, I personally am not fond of the sound track, could use some more rock / metal tracks, there is no face scanning, and the last update ""Update 2"" has caused a crash problem on start where the application will not open on my system.

												Let me start off by saying the reviews for this game are really unfair. Yes MyCareer has flaws but not enough to cause all these negative reviews. (I just started playing on PC, I've played console mostly) Here are the pros and cons imo.Pros1. Graphics look amazing. I have a 400$ laptop and if not for my screen resolution the game would look really nice. I have to run it on fairly low settings though.2. Gameplay out of this world.3. Presentation is just so good. Feels like a real NBA game when playing.4. So many customizable options. MyGm allows relocation and customizable stadiums with tons of options. You can even create your own shoe. The amount of options are almost over the top.5. Gamemodes are fantastic. MyCareer lets you play as an actual college team and play in the 2015 NCAA Championship against Wisconsin (and they have Kaminsky and Dekker lol)Cons1. You are basically forced to be black in MyCareer. Your Family and biological twin sister are black. And if you do choose a white character it looks kinda wierd.2. You are called Freq all the time and on game commentary. It would be nice if we could choose between a few nicknames at least. (I get that if you were called by your players name, it would be hard technologically speaking.3. 8 Games your Rookie season in MyCareer. Worst part of the entire game. Forget about impressing as a rookie. 2k forces you to sim most of the games. Pathetic thought process by 2k. 4. Your stats are terrible to start out with. During high school and college you are hyped to be the next NBA allstar. However, you enter the league as an 57 overall. Makes no sense.5. MyCareer in general. I still find it as a fun gamemode just because I like sports but I can see why people hate it. (Plus I have a low attention span to stick out through full games.In conclusion, as long as MyCareer isn't the only reason you play the game, there are still so many more options and gamemodes. My personal favorite is MyGm.			"

												I would actually not recommend this game when it first came out. It was full with bugs and glitches, not to mention early release server issues, and that it is easily tampered by cheats and hackers with a simple Cheat Engine tool. But, I can't blame 2K for releasing such game on schedule that still needs alot of fixing, they gotta earn money right? I don't really have any choice but to tolerate these flaws since I really love playing NBA 2k, and with the effort they are trying to exert on fixing those bugs, I really have to give them credit.PROS: Smooth gameplay, great graphics(obviously), good cpu logic(kinda)CONS: After all patches, some minor bugs still exist; MyPark still thrived by cheats though they ban ocassionallyOverall, I recommend this game for those who really like to play basketball simulation games and those who have high tolerance to its flaws, coz, what choice do we have? nba live? meh			"

												Never thought this game was this good.I always wanted to play a NBA 2K.. game. But spending 50 euros is a bit much for me.So when the game was in sale. I Tried it. And since then I'm addicted to this game. And cannot stop playing it. Nice meme for putting an IGN quote in the thumbnail.Getitng in was weird. Since I was only used to play fifa where you can faceroll defend by holding one button LMAO. But here you really have to time the jumps to defend. And react fast. MyPlayer career with Spike Lee is very interesting. Feels like a movie for some reason. Playing online. Teaming up with other players picking a court etc. It's really fun. Graphically this game is very nice. People that have played 2K15 and disliked this game. I can't really give an opinion on that. Mainly because this is my first NBA 2K game. But if you like a sports game. Basketball game. I really recommend this.+++++++++ENABLE DJ KHALED PLAYLIST IF YOU ARE PLAYING THE GAME+++++++++++++			"

												Graphics 10/10Sound 10/10Thats about it, if you actually want to play a game, this is not it.  This game is worse than most basketball games i played back in the early 2000's.  They players move like a giant cube with an animation stuck into it.  Its like the first time someone tries to use a game make for the first time and makes a circle collide with a square.  In this game you cannot make your player walk next to another, its just not possible, you will be stuck against an invisible object.But all that is dwarfed by the impressively large input lag.  I'm not talking about the time it takes for the instruction to go from my controller and be recognised by the game, nope, i'm talking about the animation almost a second long that must happen before your character actually does seomthing.you want to shoot, wait a second.you want to move forward, wait a second.you want to steal the ball, wait a few seconds.you want to change direction, wait a secondetc, you get the point.Its annoyingly hard to get your character to stand near the 3 point line because you can't slightly move, you either run, walk, or stand still.. no variable movement at all, its just isn't in the game.There are camera issues and glitches that i could not be bothered explaining.Also, there are far too many unskippable cutscenes, for series that used to excel at being a wonderful couch potatoe game where you sit infront of your tv and play with your friends, the annoying amount of unskippable scenes and transition scenes take away from the game.Oh, and the my career cutscenes.. .. ..  they suffer from poor writing.  Its like watching an interview with donald trump about americas neuclear triad.  I should give 2k props for trying to imitate the culture of harlem, but when a white surburtan office worker in australia thinks a heap of crap, imagine how the people who actually live there think about it.  I'd imagine they would be quite insulted.This game is an unsult to the past titles which i absolutle loved with over 140 hours played on nba 14 alone, with 13 being the best.If the older titles were released into todays market, they would have done far better.

												As someone who has owned NBA 2k's since 2k12 (was originally a console peasent) I believe this is one of the worst ones I have purchased. Not because of the graphics, because 99% of the time, those are spot on, but because the biggest portion of the game for me is MyPlayer. Spike Lee royally ♥♥♥♥ed it up. The addition of highschool and college ball is awesome, however, whether you are white, black, indian or asian you will have black parents, and a black twin sister. You also, only play 3 HS games, 4 College games and you only play 8 games in your rookie season. This is a very brutal part of myplayer compared to installments before.The game plays relatively well however being locked to 60fps. Graphics and general playability is about the same from past games.If you only play NBA 2k for myplayer, you may be dissappointed like me. If you play other gamemodes, it is probably a solid pickup.7/10 general game1/10 myplayer.			"

Player models are upgraded with new, more detailed body scans, and that has a profound effect on the overall experience.You can relocate and completely rebrand your team with a mind-boggling amount of options.Even if a heated conversation was all about a choice I needed to make, I was never allowed to make it myself.For the first time in several years, I’ve only experienced a few online hiccups.Defense wins championships, and the improvements to AI defenses in NBA 2K16 bring this year’s iteration of the long-running basketball sim another title. Due to some big AI upgrades, the offensive tactics that I had been accustomed to using simply no longer work, so I was forced to think like a coach and constantly adapt. Running pick and rolls and calling plays finally felt like it was necessary, as opposed to a tougher option I had to enforce on myself. NBA 2K16 is a great representation of the sport of basketball, and it plays like a dream – both online and off.Upping Its GameThe big reason to show up this year, though, is that NBA 2K’s gameplay has been completely upgraded in nearly every way, resulting in a more true-to-life simulation experience. In previous years, I always found it easy to score by cheezing my way past AI defenders, running in circles and forcing them to make unrealistic mistakes. All of that is gone this year. Zig-zagging will result in steals and frustration, and attempts to drive the baseline will end up in terrible or blocked shots. The only reliable way to score is to use real basketball concepts, so if you’re a student of the sport you'll find yourself being rewarded for your knowledge.You have to improvise, because opposing AI coaches will start to learn your tendencies and try new ways to stop you. For example, defenders had been going underneath screens, allowing me to step back and take open jumpers; after a few successful attempts they started going around screens, forcing me to drive the lane instead. This constant game of cat and mouse kept me on my toes, searching for new ways to make plays.Whose Career Is It, Anyway?There are a staggering amount of ways you can play NBA 2K16. All the game modes I expect of the series make their triumphant return, some with interesting new wrinkles. The new Play Now Online mode makes head-to-head matches matter a bit more, since it features a promotion and relegation system. MyGM and MyLeague modes are now both fully featured management sims, allowing you to go so far as to relocate and completely rebrand your team with a mind-boggling amount of options. That same team editor can also be used in MyTeam, the card-collecting game, which has new challenges and ways to earn virtual currency.Racking Up WsLivin’ Da Dream reaches its conclusion after your rookie season, which only has eight playable games. After that, it opens up and plays more like the mode I was expecting, with 82-game seasons and new and exciting ways to improve your player on off days. That’s why I can enthusiastically recommend NBA 2K16 even with MyCareer’s failure to properly contextualize my player’s rise to stardom: at the end of the day, it’s all window dressing for the gameplay underneath – and in this case, that gameplay is spectacular.ConcludeNBA 2K16 is one of the most complete packages I’ve ever seen. Developer Visual Concepts continues to raise the sports simulation bar by completely retooling its silky-smooth gameplay, adding brand-new physics systems, and refining its traditional game modes. Not all of the changes work as well as others, most notably the Spike Lee-themed MyCareer mode, but it doesn’t take away from the impressive overall package.			"

												Updated Review:I should have changed to thumbs up for awhile because the updates fixed a lot of the original issues.  I liked this game for about 2 monthes until 2K decided to step in and mess stuff up again.  The MyCareer gameplay seems really awkward with people speeding up and slowing down the game at odd times in order to try and keep the game difficult.  Things like balls magically floating through my player when I jump a lane to steal.  It seems like the game restricts you from being unstoppable, throwing in weird glitches which I have taken pictures to prove.  Players on your team will start moving one way, glitch and move towards his defender, causing turnovers that leave me like, ""what just happen?"".  This gets quite annoying but as you can see, I am still a pretty avid user of this game.  It is addictive but honestly I just turn it off in the middle of the game when those weird momentum changes seem to be forced into the gameplay, forcing odd-looking turnovers, taller cpu teammates getting blocked and characters seemingly molding together, the player missing steals, cpu teammates missing wide open lay-ups.  The list goes on; and it only seems to have gotten worse lately with these updates.Also, with the new updates I have noticed random crashing.  Once in the playoff's, I have crashed at the end of a game and then had to restart from the beginning when I reloaded myCareer.  I also tried to use the ""Save and Quit"" option in the menu; only for the game to crash, forcing the game to open a file from a previous save.  If it crashes and no previous save, quess what?  You're restarting the game.  I just recently lost an entire 3rd Quarter from this crash and it is not the first time.  The crashes seem to have become more frequent as the game has grown older; which is rather odd. Original Review:I seriously think 2K Sports are tipping off companies to boost sales and hype up this game.  I don't even know why I paid money for this game.  Mycareer is broken; missing wide open shots all the time with an 85 overall jump shot rating.  Not to mention missing uncontested lay-ups half the the time with 80+ overall rating for inside shooting; those are always great.  I respect Spike Lee but the story is completely wack and nobody cares about behind-the-scene stuff about how you produced this POS game.  Not to mention you can't skip cut scenes in between quarters, forcing you to watch pre-game and post-game videos which takes A LONG TIME TO DO ANYTHING.  After 2K's huge update, my replays stopped working, only showing scenes of the follow-up reactions after the play where your character is talking or whatever.  Who wants to watch that, seriously?  Vsync causes a lot of visual tearing and was the only fix I could come up with for the replay problems.  So now my replays work, but the crowd stutters and everything looks choppy and poorly animated.  I played this game and gave it plenty of times and opportunities to impress me but it's terrible.  Mycareer would be awesome if the gameplay wasn't completely messed up; the calender system and customization aspects are much better than last year.  Yet, I haven't even tried any other aspect of the game besides mycareer because this game frustrated me to the point of no return.  Like I said it's a waste of money.  All the missed shots, choppy framerate, and bugs are a constant reminder. 3570k @ 4.1 GhzAsus GTX960X-Box One Controller			"

												I hate how you have a ""set"" story line and it makes you an African American. Some people want to be a great white basketball player and go against racial stereotypes, or be the next Yao Ming or Jermey Lin and be asian but in this story mode you arent really allowed to be because of your African American parents, your African American TWIN sister (no claiming you're adopted) and your African American best friend. You're pretty much restricted to following stereotypes and being a black NBA player which is a little racist itself. And the career mode is very buggy and my game crashes multiple times, it doesnt even allow me to pick my college to go to because it always crashes when I try to pick one. Also, that handshake thing you do with your sister is so cringey it gave me cancer.			"

												I bought the game for MyCareer, but boy am I disappointed. This Spike Lee story is a disaster, you don't control your story, just watch it through horse smiled animated characters whose personality are just plain irritating. You start with a character that is 55 overall, and because you even draft as a 55 to NBA (no VC earning through high scool or college) you will ♥♥♥♥ up most of your rookie season, until you can actually buy some attribute points.During High School and College every time I rack up some serious points through a match my teammates start to foul so much that we lose the game to free throws. Is this intentional?Don't even mention the graphical bugs and misbehaves, you'll need some forum research on how to run this game fairly on a decent rig.Furthermore the menus are far from intuitive.Just wanted a basketball game which I can spend some fun time occasionally, but instead got a game that gets me angry every time I play it. Sometime because of how ♥♥♥♥ed up the game's logical build up is, or because of lag spikes.Next time I read reviews first, and don't assume just by title how good a game is.			"

												I was hopping that the game would be better than this. As others have said the story mode is stupid, and not only is the story extremely generic, it is target toward a specific character, even though you get to choose what your character looks like, is. The idea was intersting but poorly executed. The game just feels broken half the time, players don't behave properly, random fouls and calls, which make the career mode even worse when you are ""graded"" on these glitches. It becomes painfully clear that you are not going to make your career player good through gameplay alone, after 9 hours, i could barelly upgrade a handfull of attributes, but luckly you can BUY the points to do so, YAY!...I think the most telling point, is throught most of my playtime, the thing I capped asking my self was ""Who thought this was a good idea?""

												Graphics 10/10Sound 10/10Thats about it, if you actually want to play a game, this is not it.  This game is worse than most basketball games i played back in the early 2000's.  They players move like a giant cube with an animation stuck into it.  Its like the first time someone tries to use a game make for the first time and makes a circle collide with a square.  In this game you cannot make your player walk next to another, its just not possible, you will be stuck against an invisible object.But all that is dwarfed by the impressively large input lag.  I'm not talking about the time it takes for the instruction to go from my controller and be recognised by the game, nope, i'm talking about the animation almost a second long that must happen before your character actually does seomthing.you want to shoot, wait a second.you want to move forward, wait a second.you want to steal the ball, wait a few seconds.you want to change direction, wait a secondetc, you get the point.Its annoyingly hard to get your character to stand near the 3 point line because you can't slightly move, you either run, walk, or stand still.. no variable movement at all, its just isn't in the game.There are camera issues and glitches that i could not be bothered explaining.Also, there are far too many unskippable cutscenes, for series that used to excel at being a wonderful couch potatoe game where you sit infront of your tv and play with your friends, the annoying amount of unskippable scenes and transition scenes take away from the game.Oh, and the my career cutscenes.. .. ..  they suffer from poor writing.  Its like watching an interview with donald trump about americas neuclear triad.  I should give 2k props for trying to imitate the culture of harlem, but when a white surburtan office worker in australia thinks a heap of crap, imagine how the people who actually live there think about it.  I'd imagine they would be quite insulted.This game is an unsult to the past titles which i absolutle loved with over 140 hours played on nba 14 alone, with 13 being the best.If the older titles were released into todays market, they would have done far better.

												It's not as terrible as what many believe. I have a run of the mill PC and it runs fairly smooth. The framerate does drop every so often but normally picks itself up. I think the fluidity of the game is pretty good. I have 138 hours logged, so I think that if I didn't enjoy it, I would have refunded it by now.Now the bad. For starters, whenever I want to do a quick substitution, the screen sometimes locks up on the sub screen. Because of that, I only have limited controls with the players. Kinda frustrating. And starting tonight, it began closing on its own. Though I hope it's merely a bug, I doubt 2K would fix it.Overall, It's not TERRIBLE, but it's not the best either.			"

												if you got a ps4 or xbox one version go wit that instead if you can, PC community is trash, there will be not many players online, there will be those too lazy to upgrade VC and use cheat engine to upgrade your myplayer(i'm one of these guys), and there will legit players accuse of cheating, feel bad for those guys, then there are these 7 ft tall ♥♥♥♥♥s wit the speed of Rose and shooting ability of curry, and finally there's these closet cheaters that pretends to be legit while using attribute cheat to boost their speed and shooting to 99 overall, and there's even players that can crash servers.so if you want none of these problems, dont play park or pro am at all, you wont be dealing with these issue on the console,  if you're only interested in other modes like mycareer  then this game is pretty decent "

												Has some legitimate improvements over 2k15. Would recommend based on my initial reactions.MyGM/Franchise has re-introduced 3-way trades and made some minor changes to add to the realism (promises to the GM now have consequences, trades destroy chemistry, staff contracts are negotiated, etc.). Gameplay feels tighter than in the past. Shooting is far more difficult, but that seems fair. The timing of button presses and appropriate spacing is now an aquired skill rather than automatic. Players respond better to inputs and the sense of control seems more legit.Ernie and Shaq are back, but now Kenny joins them on the desk. Add in Barkley next year, and it'll be worth it just for the pre-game/haltime/post-game shows.MyCareer is actually a lot of fun. There's a lot more interaction than in 2k15 in terms of what to do on off-days and how to earn Virtual Currency (VC). The ""Spike Lee Joint"" is completely unnecessary, but starting in year 2 the game takes a huge leap foward and it becomes a real improvement over last year's encarnation of the mode. I'd recommend skipping every cutscene and just flying through year 1 ASAP. If you want to see the movie later, it's made available in your second year. It's not awful if you're a fan of Spike Lee, it's just way too much if you want to actually play a game. The entire cutscene film is nearly 2 full hours in length. That's ridiculous for a sports game.All in all, a legitimate improvement over 2k15. I've heard online play is a mess, but I stick to single player. If you're like me in that respect, give this a try.			"

												Game is very choppy and laggy. Frame rate issues cause for very frustrating gameplay. Just doesnt seem meant for pc i can run ARK: Survival Evolved on High with less lag than a game of 2k with medium settings and no crowd. I'd request a refund for the game but i put well over 2 hours into just trying to get the game playable by adjusting with the video settings, testing out the game play for a min or two than going back to re adjust.  I put so much time into trying to get this game to work because i actually really enjoy the nba 2k games and have purchased every one since 2k5. Then there are just the issues of getting the pre-order through steam i did not recieve any bonuses even though i bought the Michael Jordan edition and that seems to be a problem that occurs only through steam. Those that bought a physical copy or through amazon have all recieved their pre-order bonuses. I figured id get this game on on my laptop because of  better graphics and frame rates but it doesn't even look or perform as well as 2k14 for my xbox 360. With 12gb of ram and AMD 8700 processor and an AMD radeon r6 8700 graphics card you'd think that wouldnt be the case. If steam and 2k can fix the gameplay issues and the pre-order bonuses missing than game is good but as it stands right now the game is almost unplayable and extremely frustrating and absolutley not worth $99.99, should of just got it for my xbox one id actually be able to shoot the ball without lagging into a travelling violation every so often			"

												You know this game is not at all what I expected, I think the only reason that I plajy it is to live the real-time roster that is currently available.  But the MyCareer is trash complete and utter garbage.  Spike Lee accomplished nothing in this and should never be brought on to operate anything in NBA 2K again.  They need to stick to the NBA 2k14 and 15 template for my My Career.  Please fire Spike Lee or get a better developement team for that mode.  I have more hours played on 2k15 than I do 2k16 and I think I am finally going to call it quits on 2k16 and go back to the 15.			"

												Okay.. I already played NBA 2K since 2K9 for the first time ever I disappointed with 2K SportDon't get me wrong, there's some improvement this year. And this is a review based on the pre release date. Pros :+ The gameplay animation and physics is good. I like it, feels more real now.+ More animation for players. More varieties of movements.+ Dunk feels more powerful+ Good concept idea on MyCareer (From High School to NBA Draft)+ AI is harder than last year. AI's Defense is more intense and quite hard to breakCons :- Always crashing after half game of the 1st NBA Game of MyCareer. Now I can't continue MyCareer- Quite lagging compare to NBA2K15 with the same game spec- MyCareer storyline. You just played as Freq, it doesn't matter what's your name is, you always become Freq. What I enjoy about MyCareer from all the other 2K is I can be myself. Now it doesn't matter, it's Frequency Vibrations who will become the all star. And yes. that's your nickname Frequency Vibrations.- Some bug where suddenly pass icon just appeared out of nowhere, very annoying especially when I tried to shot and that pass icon suddenly appeared and I end up of passing.- Stuttering especially on commentator's talk. So lag and they are late to comments any action in courtOf course I will recommended this game if 2K Games is already optimized this game, waiting for some patch and a new GPU driver that support this game. Let's see until the release date, if there's some optimizations and get better, this game is 100% recommended. it's funBut for this pre release review it's a naaahhSorry 2K.. Hope it's got better next week :)			"

Did not recieve my preorder bonus and theres already hackers on mypark. This game is basically 2k15 with a couple new features like the story mode wich allows your player to not have any choice in anything beside picking your highschool and college team etc and the players feel clunky when moving around I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS GAME AT ITS CURRENT STATE			"

												You know this game is not at all what I expected, I think the only reason that I plajy it is to live the real-time roster that is currently available.  But the MyCareer is trash complete and utter garbage.  Spike Lee accomplished nothing in this and should never be brought on to operate anything in NBA 2K again.  They need to stick to the NBA 2k14 and 15 template for my My Career.  Please fire Spike Lee or get a better developement team for that mode.  I have more hours played on 2k15 than I do 2k16 and I think I am finally going to call it quits on 2k16 and go back to the 15.			"

												My experience in basketball games ranges from the NBA Street games (you know, the best ones) to 2K15, and now 2K16. There have been stellar reviews for 2K16, praising it for the most quality basketball game thus far. Well I have to say, all in all in comparison to its previous installment, I'm not impressed.Yes, 2K16 has an actual story to its game (a Spike Lee Joint apparently), but the story is streamlined in various ways. This is not necessarily a good thing. Regardless of your nationality or ethnicity you get the same family, the same hometown, and the same story. It feels lazy and borderline offensive even. Kind of feels as though 2K Games thinks only black people are playing basketball, which is just kind of stupid. Not to mention that the story takes too much out of your hands. Want to pursue your education first and hone your skill with your college basketball team? Too bad! Spike Lee says you're off to the NBA! Unprepared I might add, because you simply aren't of the appropriate skill to handle these kinds of games yet. Almost like you should have stayed and honed that skill first. Oh well, too bad that option wasn't available eh? Kind of makes the time you took deciding on which college to go to pointless.Aside from some random cut scenes with the cringeworthy cast of characters (Jesus your in-game girlfriend [another decision you weren't allowed to make by the way] is downright nightmarish), the game basically falls back into the same game NBA2K15 was, with minor tweaks.That's the best way to explain the game as a whole, minor tweaks. Nothing special, but I suppose if you missed out on 2K15, then this game will be a newer experience to you. It's not a bad game, just not good enough to warrant calling it a brand new game.			"

												First of, this game does not have a tutorial. Brilliant. I'm a new player so I must already know all the controls, right?The loading times are something else as well, but I'd be willing to overlook that. What is not to be overlooked, however, is the amount of cutscenes you have to sit through just to play a single.. not even match, just a quarter. Horrible experience for me.			"

												Id love nothing more than to recommend this game to you guys but even after the patches and updates this game is nowhere close to being worth the 60 dollar price tag. First off I know what your thinking"" the my player mode cant be all that bad"" trust me it is, its honestly as if your playing as a character that you made but that's going through someone else's stereotypical life, and to be honest I hate the guy I made if found myself rooting against him most of the time. Not to mention your first season is literally 75 percent cut scenes that are terrible and predictable and if you skip any of the them you will be lost as hell as to what's going on. But seeing how awful the plot is I guess that could be a good thing. 2k16 does improve on the terrible AI of the past making help defense run a little smoother, not to mention ally oops and dunks aren't unstoppable anymore, improvements like these make exhibition matches pretty fun to play. The different online modes are fun to play.... that is if you can find anyone to play with in the first place, as finding a match can prove to be quite difficult it often seems like the only people on are me and ""cool daddy421"". Overall there have been some improvements but not enough to justify paying 60 dollars for it, don't buy it for more than 25 dollars or just go back to playing 2k15 you aren't missing out on much here.

												Firstly, just look at my hours for this game and the previous 4 iterations. Obviously, I'm a fan of the NBA 2K series. HOWEVER...One of the more recent updates they did broke MyCareer for a lot of people. When you try to save and quit, you crash to desktop with no error 50% of the time. If you finish a game and try to advance to the next loading screen, it crashes 50% of the time. I've even heard of people crashing while just trying to simulate through games. Imagine the frustration of playing a masterful game, netting a triple-double, and then having that progress erased with no chance to save it. I paid full price for this game when it first came out, and have since then probably bought $50 in VC, but now my characters are all unplayable. If I could, I'd get my money back for the game and the VC I bought.In short, do not buy this game. EA broke it, and they have no intention of fixing it because they'd rather you just buy 2K17. I don't know why I would expect anything else from a publisher with as much garbage history as EA.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP, PLEASE KEEP YOUR MONEY FOR FALLOUT 4 OF SOMETHING. JUST INSTALL A ROSTER UPDATE TO AN OLDER VERSION.UPDATE: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP.""The most impressive supports game ever assembled"" my♥♥♥♥♥ Although if someone paid me that much money I'd probably say that even right now.DON'T BUY IT.Ok now, I've played my career enough to hate this gameThe rules state and I quote ""Contact initiated by the defensive player guarding a player with the ball is not legal.This contact includes, but is not limited to, forearm, hands, or body check"". So If a defender charges to me and im not moving, that should not be a foul.Except it always is, always. Especially in the layup attempts. I don't seem to get such fouls.My teammates have a basketball IQ of 25. Say Someone got their shot blocked and it went out of bounds in my halfcourt. The guy inbounds immediately, giving me the only chance of a hail mary.Also they miss wide open layups, their body movement while finishing a play always say ""BLOCK MY♥♥♥♥♥quot;. Did i say I always miss wide open shots while my shot meter is very close to centre? (sometimes green releases too)Gotta mention, you cannot skip in-game cutscenes (such as timeouts, free throw prep stuff, the black and white matchup animation etc.)You cannot sim to offdays is another annoying thingI am in Miami right now and in the game i just finished, Luol Deng inbounded into the backboard twice.I will still play this game from time to time but my last message is this.♥♥♥♥ YOU 2K FOR WASTING HOURS OF MY LIFEUpdate: On a scale from Einstein to the devs, I think teammate IQ is much more resembling to the devs. If I want my SG to carry it while playing a PG, what he does is pass it back to me immediately. This means backcourt violation.Update 2: I definitely think Developers' IQ is lower than their shoe numbers.			"

												Jacko Rating9/10Well another year and another NBA2K - This review assumes you are familiar with the series.This year the team has given us something a little different and have included a story driven My Career mode, while some will hate it I thought it gave some fresh blood to the franchise and it can be mostly skipped anyway for those who aren't interested.  The game itself has been improved in several areas but to sum up it has become more realistic with the AI playing better and not so many easy dunks or silly looking alley oops in My Park for example.Graphics and Audio are both top notch and the commentary is an absolute treat with a surprising amount of variation, gameplay has become in my view slightly harder which I luv and My Park has had a few tweaks for the better also, mainly toning  down the massive advantage that taller players had previously and dampened down the 3 point shot success rate in Sunset Park which was very annoying previously and turned the games into rubbish ball for 5 year olds rather than resembeling the real game.Amazingly the game worked right out of the box - unlike the last 3 years releases which were full of bugs and issues that prevented many gamers from playing the game they bought for several days.  All in all NBA2K is still miles in front of any other BBall sim out there today and this year's release in my view has improved the franchise, given My Park a much needed face lift and brought back the highschool and university ranks to play through in My Career.A big Thumbs Up on this one :)			"

I could go on and on about bugs...Unoptimized beyond belief...Game makes me want to kill myself. Oh well, at least there's still FIFA. How does 2K even exist still, I don't even.Pros:Ernie & ShaqPS - Transitions in this game are glacially slow. Bugs like waiting for the ref who's holding the ball for no reason for 30 secs before handing it to a player for an in-bounds pass still exist decade later. Remove all cut scenes otherwise 10 min qtr games means you're playing for at least an hour.			"

												If you're assuming this game was overhyped and had way high expectations, then here's the review for you. This'll be quick.Anyways as an overview for this game, servers right now are terrible. No one online, first day of pre-release had vc hackings, server bugged for the vc store. Graphics? Amazing...if you could actually play on them. Is playable but has alloottt of lag. Like fr. Still waiting for that preorder key for the pre-ordering bonus. ): still didn't get it.My career? Terrible story. You are forced to be African-American (No problem with that) with an African American family, with one voice, as well as a terrible name (Frequency Vibrations [Freq]) and cannot create an individual character such as pale skinned, or tanned. You can't customize your character fully because of Spike Lee's stereotypical scenario which puts you into this ""world"" that is already pre-set. So gonna say. 2k Realized they needed to step up their game, brought in Spike Lee to make it happen. Didn't happen the way I wanted it to, but oh well. Graphics are majorly improved, but have more lag. Servers are trash right now. Multiplayer would be fun if nothing was hacked. Mycareer is just );< Could've been way more better in terms of the ""open"" world they were trying to create to actually ""live the dream"". But in future patches, well.. hope it'll better. 2k needs to step up the game on the pc platform. fr.			"

You have to play the same game multiple times until the game eventually says you don't crash this time. Absolutly ridiculous that 2k won't fix this game breaking bug just because it isn't 2k17.

												I've never left a bad review for a game before.  I've always felt like if a bunch of developers spent a huge amount of time on a crappy game then it'd be messed up to leave a bad review.  Well in this case I figure it's ok.  Because they take a pretty good game and absolutely ruined it.  For insance.  This game has a shot based around a cage taht fills and a timed release.  Well you'd think they'd make sure that guage is always visible.  WELL THEY DON'T.  Occasionally the guage will go off screen, behind other players or behind annoying popups that tell you things like who the announcer is that's talking or how big the last run was.  It's so infuriating to go to take a shot and suddenly have the guage covered.  It's even more annoying because the guage fill time seems to vary based on which player is shooting and how far they are from the goal.  And sometimes it doesn't even fill up.  It just shoots.  And there's no real good tutorial in the game.  Like you're just suppose to already know how to play.  So then you get to the passing on offence.  You tell it to pass and maybe it'll pass somewhere good, maybe it won't.  WHO KNOWS.  Then on defence you switch players by pressing A.  So press A repeatedly until you get the player you want.  But it transfewrs you to the player closest to the ball.  Not the player who should be covering the shooter.  And there's no alternate button as far as I can tell to choose.  So when you're cycling players sometimes you periodically interupt another player running to position, disrupting him, then you get the player you want, but the person that other guy was suppose to be covering is wide open.  This kills the game.So... given all of that, how do you make it worse?  Well, let's throw in a crap load of ads!  For instance, every time you try to shoot a free throw, on the second shot, the gatorade logo will always block you from seeing the guage.  This kills the game.What else?  Well the game calls timeouts every friggen 2 minutes.  This is an unskippable 20 second loading screen essentially every 2 minutes.  There is no way to turn this off in options or alter the volume of timeouts that are called.  This more than anything... kills. the. game.Now if this was a crappy game, I wouldn't care.  I wouldn't even want to play it.  But this game is actually fun when you can actually play it to spite the crappy passing and defense controls.  It just needs a good tutorial, a fixed position for the shooting guage that's always on top, and the ability to turn off timeouts.  If I could do that, I'd probably play the crap out of this game and LOVE it.  But... unfortunately I want to play this game all the time and it does nothing but infuriate me because it's so close to being good and just seems to be intentionally destroyed by ads, and timeouts.  Also as a side note... the story line is garbage.  It says it's a Spike Lee joint, but if I was Spike Lee I wouldn't want my name on some garbage like that.  It's horrible.  I haven't tried online play yet.  So maybe that'll be what saves the game.  But I know better than to play a game online before practicing offline for a long time.  I guess we'll see.			"

												NBA 2K16 is a great game, like its previous titles, but I'm giving it a negative review simply for the fact that the developers don't seem to fix the bugs that persisted through their previous titles. As well as some few good things that they don't seem to keep from their previous titles.1. Commentators cut off during the game sometimes. Commentary starts again at the next quarter.2. Referees sometimes just sit there with the ball for half a minute before giving it to you.3. There also seems to be problems with the VC sometimes not reaching the server properly.4. (Personal) I want the option to make a fantasy team with just the playoffs, whether it be MyGM or MyLeague. This was done in a previous 2K title. I don't know why they got rid of the option.Overall, almost nothing has changed from 2k15. I mean, there were a few changes that has inevitably made the game better (ie. speed mechanics, blocking fouls are now shooting fouls), and I understand that graphically theres only so much more they can do. It feels like there's way too much emphasis on MyCareer, if ONLY for the fact they earn more money from it. I would love to give you more money for your titles, if you released a title worthy of it. This to me tells me that the developers don't care much for the fans except for their money, and how to exploit that fact. But honestly this game is just 2k15 with different controls. Please at least fix the bugs before releasing your next game.			"

												The MyPlayer/MyCareer is jank. I'm as white as you can get. My parents and my twin sister are black. what the even heck. 2k also doesn't care at all about anything. I can't join friends, friends can't join me, there's no players in MyPark, and I can't buy anything from the store. The same stupid message pops up, saying something about how I can't connect when I'm obviously connected. It also gives me an error code to type in on the website. I type in and it just says the code was already typed in.This game could be good if 2k cared at all. But they don't.			"

												Biggest thing: the keyboard controll is not even an option for users... this is unbelievable for a PC game. I know this kind of game is often signed as the game playing with a controller, but there are people who get used to keyboard. Please make keyboard controll an option for users. And did not see much creativity. 2k15 otherwise did really well compared to 2k14, but for 2k16, the only thing better I could see is the myplayer story line created by Spike Lee			"

												This game is crap. It crashes constantly, the VC store is down, and even worse the myCareer option is NOTHING like it used to be. Its just a stupid movie and you have to follow it. First off it took me 3 hours to set the game up because it kept crashing so I hd to scour the message boards looking for ways to fix it (turns out you have to run windowed mode, turn down AA, and turn of Super Sampling, what the heck???), people online are already using the same exploits 2K knew about last year so instead of fixing it they just shut down parts of the game, and the worst part of all is the blatant racist story line. They force your character to be an ""african american"" kid, living in the projects of Harlem, with a twin sister who is black. I am Asian and this is myCareer! How the heck is my family a poor black family from the Harlem Project? This story line is set and unlike last year you can't make ANY decisions, its all done by Spike Lee. All this game is, is a Spike Lee movie and I'm not going to watch stereotypical black gangta's ballers, with a Kim Kardhashian gold digger gf, who fights with his over bearing, in your face, ghetto, attitude twin sisters, while your evil, greedy, trying to talk with hood slangs, Italian mobster agent runs around. This game is a digusting farce. I don't want this trash on my computer.			"

												The actual gameplay for this game is alright, almost great. So if you just want to shoot some hoops with a friend this is a nice sports game. However, if you care at all about the game delivering on its promises in any actual game mode besides quick matches, you'll be disappointed.Street - Sure, as long as you don't mind just walking around watching other people playing. You won't actually get to play any games, since as soon as you queue up, everyone else will leave, because they don't want to play with your low ranked scrub. If someone actually takes pity on you, get ready for the bashing of your life, seeing as your skills are probably mid stat and everyone else is maxed out. So time to open your wallet, pay good money and max out your character, wait another 20 minutes to even get into a game, lose anyway since everyone else also bought game potions.ProAm - I still haven't figured out how this works. As far as I can see it has the same tedious problems as Street - this is just a 5 man version.You character will still suck. And you'll have to wait 30 minutes or so to fill up all slots to get the game going. 2K advertises this as a game mode where you can create your own team where there is an actual ranking, but to my knowledge you won't get anywhere near actually playing as your custom team unless you bring 4 friends.Career - The ""Spike Lee joint"" part is ridiculous. 2K tries to feed you a storyline and crams in all kinds of characters that are supposed to add immersion. It does just the opposite. I have no idea why my white 5'8 geek was raised in an african-american family in Brooklyn. Nor why he speaks with the deep voice of a 7' giant. I mean, I get cut scenes where my stepmom (well, you explain it!) explains how she met my stepdad... and this is supposed to immerse me how exactly? How you perform in high school makes no difference. What college you choose makes no difference. How you perform during your rookie season makes no difference. Then onto your first real season playthrough. And chances are big you'll finish dead last in your conference. Make a trade, the sooner the better. For me, I still thought my team had a fighting chance of making the playoffs, so I stayed on until it was too late. Then came the last season game and after that - Boom! Next season. I didn't get to see how the playoffs went, no awards, no summary, nothing. Oh well, atleast I can request a trade now? Nope! You need to play 10 games the next season first. Oh, so is that like an NBA rule? I'll just sim through the first ten matches. No, no. You actually have to play 10 matches. The fu....? So I'm stuck on this roster for ten more games? I'll just sim through the rest of the season, maybe some other team will take an interest in me. Not going to happen, silly... Now you're back at the start of a new season on the same crappy roster. Only now, your popularity on the trade boards have gone from 100% to 10-15%.MyTeam - *Uninstalls game...* "

												The most annoying game you will ever play.-Controling you character is unresponsive and too scripted.-Turn off the commentators right away because they're poorly programed, will repeat sentences multiple times in a row and a lot of the time what they're saying makes no sense at all.-MyCareer story is simply - ♥♥♥♥. You are an honor student from the projects who is also an amazing b-ball player. Oh yeah also your nickname is ""Freq"".-""2K Beats"" is a soundtrack of then popular songs that are censored (it goes ""blow a kiss, **** * ***"" apperantly) and just repeat over and over until you lose sanity.And the worst part is:-The mother♥♥♥♥ing AI. Your teammates (that you don't control) can't play defence or offence at all.On D they can't deffend the pick & roll and are unable to rotate so when I play great defence but my team allows 15 inside baskets I can't do ♥♥♥♥.On offence They either hog the ball untill time runs out or you call for the pass or they try a hand at the worst possble solution so they ♥♥♥♥ up your whole day.In conclusion: Awful AI, boring and unnecessey MyCareer story, bad soundtrack, bad controls.How to fix: Hire better programmers, keep to a simple story, bring back 2k12 soundtrack, make your player more responsive to controls.If you read all of this I feel bad for you son, I got 99 reccomendations but this game isn't one.

												Ok, so first off, 2K straight up lied to us about pre-order bonuses and said that we would get 3 emerald packs (which would ensure us all 3 emerald cards) and low and behold, I get 2 bronze's and 1 gold. That is 100% false advertising. Also, the game lags like crazy and the loading times are especially slow. Yes, go ahead, tell me I'm being too harsh because the game hasn't even officially been released yet. These things however, have nothing to do with the problems I'm experiencing with the actual game right now. That is for another rant. 2k, you and your team have turned one of my most beloved franchises into absolute monetizable garbage. Time to sweep you under the rug.			"

												If you're interested in simulation basketball, this game runs a mean fast break on all previous iterations -- I'm talking New Jersy Nets Gerald Green head above the rim alley oop windmill dunk. Gone are the days of the ubiquitous jack-of-all-trades superstars. More than ever, the basketball IQ of the person behind the controller matters, and I welcome that. Sure, some cheaters still exist, but, if you learn at least part of the art of basketball, it's not a forgone conclusion that you'll lose.Despite the backlash against MyCareer mode this year, it's an enjoyable mode with a storyline that can be forgotten entirely after your rookie season. In fact, from the second season forward, this mode is probably the most in-depth and satisfying career mode in any sports game. If you're considering buying this game, don't listen to those who wished for the moon and were delivered a game rooted in great basketball mechanics.There are so many modes in this game (I'll let you read about them elsewhere) that any basketball fan should be able to find something they like.

												Great game, very different from the past releases. They have completely remodeled the defense making it a lot harder to just zig zag through the cpu's defense which means you have to really work hard for those shots. Also passing is different with new controls and animations and with the new defense some passes are you may have used to do are a lot harder leading in several turnovers They have added a lot more gameplay animations blocks are more realistic, player movements are alot better with faster reaction times. Each player also has their own way of playing. Also body animations are added such as flexing playing with their mouth guard, dunk face animations, gum chewing, etc.The rating system makes more sense this year even though some of you may disagree they are doing it by comparing the players ability to the greatest in that area like for example the best avg rebounder is Dennis Rodman so he has a 99 OFF and 95 DEF in rebounding compared to a current dominating rebounder with DeAndre Jordan who is given a 92 OFF and 94 DEF and same goes for other attributes so if you dont like it, no one cares.MyCareer also has the Spike Lee storyline which has lots of mixed feelings. I just want to mention in my opinions stop b*tching just cause yoour family is black, there are countless games that I've played where I'm given a family that looks nothing like me as a created player and like many others we dont complain we just play and enjoy what they give us. Also they'd need more voice actors which would be too expensive for something they're just trying out.Any way in MyCareer you now have offdays where you get to do either connections (haging out with someone in the leauge such as player, teamowner, celeb) where you get rewards like VC or my favourite you get to pick your game day jersey. Also there's training on off-days for attribute boosts and Endorsments that also give VC. So those are all your choice. Only problem I have with it is you play 3 HS games and 4 College no VC games but are fun and only 8 rookie season games while I would prefer having the whole rookie season to play.MyGm has been redesigned and is more realistic with team relocation added.My Team added several new things like player cards that attributes change as the season goes by with their performance. I may missed some stuff but if this hasn't made you want the game, I don't know what will.So if you want the best NBA... No, a sports game of all time. Here it is.Well till 2K releases something better anyway.			"

												The basketball so far has been excellent.  The story in My Career has not.  Anyone familiar with Spike Lee's previous work can guess what it is: Preachy ghetto story that has been told 1000 times.  The whole thing is just very very cheesy.  All credit to the actors for trying to salvage the script, but they really had their work cut off for them.I've just realised the first 3 lines of my review sound like a review on iMDB.  So..... basketball.It's a lot more fluid, the players have a better sense of weight, and it just feels right.  Controls have been changed quite a bit with more passing options, and after a while I really like the change.Presentation is very good, and I love the post game show (whenever I quit early Shaq seems to give me a filthy look).Sound is a bit wonky though, and I have had a few odd bugs where the sound goes a bit mental.  Otherwise, it's technically fine turned up to the max.If you love basketball you'll enjoy this.  If you can suffer through the god awful story the My Career is actually quite engaging.  Thankfully you can skip the cutscenes.Oh, and get used to being called Freak (Freq? whatever).I mean seriously Spike. Frequency Vibrations?  Really?  I swear you ran a competition in local primary schools and a local 8 year old kid thought that up.  At least I hope that's the reason.Signing off as I'm ranting.			"

												The Spike Lee Joint portion of this game does not take your gameplay into account at all. It's irrelevant how poorly you play, you are a superstar and that's it. Still, the actors are seemingly giving this annual release of a sports game their all and that makes the lengthy cutscenes in between games worth checking out. The story line certainly goes to some peculiar, melodramatic places that can be entertaining in ways that aren't always intentional. If you snagged this, give the MyCareer mode a try.			"

												Only played 33 hours so far but gameplay and my career mode have been improved nicely so far! Even more realistic than last years game, get ready for some authentic basketball! You start off now in High school and do some games then you get some offers for college basketball and you pick where to go. Then you get to play college games and then off to the NBA! Nice improvement to My Career no doubt! 2k just keeps improving!I will edit this review after 50 hours or so again. So far so good though, only issue I have had so far is that the preorder bonuses are not working yet (I think they might not unlock until the game fully comes out on tuesday). Everyone seems to be writing bad reviews because they don't like Spike Lee, pretty pathetic if you ask me. This game has the best gameplay every in a 2k game and people are angry a black director helped on My Career mode.The game is also running very well (75-80 fps for me atm) and I am not having many issues, just hoping to get my preorder bonus on tuesday and I will be set. Sports gaem of the year so far! Better than Fifa and madden so far.			"

												NBA 2k was once a respectable franchise, 2K16 was the first I got on pc however the devs give absolutely nothing about the PC community and just like last few years. The game is full of bugs and gamebreaking glitches. The reason I keep coming back is the pre release hype, this time being the MyCareer story mode that on a sidenote is completely garbage, I'm not black and not from Harlem so its not even your own career.The online community is toxic and full of hackers, the 7ft center of last year are 5 ft '11 guards this year, for new players there is no point in getting the game this time of the year because when you go online nobody will play with you because you are a low rated player, everyone is a 99 overall in the first weeks of the game.The controls feel sticky and the gameplay is slow compared to 2k10,11 and 12.If you're not a basketball fanatic, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			"

												After playing on free weekend, I'm glad I didn't purchase it. It was buggy and the graphics were not on par with 2015. The game however, was easy to pick up on, having never played any sports games before. If this is your first, I would suggest looking elsewhere for quality because you won't find it here. Glitches were everywhere and made it near impossible to play.  I feel I don't have enough to properly review it, but I can say what what I had played, this game is not all it was cracked up to be.

												Best sport game i've ever played. NBA shows that giving the story in games of sport is a great idea that actually works. The game is very complex which means its not monotonous, and thats important thing. 2k should be an instance for the other producers, how to create a polished sport game.			"

												What can I say about the game?Pros1.Great quility on default, prob on max even better2.Only have tried MyTeam so far, so can't say anything about other modes, but MyTeam is good3.MyCareer Story is very good.Cons1. no keyboard configuration, but somehow I have gotten used to gamepad 2. controls I guess are cluncky, but that is ONLY because I have to play on gamepad which will take a A LOT of time to get used to the game (now ok)3. VC glitch (fixed now)Overall: I Have changed the review from negative to positive and once again have to change it to negative, because 2K just CAN'T make GOOD SERVERS, example, RTP 6th seed was 1-6 and had 4 losses because of errors in game, now in 5th seed have 3 losses cause of errors...I NEVER get a Win from an error, why it always has to be a loss?Just don't count the game, the hell 2K?

												Is Spike Lee a terrible person? Probably not. Did he make a terrible thing happen to a good game? Absolutely. So much cringe, and it takes forever to skip, some are unskippable, the MyCareer should be one of the best things about the game, yet its the worst. Luckily the game is redeemed by MyLeague and the depth of the actual gameplay. You literally have to understand the game and the players, or you will not win. Don't know the weaknesses of a teams star players? Get Rekt. Don't know how to play off your teams strengths? Get Rekt. Watch some games, study some stats, and git gud at this amazing game to pwn your friends.Now if only I could stop Cheif Curry from making these threes....			"

												I just want to say. First off, people are giving this game a REALLY bad wrap. Mycareer might not be your cup of tea. But seriously, come on, the game itself without Mycareer mode, is friggin the best basketball game on the market today, period. I have a i74770K, amd R9280 and 8 GB ram, runs almost flawlessly on max graphics. NEVER had a crash , ever. PLaying in any of the modes. So this review will be about the GAMEPLAY itself and NOT mycareer mode. The gameplay is difficult, its tough, you need to know some moves, some plays and you need to mix it up to get by defenders. Its true, this game, DOESA have a learning curve, but then the BEST games have a learniing curve. If it was to easy, id be bored shtless in 5 seconds. Yes it IS hard to get by Ai, but still possible, if you learn some plays and mix it up. Everything gameplay wise has been smoothed out, compared to all the other NBA 2K games. Franchise is better, blacktop is better, the game IS better.Now as far as mycareer mode goes, I havent tried it, because of all the negative feedback on it.Graphics 8/10 for a basketball game, easily. Id give it a 10/10 if they fixed a few bugs(which theres barely any that ive experienced)Sound 10/10, the commentary is incredible for a sports game. Just play Rugby challenge 3 and compare it or WWE 2K16.gameplay 8/10 Its about as close as we are going to get without playing basketball.Presentation 9/10 It feels and looks like the real NBA presentation, right down to the halftime report.So overall a 35/40 for me and if they improve a few bugs and make it a bit smoother, this game coudl easily get a 10/10.

												Really disappointed by 2k, again.PRO:-Even better graphics than 2k15 (that makes me run the game with low settings)-One new voice for the reporter ( The other one is still annoying, saying the same old♥♥♥♥♥♥for 2 years and counting)-At least this year Pharrel didn't ♥♥♥♥ed up even the music, thank god.-Menus are better, but I still don't like it, especially all the useless animation between them-Better Defense-You can create your arena and jerseys on MyTeam, very cool feature. -Only NBA pc gameCONS:-Ratings are quite wrong to me, maybe they are not updated yet, we'll see-Laggy, game has FPS drops quite often-Glitch, player walking inside other player or referee desk etc-I really hate that momentum mechanis gameplay. As soon as you make a mistake, you're screwed because cpu will start blocking your shots, stealing your ball and most of your shots won't fall either way.-What the heck is that myPlayer? I'm a white guy with a black sister and family and I can't decide anything, it's just a long and annoying movie-MyTeam is quite difficult to me,especially with bronze player. Also 6 minutes per quarter are just too many. After 20 minutes of playing point by point, the cpu will start destroying you with big runs. -If you like passing a lot, you will end up yelling and swearing at the game. cpu will just raise his hand and intercept something like 30% of your pass, which is very frustrating. -Voice randomly muting for the entire quarterOverall: I just really am not able to enjoy my time with this game, just feel so frustrating. I think they should focus on 2 gameplay mode: MyPlayer which is the most played and MyTeam which can be profitable for them. I would cut all the mypark player♥♥♥♥♥♥ Game mechanics sucks, and the player felt to me more fluid in 2k14. I see that there are a lot of negative reviews and the positive one are just because there isn't just anything else to play on pc. After 250+ Hours on 2k15, 250+hours on 2k14 I doubt i will play 2k16 for such a long time, pity.			"

												I just want to say. First off, people are giving this game a REALLY bad wrap. Mycareer might not be your cup of tea. But seriously, come on, the game itself without Mycareer mode, is friggin the best basketball game on the market today, period. I have a i74770K, amd R9280 and 8 GB ram, runs almost flawlessly on max graphics. NEVER had a crash , ever. PLaying in any of the modes. So this review will be about the GAMEPLAY itself and NOT mycareer mode. The gameplay is difficult, its tough, you need to know some moves, some plays and you need to mix it up to get by defenders. Its true, this game, DOESA have a learning curve, but then the BEST games have a learniing curve. If it was to easy, id be bored shtless in 5 seconds. Yes it IS hard to get by Ai, but still possible, if you learn some plays and mix it up. Everything gameplay wise has been smoothed out, compared to all the other NBA 2K games. Franchise is better, blacktop is better, the game IS better.Now as far as mycareer mode goes, I havent tried it, because of all the negative feedback on it.Graphics 8/10 for a basketball game, easily. Id give it a 10/10 if they fixed a few bugs(which theres barely any that ive experienced)Sound 10/10, the commentary is incredible for a sports game. Just play Rugby challenge 3 and compare it or WWE 2K16.gameplay 8/10 Its about as close as we are going to get without playing basketball.Presentation 9/10 It feels and looks like the real NBA presentation, right down to the halftime report.So overall a 35/40 for me and if they improve a few bugs and make it a bit smoother, this game coudl easily get a 10/10.

												Is Spike Lee a terrible person? Probably not. Did he make a terrible thing happen to a good game? Absolutely. So much cringe, and it takes forever to skip, some are unskippable, the MyCareer should be one of the best things about the game, yet its the worst. Luckily the game is redeemed by MyLeague and the depth of the actual gameplay. You literally have to understand the game and the players, or you will not win. Don't know the weaknesses of a teams star players? Get Rekt. Don't know how to play off your teams strengths? Get Rekt. Watch some games, study some stats, and git gud at this amazing game to pwn your friends.Now if only I could stop Cheif Curry from making these threes....			"

												I'm a long time player of the NBA 2K series.For the record. Yes I like the game. Yes I think it's better in every way than it's predecessor. Yes there's loads of new content. Yes the graphics are better. Yes the game-physics are better. Yes the MyPlayer story is interesting, if a bit short. Yes all the game modes are better. Finally, the biggest pro of the game 2K actually seems to give a rats ### about us PC gamers for once! Big Ups 2k! However... The same problems persist across the board, in each and every game mode.I'm a big fan of MyPlayer, but just in case your wondering, YES the problems I'll mention WILL persist in every game mode.The famous GOLDEN BULLET principle is still in effect. Durant, Bryant, Curry amd other crunch-time shooters are still frustrating to guard; NOT because of their skill, though - that would be something I could live with - but the GOLDEN BULLET principle allows them to make three point shots through defenders hands, armpits and even their body.Great Defensive Players have their own GOLDEN BULLET problem. Simply standing within 6 feet or so of a defensive ""ace"" will more or less remove whatever shooting skill you have, whether he's standing between you and the basket or not. Notorius Shot Blockers like Ibaka, Gibson and the like are able to block the shot without even touching the ball. Tony Allen, CP3 and other Top-Thieves are able to steal the ball without being able to reach it. - YES I checked the replay...Finally, there is the Makes You Look Bad Effect - Or in plain terms, the player's gotta be the one responsible for coughing the ball up: On offense, in key situations I'll push the pass button to make a pass - gee... - and in most other situations the pass will go off without a hitch. However in said situations the player in question won't make the pass at all, and I raise my eyebrow and think ""WTF... Well whatever, let me just make another play."" but then, in something like a few seconds I'm left thinking and even bigger ""WTF!!!!"" when the player THEN makes the pass to the player I indicated seconds before, who, of course,  is no longer open at this point - Instant Turnover.Also in a Defensive Rebound situation you quickly advance the ball to avoid turning it over to a CP3 or D-Wade or whoever who's crowding you and Hallelujah, you make the pass to an open teammate who takes it across the line as you sprint up the court, only to gawk in terror as your teammate passes the ball BACK to you before you've even crossed the line, AND YET SOMEHOW you still get the Turnover... Illegal screens, while they certainly do occur, is a little hard to swallow when the ""screen"" button is the only button you're pressing and yet the player STILL moves into the screen at random moments.... Same deal with a great entry pass into the low post, where the post player, for whatever reason loses the ball or gets it stolen; STILL YOUR TURNOVER. Funny, if you're the player in the post, and the same thing happens, it's ALSO your turnover. Finally there's the weird timing of passing system which I've yet to figure out how works. It's obviously very. VERY advanced, seing as directional passing is lot like playing russian roulette. One time in six the ball will be passed to a VERY covered player instead of the wide-open one you thought you were passing it to, and the reason? Well, I'm assuming there's a very strict timing as to when and where the directional passing indicates who exactly it is your passing to, and that it changes dynamically. That's fine, but it does have me swearing by Direct Pass more times than not, just to avoid brainfreezing directional passes which would land you on Shaqting A Fool in a heartbeat.The AI controlling the rest of your teams, at times, is a little thick as well.... - I've never seen so many Defensive-and/or-Offensive 3-second Violations in real life Basketball, but defensively, you get the feeling you're either not being told you're supposed to be double-teaming someone, becasuse a big man is suddenly called for the 3 seconds. Several times in a row... (If it was a rookie from Europe, I might even think it was realistic. But lets be honest, when it's the Gasols, Noah, or even Tyson Chandler?!!! Oh hell no...) Offensively, it's usually a dude in the paint, having just passed outside and waiting for a wide open shot from a team mate, that never happens...(A singular piece of advice here. Unless you're utterly desperate, forget the hold button down to Lead-To-The-Basket-Pass exists! I'm not saying this because of the fact that it's a dumb system, cause that should be obvious. The fact that you can't cancel the pass easily and the player will usually make the pass anyway even if the Cutter is standing neck deep in three defenders, IS, JUST, STUPID. No The problem is choosing the recipient. Leftstick should do that, except it doesn't. I mean it REALLY DOESN'T. I was being double teamed and i was right next to my teams primary penetrator so I thought, wtf go for it. So I pressed down and held that Lead-To-Basket-Pass button down... And I went ""huh?"" when the icon did NOT in fact appear and the guy didn't move... Uh, what? I then caught on as I saw a cutter coming the opposite wing, weaving through defenders, whom, of course caught whiff, and started defending the passing lanes. So there I was, double teamed, leadpass button pressed, and couldn't pass it to nobody but the, by now, most defended player on my team besides me. Turnover... Obviously...)The same sort of thing applies to when your defending Superstars. The CPU seems to decide when and where your player ""freezes"" or does something S-A-F worthy. Usually it's when Lebron has the ball or Westbrook or whoever, usually a good penetrator. I don't begrudge them being good enough to get past me on the perimeter or being able to manufacture a shot against two or even three defenders, but seeing the player you're in control of suddenly stand still for a split second even though you've been running for 4 seconds already, jump straight up, AT THE FREETHROW LINE, behind an opposing player on the break even though you're still moving and right on his heels, NOT jump to contest the shot even when told to, or NOT get the rebound that's basically in his hands, or whatever... It's frustrating to say the least... It's things like this that make me SO tired of playing that I usually shut it down and stop playing for a good long while until I remember how much I like the game.In all honesty if it weren't for the drawbacks I would probably be playing this game every day.Room for improvement 2K. You've gotten better and better and I like that, but keep at it! Perfection is an impossibillity, I know, but you should strive for it just the same; or else what are you even doing it for?Update: Dear 2K... I know the new game is out and all, but PLEASE, show a little attention to detail for the next patch on this one? - The only thing ""getting old"" about it, presently, is this: My LEAST favorite bug in the game. The ""Gremlin"" in the game, usually during, but not exclusive to, the playoffs, where you finally, FINALLY, have a MONSTER GAME. You know the type - either a 5 by 5, a Triple-Double, 50 points +, perfect shooting 22-for-22, yadda-yadda-yadda... Or, heck, all of the above. And then the end of the game rolls along. (Doris Burke does a disappearing act and I start to grimace... I know what's coming already, but there's nothing I can do about it now.) We go through to the Player Of The Game segment and then it's the menu to advance. At this point the screen prompts it is ""Saving."" WTF is it saving? When done, I press advance. The game cuts out and when I start the game again, and reenter the game mode in question, the game NEVER HAPPENED!!! And it's ALWAYS that ONE PERFECT GAME!!!! Pretty please, with sugar, whipped cream and a cherry and chocolate sprinkles and whatever-else-youj-want-on-top, 2K, could you KINDLY do something about that? It's SOOOOO frustrating....			"

												I bought this game for mycareer since it was on sale and afte 6 hours of playing I gave up.  I never even made it to the NBA.   Your team AI is complete trash, they will pass  up open looks, or not pass as you cut unhindered to the basket, they don't play defense and miss wide open shots.  The opposing AI however is very good, will fight through screens, run plays and actually look like a team.  Your team just stands around and wont even pass you the ball.  I dont understand what the computer thinks a good game in college is.  My draft stock was plummeting even though I lead every game in scoring, and had a fg% over 50% at least 5 rebounds and 2 assists a game, along with a steal and block and all the headlines would say I was a ""house of horrors"" and may slip into the second round.  The story is TERRIBLE.  I made my player white (because Im white) and i had a black family and black twin sister and grew up in Harlem?  wtf...			"

												Well... for those people who are hesitating to buy this game, I have something to tell you. I am a big fan of 2K and yesterday I eventually bought this game. I was so excited when it finished the download. I tried to launch the game, a launching window popped up and then disappeared. Nothing happened... The game couldn't even start... I thought maybe my pc was missing something else so I searched online and did everything following the guides. I redownloaded the game as well and tried EVERY possible solution, but unfortunately they all didn't work. My pc runs win10 with an i7 core and gtx950m. I find out that a few people actually meet this cannot-start problem, perhaps it is related to the compatibility with win10? I have no idea. Anyway, I am very disappointed. I heard a lot of negative reviews on this game but I was still willing to give it a try. The reality is that I cannot even start the game...and not only me... The good thing is Steam gives me the refund immediately (actually the next day, kind of ironic for 2K or Steam is efficient?), and that surprises me a lot. To sum up, give a thumb to Steam! As to 2K, well... dunno what to say anymore...			"

												I don´t even know if I will recommend this game or not. I have played a lot of it but sometimes it's just REALLY BAD. The game favors the computer it seems like. Right before I wrote this I rage quit a game against the computer where they made a shot THROUGH the backboard, I THOUGHT PHYSICS WERE A THING IN THIS GAME! Same game: my Curry (with 99 3 pointers) missed a total of three 3 pointers uncontested and my release was almost perfect in all of them; Their LeBron James made 4 with 2 of them being contested (and he has like  70 something 3's). If I wanted I could come back in 30 mins and make another review of anothere BS game.			"

												I have a few hundred hours in my career on 2k15 and held off on getting 2k16 until it was on a good sale. I can understand the hate for a bigger story mode in my career, but as far as I can tell that's all it is. The situations and overall goals seem the same as 2k15, only it goes deeper because of spike lee trying to create a bigger story you can get into. The graphics and fluidity of play seem better than 2k15. I haven't done multiplayer or my team yet so check other reviews for that, but for the summer sale I really like this purchase.			"

												If u have played any other NBA 2K, then u will like this game. Graphics r great, and the little touches they have done with the crowd and players r great and really makes it seem like a real NBA game. The music used for this game is great too.Minor glitches with sound during some parts of gameplay, but gameplay itself isnt affected.I STRONGLY, and i repeat, STRONGLY recommend using a controller to play this game. Very hard to play using the keyboard.Other than that i would strongly recommend this game!! "

												I am seldon writing reviews on games, but when I do it's either a great game or people have to be warned. Even while I have read older reviews crushing the MyCareer-Mode and the controls, Mostly this game is interesting for me because of the MyCareer-Mode, cause i suck at controlling a whole team in NBA games, so I thought give it a go for 10€. You can't make anything wrong.I may have made a mistake. positive: - presentation is as awesome as ever- gives you something to do on your offdays- graphics are okay in gamenegative:- god dammit the controls feel so cluncky, everything seems to react on a delay. I let the player sprint and want to stop in front of the enemy, but no the player runs outside the field 50% of the time - don't expect your character to be a good shooter, had so many open looks and made him an outside shooter, never hit green or even got close to scoring in the NBA- PG's in this game love to hold the ball, even when the whole team is screaming at them- pick and rolls don't seem to exist- and starting the season as a 57-60 overall always sucked, give us something to be on a level with the other rookies and change the progession system, is it that hard?- randomly crashesThe story: For the most part I have to admit, that I liked the story under some circumstances. It was to short for my taste, just a few highschool, collage and rookie games and thats it? Didn't took me 4 hours to play through that. I thought of my swedish looking 6'8"" guy as an adoptive child and tried to ignore the twinstoryline. Even while the dialogs were kinda cheesy the story was on a good way, but poorly transfered into a game. Some aspects could have been easily randomized. AND PLEASE GETTING CALLED ""Freq"" (FREAK) THE WHOLE GAME, WHO WANTS THIS?WHAT I WISH FOR IN THE FUTURE: SMOOTH controls were the player reacts as I want and not 2 seconds later as I pressed buttons, as well as actually doing what I pressed and not what the pc wants me to do, so I can lose possession. I dream of a game were the player passes in the direction I hold the stick.			"

												If you're thinking of buying NBA 2K16, you might as well purchase its predecessor NBA 2K15. 2K16 has slightly better graphics than 2K15 and the animations look slightly better but everything remains the same. If you’re solely interested in buying 2K16 in order to see the new players, you might as well download the 2015-2016 roster available on 2K15.If you’ve begun to play MyTeam late, you’ll realize that most of your opponents tend to utilize Steph Curry or LeBron James as their picks in the Gauntlet, which damper your picks as you’ll still be stuck with your bronze starters and a possible gold or sapphire that comes your way. Multiplayer is extremely laggy, with constant drops and opponents disconnecting. Your AI teammates still behave strange and actually allow for weak defense being played against the AI opponents allowing for easy buckets and unfair gameplay, making switching between teammates creating a lag and opportunity for the AI to sprint past you. I didn’t desire to even try MyCareer after having heard the great comments about Spike Lee’s direction (sarcasm).The game also contains a lot of issues regarding FPS and video settings. As a person with a decent computer to play games, I constantly seem to get FPS drops.Overall, I was severely displeased. Someone who has never played 2K15 will find that 2K16 is quite amazing but the fact that 2K continually releases the same issues and errors is frustrating. Every 2K game since 2K14 has felt exactly the same. I probably won’t be purchasing 2K17 until it goes on sale just as I bought 2K15 and 2K16. None of the 2K games is worth their +$60 value. The game is in general a bad port from console to PC. The developers should listen to the steam complaints.			"

												One of the worst sports games I have ever played. Graphics and sound 4/5Controls 1/5Ai 1/5Gameplay 2/5I bought this game on sale because Madden will never come to PC and I thought I would give this series a try. That was a mistake. This game is garbage. The ai is terrible regardless of which team you play as. They foul constantly even if I don't touch the game pad or disable late game fouling. The opponent Ai pulls some incredible bs such as with 0.3 seconds left in a game where I was up by 2, the opponent ai over hand throws beyond half court a game winning 3 point shot. Once...ok..but 3 times!? I felt like the cavs over the last 52 years. I can handle getting beat by a computer. Just not 3 times in a row by some robot super human throwing half court field goals with less than a half a second left. The controls are like that of a fighting game. There are so many combos and schemes , I felt it was too complicated for a sports game. I stuck the simple buttons for shooting , blocking and jumping. Beyond that would require a cheat sheet in front of me to remember the 6 button combo to alley-oop.The career or season mode or whatever is kind of a joke too. There is a dialog tree and it treats it like some kind of terrible RPG instead of like the older franchise modes in Madden. I lulzed when I was presented with 3 options ranging from happy to angry to respond to the owners questions with. I guess this is more for the kids. Not sure what I expected. I was looking forward to front office tasks while playing the games. It is not that : \I tried to get a refund but because steams refund system would require me to relinquish every title I purchased when I got this, I felt it was not worth it. I'll suck it up and just count my losses. If you have never played the nba2k games before, don't bother. I see a lot of the positive reviews are people who enjoy this franchise of games . Just was not for me.Overall 2/5 . It does look and sound good. That is all it has going for it IMO.			"

The gameplay is overly complicated, the cut scenes are out of control, and the storyline for MyCareer mode is terrible.I should state I do not play these games online with others so perhaps that experience is where its at for NBA 2K, I mainly play the Franchise and MyCareer modes for fun and it falls way short for me.

												One of the best Sports games by far. I always played games like FIFA because football (soccer) is extreamly famous in Europe but then I thought I should give NBA a try and I just fell in love with the game. The graphic is pretty good the game mchanics are also good. The only downside are the minor bugs like having a ball inside the face or the shorts going up to the waist, and whe I was changing the lips on myplayer he couldnt speack normal anymore his lips wher e moving way to fast.

												This game is terrible. I can't describe it any other way.Granted, I am a very casual gamer so maybe I don't have the patience required for this game but there are so many things wrong with it.Cons-Career mode is a joke. Your player is so bad it's not even fun. Misses 75% of his shots, can't shoot freethrows, it's just aweful. -Constant UI lag. I don't know what's wrong with this game, but it seems like everything you do is horribly slow. Press the X button for a jump shot and your player will travel for almost no reason (like a player can't do a jump shot on the move or something?). Release the shooting button on time and you'll actually be late (falling down or away once you release) for again no reason. This is not a Specs Issue either, I'm running a machine with specs much higher than recommended. -Game is just horrible with Steam Controller, I couldn't recommend playing in this manner to anyone. The dunk stick just dosn't work right because Steam had to be different and go with some sort of scroll pad.-Learning Curve is too high for casual players. I'll do a simple pick and role and the player will just pass to someone else. How stupid is that? I call for a pick and roll and go to pass, and the player kicks it out to someone on the wing who's being guarded...game is so poorly designed in this regard. -Driving to the basket is unneccesarily difficult. The game actuallly punishes you for not running designed plays and maintaining a certain tempo about your play. In real life (I have NBA league Pass) these players would not miss the chances I create in the game when driving to the basket. Yet I almost nearly always miss when driving to the hoop. I also cannot shoot 3's because the shooting command on Steam Controller is delayed or something. I tap X to shoot and the player releases the ball a milisecond before coming back down to the floor. Like the type of real-life shot a player would make as he's getting fouled near the basket. Complete garbage.-Passing is also not right. I can't tell you how many times I move out to the wing and try to pass directly to the center who's got some space and the ball gets picked off in a manner that isn't consisten with the physics of basketball. Again, the game is designed to force you to play a certain way and you cannot simply work around that. -The substitute menu freezes often and interferes with what would be the bounce pass or B button on my controller (configurations vary). It causes me to have to restart, in which case I generally just turn off the game.Overall I don't have the patience to learn to be good at this game and I think it's a horrible waste of time and money.

												I am a fan of NBA2K games whether good or bad and this game seems like it would be really fun on console; however, on PC it is just plain awful. It seems like there are little to no updates (feel free to correct me if I am wrong) or at least not since I got it during the summer sale, very low fps, delayed response sometimes when I am using a controller, and there is no obvious fix to my knowledge of how to get this game to run well enough for it to be playable. I feel that if I am using a computer that exceeds max setting standards for a game, I should not be looking up fixes to make it run better! It is very obvious the the developers had no concerns about how the game runs on PC before releasing it and they failed to fix it after release. Worst part of this is I played more than 2 hours of this game (even though most of these hours are me afk trying to figure out how to fix the game) so I can't even get a refund which I blame more so on Steam's policies than the terrible devs. NBA2k17 is coming out in September and 2K16 is still not fixed so I doubt I will be buying it.

												This review is based on 12 hours of gameplay, mostly My Career, and a tiny bit of My Park and Pro AM. I wrote this review between the pre-release and the release of the game, so some of the problems might have already been solved when you'll read these lines.Quite a lot of things improved this year, but the game is riddled with bugs, crashes and exploits at the moment.PROS:- Graphics (more details, better skins, shoes, etc.)- Animations don't lock you so much any more. It's easier to place yourself accurately on the court for these previously hard-to-reach play positions.- The My Career mode has more things to do, such as drills on off days. You have access to a real court filled with your team mates, where you can take part in different drills or just shoot around with your mates.- You can also manage how you want to spend the rest of your off-time to gain VC or fans with endorsements and connections with influential people in the NBA.- You have a customizable court where you can play or just chill out with friends- The game is a bit harder than last year, at least in My Career, which is a good thing- The reworked controls are easier to grasp and work better for me- a bunch of bugs from last year have been fixed- less lag in My Park- Maybe the Pro AM mode, when it works? (see below)CONTROVERSIAL:- The Spike Lee story takes you from High School (3x8 minute games) to college (4x10 minute games) to your rookie year (8 normal-length games). It ends at the end of your rookie year, so it's not very long. After that, you get your usual but improved My Career experience- Some people don't like it, but I think that the story is pretty good. It immerses you in the life of (your) an NBA player and serves as a big tutorial, starting with easy games. I put brackets around ""your"", because you answer by the stupid nickname of Frequency Vibrations (Freq in-game, sounding like Freak). You can change it when the story ends, but they still continue calling you Freq sometimes when they refer to what happened in the story. - It's a non-interactive story, apart from the choice of high-school and college, which has no incidence on the story.- Even though you create a white character, you'll still have the same black parents and sister. It doesn't bother me though, because it's only apparent during the (not so long) story. Also, their skin is more mixed than really black, so it didn't really break immersion with my white character.CONS- new year = new bugs (nothing game breaking so far, apart from the lines below)- frequent crashes to desktop when navigating through specific menus- less frequent CTDs when loading a game- Some players could exploit the VC store and now have rating 88+ characters in My Park. So no point in going there until they are banned, reset, or you can catch up with their characters.- The Pro AM mode just doesn't work at the moment, you can see your player entering and leaving the court endlesslyCONCLUSION:It's a much improved version this year, adding plenty of major and minor things which improve the gameplay and immersion. You might want to wait for a few patches though, especially if you plan on playing online.			"

												Let me make this clear. I love the changes to MyGM and MyLeague, which is the only reason I'm recommending this game. However, if you are intending to make MyCareer the majority of your playing experience...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The game is advertised as 'My Story' yet puts you on a linear preplanned story. If it was my story my guy would not have been born in Harlem, he would have attended a different college program, and he would have stayed for more than one year. Spike Lee directing the story ruins whatever immersion I had with the character. I feel MyCareer has some good moments and ideas. I love the idea of playing high school ball and choosing a college. Yeah there are only 9 choices and I wish there were more, but I understand why with the cost of getting more on board so I don't let that bother me. What MyCareer did wrong. Only able to spend one year in college; I get it you are supposed to be a superstar but let us decide if we want to stay one more year. Heck make the games challenging enough that we don't win the NCAA tournament giving us the option to stay and try again out of pride. Your skill rating when you join the NBA is a puny 55. This forces you to either play with a crappy player, buy VC with your money, or farm in other modes first. On top of that they kept the grouped together stat increases that NBA 2k15 started, which reduces the variation of play styles I could develop MY player into.I haven't finished up to the FA period yet, so I can't comment on length of seasons fairly. I do like shorter seasons compared to the older games when you had to play every game, but I don't like them moving away from 2k15's decision to let you pick which games you play.Overall, if you are looking at this game for the MyPlayer mode...just stick to 2k15 or 2k14 and just watch the cutscenes on YouTube. If you are looking at the MyGM/MyLeague then I say buy it, the improvements are worth it.			"

												NBA2k16 is recommended.I've only played the story mode as far. I was a little upset at the lack of options in the story mode. However, after hitting your 2nd year in the nba the short story ends and myplayer becomes a better version than last years. I'vehad no trouble running the game. 144 fps but thats on two 980tis, dont get any lag like mentioned in other posts.Gameplay isnt much different than last year which is a good thing. Blocks seem cleaner. You can now strip the ball by pushing pass button just as they take a shot. ( although i havent has success with this lol)You can now call a 2nd player to double team with the LB.I can see me sticking 60hours plus into the season as its a grind for points!			"

The only way I was able to make an impact with my player was with rebounding, where I frequently left the player I had to guard (which the game berated me for every time) when I could see there was going to be a shot, and stood under the basket.

Plus, the Spike Lee story lasts for like 17 games which you can play at less than 6 minutes a quarter. Even though the commentary is good, it gets repetitive towards the season end.Overall, Gameplay - 8/10Story Mode - 7/10Soundtrack - 9/10Recommended for 2k fans, and noobs alike!			"

												This Game is junk. The stroy is there but you dont make any of the choices , they also limit what you can have your player do. No matter how hard you try you cant make your player be dominate . You are always going to be weak in something. not to mention the problem with the controller sometimes it will connect and work and sometimes you have to restart your game .			"

												I own 2K14 and for the most part enjoy playing it.  I only ever play the career mode because I like making a player and watching them and myself develop over the in game seasons.  Boy oh boy to my surprise, after being an idiot and not bothering to read all the reviews which mention it, this game has changed.Right off the bat: not a fan in the slightest of the 'news' video that loads on your landing screen which seems to be a poor cross between advertising and social media integration.  Okay whatever, I can live with that, maybe I can get a patch somewhere to disable it.  I went to start a career and I'm treated to...an unskippable video from amazing director Spike Lee, clearly reading from cue cards, about how the career mode is so much better now and the story is gonna be so great man I just know it!No thanks.  Not why I like your game.  I clocked eight minutes 'played' after the 50gb install and was totally turned off on the experience.  Went straight away to ask for a refund.If you are here because you like 2K's career mode, look elsewhere.  I'll just go back to playing 14 which is fine enough for me and maybe with the next release they won't ♥♥♥♥ up a good thing and I could be persuaded to buy a new version.			"

												This game looks amazing and plays like garbage. The career mode is AWFUL. The story is so boring, you have the illusion of choice but really you have very little, and the game itself is fun while in high school and college and dull as anything in the NBA. Way too many cut scenes and stupid game overlays. Shooting is almost totally random. Your player gets stuck in the paint occasionally and so you turn the ball over. The only way I was able to make an impact with my player was with rebounding, where I frequently left the player I had to guard (which the game berated me for every time) when I could see there was going to be a shot, and stood under the basket. Everything else was boring as ♥♥♥♥. BORING.POORLY SCRIPTED.UNLIKEABLE.AMAZING VISUALS AND GOOD MUSIC.ps. how does it make sense that you're this hot♥♥♥♥♥♥player and get drafted in the first round, but your stats are garbage and you can barely make a jump shot, even when you're six foot 9 and next to the bucket? It doesn't. It doesn't make sense.			"

												Damn 2k...Why you do this...First off, everyone knows the story sucks in this game. I'm not gonna elaborate on that.Gameplay: 7/10Gameplay mechanics are is pretty mediocre in this game compared to 2k15. Pick and Rolls are easier to call and you could choose the side they do it on but the it usually never works on the A.I.. They never run ito it. I have no idea why they would change the way passing works when the system from 2k15 is really nice. just wish they would add a laser pass but 2k never listens to its fans I guess. Alley oop is pretty much almost impossible to pull off. All I could say about gameplay is...weak. Stick to 2k15Visuals: 9/10I play this game maxed out and it looks really nice. -1 for really ugly looking hair.Sound: 6/10Turning down the sound and mixing it to your liking is pretty garbage. Even at 5 the game is still too damn loud. Fire the sound mastering department of this game plsOverall: 11/10 would get marked down a whole grade for a minor mistake again			"

												Ugh.  Where do I begin with this game?  Mycareer mode is completely broken in this game.  First, you have to put up with sitting through some idiotic Spike Lee video (which cannot be skipped) before finally you get to play.  In a high school game.  High school.  After a few of those, and then a few college games, and so many tedious videos that will have you jamming the skip button as hard as you can, you get to the NBA draft.  Congratulations, after a few hours of mind-numbingly dull videos, now you get to spend 20-30 minutes sitting through the NBA draft.  Can you skip it and just find out who drafted you?  Nope.  You are forced to sit through the whole thing.  Thank you, Spike Lee.  Go back to making movies.  At least some of those are good.  Did you guys see Inside Man?  That is probably my favorite Spike Lee movie.  Denzel and Clive Owen are great.Anyway, after all that excruciating draft, you are finally in the NBA.  Good luck getting through even one entire game without it crashing on you and making you start over.  I think I tried about eight times without success before I finally gave up.  And the gameplay?  The actual basketball part was fine, but even after turning off every option about replays and all that garbage, it was still infuriating.  Whenever someone shot a free throw, I had to press a button or else watch the shooter high five or fist bump the entire team for 10 seconds.  Did he then shoot?  No.  At this point I had to wait another 10 seconds for the referee to pass the ball to the guy at the free throw line unless I pressed the button again.  Did he then shoot?  No.  At that point, he would go through another 10 seconds of some stupid pre-free throw routine before finally shooting the ball, unless I pressed the button again.  Seriously?  I have to skip three different cutscenes every time someone shoots a free throw?  Ugh.  And do not get me started on timeouts.  One team calls a timeout.  Cool, that is fine.  Just let me press a button to skip ahead to gameplay.  I am pressing the buttton, so why are you doing nothing?  I am still pressing the button.  I am still pressing the button.  Now I getting very angry and still pressing the button.  After about 15 seconds (every single time there is a timeout), I can finally skip ahead.  Please, please, please, just let me PLAY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME!2K, you used to make fun games, but this is probably the worst sports game of yours I have ever played.  I hope 2K17 is better, but based on this game I am not buying 2K17 unless I can get it for $5 or less.			"

												I think it would be rude to say that it is a bad game. It is a very good game actually. But there are some things and features that need to improve in 2k17. And that is especially the story mode. First of all: it would be nice if your family is the same ethnicy like you. I, as a white guy, wasnt really able to get the feel that these people are my family and that Cee-Cee is my twin, because she's black... nonsense. Furthermore you get announced as an amazing young talent, but you are one of the worst by rating in first round Draft picks, which also doesnt make sense at all.			"

												Being a regular customer for NBA 2K games since it first came on PC with 2K9, I didn't really expect much from this game - I came in thinking that this was pretty much 2K15 but with the current roster. While that is true for the most part, there have been more improvements than I expected, particularly with the gameplay itself.Smoother animations, better dunk animations, better rebounding, and a better-than-expected MyCareer mode are some of the things I definitely like so far.However, it does not have the best optimisation for PC - while mine runs just fine (i5-6600K, R9 390, 8gb RAM, 1440p) but a lot of people are having trouble with framerate drops and poor performance overall. The controls have been changed yet again, which would take some getting used to (though it does feel better than with 2K15).Overall, I am quite satisfied with this iteration of the series, but it's definitely not for everyone. There's still a lot more to improve in this game, but with yearly releases, I can't really complain too much.			"

												This review is based solely on the fact that I mostly play these games for dynasty/GM mode. My carareer is basically the same as last year but they magaged to make it more trash by adding in Spike Lee. Seriously, the story touches on subjects and situations that has no business in a game like this. We just want to enjoy the game of basketball, not open up a debate about various social issues. just for clarity, im black and im very familar with his work. And 90% of it is stereotypical trash, why 2K thought it was a good idea to bring him on is beyond me. so basically, my career is a wash. O, and hackers....everywhere.well, enough of thatThe game really shines on the court.  Passing, post play, screens all butter smooth. The AI reacts ""intelligently"" to what you are doing on the court and your line up. If you got lebron or curry dropping 30 in the third they do alot more than just double team them when they touch the ball. Theyll, play screens differently, deny the ball, force you to take long 2's. Its really actually pretty good. A clear improvement in graphics and animations as well. And the soundtrack is back to form as well.That being said, literally everything else either didnt change or got worse.  Ill have to recomend becasue steam lacks a damn middle ground. TL:DRMy career: Spike Lee/10 hes an idiotOnline:       Hackers/10 (and lag)My GM:       7/10 not much changed, wasnt expecting it to.gameplay:    9/10 best in seriesAudio:           New Buggatti/10 would engrage people in my apartment again.overall: 6/10  if you just want to play some good offline basketball look no further. If you want anything else....lol dont buy it.			"

												2K16 is a huge improvement to 2K15. With that said, a lot of negative reviews here are from the fps/stutter issues and terrible keyboard support. On default video settings, I also experienced fps drops and stutters during gameplay with a 980 and i7 4790k. However, after switching from Fullscreen mode to Windowed Fullscreen in the video options, all my fps and stutter issues were gone. I'd suggest a lot of people to try that if they are having problems and avoid using a keyboard for now. As far as crashes go, I haven't experienced any at all.Pros:-Improved MyCareer-Improved MyGM and MyLeague-Improved gameplay over 2K15-Incredible depth in MyLeague-Animations are way better-Defense is actually challenging and rewarding-Very smooth gameplay after stutters were fixedCons:-Bug with Fullscreen mode plagued with fps and stutter issues-Bad keyboard supportI'd highly recommend this if you are a fan of 2K15, as 2K16 is a massive improvement over it.

												Do not buy this game if your favorite mode is myplayer. It's absolutely terrible. The store behind it is corny and boring. They take out any kind of choice that you would want to make. On top of that, while you're in high school in college, you are an absolute machine with superstar stats. As soon as you make it to the NBA, you're 55 overall. Complete money grab to get you to buy coins so you can actually do something, The store doesn't mesh with what you actually do in game. I'd return this game if I could, but because I left it on the main screen for a while, I have to live with wasting 80 bucks. Do yourself a favor and wait for the next installment, or switch from 2K all together.			"

												They call this a basketball game?.It's more like The Basketball Diaries only instead of a crime drama it is the Spike Lee version of rising from the ghetto.I know I am not so good with sports game although I have played enough to know when things are out of balance.I have tried a few times to play this game on default settings and everytime it ends the same way.I miss 3 open lay ups in a row while the A.I. just seems to sink most everything it throws up.They also seem to be telepathic and they know where I will throw the ball and steal it quiet often.The worse part is the controls and passing is still an issue till this day.Though really those are just the minor issues.The bigger issues is the terrible A.I. that is your teamates it's more akin to playing with zombies then an actual team.The defense is terrible why bother keeping your man in check when the A.I will just let there man own them.In the end I do not mind losing but I still expect to lose a fair game not one where the A.I. I am playing makes almost every shot while my A.I. looks like Elmer Fudd trying to catch Bugs Bunny.The game does run great on my system which is just an Intel 6400, RX 470 and 16gigs of ram.So i give them that much for making the game work really well.I still do not see how this sells so much each year when it gets worse and worse.I got this in a bundle and I still regret it.I would rather play R.B.I. Baseball at least they try and be a baseball game.This game has mutli personaility disorder.Is it a basetkaball game or a Visual Novel about someone who wants to be in the NBA.ProsA actual baseketball game on the PCGood performanceYou can play as your favorite teamIt was in a bundle.Be A Player ModeConsIt was in a bundle and now I know why.Actuall basketball game that fails at being a basketball game.Poor A.I.Lame story by Spike Lee who is a washed up director who ruined the best part of this game.He also seems to think everyone wants to be a black player from a rough neighborhood.I have this say pass on this and well this is also why I have not bought NBA 2K since.This is what happens when your the only studio in town doing a sports game.It turns into Madden it get's worse every year and stall's with inovation.Why bother with any of that if people keep buying the same tired old game.I guess I do not blame them for not really trying when they have no reason to do so.

												Brought this because I had a great time with 2k15. Experience so far.1. This game does not support my controller for navigation on main menu.2. Lag3. Graphics does not even look ""normal"", many lines around and blurry animation.4. Bonus is not even out yet... Y u do dis to me?So, if you're wondering if you should get this game too... keep reading.1. There's nothing better to buy on steam.2. You have too much money.3. Buy just to show off on social media.4. Ball is life.16/10 would buy this and cry again.			"

												Besides the No 35k VC and 10k Virtual currency, the game runs smooth, the story line is decent (for Spike Lee's sub par film making) played roughly over 6 hours currently and enjoy the fluidity of the game play. Would really have enjoyed the promised extras with the pre-order download  however, and leaves a salty taste in my mouth with no eagerness to pre-order anymore			"

												I am already loving it.  It feels a bit slower than 2k15 but that allows fast players to use their speed.  The MyCareer has interesting dialogue now.  I really like control changes to setting picks, you can choose which side the pick is set; right or left.  Also it seems like the CPU has gotten smarter, my teamates cut to the basket more.  Also defense seems to have improved but too early to tell.I haven't received my coins for preordering yet. Also I haven't tried online but if you are buying NBA 2K for online mode don't bother it has never worked.  There has also been some questionable menu changes.			"

												Pros:- nice to look at, nice to listen to- nice to play like a simulation- nice to laugh with (or at) Shaq and Kenny- nice to play with your friends (most of the time)Cons:- absolutely terrible Spike Lee story for MyCareer mode (completely linear with no choices at all, and terribly written ""drama"")- MyCareer starts at 2016-2017 - good luck with retiring of your favourite old guys- some lagging (he he) issues with online play, although it is improved over 2k15- no protection from people who cheat online - you have to beat guys who are quicker, stronger, taller, more precise than you will ever be just using your gaming skills- virtual currency isn't balanced well enough - some things are too easy to acquire, some are too hard, and some things just shouldn't be available to purchase with real money - this is an issue that's only going to be worse as years go by- a bug here and there, like sudden silence from the commentators' booth (for some gamers it's game-breaking, for me not so much) or unskippable cut-scenes mid-game. However, we've already had two patches and it seems that this year the developers are actually caring a bit more!Overall:- if you're a basketball fan(atic) and an avid gamer, then you already have this game- if you're looking at a high price and wondering if it's worth it, the answer is yes - just look for a discount somewhere and you will find it- if you want to know why there are more cons than pros up top, read on - this game is really good, but has a few annoying things that really shouldn't have been like thisThanks, Spike Lee. You've managed to write the story for MyCareer mode that wouldn't get a 3 on IMDb if it was a movie. What did I expect? A branching and immersive story. What did I get? My career starts in 2016/2017. No relation to real world anymore. Trades going on. MVPs happen. And I missed all of that.As you could have guessed, this is the game mode I play most. When this awful part of the game ends (the story), the game really becomes something much better. Many improvements have been made. Many opportunities have been missed, too, but you can't expect every single item on your wishlist to come true.The game is really challenging (on Hall of Fame level) and sometimes brutally unforgiving (your teammates just can't sink a shot or defend anyone sometimes, even if you're on fire on both ends of the floor), but I would say that it is a feature, not a bug.Online experience has been somewhat improved regarding MyPark from the last iteration, and I haven't really played much of other game modes.

												I think this is the only NBA 2k that is actually superior in nearly every way than its predecessors.  It's more fluid, it has better graphics, it has more customization, it has more everything.  Some new features are executed very well and really add something new to the game.  It feels like a better game from day 1.  I've been interested enough to play 17 hours in 3 days, and more importantly, I've had new things to do in 17 hours.  All the negative reviews are filled with people with more hours than me, like, come on.But... the negative reviews are pretty justifiable.  2k has somehow forgotten the preorder bonuses and have done nothing about the hackers.  Every myPark game you go to, you will find a hacker.  Hacks include:-99 overall hack-Park cards hack-Badges hack-Skin hack-Bodymod hackAnd it also doesn't help that the PC version is terribly optimised and the myCareer seems like some half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥third party movie.  There is absolutely no freedom of choice in the myCareer.  It's completely possible they'll add a patch upgrading the story, fixing the optomisation, but at this stage of the game, don't get your hopes up.  I'm not really playing myCareer right now because they will presumably wipe your progress.Yes, you should buy this game if you're an avid basketball fan.  Even if this game sucked, I'd still buy it.  And dont think live 16 is that much better than 2k16.  So yeah, but it I guess.			"

												Ok I don't know if there is something i'm missing but there was NO tutorial on how to play this game on pc even though all the controls are optimized for for consoles. The game itself is clearly poorly optimized even for me and I have gtx 980's in SLI. Furthermore the story will only make sense if you want to play as a black person (which is fine if you do) I made a white character with red hair only to be injected into a story where my family is black(and don't seem to realize i'm white), I live in the ""hood"" and my voice actor is noticibly black. Obviously that is contextually nonsensical and I ultimately went back to change my character to a black person so as not to mess with immersion. After that mess I tried to play in my first high school game (still no tutorial, although in the open gym you are supposed to mess around in before your high school game might have had some ques, the control mechanism to pick up the ball didn't even work so while messing around TRYING TO PICK UP A BALL I accidentally started the HS game). After seeing that I could do nothing other than run in circles I quit and looked for tutorials and control schemes only to find that ALL OF THEM ARE FOR CONSOLE CONTROLLERS, EVEN THE VOICE ACTED TUTORIALS ONLY TALK ABOUT CONSOLE CONTROLLERS. This is absolutely rediculous.let me be clear I am not an inexperienced pc gamer by any means. This being on steam is nothing but a poorly thought out cash grab.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

												This will be the last NBA game from 2k for me for a while. Though the gameplay is fun most of the time, the has bugs and glitches which carry on from year to year.Savefiles can get corrupted and become unloadable. Which means your spent VC are lost! This can happen to MyCareer and to MyGM (ever bought the team for 50k VC and some seasons later you can't load the save anymore? Very nice...)The game is balanced too much around the VC and onlinegameplay. Because of issues with MyPark during the last years, where 7 footers could hit 3s and run as quick as small point guard, they changed the skill system (again! and again for the worse). No my center is lame as a duck and can never be as quick as f.e. Dwight Howard. And you can't be the new Nowitzki or Jordan because the harsh way your skills are bound to your height is ridicoulus. I don't like the upgrading of skills in fixed categories either. Want to raise your midrange game? Well, then you have to raise 3s, fts as well. The old system, where you could just raise the one skill you wanted is gone since last year.Ingame the AI is often stuck and players will just hold on to the ball and do nothing until the shotclock is down to 2, then they will shoot a contested fadeaway 3...The new MyCareer story is a nice idea but failed hard. The story is outright racist, because there is just one family option. Want to be a white guy, or asian, or indian? Well, see how your twin and the whole family are afroamericans. They could have easily changed the story to say you have been adopted as a child and it would be fine! Then the story is always the same, just the teams you play for change. In your rookie season, you can play only 8 games and have absolutely no clue what's going on in the nba because you can't see any rankings, stats, etc. Becoming ROY is almost impossible, because you won't be getting the minutes you need and the other rookies are starters and play very good. Even with 15ppg 10rpg  and 2bpg I wasn't ROY, because i only played 20min/pg.You can't use custom rosters on MyCareer too btw, so no editing the playes too their real values. You won't earn any VC during highschool or college and will start as a 55 overall in the nba, even if you manage to get picked top ten or even #1. Well, 2k wants you to buy VC ;-)Then your second season, after free agency(!) you can earn 17million $ a year and still come off the bench. That you go to free agency after season 1 is total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and breaks the nba rules. You are no second rounder, come on 2k!Buy this only for 10€ or under in a sale.			"

												It's pretty sickening to see people bash a game that is THIS good.  This may be the best sports game ever made!  Don't get me wrong, it has some problems; namely connectivity issues that I'm confident will be fixed and yes the Career mode is kinda dumb at times, but overall even it is better than ever.Every mode in this game is better than ever before.Basketball has never been portrayed with more accuracy, fluidity, and detail than it is in this version of NBA 2k.  If you liked 2k15 but thought it still didn't feel quite like what you see on tv, well you're in for a true treat.This is B-Ball for fans of B-Ball.			"

												Absolutely sick to my stomache i Gods promise to you all i've never been this worked up or upset about a game in my life. I just to get off my PC take a shower and a Xanax because it literally made me that livid. (True Story).I bought this game last night, i know that it's been released for awhile now but after 2k15 i swore to never buy another 2k game. I collapsed, i missed the greatness of my favorite sport Basketball. Within 5 minutes i felt like a kid again booting the NBA screen up all ready to play and deliver. As soon as i logged on i kid you not, literally within 5 minutes i realized i '♥♥♥♥ed' up. I went right away to my favorite mode as a long time 2k veteran. MyPlayer, yes hands down my cup of tea i love the fact you can almost virtually become an Allstar in 2k and it all feel so real. It didn't take very long for me to figure out it was exactly the same reason i gave my 2k15 disc to my dog as a chew toy (didnt end well) anyways.So this year brings a lot of exciting things, multiple game modes, character creation has never been better.The graphics are great allways delivers on that, aswell as animations and overall flow of the game. So minor glitches but nothing serious that effects the way you feel when your on the court. For the most part you have control. They honestly did a great job with the mechanics this year. Howerver for the myplayer they failed, and they failed hard. First and formost the name situation has been my biggest pet peve. You are named 'Frquency Vibrations' like seriously what the bloody hell is that? I mean its a joke and there is no way around it because its in ever cut scene, anoucement you name it its Freq, all day everday. But i said i can move passed this no big deal. So the main point of creating a my player is to be an allstar right? Well if you want that in 2k16 you can kiss your dreams goodbye unless you literally wanna dish up about 200 USD. Thats right 60 for the game, and about 120 - 180+ USD. just to have an allstar stat sheet. Well ofcourse thats if you want to pay right? Well some of us don't have the money to pay 200 USD to ball with all the other 99 Overall exploiters or rich kids so we earn it on our own. I calculated and did the math. It would take About 100 Hours just to reach and 88 Overall status. Who in they're right mind has the time and dedication for that. Thats just 88, and from there on it gets more expensive, and more VC so its honestly can range to about 300 to 400 hours to be a 99. Like many im sure i have to work, pay bills, dedicate time with my fiance live a life. Another sad factor is you can find ways around it like purposly fouling out of the game to get VC in about 2- 3 min but still its such a minimal amount that it would also take hundreds of hours, while defearing the whole purpose of the game, not plauing that is. What makes me so upset is how company's have turned so greedy. its not about the fanbase anymore its strictly 100% revenue.  You cannot purchase a damn thing without this Virtual Curency. Tattoos, clothes, shoes, accesories, editing you court so it can look cool all requires VC. And let me tell you its all very expensive so be prepared to grind harder on this then you would a 99 on runescape.I didn't have much time to write this review i am going to work, so its definitely going to have typos and errors and thats my bad i hope you all can get the point. Also something i forgot to mention the game is empty at this point, you will not find matches and if you do the are lagged out behyond belief and the patches ruined the main mechanics. They only version i would reccomend is the offline version only. But be prepared to have no customization and become a freq.\I will never purchase another 2k game again aslong as they have Virtual Currency, its like buying a game to just put the disc in, and then paying outrageous amounts of money just to even enjoy.Worst game experience of my life, i feel scammed, ripped off, and betrayed. Rant over. Save yourself 200 dollars and buy something worth it.			"

Perspective: I'm a fan of the NBA 2K series for some time now, I have played every single game since 2K11 extensively and I have played NBA 2K16 for close to 150 hours at the time of this review.Short and sweet:NBA 2K16 is the best sports simulation game I have played to date. Unlike franchises like FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer, 2K constantly reinvents it's game on a yearly basis rather than release the same product just with updated rosters every year.This year's title is a big step forward from the last one and it manages to do a lot of things right, particularly now after a few patches.If you're a basketball fan or even if you're just looking for a fun sports game to play casually, I would fully recommend you pick up this game even at full price.Long and nitpicky:The game's launch was not without it's issues, from gameplay tweaks that were made through patches and performance issues on PC... It was not a complete disaster but far from a perfect launch, from the inability for keyboard users to edit keybinds to graphic settings rendering the game unplayable it took some doing to get a great experience out of it at launch. As of the time of this review, most of these issues have been addressed though a little history never hurts anyone looking to make an informed purchase.Positives:The game boasts fairly good visuals and don't even get me started on the gameplay... It is by far the best basketball simulation game I have ever played, actually make that the best sports simulation game!Relatively low requirements on the hardware front make it accessible to a wide range of consumers which is always good though I'd recommend at least meeting the recommended requirements for a complete visual experience.For comparison's sake, I run the game on a GTX 970 (non-OC) and an i5 4690k (OC to 4,2 Ghz) with every possible filter injected (8x Supersample + 8x MFAA + FXAA) via Nvidia control panel and it runs silky smooth at 60 FPS at a 1080p resolution without GPU usage ever going above around 80% so we're dealing with a decent port here.When it comes to gameplay, most of the cheese tactics from previous years have been nullified in this year's game. Want to drive baseline and get a bucket everytime? Better boot up 2K15 then because it's not happening in 2K16.Excellent AI defense makes it a challenge to score every trip down the floor, mindless attempts to get to the basket will most likely result in blocked shots than in points, attempting to thread the needle through defenders will probably end up in a turnover... These are but a few examples of how AI has been improved this year.Most game modes are back and better than before, such as myGM and myTEAM. Up-to-date rosters, new and better animations and all other goodies that one might expect are also a part of the package.Negatives:The myCAREER mode was highly hyped as a Spike Lee directed story and I'm afraid it was arguably this game's greatest letdown. You follow your player's career since high school, into college and eventually into the NBA although in some key points along the ride you're faced with decisions which are presented to you but you really have no deciding power over what happens next. You're only able to play 8 games during your rookie year in the league (9 if your team makes the playoffs) the rest will be automatically simulated. This game mode opens up once you reach your sophomore year in the league however and from there the experience is excellent.The typical flavor of the month builds for myPLAYERs still exist after every patch, if you're looking to play myPARK or other online modes extensively this information might be of value to you.Also there are some latency issues for non-NA players, I personally can't make a jumper online because of this.myTEAM mode gets content updates regularly, but not regularly enough and most of the content it gets is irrelevant. This mode along with myPARK are the modes I'd classify as the 2 main attractions of the game when it comes to online play so I definitely see this as a negative. Most new packs contain only 1 or 2 relevant new cards and the rest will literally never see the light of day and have no use aside from contributing towards collection rewards.Summing up:NBA 2K16 is a solid 9/10 if I was asked to resort to that rating system.It's not a perfect game, but the issues it has have not dragged down the experience for me. The revamped gameplay and gorgeous visuals keep me coming back for more.The game is well worth it's full price and a complete must-have for any basketball simulation fan.			"

												This game is totally not optimized in PC version, eventough my computer  meets the system requirement  and the laggy situations are everywhere. 2K should fix it immediately for those who paid for this game but cannot enjoin it.Do something! 2K you will ruin this NBA game and all the customers' faith on you if you don't release the updated patch to fix this serious problem. I am really disppointed with this unfinished product and your laggy reaction to fixing the problem.If laggy problem is not solved, I will not recommed you to purchase this product. You cannot even play this game smoothly.It is very ridiculous!			"

												Practice, practice, practice. Repeat, refresh, reload. I suggest shooting guard(sg) or (center) but its your choice; Not sure what Spike Lee and 2k was thinking. Make sure you take your time and allow your character to grow; Bulldogs was the better team for me. The pc version is missing interactions with star players on other teamsGm mode has a lot to offer; You have a number of options. Go through each menu and find the best settings for your type of simulation styleThe cpu strips the ball with no animations and how in the hell can the computer go past the backboard; to pull of a b$ goal by making it go through the board itself...

												The graphics are definitely an upgrade from 2k15. From shooting to general movement, the game feels really smooth. I haven't experienced any crashes yet. I am running this on 1440p with a GTX 980.    My only quirk is that MyCareer has a little too much story. I like that fact that I can play in high school and all of that, but sometimes the cut scenes are way too long and not engaging at all. It all goes away after the first season though,, but then it feels completely empty because there are rarely anymore cut scenes.Also MyPark is basically dead during the day, but is packed during the night time. I do see a lot of the same people around so I hope the online community stays alive, but I wouldn't be surprised if everyone stops playing. I would say that the console ports have a bigger and wider community. I would blame it on the PC optimization of this game.Great game overall. Judging by the other reviews I wouldn't get this game unless you have a decent graphics card. If you can run this game you will have a lot of fun.			"

												NBA 2K16 is a very under-appreciated game, although it is not one of the best games of the 2K series, it is still a very fun and innovative game. First, the My Player game mode, I understand it is not as fun as it was on 2K15, but it is as in-depth and realistic as ever before. Sure, the cut-scenes are a bit over the top and sure some of the cutscenes last a fairly long time, but on the whole, I still really enjoyed the story and the gamemode. My Park is a very simple and easy way to play against people online, and is very relevant if you just want to play a short game without having to take it seriously. On the whole a very fun gamemode but maybe lacking some excitement.Yes, maybe the ratings are a bit unjust this year. I agree that the cover stars (Steph Curry, Anthony Davis and James Harden) are maybe a bit overrated compared to how they play in real life. I am a big fan of Curry and the Warriors, but I think some of his passing stats, running and defending stats are maybe a bit too high and should be lowered a bit, but not too drastically. Although Davis has had his troubles with injuries as of late, I still feel he is a couple overalls too high and I feel an 88-89 rating would have suited him better. Finally, with James Harden I think he is a very talented guard, but his defendsive rating is way too generous to him. Harden is quite a poor defender and the way he has defended this season, I am sure you guys will agree with me here.People that give this game a negative review obviously haven't looked at the EA Sports NBA Live series. 2K16 is undoubtebly the much better game and is alot more fun. For people that complain a lot about this game, I recommend they play a game of NBA Live and see if they still complain about 2k16...			"

												The game is playable for me although the framerate a little choppy sometimes ( r9 280x almost maxed out) and there is too much animation for the UI. But the main problem for me is the game play mechanic. Pick and roll work differently compare to last year and it's definitely much harder this time and the all the new passes button. It definitely need take sometimes and use to it. The VC not a big problem to me cause 2k would probably fix this soon. But oh God play with my freq with 56 rating is God awful hard.			"

												Incredible game. Even though its rare to find an online match, (whether it be MyPark, MyTeam, Play Now etc) and even though the small forward position was stuffed up in the MyCareer mode... This game is unbelivable. There are countless new additions to the game, which make it playable for longer, aswell as adding a whole new layer of depth and fun.I cant really be bothered to go over the endless amounts of enjoyability of this game, so I'll leave the review here.10/10- I also have 200+ hours			"

												The best simulation game of NBA so far, become better each year. Graphics are just great, moves are really realistic, many set-ups for difficulty. I would recommend it to fans of NBA first of all because it's still Basket-Ball but you can still have some fun without following NBA or stuff.. Gameplay is good, i recommend controller even if you can play with a keyboard (what i personally do because i ain't got a controller) but it'll be easier with a Controller.I won't talk about multiplayer because i done only one game but it appears to me as fun. MyPlayer Carreer is always great, MyManager as well.So great game !			"

												I honestly don't know what people are talking about. (For Me) The game runs great. I'm running it at Max on a GTX 760, I have good framerate, and haven't had any crashes. A lot of people have been saying it's 2k15.5, but once you get the game in your hand you'll know it's not. The game has been improved from graphics to gameplay. A lot of people have been complaining about they're not being keyboard support, when if you look at the required specs, it clearly says gamepad required. The loading does take a while, but this might be a server issue, which may change post-launch.			"

												Lets start out by saying finally get a basketball game that feels real! I mean nothing will ever be like actually playing a real game but this is the closest you will ever get. I like everything about this game honestly. Way better animations than 2K15 easily and there seems to be no real problems for now. Only thing I do not like is that your attributes are stacked by sections and you have to upgrade certain things together which to me will always be dumb. So many features added I have not even had the time to play everything yet. I am giving this a 8 out of 10. I think some of the textures of the my player characters throughout the story are just not good and smooth enough for me. At times looks a little cartoon like but not enough to mess with the game in any way.			"

												If you're looking for an NBA game, you don't really have a choice.2K kind of exploits that through microtransactions, but it's not near as bad as most games. Sales for VC come up often and are usually pretty decent discounts (ex: 75% $10 amount). MyCareer sucks. You have hardly any control over your player. The High School and College games are very fun and atmospheric, but they're super short. If you're a white person like me, you get stuck into a black family and can't do anything about it. I wouldn't have an issue with it except for the fact that you have a TWIN SISTER that is also black. The main issue for me outside of the terrible story that you have no influence over is the fact that you can only play EIGHT games your rookie season! And even worse? YOU GO INTO FREE AGENCY AFTER THAT YEAR! I was #1 overall draft pick and I go into FA after the year?Overall the game is pretty good for gameplay. Jump shooters from midrange are the best, as layups and 3s have a pretty low chance of going in unless the player has high ratings.MyGM has a nice feature to relocate a team anywhere and completely rebrand it. I chose the Clippers and relocated them to Kansas City after a few years, overall it was a nice experience.As for online-- I don't play sports games online as they ruin the game for me, but I've heard it's full of cheaters on PC and you'd be better off getting it on a console if you're going to play online.

												I was hesitant about buying this game due to the commentator bug, so I took a risk and bought it and I'm pleased to say the commentator bug has been addressed. The gameplay and presentation are amazing as you'd expect from any 2K sports game. A lot of others complain about hackers, but I don't play online so no worries there. It simulates a basketball game fantastically.So, 40 hours later I'm still really loving the game this time around. The story in MyCAREER is amazing, and now after finishing the ""Livin da dream"" or whatever it's called, I signed a deal with the Houston Rockets, and now I'm really tearing up the courts. Oh, and I ranked 4th best in 3P% in my rookie year, not too shabby for a 60-ish rating player.Stephen Curry, I'm coming for you my friend.			"

												The best basketball game out there. 8/10But first, I'll start with the cons. 1. The fact that I had to waste 2 days trying to get hold of a Xbox controller is frankly ridiculous as the keyboard controls in 2K16 are♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2. Some glitches like commentary cutting out completely for like 10 minutes during each game are annoying. 3. I couldn't play on the Park without getting destroyed until I was at least 80 OVR. Cashers....However, 2K16 is still a very good game. Gameplay improved, new features on GM/League/Team are refreshing and fun. MyCareer is still the most indepth career mode in any sports game. But my biggest beef with the MyCareer is the rookie season, which Spike Lee seems to think is unimportant to us.			"

												Here is my thoughts on the game as of two main gamemodes as in the MyGM gamemode and the MyCareer GamemodeMyGM:I felt like the MyGM mode was fairly good and very refreshing for a gamemode that has been the same and kind of needed a new thing added to it. The team relocation is a great addition, but is very hard to do and you need to play for a long time to get enough salary to even have the oppurtunity to do the relocation. So if you have the time to do 4-5 seasons and be able to complete the goals then you will be fine. But if you only do anything below the 4-5 seasons then the MyGM mode is mainly the same with only a new layout and 3-team trades to go along with it.MyCareer:They add highschool, college, and you get a story through the first year in the NBA. What could go wrong? That you play 15 games, 3 being 3 minute quarters, and then watch a movie for the rest of the time having no control when if it is really your life and options then you should be able to choose like you could in NBA 2K15. But this is really sad to see because they advertise it as a game where you can choose your story and life.......in reality you can't. NBA 2K15 - 7/10Get it on sale, not for full price.			"

												NBA2k16 has been poorly ported to the PC. It suffers frequent crashes, unacceptably long loading times, and in general the story doesn't add anything to the game. I was a fan of NBA2k15 and NBA2k13 but with 10 hours on the clock I'm already ready to stop playing NBA2k16. I feel that the gameplay is a solid improvement over NBA2k15 but it's held back by everything not related to actually playing basketball. I like the fact 2k was willing to try something new in my career but the implementation leaves me feeling like I'm playing some arcade game. Finally, this game is once again attempting to sell you a virtual currency as a method of making yet more money. On a game that can cost as much as $80 it's unacceptable.Final note on the virtual currency - It's possible to use Cheat Engine to increase how much virtual currency you have. Do not spend money on the microtransactions just hack in 100k virtual currency through a cheat table. Just search for ""cheat engine table nba2k16"" on your favorite search engine.			"

												I decided to review this game due to the many negative reviews it has gotten on Steam. I have played 2K14, 2K15 and now 2K16 and this game seems to be the one that has got me hooked the most. I feel like the career/story is a bit silly, it might just be me but I don't care about the personal life of my character, all I want to do is shoot some hoops. I havent experienced any crashes but I have seen a few glitches in-game but they don't disrupt the game for me and they will hopefully be patched in the near future. I feel the pre-game and post-game show/breakdown isn't detailed enough and the cut scenes where it shows the city where you are about to play are really low resolution for some reason. I would recommend this game but be aware that some people do experience crashes.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. MyCareer, at least the story portion of it is awesome at first. You go from high school, to college to the NBA, after that it's one giant cluster of a mess of a story. I didn't really like it one bit. You get two choices in the story 1) What high school you're attending and 2) What college you're committing to. It was difficult to get immersed into a story that I didn't particularly care about and the story wasn't engaging at all, there is no input, no matter how poorly you play your rookie season, the story arc is exactly the same. Spike Lee? Please stay away from video games, your story telling is sub par.Other than that, the game itself is really good. The controls feel different and I think it's a good thing. The mechanics feel better and you can see the work they put in on the animations in the game. I like how deep the customization is on relocation from the arena, to uniforms, to logos..ect, it's all on point.			"

												***PARTIAL FIX FOR STUTTER/LAG***By using RTSS and MSI Afterburner to cap my frame rate at 60, then displaying the game in full screen windowed mode, the stuttering and lag has been massively reduced. Once the updated drivers and game patch come out, this will be 100% perfect. I have really enjoyed the game itself so far. My Career is a little heavy on the cutscenes but the difficulty once you're in the NBA has certainly been ramped up and it feels a lot more challenging on the higher difficulties now.			"

												Best NBA 2K game so far, concerning gameplay and visuals. It's more or less the same game as the before years, without some of the kinks and with a couple additional features. It's really, really, really fun! I mostly played MyPlayer (the career mode) with two positions (PG and C) and this year it's better than ever, because the AI actually tries to set up plays and moves around the whole shotclock, whereas before they just stood around when the play fell apart. I didn't like the newest, most hyped, addition to the game which was Spike Lee's Story Mode in MyPlayer. Yeah it's fun to play in high school and college but it just sucks that you only play about 10 games your rookie year and the rest is simulated. Part of the fun for me was trying to win ROY award and play in All Star Games while my stats aren't that good. Another weird thing is (and I skiped most of the story) that you're released at the end of your first year, and sign a 10 million dollar contract in your 2nd year in the league, with pretty much any team you like. Long story short: Buy it, you won't be disappointed (even in MyPlayer once you finish the Spike Lee storyline)			"

												The Good:- How real the game feels in comparison to real life. - So many new elements in the MyCareer mode. - Graphics aren't bad. The Bad: - Crashes, crashes, crashes.- Gameplay bugs- Passing is unnatural - New controls are just weird for all who are used to previous NBA 2K games- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimization all around. - Game simply feels incomplete. This pre-tipoff is nothing more than a beta test. 2K doesnt have the balls to call it what it is.  "

												Okay, I will start with the fact that this game is way better than last years game. After playing 30+ hours now and in my third season of mycareer and I can now write an honest review. All the things people keep complaining about are miniscule.  Having a black family in MyCareer is really not that big of a deal. Yes you are a white guy (if thats what you pick) but really it dosent matter. After a couple hours you through with the rookie year of 8 games and all the cut scenes. The only downside is you cant win rookie of the year. Then after the last cut scene goes its normal AND MUCH MORE IMPROVED mycareer. The off  days managment is exactly what mycareer needed. You can pick all sorts of activities and they all have a risk-reward system. All in All I think this year was a vast improvement and I believe people on here just like to complain. Teh preorder VC came as soon as the game came out, along with all the preorder stuff. The difficulty is much higher this year not in that the AI cheats but actually plays basketball the right way and you cant just cheese (run around the defender until you get open) the defender and win. You actually have to play basketball and move the ball around even on lower difficulties. I believe this year was much better and please do not look to the negative reviews as most of them were people complaining that they didnt get thier preorder VC because they didnt read that they dont get it until the actual release of the game.

												Running it with an fx-8350 and an R9 380 at max settings, haven't had any frame rate drops at all, the audio has moments during games where it seems like it's been put through a bitcrusher, but it usually doesn't last for more than a second or two so it's not a big negative.Pros:Gameplay is extremely fluid, no more running past clunky defenders, earn your baskets.When you score, you actually feel good about yourself.Post play has been improved greatly, animations are smoother and believable.Animations in general have been greatly improved.As someone who generally dislikes most of the musical tracks in the NBA games, I don't find myself wanting to mute it anytime the music starts playing, so I guess that's a plus.The be a coach mode or whatever has also received an overhaul and is very deep in terms of choices and gameplay.Stadiums look really really niceThe rim moves when you dunk... Sometimes.Your MYPlayer actually looks like he could be based off of a real person and not some ♥♥♥♥ed up generic clone.Cons:The story in MYCareer mode is VERY CHEESY, not enough for me to dislike the game, but enough to be mentioned as a con.Though animations have been improved, there are a couple contact-shot animations near the basket that could use some work.Haven't received my bonus VC yet for the pre-order, I heard that I'll be able to get it when the game officially releases on the 29th. How come the console peasants get their Bonus now??? Yes, I'm salty.OVERALL- The game has improved substantially over the last few years, both in terms of animations and graphical detail. I'll give it a 9/10 and definitely would reccomend it to those of you who haven't yet pulled the trigger on it.			"

												There's a lot of negative reviews on this game, and frankly, I don't understand why. Most of the hours I've put into this game came from MyCareer. And I have to say it is fun and challenging to play and to manager your life. You have to decide whether you'll spend your free day practising, hanging out with your teammates or doing commercials. The 1st season is the ""Spike Lee"" season, and I'll agree that the story is scripted, and you really don't have many choices to take. But the story itself is great.I would definitely recommend getting this game on a discount, it's just so fun and good			"

												The best basketball game out there. 8/10But first, I'll start with the cons. 1. The fact that I had to waste 2 days trying to get hold of a Xbox controller is frankly ridiculous as the keyboard controls in 2K16 are♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2. Some glitches like commentary cutting out completely for like 10 minutes during each game are annoying. 3. I couldn't play on the Park without getting destroyed until I was at least 80 OVR. Cashers....However, 2K16 is still a very good game. Gameplay improved, new features on GM/League/Team are refreshing and fun. MyCareer is still the most indepth career mode in any sports game. But my biggest beef with the MyCareer is the rookie season, which Spike Lee seems to think is unimportant to us.			"

												Here is my thoughts on the game as of two main gamemodes as in the MyGM gamemode and the MyCareer GamemodeMyGM:I felt like the MyGM mode was fairly good and very refreshing for a gamemode that has been the same and kind of needed a new thing added to it. The team relocation is a great addition, but is very hard to do and you need to play for a long time to get enough salary to even have the oppurtunity to do the relocation. So if you have the time to do 4-5 seasons and be able to complete the goals then you will be fine. But if you only do anything below the 4-5 seasons then the MyGM mode is mainly the same with only a new layout and 3-team trades to go along with it.MyCareer:They add highschool, college, and you get a story through the first year in the NBA. What could go wrong? That you play 15 games, 3 being 3 minute quarters, and then watch a movie for the rest of the time having no control when if it is really your life and options then you should be able to choose like you could in NBA 2K15. But this is really sad to see because they advertise it as a game where you can choose your story and life.......in reality you can't. NBA 2K15 - 7/10Get it on sale, not for full price.			"

												NBA2k16 has been poorly ported to the PC. It suffers frequent crashes, unacceptably long loading times, and in general the story doesn't add anything to the game. I was a fan of NBA2k15 and NBA2k13 but with 10 hours on the clock I'm already ready to stop playing NBA2k16. I feel that the gameplay is a solid improvement over NBA2k15 but it's held back by everything not related to actually playing basketball. I like the fact 2k was willing to try something new in my career but the implementation leaves me feeling like I'm playing some arcade game. Finally, this game is once again attempting to sell you a virtual currency as a method of making yet more money. On a game that can cost as much as $80 it's unacceptable.Final note on the virtual currency - It's possible to use Cheat Engine to increase how much virtual currency you have. Do not spend money on the microtransactions just hack in 100k virtual currency through a cheat table. Just search for ""cheat engine table nba2k16"" on your favorite search engine.			"

												I decided to review this game due to the many negative reviews it has gotten on Steam. I have played 2K14, 2K15 and now 2K16 and this game seems to be the one that has got me hooked the most. I feel like the career/story is a bit silly, it might just be me but I don't care about the personal life of my character, all I want to do is shoot some hoops. I havent experienced any crashes but I have seen a few glitches in-game but they don't disrupt the game for me and they will hopefully be patched in the near future. I feel the pre-game and post-game show/breakdown isn't detailed enough and the cut scenes where it shows the city where you are about to play are really low resolution for some reason. I would recommend this game but be aware that some people do experience crashes.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. MyCareer, at least the story portion of it is awesome at first. You go from high school, to college to the NBA, after that it's one giant cluster of a mess of a story. I didn't really like it one bit. You get two choices in the story 1) What high school you're attending and 2) What college you're committing to. It was difficult to get immersed into a story that I didn't particularly care about and the story wasn't engaging at all, there is no input, no matter how poorly you play your rookie season, the story arc is exactly the same. Spike Lee? Please stay away from video games, your story telling is sub par.Other than that, the game itself is really good. The controls feel different and I think it's a good thing. The mechanics feel better and you can see the work they put in on the animations in the game. I like how deep the customization is on relocation from the arena, to uniforms, to logos..ect, it's all on point.			"

												***PARTIAL FIX FOR STUTTER/LAG***By using RTSS and MSI Afterburner to cap my frame rate at 60, then displaying the game in full screen windowed mode, the stuttering and lag has been massively reduced. Once the updated drivers and game patch come out, this will be 100% perfect. I have really enjoyed the game itself so far. My Career is a little heavy on the cutscenes but the difficulty once you're in the NBA has certainly been ramped up and it feels a lot more challenging on the higher difficulties now.			"

												Although far from being perfect, 2k16 is the best basketball sim out right now. It improved a lot gamplay-wise, but took a step back in production quality. Upated Nvidia drivers and future patches will def be needed. As of right now, it's a: 7/10+ Defense actually matters now. It's very difficult to 1v5 anymore. A lot of people will complain about this, but once you learn how to call plays and use picks, it's not bad.+ Improved passing mechanics+ More things to do in MyCareer. Also I actually liked the story that Spike did during the rookie year. It's a lot different from last year, and if it's not your thing, it's easy to skip.+ Better rating system imo+ More historic teams+ Much better music than last year- Can't change PC controls- High school/college gameplay in MyCareer is very shallow and doesn't give you any VC- Crashes. The game crashes much more often, and it's very frustrating.- Buggy. There are times during the game when it just 'hangs up' during the cutscenes, and i'm stuck looking at some guy for like 20s before anything happens. The announcers randomly stop talking at times too. - Performance. I actually haven't noticed that big of a performance difference btwn 2k15 and 16, but a lot of other ppl apparently have. Just wait for updated video drivers guys!- Hackers online already			"

												I was hesitant about buying this game due to the commentator bug, so I took a risk and bought it and I'm pleased to say the commentator bug has been addressed. The gameplay and presentation are amazing as you'd expect from any 2K sports game. A lot of others complain about hackers, but I don't play online so no worries there. It simulates a basketball game fantastically.So, 40 hours later I'm still really loving the game this time around. The story in MyCAREER is amazing, and now after finishing the ""Livin da dream"" or whatever it's called, I signed a deal with the Houston Rockets, and now I'm really tearing up the courts. Oh, and I ranked 4th best in 3P% in my rookie year, not too shabby for a 60-ish rating player.Stephen Curry, I'm coming for you my friend.			"

												I love this game i really do the story i think works pretty great and i learned someone the basics of the game even tho im brand new to it. BUT the story and everything is only 50% why i got it and that's where the problems start. I only got to play 3 games and I LEFT EVERY SINGLE ONE for one reason only. I cant ******* play. 2K really needs to fix the controller responce when most PC players are playing with wired controllers but everytime i get in a game on court it's cause my Controller is completely nonresponcive and everytime i go in the menu using the keyboard It will still tell me the Xbox controls even tho i unpluged my controller and restarted the game with it pulled out. I wont beable to play games online and get stuff which for people reading this just to know about the game before getting it. Is most of what players do and i know alot of PC players that i have to tell them to wait cause the controllers wont responce when you get on a court but while walking around or in the menu it works fine. Also there are some story problems like the coachs. I been in so far 2 stories cause one wouldnt let me play at all but this second one the coach will take me out at the worse times like i got a ""good foul"" as the game told me but my coach will take me out the game and the next dude will miss the shots aswell if i make a 3 pointer it will do the same. If you want to get this game I'd wait till they either fix the control problem or wait till price drops whenever that'll be cause it aint even offically out yet.			"

												Okay, I will start with the fact that this game is way better than last years game. After playing 30+ hours now and in my third season of mycareer and I can now write an honest review. All the things people keep complaining about are miniscule.  Having a black family in MyCareer is really not that big of a deal. Yes you are a white guy (if thats what you pick) but really it dosent matter. After a couple hours you through with the rookie year of 8 games and all the cut scenes. The only downside is you cant win rookie of the year. Then after the last cut scene goes its normal AND MUCH MORE IMPROVED mycareer. The off  days managment is exactly what mycareer needed. You can pick all sorts of activities and they all have a risk-reward system. All in All I think this year was a vast improvement and I believe people on here just like to complain. Teh preorder VC came as soon as the game came out, along with all the preorder stuff. The difficulty is much higher this year not in that the AI cheats but actually plays basketball the right way and you cant just cheese (run around the defender until you get open) the defender and win. You actually have to play basketball and move the ball around even on lower difficulties. I believe this year was much better and please do not look to the negative reviews as most of them were people complaining that they didnt get thier preorder VC because they didnt read that they dont get it until the actual release of the game.

												I am going to say that 2K16 has the best presentation in terms of crowds, pre-game show, post-game show, and other stuff. The graphics look great too, but graphics are not everything. And this game is very unstable, network-wise as the game forces you to play online if you want to see actual and meaningful progress for your MyCareer (it started last year; you can play offline with limited experience; BS). Anyway, server always crashes, and for one week, there would be atleast 2 me or my friend cannot connect through the network. This is disappointing as they release a huge patch which definitely improved the performance, but did not even fix some of the major problems like the commentator dropping out if you're playing with 6+ minute per quarter. Cannot play an online game with friend without us getting kicked off with no apparent reason, and many more.If you will ever fix this game; please, fix it now or before the year ends. Another thing is the MyCareer, I hate the first part of it. The story is unwanted, though I had wanted to start from HS to College and eventually to NBA, but you don't have to put some drama crap within it. You emphasize this game as my choice, but on the first part of the game mode, there is no choice whatsoever. Good thing I got passed it and finally enjoying a better MyCareer experience.Don't buy it full price. Buy it when it's 33% or 50% off atleast.EDIT AS OF 11/21/2015:Yes, I will finally recommend this game to you guys. They finally fixed almost everything, finally, and finally. Though if you're not a hardcore fan, just wait for atleasst 33% off since the game may be really fun, but if you're looking for a total innovation, you won't really find it here, and MyCareer this year has been the cheesiest one so far (just the first year). If you can get this cheap, much better, if no, I must say it's now a decent game to play.			"

												I love sports games and had been looking forward to playing the Spike Lee story of ""Frequency Vibrations"" for some time although basketball isn't my sport (September is normally saved for Fifa or Madden).Initially I didn't recommend the game with early pre-release issues with lengthy loading times (which appear to be a part of the game) and frequent crashes which really hurt the immersion into the journey of Freq (these seem to have settled a bit).As someone who purchased the game solely for the MyCareer mode I have now given it enough of a go after 11 hours to say the basketball is fantastic, the graphics amazing, soundtrack awesome and as such I can live with the terminally slow loading times (as slow as Ed Cowan was as Australian opener a few years back).Playing a couple of high school and college games was pretty neat and I liked how the story mode through the first season kept player progression under control so Freq wasn't Rookie of the Year or an immediate All Star.Having been drafted at #13 by the Suns, my Albert ""Freq"" Timmerman enjoyed free agency negotiations and is now fighting to get his minutes up at the Bucks (getting 21 mpg at present and climbing along with his stats).While I'll enjoy working on Freq, I will have to check out some other game modes now too :)			"

												NBA 2K16 boasts the most impressive feature set of any sports game I've ever played. I normally despise basketball, but this game has started my transformation back into a fan.+One you're through the Spike Lee part of MyCareer, the mode is fantastic and holds a lot of depth.+MyLeague is a customizer's dream! You can move any team, re-brand them, control every team, or just let the CPU run a league in the background.+MyGM is the ultimate manager game inside a full sim basketball game. Building relationships a lot of fun. Al Horford has massive paranoia that I'm going to trade him. It's like I'm telling my girlfriend I'm totally not cheating on her every 5 minutes.+Best looking sports game out there.+Best presentation of any sports game out there.-There are some technical issues, like commentary cutting out, graphical glitches, and some of the online modes aren't fully up to par, but for a single player like me, these are small issues that will hopefully be fixed.-Spike Lee's story is underwhelming.

												Such a shame,What a pitty aswell.Nba2k16 was building to be the best basketball game ever and dont get me wrong it's ALOT fun to play but it has some serious issues that need addressingThe bad:- Computer wins 90% tip off- Shorts are buggy- Camera gets stuck in audience after half time for long periods of time- Invisible players- long time out's that cant be skiped and you are made to wait 20+ seconds- Replay camera doesnt show the replay- In the actual replay menu the camera is hella buggy- Long match up screens getting stuck- Mypark is hella laggy most of the time- Day one bug that has destroyed the community ( Free 200,000 vc ) <- since been removed from players who cheated- Cheaters in mypark,All badages, overall 99, All the perks of being a legend 5 at rookie level, Can lag servers, Crash games, Quit and win, Probably more.- Other modes have cheaters aswell.Now that you have read the bad here are some of the good,The good:- Update engine so that players move better- Mycareer mode is fun with the little story that it has- Mypark is fun without cheaters- New mycourt that you can customise and show off your trophies- New pregame commentary while the game loads- Easier to get stats on the board depending on difficulty- Off day's, Gain fans, Fans can be used in proam apparently, Endorsements for money, Or simply go to practice earn badges and vc, Get upgrades- Height restrictions- Diffrent game modes- Nice music as allways- Nice feel to myplayerI would highly recommend you get this game IF you dont play it online. If you want to play it online very quickly learn who the cheaters are and NEVER play them, boycot them. If they want to play walk off the court.Appart from that very good all round game.Just sad cheaters killed the community.Here's a list of how they did that.- Leader board,They get loads of steals/assists/dunks/points ( due to legend perks ) Basicly they get everything legend while normal players get nothing untill they gain rep.- Women players,meaning they can import any skin they like- Messed up charactors crazy long legs tiny body etc etc- All badages,Every single one you can get your hands on,If you where to do the same it would take DAYS,They had it all on day 1- Vc bug where you could get 200,000 vc for free as many times as you liked,Now they have any postion maxed out C,PG,SF etc etc,But 2k removed the money from people who used the cheat,But its to late.- Countless cheaters just not giving a damn- All upgrades maxed out ( not capped ) ?

												Overall this is a thumbs up, the gameplay is fun, but honestly it's not a big upgrade over last year. The MyCarrer mode has an embarassingly lame over the top story attached in which you don't get to make any decesions until after the actual story is over. For example why is all this drama going on and yet no one will even acknowledge I'm clearly not the son of this black family and that isn't my sister. They just pretend like in the movie The Jerk that I'm their black son... but my alabaster skin and thin stringy red hair is a dead giveaway that I'm not - just let me tell this leech that is messing up my career to hit the bricks and let me hire a private investiagtor to find out what happened to my real parents. Ugh. Also while all the cut scenes say I'm going top overall I end up being drafted 21st and it's never acknowledged. I know NBA salaries and a 21st pick isn't having everything this dude is having. Also why am I a free agent after my first year? They don't really explain that either. Anywho once you get past that terrible over the top Spike Lee borefest the gameplay is pretty good, it seems a bit tigther than last year. On my fairly top of the line gaming rig the game plays perfect at 3440x1440, I do recall last year that early versions of the game had performance dips, this seems more polished. However once you get past those minor changes I don't see much that is new.For me this is worth it as I played some of the free weekends on the NBA 2K15 deals they do on Steam but bought it on the XB1. I wanted it on my PC so I could stream to my Shield handheld and it doesn't disappoint (at least when on the same local wifi). If you have last years version on the PC to me it would be hard to recommend at the full price, but there are minor improvements all around and you do get that new story in MC, plus updated/new multiplayer stuff even though I never use it. If you're a couple of years behind then certainly buy this, the new engine that introduced last year on the PC is a huge step up graphically and play wise.			"

												I love sports games and had been looking forward to playing the Spike Lee story of ""Frequency Vibrations"" for some time although basketball isn't my sport (September is normally saved for Fifa or Madden).Initially I didn't recommend the game with early pre-release issues with lengthy loading times (which appear to be a part of the game) and frequent crashes which really hurt the immersion into the journey of Freq (these seem to have settled a bit).As someone who purchased the game solely for the MyCareer mode I have now given it enough of a go after 11 hours to say the basketball is fantastic, the graphics amazing, soundtrack awesome and as such I can live with the terminally slow loading times (as slow as Ed Cowan was as Australian opener a few years back).Playing a couple of high school and college games was pretty neat and I liked how the story mode through the first season kept player progression under control so Freq wasn't Rookie of the Year or an immediate All Star.Having been drafted at #13 by the Suns, my Albert ""Freq"" Timmerman enjoyed free agency negotiations and is now fighting to get his minutes up at the Bucks (getting 21 mpg at present and climbing along with his stats).While I'll enjoy working on Freq, I will have to check out some other game modes now too :)			"

												Yes, MyCareer story can be cheesy and dramatic, but it is only there for the first season, and you only have to play 8 NBA games. After that, you CAN change your nickname (contrary to what others have said), and the MyCareer mode becomes much better. Do yourself a favor and just push through the story to get to the real MyCareer mode. I haven't player 2k15 so I don't know how similar it is, but compared to 2k13/14, I prefer both MyGM and MyCareer in 2k16. The way endorsements and contacts work, with off-day decisions, works really well. The contract negotiations and player/staff morale work really well as well. The actual basketball gameplay is better in this game because it focuses on teamwork, and you can't just keep soloing as Durant or Steph or whoever your team's star is (at least on the higher difficulties). Overall, I think the story and bugs are what annoyed people about this game. I have not experienced any performance issues on my MSI laptop (960M NVIDIA card), but I'd do research on whether your computer will have problems with this game before purchasing. Finally, yes people hardly play online anymore, so if that is what you are buying this game for, you are probably better off getting it for consoles (due to larger sports playerbase) or just waiting until 2k17. I would still never recommend buying yearly sports games at full price, only because there will always be a better one next year, but since this keeps going on sale so often, grab it if it is < $30, with MJ Edition only if you want the head start for your MyPlayer.Edit: Forgot to mention, but 2KTV is awesome. The interviews are great, and the interactive polls and voting for best player dunks etc are fun and give VCs.Edit 2: As I played it again I realized that the presentation is something worth mentioning. While it makes the games take longer, I love watching the Inside the NBA crew (minus Chuck) for pregame and postgame. The halftime team meetings are cool as well. All of these are skippable though, for those who want to just play the game.PS: 2K Sports, PLEASE make a game out of that epic opening cutscene, I'm sure everyone would love it!			"

Posted: May 25, 2016
												So after more than 172 hours into this game, and undoubtedly more to come, I think I can give a good Review on this game. I play on Superstar difficulty. You should bear that in mind when I review gameplay mechanics. GRAHICS: 8/10 It's more centered towards consoles, of course. It's still good. My mom once passed me playing & asked ""Are you watching March of Madness?"" Should give you an idea.GAMEPLAY: 9/10 The most important part of a basketball game is, of course, the basketball. & no one should be disappointed in this aspect. Even though this game is obviously more geared towards console users, the game is still miles better than previous titles in punishing the user for not having basketball simple IQ. You're going to hear a lot of people say that 2k15 was better. & I'll be honest it's easier to beast mode on Hall of Fame. But that's simply because you can cheese too much. Why I rate This game so high is because of its attempt to limit cheesing from previous titles & keep/improve upon the incorperation of real basketball concepts.Shot Selection Importants:  Early after the games release you had players like Steph Curry missing 3 pointers taken early in transition, & unexplicably you still have players now with high 3 point accuracy missing open shots sometimes. The updates have fixed this a little, but I like where their heads where at. Because even though we have amazing 3 point shooters in the league, being a championship team is not about taking good shots, but passing up good shots for great ones. & more importantly the rhythm you're in when you take your shot is hugely important. The game will punish you if you aren't smart with the ball. Knowing when a player is on a hot night & when he's cold is hugely important. & It mostly depends on his physical state & morale. If your player in MyCarrer has been on the practice court after back to back games & tomorrow he's got another match you can bet he's going to be tired as balls & miss a lot of his easy shots. If you're unfamiliar with 2k they still do a great job of programming the AI to play like the real team would. You can bet that the Clippers are going to punish you with a ally-oop if you leave a lane open. Golden State will punish you from 3 if you're not physical on Defense.Speaking of Defense this is where I have to commend this game. In 2k15 the defense was too easy to press the boost trigger & run around defenders. You could just cut & boost around the Defense going to the hole way to easily. In this title you have to EARN ALL YOUR POINTS. You have to know how to break ancles, having the wallet to increase your stats aren't enough. You actually have to know how to play the game of basketball. When to create isolation shots for you & your teamates, how to do that on and off the ball, etc. This game has vastly improved the Defense. They won't let you get past them by just hitting the boost button.MYCAREER 7/10: Let's address what's on everyones mind: Spike Lee Joint. Now I'm going to say it up front. This title has made me make a new rule about anything I play. ""If at any point the story brings you to tears, you cannot rate it below 7/10. No matter how many hours the story is."" I don't want to spoil anything folks, but there's a reason this game has the Story Rich tag. Spike Lee once again releases a controversal story which, in my opinion, tries to show you the life of what it's ACTUALLY like for most NBA players. It's not all shoe deals & fame but you still have a past. You still have friends from your past. The most important element of NBA life I think this story potrays is you will have friends & family leach off of your & it's how you respond to your situation that determines your success in the NBA. The positives of this story far outweigh the negatives, in my opinion. Then again I care more about basketball than the story.Now we stll have to talk about the negatives. Your family is inevitably black. No matter how you swing it. This normally wouldn't be a problem for someone if you aren't racist, cause adoption, but the story makes reference about your sister being a biological twin. So it kind of ruins the immersion if your character isn't black. Which is why I think this title is different because it's not supposed to be you, but Freq. Why people are mad at this is because in times past you were able to be yourself & there would be relatively no story but you would sign shoe deals & be a megastar. I've tried to find a million different ways to say this but this game doesn't necessarily want your face on the story, but instead Freq's. It's the difference between role-playing a defined character or a silent protagonist in my opinion. A preference thing. But you can't doubt that the story is immersive once you get over yourself. I'd personally like to see more of this from 2k but extend towards other ethnic groups. Maybe even do a 2k story about the difficulties the first woman player might face in the NBA.MYTEAM ?/10: Please refer to another review for this. It's not my cup of tea cause I'm not into that fantasy♥♥♥♥♥♥but from everything I've heard & all the gameplay I've seen on youtube it looks... Nice? One thing I'll say is that you can get beat out by people with deep pockets if you don't know the game of basketball, as is the same with all of your online expliots.MYCOURT 3/10: Do not get me started. It's dead. Liek, so ded. Granted I've played a few matches but nothing like on console. Mostly the 1v1v1 player match & 4-5 3 on 3 matches. You have to get with a friend & do some magic voodo♥♥♥♥♥♥in order to find a server with people on it. If you're buying this game to put in a ton of online hours don't. Just don't, not on PC. I personally don't think 2k is going to be a company that gears its products to PC users. Online aspects are total crap.PRO-AM 2/10: Take my review with a grain of salk cause I have NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ENTER A MATCH. Never. I'm certain that like 10-15 of my hours can be attributed to waiting in an online lobby of some kind. I'm going to warn you with bold letters so you can't blame this review. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUY THIS GAME FOR ONLINE STUFF YOU MUST HAVE FRIENDS. Like, as many as possible. Don't rely on people you meet in game either. You might get a few sessions in if you're lucky but you need RL friends with Steam & you need to go on Reddit to find people to play with. I tried for a little but it was just too tedious for me. MyGM 8/10: I think they nailed this, not much else to be said really. If you enjoy management of a basketball team & building a team based on your preferences with real basketball concepts this is your mode. Combine that with the improved gameplay from the last game & this is a great mode. You can choose to buy out the team you're managing, which is nice. You can of course manage prices of your seats, merchandice, & concession stands. You can relocate your team. Options are almost endless. My personal fav is having different personalities for your different Team owners. They've all got their own way of running a franchise whether it be focused more on winning at all costs, or making sure the team is in the black every fiscal year. & your owners vary in their patience & involvment in your decisions. Player minutes on the court, price of stuff, focusing on Draft picks or aquiring talent in the off-season, sometimes they'll defer to your judgement, & sometimes they won't take no for an answer & that all depends on how long of a lesh they give you. TLDR: You have to know your♥♥♥♥♥♥if you're going to play this years 2k cause less cheesing. MyCarrer is different from past titles, but a great story. Online sux balls, but were already in playoffs so that shouldn't really matter. MyGM is as stable & reliable as shes ever been. Not much has changed & what has changed is for the better IMO. If you're a basketball pureist who is okay with next gen console graphics this is for you.			"

												People please stop posting about bugs right now. IT IS A PRE-RELEASE!!! It will have bugs. now to the review. I have played a little bit of GM and MY Player. I will say I have mixed emotions about such a story driven mode. I dont mind a story but this is pretty extreme. I want to feel like I control my career, not spike lee. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the improvements made to GM mode. So many quality features were added. If you are a GM junkie THIS IS YOUR GAME!!! now the gameplay. 2k delivers BIG! very fluid with great graphics. This is always the best simulator every year and I think they finally nailed it.			"

												I didn't play any of online modes, until know i have only played the my carreer. I can tell in the first few games i dind't like it, the Spike Lee part it's a little boring but make sense after you finish the first year, it's like a introduction to my carrer mode, i was thinking my carrer it was destroy but no, everything is there, the practice camp is fantastic. I don't have the vc yet, but i don't care about it. About the lag, the game have 2 days, nvidia didn't realease yet the drivers, but until now i don't have any kind of problem. I'm playing in a laptop: I7-4710MQ 2.5GHZ24GB RamGeforce GTX 860MI'm using all the settings in high and until now i didn't notice any problem. Of course the game it will have updates, but until now i dind't notice any kind of problem and i'm really enjoy it one more year.  "

												I don't really get why this game has so many negative reviews, cause personally I think this game is just another addition to the NBA 2K series, nothing more, nothing less. The servers have definitely improved but we'll need to wait till the official release to say more. Currently, the game is really all it needs to be to take down NBA Live 16, and yes, it's worth the $60 if you don't have NBA 2K15. If you do, however, the only reason to buy it is if you want to enjoy the new ProAM mode or the story mode in MyCareer. If you're not a basketball fan, I don't really see why you'd buy NBA 2K but yes, it is a great game overall.			"

												Here's the truth. Game is either terrible or great depending on what MODE you like. Though let's be fair, this PC version has a lot of issues right now regardless. Firstly, have fun Nvidia users. Chances are, you'll have to fiddle around with the settings to get this to work. Maximum performance is a hint. Then there's the sound issue, which seems to revolve around selecting 440 htz in studio. And that somehow improves your graphics....how they correlate I'll never understand. Also, people want keyboard support and such. ANYWAYS, onto the elephant in the room...My CareerThey lied to us. Promised an experience like never before. Talked about choices. Yadda yadda. 7hrs in, only choices I've made are on highschool and college teams. But I sure did get to learn about the Phoenix Sun's owner's childhood, and his friend Isadore lolOH an my agent's lemonade stand. ughreally? Not to mention, game is racisit as all get out. First, black family in the projects. Second, can't be white or asian or latino. Nope -- I mean, you CAN be, but you're not really. Just an Uh Oh Oreo. Because yeah, your family is black. Twin sister lol. Mom talks about birthing you. And you can be a white guy, blonde hair, blue eyes hahaThe italian guy says capeesh every 5 seconds. The white owner is from the burbs, and is a rich golf club type. 2K, I wouldn't be surprised if someone sues you for this career mode. It is AWFUL. Like playing Mass Effect 2 without dialogue choices. Like watching a bad Spike Lee documentary....oh waitRest of the game modes are fine. I like the changes to defense and passing. Oh an the changes to MyGM an such. But yeah, MyCareer - if you want this game for that alone, you'll be disappointed. ...sigh, rather have had M Night Shamalan or whatever directed it. Least I could have laughed at it. EDIT: After you get through the 'movie' portion of MyCareer, the regular one we all know shows up with some nice additions. Just, have to suffer through all that BS first lol

												Lovely game, feels a little unoptimized for modern machines - I've been running Mad Max at ultra high resolutions, but this game is giving my video card much more of a workout.Still. Very recognizably a Spike Lee production, MyPlayer is actually engaging this year. New pass controls are pretty slick, and the soundtrack is - as always - on point.If you like the 2K games, buy it. If you think you might like a basketball game, it's a great way to find out. If you want a single-player Basketball sojourn from Harlem to the NBA, with RPG advancement mechanics, thoughtful, nuanced acting, and a lot of people yelling, as curated by Spike Lee, there really aren't any other options.I for one, didn't know I wanted this until I got it.

												First of all I'm using a 7 years old computer with a very few little tweaks and played 6 hours straight after I got it and not one crash or lag. I do experience a framerate drop when timeout animation takes place so that's not even game breaking since its well time out.  Crowd's sound also gets messed up once in a while but that's not gameplay related again.  It really make me wonder why gamers with 5x better computer than me cant even play the game because of crashes and low framerate. Anyway this is my first basketball game since dreamcast days and I have been patiently waiting for the right version/year of 2k bball to buy and after a few research here and there, finally decided to pick up nba2k16.  My first impression is I'm really enjoying it. My high school championship in MyCareer went to triple overtime, pretty intense!  I'm still trying to get used to the controls but so far so good. Do I recommend this game? I think I will recommend this game at least the non-online aspect of it since I havent tried and probably take me a while to play online so I can't help you there. Other than that I think it's a solid basketball game and I will edit this review for more in-depth review as I play more. My player got drafted 20th overall by the Raptors, not sure if its scripted but I'm excited to keep progressing till I get my first all star and then playoffs and maybe my first ring.			"

												2k Do the Players a favour and bring back the passing and quick menu (The ingame menu to change systems, players etc..) from 2k15 these controlls are the best! (Just bring back the 2015 controlls)I am wondering if you guys changed the body type (Everybody looks very thin), because i think in 2k15 the bodys were realy good (Mass,height,Bodytype beeing not that thin)			"

												First of all I'm using a 7 years old computer with a very few little tweaks and played 6 hours straight after I got it and not one crash or lag. I do experience a framerate drop when timeout animation takes place so that's not even game breaking since its well time out.  Crowd's sound also gets messed up once in a while but that's not gameplay related again.  It really make me wonder why gamers with 5x better computer than me cant even play the game because of crashes and low framerate. Anyway this is my first basketball game since dreamcast days and I have been patiently waiting for the right version/year of 2k bball to buy and after a few research here and there, finally decided to pick up nba2k16.  My first impression is I'm really enjoying it. My high school championship in MyCareer went to triple overtime, pretty intense!  I'm still trying to get used to the controls but so far so good. Do I recommend this game? I think I will recommend this game at least the non-online aspect of it since I havent tried and probably take me a while to play online so I can't help you there. Other than that I think it's a solid basketball game and I will edit this review for more in-depth review as I play more. My player got drafted 20th overall by the Raptors, not sure if its scripted but I'm excited to keep progressing till I get my first all star and then playoffs and maybe my first ring.			"

												Didn't know you could ruin a basketball game... Until I played this year's version. MyCareer is boring AF. Menus are horrible compared to previous versions. Only positive I have found so far is the expansion on MyGM where you can customize a heck of a lot more than in the past. Glad I bought during Steam Summer Sale or I would have refunded.			"

												Coming into this game I was so hyped to play it, but man I did not expect 2K to drop the ball this year like they did.. where do I even start with this game so many negatives! The pc optimization is pure trash I'm shocked it even got released the game is almost un-playable I had the graphics settings dropped and entirely removed the crowd just to get to 25 FPS! 2K are you even serious NO CROWD AND STILL LAG SPIKES LIKE CRAZY?  The story line in the 'My Career' mode is sub-par at best and doesn't in any way feel connected to the gameplay. It's more or less a dramatic soap opera revolving around the family of an NBA star with hit or miss (mostly miss) writting and honestly unless you're gonna make an black kid from harlem for your created player you might as well skip all the cut scenes and get straight to the 2nd season.That being said I give them respect for trying something new and giving my man Spike Lee a shot at creating something, I can understand how they could've just given us the same old same old and we would've been fine with it but sometimes you swing for the fences and end up getting struck out.3/10 for the PC-port it's only barley playable and even it get's patched my whole love for this series just died with my experince so far. 2K just took my money and told me I was getting the same if not better game then on PS4/XBOX ONEAVOID THIS PC PORT DON'T SUPPORT DEVELOPERS WHO DON'T SUPPORT THEIR GAMES!

												FINALLY, DID 2k GIVE PC PLAYERS THE ATTENTION THEY HAVE BEEN CRAVING about?!!! For the sake of this review I will be classifying it into two categories. -First is the offline experience, which was pretty good, but honestly what wasSpike Lee thinking about while designing this crap?!!  he impressively managed to ruin a game mode known for it's mind-blowing storyline. Nevertheless, it was a pretty good experience (From features perspective). 2- Gameplay: 2k NBA franchise still manages to give remarkable new player animations as well as the overall atmosphere from high intensity matches down to the vivacious crowd!!!!!  I can guess your having an urge to buy this game, but Please just wait for the second part. ONLINE GAMEPLAY 1-  I was shocked by not only laggy servers, but also the tremendous amount of cheaters in my park! 2- The online matchmaking system is simply atrocious, it's just plain simple you can't find a damn game!!!!  In conclusion, NBA 2k16 is a beautiful game which is must buy for enthusiastic NBA fans, only if you are ready to compromise the online modes and stick with the well designed career mode.			"

MC is done, im so done with it. This is the first time that I really hate a video game, thank you 2k. You guys made me sick.

												I recently purchased this game migrating over from 2k15. I have to say it wasn't worth the time or investment. I enjoy that it's current with what's going on in the NBA and providing roster updates. But, that's all you're paying for like any other sports franchise game. I haven't seen any significant changes besides crowd noise, a new commentator, and game lighting. I really enjoyed 2k15 and thought this game would be a game changer. No one on Steam plays online so good luck trying to use some of the game modes to face off against other people. I was very disappointed at that point. I recommend saving your money and waiting until next year's release.			"

												Servers are trash; its a rare occasion where you can find someone to play against in myTeam, and in those rare occasions, you cant even play a single online game without lag. 2K thinks PC community is a joke by consistently proving that they do not care about players on the PC platform. For a game with the price tag of $60 you are better off buying a real basketball and playing in real life; at least you know that won't lag. Single player has improved from last year with the ""off day"" feature but even that isn't enough to compensate for the lack of respect towards the multiplayer aspect of this game. Overall 2/10 only buy if you want to play by yourself and experience the ""acclaimed"" Spike Lee ""Livin' da Dream"" which a 10 year old could've written better.			"

												My career gets boring after a while and ends up being easy... My Park is a complete mess as in everybody hacks for overall 99 and makes characters that look like lobsters that completely are OP and ruin the game. Imagine your 6 foot 7 small forward vs a maxed out 7 foot 7 guy that has the speed like hes westbrook and the athleticism of deandre jordan and the shooting of steph curry and the handles of kyrie. Don't get me started on the cheese dribble moves.. This game can be cancerous at times. But, its still fun to screw around on with friends. Honestly if you have no friends to play this with, you will honestly become bored/mad after a while. In the end, this'll probably just be a game you can go to if bored, or you got some friends that wanna play it. "

												First of all I'd like to point out that my dad never stops playing this game (He's put around 100 hours into it) even though he can barely navigate the menu just because he hasn't played an NBA game in years so he's able to overlook the flaws. I've put significant hours into each even year game in the franchise starting with 2k10 and have more experience with these games to compare to. This is a very, very dissapointing game if you play it at any level more than a very basic level. Entrance into any game mode other than simply playing a pickup game will leave you with an incredibly disappointing experience. Some major issues I have:1. MyPlayer mode is a joke and not nearly as fun to play this year as previous years. I always love playing MyPlayer but this year I put barely an hour into it it's just not fun. If you want a fun MyPlayer experience I personally enjoyed 2k14's version.2. Every game strives to keep the difficulty at a level where you feel challenged while minimizing the sense that the game is bulls--tting you. This game does a TERRIBLE job of this. All-star and whatever difficulty is above that (the 3rd and 4th difficulties out of 4-5 i cant remember) are the closest to my skill range. That said, when I play either difficulty, I either win by literally 40-50 or I lose by 20, with literally nothing in between. The game appears to dynamically change the difficulty of the game based off of how well you play, but fails miserably in it's task. I've never won a game at one of the harder difficulties if I ever took an early lead. The game amps up the difficulty to the max and you get completely obliterated. At the other end, I seem to win about 90% of games that I fall far behind in as the AI starts just throwing the ball out of bounds each possession until i catch up. The result is a game that always feels like bulls--t and gives you no incentive to actually improve your skill when in fact a better strategy for harder difficulties is to actually play worse.3. I'm usually enticed to play a majority of the modes each game has to offer, with things like MyPark and MyLeague looking like fun modes to play. They weren't. Blacktop eliminated the ability to play with stars (although they may have removed this in earlier years and i didn't notice) and because of the 2-1 scoring format (as opposed to the 3-2 format of regular nba games) players like JJ redick basically guarantee you a win. To make things worse, some stars slipped through the cracks and dominate, like Dennis Rodman.In the end, the game looks pretty and is a fun game to play with your friends when youre bored, but for anyone wanting to enjoy playing the game any deeper, avoid this game like the plague. 4/10			"

												A father passing by his son's bedroom was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. Then, he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow. It was addressed, 'Dad'. With the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands.Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.Love, your son, Joshua.P.S . Dad, none of the above is true. I'm over at Jason's house. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table. Call when it is safe for me to come home!			"

												2k16 needs to fix this game, fast. Everyone I know over at the reddit.com/r/nba2k community agrees with me that the gameplay was made too difficult and that there are so many bugs in this game, this was by far the most sloppy release from 2k. I've been playing NBA2K for years and this feels like the most unrefined version of NBA2K ever, especially on the PC version. Rampant hackers, terrible story mode, gameplay was tweaked to be 'realistic' aka my gold and purple players can't make wide-open shots half the time.. Kevin Durant missing from 17' out on non-user mode is blasphemy.This is extremely dissapointing because NBA2K was originally made to be better than NBA Live, now EA is going to take advantage of NBA2K's miscue because their game had a terrible director (Spike Lee). The entire storeline is forced and feels borderline racist, as NBA2K doesn't seem to realize how diverse their audience is.Go play NBA2K15, 2K games needs to fix this game and improve it. Their ticketing system looks like it's disabled because they're probably getting so many complaints.			"

												FINALLY, DID 2k GIVE PC PLAYERS THE ATTENTION THEY HAVE BEEN CRAVING about?!!! For the sake of this review I will be classifying it into two categories. -First is the offline experience, which was pretty good, but honestly what wasSpike Lee thinking about while designing this crap?!!  he impressively managed to ruin a game mode known for it's mind-blowing storyline. Nevertheless, it was a pretty good experience (From features perspective). 2- Gameplay: 2k NBA franchise still manages to give remarkable new player animations as well as the overall atmosphere from high intensity matches down to the vivacious crowd!!!!!  I can guess your having an urge to buy this game, but Please just wait for the second part. ONLINE GAMEPLAY 1-  I was shocked by not only laggy servers, but also the tremendous amount of cheaters in my park! 2- The online matchmaking system is simply atrocious, it's just plain simple you can't find a damn game!!!!  In conclusion, NBA 2k16 is a beautiful game which is must buy for enthusiastic NBA fans, only if you are ready to compromise the online modes and stick with the well designed career mode.			"

												First of all I'd like to point out that my dad never stops playing this game (He's put around 100 hours into it) even though he can barely navigate the menu just because he hasn't played an NBA game in years so he's able to overlook the flaws. I've put significant hours into each even year game in the franchise starting with 2k10 and have more experience with these games to compare to. This is a very, very dissapointing game if you play it at any level more than a very basic level. Entrance into any game mode other than simply playing a pickup game will leave you with an incredibly disappointing experience. Some major issues I have:1. MyPlayer mode is a joke and not nearly as fun to play this year as previous years. I always love playing MyPlayer but this year I put barely an hour into it it's just not fun. If you want a fun MyPlayer experience I personally enjoyed 2k14's version.2. Every game strives to keep the difficulty at a level where you feel challenged while minimizing the sense that the game is bulls--tting you. This game does a TERRIBLE job of this. All-star and whatever difficulty is above that (the 3rd and 4th difficulties out of 4-5 i cant remember) are the closest to my skill range. That said, when I play either difficulty, I either win by literally 40-50 or I lose by 20, with literally nothing in between. The game appears to dynamically change the difficulty of the game based off of how well you play, but fails miserably in it's task. I've never won a game at one of the harder difficulties if I ever took an early lead. The game amps up the difficulty to the max and you get completely obliterated. At the other end, I seem to win about 90% of games that I fall far behind in as the AI starts just throwing the ball out of bounds each possession until i catch up. The result is a game that always feels like bulls--t and gives you no incentive to actually improve your skill when in fact a better strategy for harder difficulties is to actually play worse.3. I'm usually enticed to play a majority of the modes each game has to offer, with things like MyPark and MyLeague looking like fun modes to play. They weren't. Blacktop eliminated the ability to play with stars (although they may have removed this in earlier years and i didn't notice) and because of the 2-1 scoring format (as opposed to the 3-2 format of regular nba games) players like JJ redick basically guarantee you a win. To make things worse, some stars slipped through the cracks and dominate, like Dennis Rodman.In the end, the game looks pretty and is a fun game to play with your friends when youre bored, but for anyone wanting to enjoy playing the game any deeper, avoid this game like the plague. 4/10			"

I don't play it online until I'm not better and better in this game. So I don't think it's a perfect sport game, but I'm saying definitely this is the best sport games on the market.			"

However, I have experienced too many game crashes during halftime cutscenes or randomly during the game.Moreover, aside of the career mode I bought it to play online, but since the servers are located in the US (so i've heard) the lag makes it unplayable for people in the EU. Street mode is playabe, when you get into 5v5 with ur custom made team, the lag is too much.			"

												I'm not a huge basketball fan. I heard the game was great from my brother who had NBA 2K15 and was opening 2K16 on PS4 while telling me this. I watched him play and it took me back to when I use to follow basketball and play the NBA Live series.I don't know what it is but I just keep coming back to this game. I clock a few hours, and put it down but I keep coming back. Mostly just doing career mode.With that said the career mode up until the second season is horrible. I have played a little 2K15 and I wish that was the game I bought simply because of the career mode. I do though still recommened this game.			"

												Arguebly, this is the only basketball game worth playing. That being said, there are some cons (and major at that).PROS:Love the living world, just wish it wasn't laggy af.MyGM is a new and better take on franchise, basically taking Madden's conected franschise and making it basketball.Addition of Euro teams is interesting, maybe 2k17 will let us go overseas?RTTF was nice.MyCareer 2nd season+CONS:The STORY IN A BASKETBALL GAMEPerformance is inconsistent at bestAnd Finally, SPIKE LEE MADE THE FREAKING STORY, IT'S A BASKETBALL GAME, SHOULDN'T HAVE A STORY!!!!!!!!!!So yeah, it's a solid game, just stay away from MyCareer unless you want to slug through terrible storytelling and boring characters with a predictable ending.

												Very often after I finish a game (MyCareer), the game crashes. The whole thing just shuts down and I unwillingly return to steam with all of my progress lost. Since this happens a lot, I always wait until the saving animation in the botton right corner is complete. Sometimes this works but it could just be lucky, because other times it doesn't. Despite telling me my progress has been saved, when I enter back in to MyCareer the game restarts at the Pre-game show. There doesn't seem to be any way of stopping this from happening. If 2K could fix this I would be very grateful. On many occasions it's crashed after important games, such as the Playoffs (which is why i'm so annoyed).On a different note, the post-game show is pointless in my opinion and, although it adds realism to the game, it really pisses me off because I can't skip the entire thing. Rather, i have to wait for 5 or 10 seconds at each new part of the show, which wastes loads of time and is very boring. If you could add in a skip button (Start), that would be great.Thanks.Update: In MyCareer yesterday in the first game of the playoffs the game crashed after I won. The same thing happened today. Despite enjoying this game, i do not recommend this game any more.Consider me a lost customer of 2K. From now on, I will download cracked versions of future games as a middle finger to 2K because they don't deserve any more of my money.Up yours.Update #2: I followed steps to fix the problem but it's still happening, even after an official update. Useless, aren't you?			"

												If you like basketball, this is probably (at least in my opinion) the best there is atm.  The graphics are really good and the gameplay is solid.  My only complaint with this game is the cringy fest that is the MyCareer.  The story is really stupid and I really wish they stuck to how they did it in 2k13 (I think it was 13 where you basically just do interviews at the end of each game and that was basically the story while you go through the season).  There is also one huge complaint and that is the amount of microtransaction incorprated into the game.  While you can earn the coins free, there may be some people that play online who bought tons of the premium currency to max out their charcter without working on him.  Basically, its pay to win if you are playing online. Rating 7/10			"

												Please note in advance that I've spent a lot of time also playing a console version.Do I recommend this game? Sure, with a few asterisks involved.PROS:Great actual basketball play.Variety of offline modes.Runs smooth on my admittedly average computer.CONS: MyCareer. No, not the ""racial"" issue. The fact that it was sold as YOUR story when it is anything but. It's entirely Spike Lee's story. And honestly, I wouldn't mind that so much if, after, you're asked how YOU would have done things. For example, there's only a handful of colleges recruiting you. As good as you allegedly are, you should have every major basketball school in the nation coming after you. Notably absent (I am a touch biased in this regard) are ACC powerhouses UNC and Duke. What if I want to pull a Steph Curry and go to a relative unknown like Davidson? Nope, you take what you can get. Furthering issues is that your rookie year is shortened to 8 games, most of which are just placeholders for filler intros about playing against LBJ, returning home to Brooklyn, etc. On draft day, unless you've played other modes and/or bought VC, you'll enter the NBA as a whopping 55 overall. That isn't potential legend territory, that's roster filler territory. VC. Expect to grind for it or buy it if you actually want a useful MyCareer player.Remaining issues with the actual basketball play. From time to time, centers who have no real life skills beyond post play will nail wide open jump shots from beyond the 3 point line, while you'll attempt a driving layup against a smaller defender and...miss.

												Game would have been great, but the career mode crashes every couple of games right after you finish and are trying to advance.  Then you have to play the same game over again, and it might crash again, you never know when it is going to happen.  2K won't even respond to the issue.  There is a fix that players found but it is overly complicated and shouldn't even be necessary if they wouldn't have released the latest patch.  Going to uninstall, and probably never buy another product from them again.			"

												Bad mechanics, the mods may seem many but there's actually only 2 or 3 that you'll actually play, and thouse are Exibition, My Career and My Park. My Career is so bad, because it's so unfaire when this should be a game of skill and ...it's not, when you press X and the shot goes perfect, but you miss because NBA 2k16, and then you have to earn money to upgrade you character.... what is this? Pay to win? Because it's seems so, mainly because you can actually buy coins with real money.			"

												The algorithm of the game ruined everything. I mean this is a good game in terms of its graphics and realish moves. However, playing the game from difficulty level All-star you always feel that you are battling with the algorithm written under this idea: if the player is in lead over 5 or 6 points, then the teamates become idiots, the opponent, whoever he is, becomes Michael Jordan. I am really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you can tell from my post, by the algorithm since it is so robust and works every time I played. When you can sense that artificial thing, it is not a basketball game, it is just you playing against the programmer who wants to add some sparks into the game and twists your grasp of the game.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR PC! A recent update has made MyCareer completely unplayable after you get out of college. This is nothing pertaining to PC specs, software or driver issuers, this is completely and utterly on 2k and the only response we have gotten is them patching the only fix this community has been able to come up with. Buy it for the consoles, this game singlehandedly made me promise to myself that I will NEVER buy another 2k game.			"

												Let me start off by saying that ALOT has changed. My first impressions were decent of this game. MyCareer is my favorite mode, and they managed to make it somewhat dissapointing. How? by pumping up your player to be the next Superstar, but making him worse than a d-league player. It takes some real hard work to earn VC, but the real pain is that they wave a lot of VC points in your face in exchange for money. That's the equivalent of waving a juicy steak in your face, while you are poor as dirt. You can take the steak and eat it on the spot, or work at a dead end job that pays you way less than minimum wage, but you will eventually have enough to buy that steak. Beware! fun to play but also frustrating like opening a jar of golden nuggets. Oh, and also lots of bugs. LOTS OF THEM. Gameplay is weird sometimes, but overall a 8/10.			"

												I love this game. Sure there are cheaters that max out players and challenge the integrity of the online portion, but you can't knock the realism of the game. It did have a rocky start, which was frustrating, but not knee jerking enough to ask for a refund (thats crazy that people did that). Mycareer is nice, great storyline for the first season. Contrary to popular belief you can be the #1 pick, and how well you play is taken into account. Love being able to invite friends to play on my custom court. Visuals are extremely well done. Controls are different but I am hoping people read ""Revamped Controls"", before they purchased. Glad they took away the supersample option in-game; prevents any more folks from destroying their frame rate. Post play is well done, and has a much better feeling of move-counter move. Will be even better once season rosters are finalized.			"

												NBA 2k16 is not NEARLY as bad as all of these reviews describe. The two biggest issues being brought up are optimization, and Spike Lee’s “MyCareer” mode.  First of all, if your computer meets the system requirements, you can run all gameplay at a very smooth FPS. I have all graphic settings maxed and can run the game perfectly fine. The stuttering and lag being described in the reviews has ONLY occurred for me during the between-gameplay cutscenes, (introductions, timeouts, ect). While actually in game, everything runs better than ever, with smooth animations and high definition characters. The graphics are by far more superior to any previous installment. 2K decided to take a risk and use Spike Lee to write/direct the MyCareer mode. Like any other movie, Lee’s story centers around one character and his family. While you can make your character look any way you want, the story encourages you to be a young black man. If you don’t want to be black, you don’t have to be. It is not racist like some people say… it is just how the story is meant to be. Throughout 2K games, many people have hoped and wished that eventually they would have the choice to play through High School and College games. NBA 2K16 listened to its fans and delivered on this! Now everyone is complaining because it isn’t good enough… I on the other hand found that it complimented the story in a perfect amount of games (4 high school, 4 college). Between each game, the story progresses. The story itself is actually quite engaging! You feel emotion towards the characters IF you take the time to listen and watch the cut scenes. All in all, it is clear after completing the story (which I have) that Lee put in a lot of time and effort.Here is the main point I wanted to make about MyCareer. If you absolutely hate what 2K has done by implementing a more complex story, DO NOT WORRY! After your first season in the NBA (you play 8 games your rookie year), the story aspect ends. At this point, you play just like you would in 2K15. Taking on full seasons, talking to the press, signing endorsements, increasing your stats, ect. All of this, along with even more!  With those two issues being pushed aside, there are many positives in NBA 2K16. The music is the best I have heard yet, finally landing on many good & popular tracks. The customization has drastically improved, and all of the best modes are there. 2K will be releasing bug fixes and updates, so all of these negative reviews will hopefully be changing. As for me, I find it the best installment in the series, and have enjoyed every minute I have played so far.			"

												For anyone on the fence about buying this game that enjoyed lasts years, Just buy it. I cant speak to the techinical problems that many others had regarding low frames in the menu and the like but as far as a basketball game this Is ROCK SOLID. The game is balanced extremely well and most of the exploits that you could use against AI have been fixed. I dont deal with people online so I cant speak to that experiance either, I just play offline and a lot of the MyGM and My Career modes. Speaking of my Career people are far to harsh on it. The first season is a write off as far as games/wins mattering and things like that but the story is pretty compelling and I find the acting and converstations far more believeable than anyhting 2K has written in the past. ONCE you get past the first year of your pro career (which consists of 8 games with story elements behind them) the game rolls into the traditional my career formula for the next years which is more or less the same as it was last year with one HUGE improvement. Off days now matter you have limited time  to get your star to being what you'd envisioned as far as endorsements,  skills, fans and everything else. For the first time in a 2k game your Star doenst feel Ignored or like he's on the back burner. what I mean by that is that the ingame personalities Reconize your Greatness, often have pre game converstaions about the crazy string of tripple doubles you've put up or your incredible shooting streak!. thats awesome! I even had one situation where at half time blake griffen was talking about how difficult it was to stop my Athletic gard for legimate reasons, not just generic ""well hes really great player so hes difficult"" its more taylord to what I do im a driving gaurd that shots a really high percentage from mid range so the converstaion was more about how difficult it is to gaurd me with the mid range shot. that is awesome I really feel like my player is the best player in the league and the league Reconizes it! that is a huge win in my opinion and has made me far more invested in my career.Preformance:for me the game is rock solid. I play it at 1440p and get anywhere from 100-130fps durring gameplay with all settings on High (supersampling on 1).my system is :i7-3770(non K) GTX 980TI game is running off a 500GB Samsung 850 evo SSD.I recomend this game to anyone who really enjoyed last years game. Improved in every aspect for me and my Offline experiace has been awesome.			"

												Pros:  Customization in MyGM/MYLeague/MyTeam is awesome, you get to create anything your heart desires, Great TV-style presentation (Makes you feel like you are watching NBA on TNT), Game Modes (My personal favorite is My League), Great overall commentary, Graphics look really life-likeCons: Frame-rate stuttering (although on my I3 and Intel HD graphics processor, it is very notiecable because with the high-end games the graphics are not as good), My Career is somewhat of a let-down considering I had high hopes for this mode.Graphics: 9.5 out off 10Audio 9 out of 10Controls 8.5 out of 10Overall Score 7.5 out of 10 (basically I lowered the score because of the my career mode)IMO if you are a NBA fan and you only have a decent PC my advice is to buy this game RIGHT NOW or OTOH if you are a casual gamer or do not have a good PC my advice is to wait for a sale or to get a PS4 or XBOX 1 if you want this game!!!!BTW, this is Becky's son (I'm the one that plays on this account)			"

If you bought last year's edition of the game, trust me, you're not missing out on much. A lot of hype is made around the new story mode in MyCareer, but the fact of the matter is that you have little choice in that regard as well.			"

Gonna have to wait about 3 hours until you've beaten the high school and college teams.  You know what that means.  Yup, 3 hours of your character being generic and untalented.  3 hours of you playing games and getting ranked all just to see where you end up in the draft.  The high school part doesn't even matter!I'm sorely let down by this one... I really liked 2K14, and I'm gonna try to refund this and go back to 14.

												I honestly would never pay full price for this game. Yes, the graphics and gameplay have improved as per usual, but to be honest if you play 2k for MyCareer like me the entire thing is cut scenes! Even in 2k15 you make choices but everything is predetermined and boring.

												Awesome game ruinned by bugs. Some serious input lag, sometimes getting so bad where the controller is completely unresponsive for a second or two. About every few minutes my player will get stuck running, and decides he doens't want to stop. He just runs out of bounds and keeps going until the controller decides it wants to work again.			"

												This game is really good ... for consoles .Once you log in ( on the pc version ) they HUGELY recommend to use a remote ... No wonder , its unplayable with a keyboard.They don't care about the pc version and it's obvious , just a quick look at reviews and you'll  understand.If you really wanna play nba 2k , keep your money and wait until you can get in on console .I've got atleast 200 hours on the console version .

												BUY ANY OTHER SPORTS GAME.I have so many hours logged into this game, and this game is the no mans sky of the sports franchise world. You know what? Not just this game, but each and every NBA 2KXX game is like this. I think when making nba 2k game the first step begins with a group of bussiness men sitting in a dark round-table room on the top floor of a sky scraper discussing how they can manage to make a game with the least amount of money spent on development, and the rest spent on marketing the abosolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. I think the conversation goes a lot like this, "" ey Ted after♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillaging all those kenyan villages, i think we should discuss making this next 2k game"""" Oi great idea, how about this time we tell the developers they have no budget and instead they have to make the game or we kill their families"""" SOUNDS LIKE A MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING PLAN LETS DO SOME COKE ON THIS HOOKERS♥♥♥♥♥CRACK"""" Yeah, yeah lets do that, also lets spend a quarter of a million dollars telling people that its gonna be revolutionary and a great new experience!""""nnnnifnfn... what did you say? you want to spend some money on development and reducing bugs in the inital release, and subsequent patches?""""No, No, I think we should release a broken game with promises of fixing it, and then make these people wait and wait for the patch, then we release the next 2k and start the process over again!""""sounds like a mdf plan ted, now please can we get back to killing these innocent puppies?""and thats basically how it goes down.

Even with max Ball Handling (99) you can still get stripped every other drive as a 6ft shooting guard and get 10+ turnovers a game.

												To make a long story short, download an emulator and then downlaod any nba live game or♥♥♥♥♥♥ Tecmo super nba basketball and you would have a game that controls better and the A.I. is better.  The NBA2k franchise is complete garbage.  Dribbling is awful, shooter ratings are irrelevant and the game is realistic if you put your pg at center and your center at pg.  Now for the ong review below.  This is verbatim my review of 2k15 and due to thiss eries still being♥♥♥♥♥♥ I will not touch 2k17.Well where to start? Basically this game is the same broken piece of crap that 2k sports has been repackaging since 2012. If you want a realistic or enjoyable basketball experience, go dust off something from the 1990s, this piece of ♥♥♥♥ sure isn't it. If you plan on playing this then be ready to watch players play out of position, clunky passing, in fact it's so bad that unless you select to do button command passing, you will turn the ball voer constantly. Player ratings seem to have little to no regard for performance and hell for that matter whether you're going to win or not has little to do with your ""skill"" at the game, rather the game's ai will just decide ahead of time whether you can win or not. If the ui decides it wants to win then be prepared for a sudden lapse in all skill in your star players as their ratings now mean ♥♥♥♥. Be prepared to watch your center and pwoer forward stand at the 3 point line, no matter what play you call and also prepare to watch as the ai walks away from a rebound or a defender mid play. In short, 2k sports is an awful company who already ruined their baseball franchise and they are a few years away from hopefully sports gamers waking up and stop paying full price for a new shine of polish on a turd. This game ahs it's fun monents but I can't reccomend this when it is essentially the same complaints since 2012. "

												Le jeu en lui même est vraiment bien comme la plus part des jeux de cette licence NBA 2K. MAIS, je suis extrêmement déçu de cet achat du fait que le jeu se ferme tout seul a partir de mon 6ème match après le recrutement des agents libres soit en fait au tout début de ma carrière. En effet, le jeu à fonctionne parfaitement pendant la saison rookie, et ensuite bas, je peux plus avancer dans ma carrière. Génial. Et en plus de ça je suis déçu du comportement du support Steam qui ne fait absolument rien pour résoudre le problème quand je les contacte et qui ne veulent pas rembourser mon achat, j'ai donc acheter un jeu auquel je ne peux pas jouer. Merci Steam.Moralité si vous souhaitez l'acheter passez par un magasin physique et non par Steam qui préferera vous vendre un jeu qui ne fonctionne pas correctement sans assuémer derrière plutôt que fidéliser ses clients.

												I think that I have played this long enough to review it... Although I have to say that I haven't yet been able to understand well over half of it... With all of its different gsme modes, options, and ways to actually play it.Before this I have never owned a basketball video game before. No... I take that back. I owned Double Dribble for the original Nintendo back in the day. With Double Dribbles very cool and artistc ""dunk"" animations when going to the hoop and its quick passing and shooting I loved the game! I can remember that if you were to shooth the ball from any of the recognizable ""assigned"" possitions on the court you were guaranteed to make the basket... Be it a three or a regular inside jumper! It was getting the ball to those ""key spots"" that was the challenge and if you were good at moving the ball you could be virtually unbeatable!That being said I have only watched my friends play recent basketball videogames. I was never confident in myself to grab the controller and play (probably cause I absolutely $uck at real basketball). With the ability to create your very own team ie: logo, uniform, arena... Me being a graphics designer I went on ahead and bought the game for the sole purpose of uploading my very own custom logos. The actual ""game"" was just a bonus.I went on ahead and started a career just to see what it was like... Well it's like watching a basketball flick made by Spike Lee. Its exactly what you would expect... Basketball phenom growing up in the ghetto and rising above the horrors and the grim reality of it all! Its nothing special or unexpected... You have heard this story before and many times since. Although the story is ment to be moving it isn't... Not because the characters or plot doesn't matter, but because it's old news. Me being a white guy in an all black family dosen't bother me. It is what it is.  It's the been there done that scenario of the story that comes up short. I know the ending before the first high school game is even played. Its because of this that even playing high school ball, then college just feels like I am going through the motions! I'm like... ""Yada, Yada, Yada... Lets get to the pros already! I mean the game is titled NBA2K right! That being said I do not know anything about basketball games to compare this to. It feels good... At least I think it does. I don't have anything else to compare it to except Double Dribble and in doing that Double Dribbles controlls feel more tight and responsive from what I can remember. If I said that passing, dribbling and shooting seem... Loose... Would that make any sense? Defense feels OK I guess. Its what I expected it to be... To confusing fro me to pick up really quick. I am gonna need to practice to be any kind of good, average at best.Its the ability to create your own team that makes me want to diouble click the NBA2K icon on my desktop! The uniform creator is off the hook! With my ability to create custom logos using all of the really expensive artsy, fartsy software that I own, I can craft me some incredibly, insane uniforms! After all... Creating athletic aparrell and uniforms is what I got my graphics design degree for! Im about 2 years I will be graduated with my masters and on my way to ADIDAS to work in the ""Uniform Creation and City Culture"" department... AND I CAN'T WAIT!!! I'm gonna actually use what I create in this game in my protfollio! Right now I'm working on a team dubbed the 'Louisville Colossus""! The mascot is an Elephant and the logo is SICK!!! What I would love to do is create logos and emblems for you guys... Gamers that don't have the ability to make your own logos! I would do this for free of course because it's what I love to do. It seems that whatever logos I create are uploaded to the the NBA2K website for all to use! What I'm gonna do is go crazy and make a ton of custom logos, grapgics and designs to upload to the site so anyone can benefit of my talent! It is what I bought the game for. I know it sounds weird, but doing this kind of stuff is what I LOVE to do and for me to be able to see my very own creations in a video game is just to good to not pass up! I have been wanting to do this for a very long time! I can remember watching my friends play basketball and football games thinking to myself that I could create WAY BETTER uniforms than the ones I was watching my friends use!Don't use this review to bease your decission on buying this game! PLEASE! Just know that I am gonna be uploading some very cool logos on NBA2K.com and if you wanna custom logo for yourself just friend me and let me know what you want. In the meantime I am gonna be working on some bird logos, wolf logos, elephant logos, letters, insects (bees, wasps, yellow jackets and so on), and other animal logos! All images will be under my Steam alias: The White Knight!Thank ou and I hope I make some logos that you and your friends will be able to use for creating your dream team!			"

												The story of the great director known as ""Spike Lee"" began all the way back in 1818. Following the wake of the great Finnish depression, his father Petri Vehvilläinen II was unable to find a stable job - this led to a poor home. Spike's mother Mumin Vehvilläinen was consistently beaten by her husband, and constantly longed for a better life - away from Finland. She dreamed of one day becoming an actor in the United States. Once, when Spike was only 11 years old, Petri came home particularly drunk and violent. After discovering that his wife had been unable to produce a dinner which was up to his standards, Petri began aggressively beating her. Barely managing to escape with Spike, she left off for America.Initially, she found a job as a carpenter in downtown New York, but never gave up on her dream of becoming an actor. After meeting a wealthy individual by the name of Nicholas Cage, whom she became enamored by, she was given the opportunity to see her dreams come true. They lived the rest of their lives in Hollywood. Seeing this inspirational story led Spike Lee to become the greatest and most distinguished director of our time. His magnum opus, NBA 2k16, has been universally and critically acclaimed. His future repertoire includes such stunning pieces as NBA 2k17 and even NBA 2k18. In conclusion Spike Lee ♥♥♥♥ed this♥♥♥♥♥♥up, he stuck this whole franchise up his♥♥♥♥♥and when he pulled it out it was already covered in sticky♥♥♥♥♥♥ Please do not make a return in 2k17.

												NBA 2K16 doesn't really need a review. It's the standard in NBA games, and pretty much has been since its first inception since the original NBA 2K.Once again, 2K emphasizes the career mode that puts you, a created rookie player, on a journey to become an NBA superstar. It's a fine mode, but the real reason anyone will get this game is to play simulated NBA matches. The game has a lot of nice touches that makes the game experience immersive. Sponsors, cheerleaders, and decent commentary and improved visuals makes this entry a little better than last years, and really that is all we as NBA game players expect from a title like this every year. The short version of an already short review would be: If you like to play proper Basketball in videogame form, this is the game for you.8/10 ""Good""			"

												It is with a sad heart that i write this review. I never thought that i would be giving a NBA 2K game a bad rating. They had a winning formula that was used year after year, and continued to be enjoyable year after year. This year, things went bad, and it wasn't just one small issue but a multitude of problems plaguing this game. As a basketball game, the game works, but controls feel more unstable than previous iterations, defense is a nightmare, shooting feels like a game of chance. MyPlayer had a brilliant addition in the spike lee storyline in adding high school and college games, but cutting the rookie season down to 8 games made it dreadful. Worse than that, as of the current patch, the game crashes more often than Helen Keller would if you had put her behind the wheel of a car, thus erasing the previous game that you had played. 2K has avoided replying to this major issue that has plagued this game for the last month. I can only assume this is a business strategy to get people to move over to consoles and to buy NBA 2k17. TL;DR 2K broke an already ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game and refuses to fix it.			"

												The first ball game without a keyboard controlling adjust setting from 2K, great! Right, 2K, you have been the story! I know keyboard 2k players like me are minority. But have you ever noticed that your default keybaord control setting was a crap? I cant do any pro joystick stuff with that. From now, there will never be any more gamer who can use the pro joystick like a controller but with a keyboard. You ruined my gameplay. Or lets talk about performance of the game on PC, lag a lot, just not as smooth as 2K15. My PC spec is 4790K+R9 295x2 and 16GB mem. I know there might be something wrong so I didnt turn on CF and using only one graphic card. So you can see that as the performance of R9 290x. And thats more than enough in my opinion. But it appeared to be not. I'm seriously disappointed 2K. You will lose many keyboard players for sure unless you do something.			"

												All these ATI and keyboard fanboys should SHUT UP.Laggy? Crashy? Poorly optimized? Oh, right. You are rocking those sweet AMD cpus and ATI cards. No lag. No crash. Solid 60 fps @high settings. You know why? Nvidia + Intel. And people are really trying to play this with keyboard? Really? I wanna know how you do intense D + call for double team + moving with your opponent + trying to steal the ball ALL AT THE SAME TIME on your precious keyboards.And I don't get the hate for Spike Lee and his MyCareer movie. It is not going to win any Oscars but it gets the job done.The only weird thing about MyCareer is that you get dropped into NBA with 55 rank while everyone refers to you as a next superstar, like you are special. ""Freq, who averages 2 pts and 2 ast per game, is a special player!"".			"

												NBA 2K16 by far has the best gameplay of any basketball game to date.There are so many game modes that'll get you engaged to this game such as MyPark, MyCareer, My League, My Team, MyGM, Online Leagues, etc.The gameplay has been improved compared to last year.It has the best AI (Artificial Intelligence) of any basketball game.Many people complain about Spike Lee's ""Livin Da Dream"" on My Career.but here's my thoughts on it...To be honest, I find ""Livin Da Dream"" to be ok if and only if you view it as a standalone movie.It's ok if you're just viewing it as the life of Frequency Vibrations.But the bad part about it is that you have no choice but to step into the shoes of Frequency Vibrations. Whoever player you create becomes Frequency Vibrations. It just didn't feel like the player I wanted to be. I mean I don't decide on stuff like he do. It just didn't feel like me.Maybe the advertising of ""Be The Story"" mislead some people on My Career.Maybe they should've advertised it as ""Be The Story of Freq"" or ""Step into the shoes of Freq..."" or something like that so that fans of My Career should not have been mislead to thinking of actually being the story or having to choose what story your player will have on the journey to the NBA. Instead, they gave us a fixed background story of your journey to the NBA.But Overall, MyCareer along with the whole game of NBA 2K16 is pretty good.This is a must buy for all of the basketball lovers who plays Bball on consoles, PC and stuff.

												Good Game But, Seriously 2K needs to fix the delay on my park and having 99 overall players miss wide open shots, it's really annoying, another thing they need to fix is all the cheaters on my park with 8 ft my players with arms the length of their legs, send a ban hammer on everyone who cheats. It's also impossible to stop a Center on my park from dunking on you or laying it up. Other than those problems the game is fine.6/10 is my rating			"

												If you're a true fan of the series then you will have fun with this no doubt.  PROS:+ The gameplay is much more improved then previous titles and plays remarkably smooth.  + Player customization has improved slightly with the addition of more hairstyles and a better tattoo system.(Light skin players still look like cavemen)+ Graphics are on point as always, 2K does not disappoint in this aspect.(With the addition of SweetFX it can enhance your experience)+ Modes like MyGM and MyLeauge have been improved.  The off-season is one of my favorite parts.  Also you can relocate as many teams as you want in MyLeauge.  Since there are no college mods yet I decided to base each team off NCAA teams to add my own twist.  + Roster customization.+ Uniform and court customization is a plus.+ Soundtrack is good, not the best, but good compared to previous titles. + Runs smooth at a steady 60FPS on all high settings with the addition of SweetFX. (Tested on an i5 4690k, R9 280)CONS:- Little care to the PC online community from the devs. - Lots of cheaters, horrible matchmaking, and MyPARK is still a joke.  You can't even communicate with other players, there is no mic support online...what the ♥♥♥♥ 2K?  - MyCareer... I was so hyped for this mode but Spike Lee's involvement puts so many limitations on what the MyCareer should of really been, at least for your high scool, college, and rookie season... It was rushed and felt like I had no control over my player's decisions other then selecting which college I wanted to play for.  Anyways after your rookie season is over the actual mode is unlocked and just like the previous year it's the same with some slightly new additions.  This mode honestly gets boring after a while, 2K does very little in terms of detail and doing something during your off-season.			"

This is a game you NEED a controller for, don't even try with kb+m, probably where most of the negative reviews come from in the first place.  easily 10/10, will take a long time to master the game though with all the controls you need to use situationally.

												FINALLY WHAT 2K15 SHOULD HAVE LOOKED LIKE!Although that VC problem& many others they had on start - it's a way better game than 2K15. I guess 2K needed some competition from NBALIVE16 to wake up!The game is more realistic, the animations are smoother. Even cheaters with 99 will have hard time against you(And lose most of the time). New stuff like connections & practice days(Endorsement included). Of course a little bit lame story by Spike Lee(But it's okay). Good thing you can earn badges from Practice days if you earn GOLD on drills.Connections give you tons of stuff(but you'll have to choose on your free day - either this or practice or endorsements).You start with 55 rating, 1 of 3 highschools. After 3 games there you'll choose your college(9 will interest in you eventually out of 20) and play 4 games. Too bad you cannot skip the draft part. You'll play 8 games in your first NBA season with Spike Lee movie cuts.Those who cry about 55 rating start should not play - mostly noobs - IT IS THE BEST THING EVER. IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN. You'll have to earn it. You can actually earn pretty quickly VC from MC and also 2K APP.New interactive TV from 2K16. You are participating and answering questions while watching episodes!!!The Proam system a bit suck, but few fixes and it should run properly(NO MORE REC). Making your own team for playing in sort of your own court is a great thing.YOU ALSO GOT YOUR OWN COURT. You can practice, can invite friends and play(ALSO EARN VC on 1v1,2v2 and so on). You can also teleport them from your own court with you to Proam or Park.The Ante-UP this season is GREAT. YOU GOT JACKPOT YOU CAN WIN OVER 100K!!!Of course there are few glitches now & then - but overall it's GREAT.			"

You'll play 8 games in your first NBA season with Spike Lee movie cuts.Those who cry about 55 rating start should not play - mostly noobs - IT IS THE BEST THING EVER. IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN. You'll have to earn it. You can actually earn pretty quickly VC from MC and also 2K APP.New interactive TV from 2K16. You are participating and answering questions while watching episodes!!!The Proam system a bit suck, but few fixes and it should run properly(NO MORE REC). Making your own team for playing in sort of your own court is a great thing.YOU ALSO GOT YOUR OWN COURT. You can practice, can invite friends and play(ALSO EARN VC on 1v1,2v2 and so on). You can also teleport them from your own court with you to Proam or Park.The Ante-UP this season is GREAT. YOU GOT JACKPOT YOU CAN WIN OVER 100K!!!Of course there are few glitches now & then - but overall it's GREAT.			"

												The best basket simulator until today, the graphics are better than 2015 and has officialy support for SLI,  The Career mode it is so realistic eg at the free days your manager close deals with shops and you get there and get money, or hang out with Teammates to have better team chemistry, or you hang out iwht your fans and you earn 50000 fans. ITS IS THE BEST OF THE BEAST BASKET GAME.			"

												Runs like a dream. Looks like a dream. This is easily the best sports game I have ever played. I said that when I played NBA2K15 when it took over my life on PS4 but this is a step up. The whole Spike Lee Joint part adds a depth of story even if its a little left of centre. If you like sports games you have got to give it a try. It isnt NBA Jam and it will take a little bit of time to work out what player type you want to play with but it has so much depth. You honestly cant get this much game out of any other sports title in my opinion.			"

												Beyond the other reviews I really like this game. The story with Spike Lee is pretty weird how they have it set up, but oh well. They did something at least. The gameplay is super smooth for me, Idk what everyone else is playing on, but ive tested it on a 970 and a 7950 and both ran super smooth for me. The game to me isnt a whole lot different from 2k15, but the few changes were good. This game is a ton of fun, I dont see all the negative reviews. But hey, I only put 300+ hours into 2K15 and only 20 at the time of writing this so we'll see I suppose "

												Well, here we go...... (WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS GAME)This game is by far the worst nba game i have ever played in my life, the worst sports game for that matter. It is a bugged money grabbing piece of mess you can barely call a game. The concept is great, but it has been poorly realised. One of the worst mycareers EVER (from what ive seen, and form what the community says), god forsaken controls, bugs and glitches left right and center, AND I HAD TO BUY A CONTROLLER BECAUSE THE KEYBOARD CONTROLS, and when i tried to figure out what keys on the keyboard with what controls matched up with the controller buttons controlls, i got the basics down but when i got in the more complicated ones they were all mixed up, when it clearly said that the right analog x positive axis is the same control as klicking the 6 on the num pad, well turns out it isnt. Nevermind what i said here just know that te controls are ♥♥♥♥ed up. Now the next thing.......... the sheer stupidness of the bots (friendly and oppsing). In short terms they are poorly programmed and they werent paid any attention. Im not picking on mycareer because it has more cutscenes in it or that kind of stuff, im picking on it because its a dissapointment, and a discrase.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, NOT EVEN ON THE SUMMER SALE. The menu screens are bugged , i find my self stuck and unable to get off some options menu screen, even though im clicking the exit button. This game has been rushed out(not that it has been realeased in 2015 when it clearly says 2k16(very stupid joke XD)) because im still experiencing some glitches from day one (as i've read) that should have been fixed by now..... Theres alot to comment on, but in short terms; THIS GAME IS A NO GOOD PIECE OF KOMODO DRAGON♥♥♥♥♥♥THAT ISNT WORTH 49 EUROS NOR 10 FOR THAT MATTER, IT IS A GLITCHED MESS CLEARLY DESIGNED FOR MONEY GRABBING, IT ISNT WORHT 40 GIGS OF STORAGE, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, ID RATHER BUY A COLLECTION OF JUSTIN BIEBERS ALBUMS.

 É questão de ponto de vista É inegável que todo o marketing do jogo foi voltado para o Livin da' Dream a.k.a Vivendo o Sonho de ser um jogador profissional de basquete na maior liga do mundo e é ai que começou o erro da publisher. Livin da' Dream a.k.a MyCarrer não é tão mais MyCarrer assim, por isso a questão da casualidade é fundamental para entender o ponto de vista abaixo explicado: Enquanto a maioria dos jogadores busca no Minha Carreira, obviamente, desenvolver seu jogador do status mais baixo possivel até o momento em que se torna uma lenda, Livin da' Dream ""quebra"" esse contexto, apesar de te iniciar do High School, no final das contas nada importa jogar bem sua temporada de HS ou de College, ser campeão, pontuar, ter boas notas... você irá para a NBA de forma até chata, você terá o mesmo agente das estrelas ainda na faculdade, quando menos esperar terá uma namorada e seu próprio tenis, prestigio e fama. Tudo isso sem ter que fazer absolutamente nada.Mas ué? Onde entra o meu jogador?Para entender de uma vez por todas o que é Livin da' Dream, saiba que não é sua história, é a história de Freq. A questão é que Freq tem o seu rosto, sua altura, peso e tonalidade de pele. Isso torna tudo extremamente fora de contexto dependendo de como você criou seu personagem e toda essa falta de contextualidade torna a história desinteressante para muitas pessoas. Você escolhe apenas a sua faculdade.Pelo lado positivo, Spike Lee mostra muito bem o fator humano por trás da tentativa de se tornar um jogador profissional, os personagens são cativantes e o nível da história no geral é ok, só não leve tão a sério.Os outros modos de jogo são diversificados, além das partidas convencionais existe o MyPark onde se lembra dos tempos de NBA Ballers com o seu Personagem, o MyTeam a.k.a Ultimate Team com submodos muito divertidos, MyLeague, MyGM entre outros. todos cumprem seu papel.A personalização de quadras, logos, uniformes e qualidades gerais que envolvem um time é sensácional, slooooooow clap! O Gráfico, bom, é o jogo mais bonito que eu já vi e ainda tem uma performance invejável, diferente dos anteriores. O Grande problema é a quantidade de microtransações possíveis , é 2K ou EA? Nenhuma passa de itens visuais e cartas do MyTeam entretanto. Trilha Sonora: Another One.Resumindo: Como um jogo de basquete, é sim o melhor já feito, mas talvez não compense se você tem o 2K15, por exemplo, agora, caso você assim como eu esteja vindo do 2K13 ou anteriores, vale a compra sem a menor dúvida!

												First sports game I bought day one since Madden 11 for the 360. Last sports game I buy day one until Madden or some sort of REAL football comes to PC. IDK how many hours I have put into 2k as a game company (not just b-ball) but it's a lot I will spare you the details, sufficed to say I feel they could do better. Step 1. Go to♥♥♥♥♥.com and purchase the game for much cheaper than retial...Step 2. Regret purchase and uninstallStep 3. Write this review detailing the steps I took to get hereSeriously though, the game is fun to an extent. Someone else said after the first myplayer, it's a grind well I say it is ALL A GRIND. The VC is more scarce and harder to get. They added more VC accomplishments but than they don't unlock. My character gets stuck in weird animations all the time. I can't skip cutscenes. IDK how many times I pressed start to skip a scene only to have it accidently take me to the park... The park... Dear God the park So the top guy shown on the loading screen is obviously a cheater. So is the second, thrid and fourth on down the line all 99 across the board. Some ppl are 7 ft tall and have the speed of I.T. (Boston Celtics P.G. now) and the quicks of A.I. mixed with the passing of J-will and Nash combined with the strength of Shaq in H.S. and Ben Wallace in his prime. Put all that mixed with the hops of that one nukka who pulled the 720 dunk on And One back in like '04 and you have a bunch of ultimate players that hardly pass the ball but know how to Kobe it up. You ever see that meme on FB where Kobe is sitting at the table and someone asks him to PASS the salt and he has that perplexed look like ""WTF nukka pass?"" That's EVERYONE in the park from day one because they are all the greatest players in a TEAM sport. 2v2 is a joke. 3v3 is fun but only until the mascot comes around skateboarding with Allen Iverson next to him. Or the topless CHICK. To be clear, you CANNOT be a Female character in this game UNLESS you cheat. They supposedly fixed the fact that noone could join anyone else's homecourt ever. My court was pretty cool looking. They did add some nice features but again it's a pain. The controls are different this year again... The story is just plain not needed. The always online mycareer is stupid and has been since day one. The reason I play mycareer is to play BY MYSELF in MY CAREER. I don't want it to be online if I did I would play it in online mode. That's why Madden has franchis online and offline OPTIONS. Madden doesn't force me to play my game online if I don't want to. All that to say this: I got banned a while back for apprently exploiting the same thing that A LOT of ppl did and that's fine the servers will be off in a year or so anyways. NBD. My issue is that there was NO WARNING. That's all I will say on that. I do reccomend this game especially right this moment as it's just 20 dollars. I do not recommend this game if you want to play my career, my park, my team or street. I recommend this game as a time killer. When you are waiting for your kids to get home from school, play this. When you got something to do but it's just 40 mins away, play this. JUST SO YOU KNOW: YOU CAN NO LONGER PLAY PART OF A GAME AND THAN SAVE AND EXIT AND COME BACK TO IT IN MYCAREER. Apparently the best way to stop people from exploiting minute bugs like the save and quit VC glitch is to take out one of the best parts of the game. I didn't cover everything because I don't want to bore you.....			"

												Would I recommend NBA 2k16? Absolutely! I'm not sure why so many people are hating on this game. It's the best basketball video game out right now. There's no denying that (I don't say this because I'm a fanboy or anything, it's just a REALLY good game). I haven't played everything yet, but I'll do a full review once the game is properly released. Anyways, here's my thoughts on the game so far.So everyone talking about framerate issues with this game. It seems to vary person to person. I've noticed a couple times where the framerate slowed down, but it wasn't anything game-ruining. Generally it lags when the crowd stands or something, but I find these lagspikes to be somewhat uncommon. However, we must all keep in mind that the game is currently in a pre-release stage. Chances are that  NVIDIA driver will release the day the game is going to fully released, and then all our lag problems will be taken care of (Hopefully). But for now, it's still playable and doesn't ruin the game.There's also a lot of talk about controls. I must say, the keyboard controls are horendous. It's basically impossible to use keyboard controls. A controller is pretty much recquired, which really stinks for those who have to buy one. Although, if you're a gamer, you should have a controller already. But you shouldn't be held responsible for the laziness of the developers. Other than that, everything is good. Smooth gameplay, easy controller use, all that good stuff. Except for passing. They changed how you pass, so it may take a while to get used to it. It's still playable though, and still quite a lot of fun.The graphics are amazing. There's a lot of options for video settings, which can make your game look as close to real life as games will ever get. The animations are spectacular. Everything interacts with eachother, which truly makes the game feel like real life.There are still micro-transactions and DRM, which some gamers absolutely dispise. Although the game is completely playable without a single in game purchase, it's easier to just buy the in game credits. And the DRM is just a one time connection, so it could be worse. Neither of these are major issues. The game is still fully enjoyable.So, that's my review. Analyze however you want, but here's the facts: NBA 2k16 is the best basketball video game in existance at the moment. If you want the best, here it is.			"

All you need to get the most out of it is a gamepad (I use an xbox 360 controller) for your computer and you need to set the graphics so it doesn't lag up your whole game. Do not listen to all of the bad reviews because this game is very good.			"

												To begin with, I think there is a reason behind why this game has a huge discount at summer sales unlike 2K15 , 14 , 13 etc.It's not hard to guess that 2K has had high hopes for this game but they haven't got what they expect.I don't have a controller or anything like that. Just a basic setup with a keybord and a mouse. If you are an oldschool NBA and 2K fan like me and want to play this game with your keybord, trust me you're gonna have a hard time. As soon as I finish my work at the controls menu (it is still not what I want it to be), I play my first exhibition game and I quickly realize that I miss the pure , simple and good old 2K series.

												There are many improvements  and changes in NBA 2k16 that make this game feel like a different game than NBA 2k15.I started out with NBA 2k15 and straight away I could feel that the game was one of the best sport sims I had ever played. NBA 2k16 pickup where NBA 2k15 left off by tuning the game even more. Setting a screen is no longer just run to spot and press the button. If you are moving and setting a screen you will cause a foul resulting in a turnover. Blocking seems more genuine. I caught my self yelling out NICE!! when the AI denied a dunk. The animations are really awesome.The commentary is another thing that really makes the 2k games so good. They really build up the whole sports feeling and I love it. It's really great.But this release is not without flaws. You all have probably already read about MyCareer mode which isn't the story that everyone expected. I won't go into details but what you should know is that you are not playing YOUR future. You are playing an ongoing MOVIE and you have no impact on the story at all. The Spike Lee ""experience"" is just that, a movie and probably not what was expected. In that aspect nba 2k15 was light years better because you want options and different outcomes depending on the choices you make and reactions to what's really happening on the floor. Nba 2k16 is not that but it doesn't make this a great game.A second flaw are the bugs. There are just simply too many to be called a full release. Penalty shot, the camera pov starts to shake like there is an earthquake.. I'm guessing this is not intentionally as it's horrible when it happens (which is quite often). Fouls are called by the commentary but no fouls are given in game.  The list can be made long with bugs that will need to be fixed and probably are going to be soo to.The conclusion is that you are not paying for a full game at this stage. You are paying full price for a game in beta stage. There is no way around it. However, the game is really good. You can feel it through the bugs and glitches and once it's been tuned it will be one of the best games out there.  So I'm going to give this game 2 ratings. 6/10 out of the box as it is now. It's beta with too many buggs. 10/10 Once the big fixes have been rolled out, this is superb game. It feels like a new game, you'll have to relearn how to pass, dribble and take shots. The AI are smarter and will punish you for trying to run through traffic or make bad shots. NBA 2k16 is even more realistic than 2k15 and that is why although the game has some serious flaws as of right now, the potential and what it will be is simply too good not to get. But if you really get annoyed with unfinished games you should wait so that it does not ruin your game experience. Me on the other hand. I just couldn't wait and even though the bugs I'll keep playing nba 2k16 even though I'm still having fun with NBA 2k15 as the AI and the game mechanism behind 2k16 are just that much better. "

												To begin with, I think there is a reason behind why this game has a huge discount at summer sales unlike 2K15 , 14 , 13 etc.It's not hard to guess that 2K has had high hopes for this game but they haven't got what they expect.I don't have a controller or anything like that. Just a basic setup with a keybord and a mouse. If you are an oldschool NBA and 2K fan like me and want to play this game with your keybord, trust me you're gonna have a hard time. As soon as I finish my work at the controls menu (it is still not what I want it to be), I play my first exhibition game and I quickly realize that I miss the pure , simple and good old 2K series.

												Really didnt care for the mycareer mode. Story was somewhat interesting but did not provide enough backstory to fully engage me into some of the characters. I felt that in the mycareer, during rookie year, there was not enough time to gather enough skill points to actually make the player decent. Most of the time, your calls for passes are ignored and it is very difficult to score any points whatsoever. Your only chances in getting any VC is getting a good letter grade for the game or giving into the scam that VC is and actually paying money for it. Aside from the sloppy my player, the rest of the game is great. Defense seems more intuitive and offense is a real challenge. Forcing you to make better, smarter plays in order to succeed, which is very fun. Overall, great game that couldve been done so much better in the my player area.			"

												Overall I thought that Spike Lee had a great story and was very impactful for the ""moral of the day"" kind of ending. He tackled real problems most if not all NBA players face in one point in their lives. Spike Lee is being real as it gets when it comes to making it in the NBA, and I believe he wanted to show the perspective fans don't really get to see.			"

												I was playing online with the multicourt option. In this game mode about 60 people can wander around 10 basketball courts. When you want a pickup game you line up by the side of the court and call next game. You can form a team and that allows actually multiple sets of people to call next game. They have a 4 on 4 court. Nobody plays it. The court takes forever to fill up. I left my avatar waiting at the court and started doing my dishes. Quite a long while later I realized that a group had formed a team in the team section and then another group had lined up on the other 4 spaces leaving me alone. I was first to the court and waited 20 minutes but the other groups walked out on the court and left me not playing. So in conclusion, yet another junky steam title, that I wont be purchasing. 44 gb and it isnt very good.			"

												So many things was made wrong. I even dont know how to start this review. This all is refered to MyCareer. My player is an outside scorer, PG, 1.71m, has maxed stats and got already all necessary perks.Ok, and now tell me, why the shooting skill depends to a person's hight? Why a person who has 1.74m can not became so good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in RL, made my first player with this hight and noticed then i can not reach a higher skill than 89. WHY? Thats a pure discrimination! AND WHY the game does not tell me that BEFORE I create a char and not even then when I reach the skill limit after weeks of playing?!?Shooting:Shooting in NBA2k16 is completly scripted and depends to the game's mood. Example: The game just started, after fews passes I'm standing free at the 3P-line, get the ball, the shot is A+ and its a miss. WHY? There are 2 option how to throw: player timing or % from the stats. I have player timing selected. Why I miss so often A+ shots? WHY? That isnt funny!!Futhermore a shot has a higher chance of success after a doublemove than without? WHY? In NBA2k13 I had a 80%+ throwing rating- in 2k16 42%. Really?Coach orders/tuts:The coach orders are a joke. Firstly, 70% of all orders aren't shown. Suddenly I get an F because I didnt done what the coach wanted. And thats several times per game! WHY the hell that is not fixed after so long time??Coach orders the second. There isnt completly nowhere an explanation of this orders. There isnt any explanation at all! ""Bring the ball into the post and let the big men do their job"". Post? Where is the ♥♥♥♥ing ""post""!? In Germany ""post"" means ""post office"". Shall I screenshot the ball and send you a post card?!? Where is the ""low post""? Where is the ""zone""? Etc. pp. Not every ♥♥♥♥ing man on this world grows up with basketball. I i.e. grew up with soccer. I dont know the rules of BB, the field positions, the strategys, etc. pp. I just want to play some BB on computer. Where is a ♥♥♥♥ing tutorial which explans me everything I shout know about this game BEFORE I start playing??Cutscenes:There are so many cutscenes you can not cancel immediately. Every timeout I penetrate my controller in the hope the cutscene cancels soon, and have to wait anyway til Gatorade's surreptitious advertising was shown. REALLY? WHY!?Defense-AI:My team has the ball, I'm standing outside in the corner. I decide to run to the other corner. When I start running the oppenent who is guarding me starts running too - at the same time in front of me! I running down, he running down. I running up, he too - without looking back! He behaves like a mirror - like i would steer both. That dont even happens only in such case, it happen always and for ever! WHY?Passing:Def Rebound -> fastbreak. A player of my team is running to the offense, I see a free straight line to him, press the pass button and what happen? Right, he is suddenly turning to the basket, runs behind an opponent and my player passes to the position he got AFTER I pressed the button -> turnover. WTF!? That happens so often. SO OFTEN!! WHY!? And the biggest joke of this game is the other way round happens the same. I running a fastbreak in the direction to the outer line, get a pass and my player... right... runs to the basket out of my control! I can not stop him to do this! REALY? WHY!? I dont want to do a ♥♥♥♥ing dunk! I want to do a 3 point fastbreak! Got it? GOT IT!?This example represents the whole game: you have to have fun in the way of the developers. You even can not do your thing and enjoy the game like you want. You have to play this game like they want you to play, but in addition they dont tell you how. And that means a high frustration. They want you to play in manner of their imagin and there is not a single inch place for you!			"

												I have been playing NBA 2K games since the beginning and this is the worst one I've ever played.  Even setting aside the terrible myCareer Spike Lee disaster, the game just doesn't feel fluid like previous entries.OffenseAll the passing and player movements feel very mechanical and do not seem to map that closely to controller input.  The isometric moves are a joke that can't get you past even the worst defender.  The passing is terrible at targeting the right guy and I got super frustrated at watching my player coming to a dead stop to catch the ball during a fast break.  The pick and roll never works as the players cannot seem to set a pick to save their lives.  The control mapping to call plays was also unnecessarily complex even for quick plays.  Even the shot timing just felt...off.DefenseThe defense in this game is a joke.  Your AI teammates will stand around while the other team moves around them to the basket.  Playing defense myself, the AI will be stopped before making a jaring motion to the side that your player can't apparently handle regardless of your controller input, leading to an easy basket as your teammates wave them on.  In the myCareer mode with player lock, the arrow indicating who to guard cannot seem to decide who you should be guarding and, as a result, your AI teammates will randomly decide that you are responsible for the guy they were moments ago closely guarding.StyleThe layout of the menus in the game made it difficult to navigate and just looked flat.  The diagonal text for everything wasn't as cool as someone thought it would be.  Are we suppose to be playing the game with our head cocked to the left?  Even the 2k13 Jay Z gaudy layout was better.StoryI knew it was going to be bad and it met those expectations.  I like the attempt to innovate but this was a horrible overly scripted mess.  People want to feel like they are in control of a player rising into the NBA.  We do not want to be told some over dramatized story that is way to ridiculus to take seriously.This game felt so horrible that I have to uninstall it and reinstall NBA 2k15 to get the bas taste out of my mouth.  Seriously 2k, stop trying to reinvent the wheel everytime with the gameplay.  Focus on innovating the modes.  The myCareer this year failed but I would have been perfectly fine with it if the gamplay wasn't also this broken.			"

Jump Shot is RS i have not RS on my keyboard 2k you nit wits, i have letters and no like A & S & W. Why would you want to play a game that you can't change the controller type to suit a keyboard.

												running smoothly on my GTX 970 but loading takes quite long.gives an impression that the game optimization could have been done better.but once you're in the actual gaming part it's all good.better than its predecessor 2k15 in evert way.I like the risk they took on the new MyCareer with the cinematic touch from Lee even though it does not feel as polished as other features that have already been years in the making.I like the new tweaks on the control with my Xbox360 for PC.

												Pre ordered this game, there was no VC or emerald packs. Went to settings found out that there is no controller configuration. Went to the mall and bought a logitech gaming console then played my career only to figure out that there is a controller configuration option only in my career. Bravo 2k just WOW. could have save money not buying the controller.			"

												Of what little time I have played this game, I can honestly say that this game is the truth!!! Great gameplay, great graphics and major improvement over NBA 2K15.This game is in catergory of NBA 2K11 which is the greatest basketball game of all time. That being said it took me six hours to play the game becuase it kept crashing to the desktop as soon as I got to the title screen. It did work once when I got to the myplayer creation part but crashed before I could finish it. By chance did I figure that if I set Steam to offline mode that the game would work completely (Minus the framerate or stability issues). Cant recommened until I can connect to online so I can play MyCareer, The Park and get my preorder bonus....			"
