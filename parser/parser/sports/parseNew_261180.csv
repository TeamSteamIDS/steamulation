												As a projectile fighting game Lethal Leagues core is simple: hit your opponent with a ball to score and ultimately win a match.You can try a bare bones prototype on reptile games' website to see if you like that concept.Like many other recent small competitive games this one challenges the player with high risk&reward as a single hit from the ball is a knock out. Although if you or your team hit the ball last it won't harm you.The intense fun of this game starts to kick in once you've hit the ball back and forth a few times, ever increasing its speed to ridiculously high levels (speedometer at the bottom on the boombox). Normal hits only increase the ball speed by 1, charged hits and smashes however double the speed. With more speed the hit lag will increase, the screen will shake, the background will change, intense visual effects will ripple across the screen and the characters will throw catchy phrases at each other as they hit the ball. Next to jumping and swinging you can also bunt the ball to slightly decrease the speed and carefuly set up your next attack.The movement mechanics are very solid. You can move right and left as you jump, you can tap for a short hop or hold to jump higher and stay in the air longer as well as press down to fall faster.The selectable characters two major mechanic differences are their method of gaining height (high jump, wall jump, double jump, wall ride, ...) and their special move, which can be activated with a full special bar (builds up by hitting the ball).Next to online and local multiplayer with up to 4 people there is also a single player challenge with 10 increasingly difficult stages to beat in sequence and in local multiplayer there are 7 levels of AI difficulty with the highest one still being a challenge even if you are already very good at the game - although not as engaging as a good human player will probably be.And it's a damn lot of fun.Raced to the top of my most played game ever list during beta testing.

												Honestly a great game that I didn't think I'd stick to for so long, even though 80% of my playtime was spent vs North American Players the community was willing to accept me and tolerate as much of my lag.... as they could (I'm Antarct---- Australian) :D:Great Game 9/10, could use some better palettes and have a tutorial with parryingIf you're willing to treat this as more than a party game, Lethal League has great depth and offers the potential for insane rallies far beyond the scope of ballspeed :D: with a great community to boot (just join the LL h̶u̶b̶c̶h̶a̶t̶ discord https://discord.gg/zSB7ZAe feel free to ask for games or just hangout).

												As a big fan of local multiplayer games, I originally got this thinking it'd be a fun couple hours of casual fighting with a group of friends. While it was certainly that, I never expected to get so deep into (what I deemed as) a ""party game.""The online community is fantastically rich- Just hop in the group chat, and you're bound to find a match with someone of whatever skill you're looking for, or someone to help practice a specific tactic, or just some casual FFA fun. There are tournaments hosted every weekend, and virtually everyone in the community is a blast to talk to.But the game itself has a depth I have never seen before- I have over 100 hours logged of high-skill matches and tournaments, and I am still finding new strategies and mechanics to use. My current repertoire is even missing two mechanics that I know, and with those two, there are plenty of uses I haven't even thought of.The depth is incredible. The community is great. The style is fantastic, and the play is like nothing I've seen before. Buy the game- You won't be disappointed.			"

												This game takes the old school two-button skill games and gives it a flavor like no other. It's like being put in a racquetball room with dodgeball rules. The ball can get to ludicrous speeds! But if there is any lag at all whatsoever, it will be difficult to achieve.There's a baller OST (not many songs though), a nice variety of stages, mostly aesthetic, but still provide a variety in size and significant difference with candyman's special--and a handful of characters with subtle but important differences in their traits. I highly recommend this game as it is online play, amazing with friends and absurdly addicting for such short matches!I hope there will be a way to chat with opponents in the game, at LEAST in the lobby. You can not communicate to them not to start a match because you are waiting for more people or if you want them to ready up for the game. 9/10			"

												The online is incredibly good, which is to be expected from GGPO.  4 player games tend to lag/desync a bit, but as long as you are not playing across countries, it handles it well.  1v1 online is nearly perfect from my viewpoint.Controller support is also good, I have tested 4 different controllers, all of which worked.  Only a few required minimal key binding.Gameplay itself is of the ""simple to pick up, hard to master"" variety.  Great for local party/competitive play.  Its fast paced, and has a lot of ""epic moments"" for all your friends to hype about.Not much content to be honest, though the game is obviously about multiplayer, and they do have a few modifiers to change things up.  But this is an important note, if you don't have good internet/local friends, do not get this game.  Though I doubt anyone reading this falls under this category.I personally like the art style, I have heard a lot of people complain about graphics.  I don't really need to review this though, if it looks ugly in the screenshots, you will find it ugly in game.Boss soundtrack, as in GOOD electronic music, not try hard dubstep.If my review seems badly written, it is because I am not a writer.  But you can trust me on this, Lethal League is amazing for what it is, and is definitly worth the asking price.  Anyone who is shying away because it is ""too simple"", there is a lot of depth/mind games to be had in hitting a ball back and forth(as silly as that sounds).  Is it another Nidhogg?  No.  Another Divekick?  ehhh, maybe, depends on whether you hated Divekick for its gameplay or for other reasons.  To me, this seems like a similar concept to Divekick, though better polished, different gameplay mechanic that is more hype because of its faster/more deep nature, and a better presentation.  This game is definitly better than Divekick, but still holds the similar concept of simple but hard to master.In the end, yes, I do recommend this game.  This game will entertain you and your friends for a long time.If I have not answered your questions/concerns about this game, leave a comment and I will edit the review.""I am terrible at this game.10/10  Would noob rage again.""Edit: Nominated for The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award.

												Lethal League is a 2D fighting game, but unlike traditional fighting games you don’t use fists or kicks or any kind of combat moves. You pick a character and hit an anti-gravity ball against your opponents to beat them, the ball speeds up and bounces harder off the walls with every hit it takes, reaching unbelievably fast speeds - particularly when one charges the hit. All this makes it hard to avoid the ball and also hard to hit the ball. Each player has a certain amount of lives per round and lose them by getting hit with the ball. Once all your lives run out you’re done, and the round ends when there’s only one player left in the game.Pros: ++++ The game is good fast-paced fun, the latency is very comfortable.+++ The audio and visual aspects are very befitting of each other, especially the effects and art style.+++ Music is awesome, fits perfectly with the battle atmosphere.++++ Hitting the ball feels solid, firm – making for immersive projectile battles.++ Different modes: FFA, TEAM DEATHMATCH+++ Different characters make for different moves/special moves.+++++ ”No weak♥♥♥♥♥♥”Bittersweet:-/+ Gameplay is easy to learn but hard to get good at, practice makes perfect and provides hours of fun.-/+ Speed cap for the ball is ridiculously high, might as well be infinite which makes for difficult but impressive moments.-/+ Limited player choice, however they are very stylish and have different colour schemes.-/+ Player base has cool people, but it’s not very big.Cons:-Not really anything negative about the game, if I had to name something it would be the lack of characters and small community.Final Opinion:All in all this game is addictive, exhilarating and a massive amount of fun. It’s as if Super Smash Bros, Pong, and whichever traditional 2D fighting game you can think of had a baby. Easy to pick up, hard to master. Art style, music and gameplay go perfectly well together for an amazing fighting experience.Liked this review? Join my group and follow my curator page. "

												This game is the perfect example of how you simplify a fighting game to its roots while maintaining all the depth and metagame intact. Lethal League is a 3 button game (Hit, jump, stall/counter) where your goal is to hit your opponent with a ball, the ball builds speed with each hit and you have to be in the proper position to hit it back to your opponent while trying to not get hit by it.There's a limited roster of characters but all of them are very unique, no character plays exactly the same which makes every matchup very fun.This game also has a superb sountrack and an amazing netcode (GGPO) with up to 4 player online multiplayer.This is one of the most fun games i've played in a really long time, however there is a huge con to all of this, the game's asking price is $13.99 USD...Sure, that isn't much, right? it's the price of ""X"" or ""Y"" so it's not a big deal yadda yadda. However the game is truly lacking on the SP content, there's only a mode where you play against the CPU and a pretty barebones ""Challenge mode"" (Arcade mode) so there really isn't much outside of playing it against other people and even thought that's the main point of fighting games there's so many other games (Skullgirls, KOF) that at least cover a bare minimum of a Story Mode and a proper Arcade mode while also having very good tutorials (Skullgirls) and really good challenge modes (KOF Trials) both which have been in multiple sales for less than half the price of this game.The game is virtually dead on arrival, very much like Divekick (Even though Lethal League is incredibly better on every single aspect). It's almost impossible to find an online match because no one really is playing it and the price tag does not help the situation and it's a HUGE shame, because this could've been a smash hit that everyone would be talking about.Bottom line, this is one of the best fighting games you could ever play if you're either a veteran or a beginner, but i can't recommend this to everybody because the current price tag is not really justified, wait for a sale and buy it, maybe then more people will be playing it after they discover how amazing this game is.

												This Game is fantastic, if you have Friends!I played this Game with my Brother and Friends, and we had a lot of Fun for 13 Hours. The Gameplay is very simple. You choose a Character out of six.Every Character has their own ""Ultimate / Special Attack"". For example one Character can eat the Ball and spit it out somewhere else. It's getting really hard, when the Ball reaches a speed out of 10.000+Multiplayer is quite dead, even after Hours of searching. So if you have Friends, go for it!If not... Think for yourself it its worth it. Story Mode is kinda... meh...*RECOMMENDED AFTER ALL*			"

YouTube™ Video: Lethal League Review 

			Views: 1,138		

			Episode 48 - Lethally addicting Review by 16-Bit In today's episode we take a look at Lethal League! Make sure to check out written reviews and plenty of other well done reviews and recommended games...		

HISTORYReleased in August 2014 and developed by Team Reptile and based off the flash game prototype bearing the same name, it’s Lethal League!As of this review the game is on version 1.07.12STORY AND WHAT YOU DOIn Lethal League with no real context or story, you play as up to 6 different playable characters who face off against each other in an arena in up 4 players at once, the goal simply being to hit the ball at one another to knock them out.With each consecutive hit to the ball, it gains speed, which can make things very interesting, very fast.The game also has a number of different modes from online, to versus, to an extra menu with different things such as a tutorial, training mode, as well as the challenge mode which basically acts as the core single player aspect to the game itself.THE GOOD-Quick and easy to pick up and play gameplay-Addicting-Different game modes and options to choose from-Competitive and great multiplayerRight off the BAT pun intended, one of the best aspects to Lethal League is the pick up and play nature of the game itself, it’s easy to learn and you’ll be smashing your opponents in no time flat, the game features an easy to learn tutorial to help new comers out, but the concept itself is pretty easy to wrap your head around.It’s also extremely addicting, the first time me and my friends started playing this together we couldn’t stop, the quick matches and nature of the game itself lends to the addiction factor big time and it works beautifully.The gameplay itself is fairly unique, almost reminding of pong on steroids with a gorgeous art style and blazing soundtrack to boast its intensity, the game is easy to play, but definitely takes some serious skill and good timing to master it.But easily the BEST aspect to Lethal League is the online multiplayer, whether you’re in a team or free for all, Lethal League truly shines when you’re pitted against your friends as you battle it out and make the ball reach absolute insane levels of speed.You’ve also got access to a variety of different game options if you’re hosting, from changing the speed of the ball itself when you hit it, to a big ball mode, team versus matches, free for all, and a mode where you basically have to hit the opposing team’s target at each end of the map to gain points.The character roster as well all have their own unique abilities as well to mix things up, and you unlock different skins for them as you progress the game and earn “experience” allowing you to level up and unlock the different skins for them and overall really adds to the addictive nature and replayability of the game.Over all, we had TONS of fun playing this for hours on end and is easily one of the best competitive games I’ve played in recent memory.THE BAD-Few core game modes to choose from (not much content) *Minor*Honestly I don’t have much to talk about here, Lethal League does what it does very well, I had no major issues or never felt something was unfair or over powered and the game is very well balanced. Probably the only issue I have is the lack of content, despite just talking about the different game modes to choose from, Lethal League outside of what I mentioned doesn’t offer much for core game modes.If you’re looking for some beefy single player content, you won’t really find it here, sure you’ve got a versus mode where you can pit yourself against the PC at different difficulty settings, as well as a challenge mode that you can beat with each character to gain some achievements but honestly this felt nowhere near as compelling or interesting as the multiplayer.As for the multiplayer, once you’ve played as each specific character, and played the different maps and fiddled around with the match settings a bit, you’ve pretty much seen everything this game has to offer you.But to be honest, this is all pretty minor and I can easily see myself coming back to play this.THE UGLY-Not graphically impressive, it’s quite literally based off a flash game after all-What it lacks in graphical fidelity it more than makes up for it in art style-Amazing soundtrack-Odd game crash during multiplayerWhere we discuss the graphics, soundtrack, and technical aspect of the game.Lethal League won’t wow you in the sense with amazing textures and particle effects like some games might, which is obvious considering the game looks like something you could find on Newgrounds.But what it will wow you with is the fabulous art style it boasts, from the different scenic backgrounds, to the character models and general presentation, what Lethal League lacks in big budget impressive graphics, it more than makes up for in its amazing art style and presentation.And one thing that really adds to this is the AMAZING soundtrack, this is easily one of the best sound tracks I’ve listened to in a game in a long time, the art style and soundtrack over all give me almost a Jet Set Radio vibe, and I love it.However, not everything is perfect, we did have our fair number of freezing issues during online matches, as well as the odd game crash or two in my 5 or so hours I’ve spent with Lethal League, but overall the gameplay itself was bug free during our experience and most of the crashes and freezing were during the online match making.FINAL THOUGHTSAs I said earlier this is probably the most fun I’ve had yet so far with any indie game and I highly recommend you give Lethal League a try if you’ve got some friends looking for a fun, unique, and competitive game, despite some minor technical issues we had, playing this was an absolute blast.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												10/10 No weak sh*t.Ok let me start talking seriously here, it's you vs a bot or a local friend, or an online person. there's a ball you can hit and by doing so the ball will change to your color and it won't hit/hurt you, on the other hand it will hit and take out your opponent if he/she doesn't hit the ball back at you. Every time you hit the ball it will increase it's speed/velocity, and hitting it in a certain way doubles the speed, so it will become more and more challenging and hard to hit the ball.Also, this deserves a notice of its own, the online playing is amazingly smooth, just fantastic. Hard to notice any lag.Personally, I'm loving the game, and i think it's well worth it, but it's basically match after match playing against 1 to 3 other opponents. there is a ladder challenge single player mode which will get harder and harder the more levels you finish, with some changes like going against a huge boss character, or the ball being huge. That's what's in the game, and if you think that's not enough to make you jump and get the game, then wait for a sale, but if you want to go by my opinion, i think it's well worth it for the fun and challenging experience you will get from it.More info here[www.ksalue.com] "

												SUMMARY: Its like smash and pong on crack. Very fun to play with friends or on local co-op. Gets more and more intense as the round goes on and both parties are screaming their asses off as the balls pierces the fabric of the earthEXPLENATION: Its a fighting game where the player chooses their select character each with its own special ability that is more or less balanced. The object of the game is to hit a small ball back and forth, changing its colour to the player that touched it last, if a player who is not the same colour touches the ball (as in not hit it) they die and lose a life, zero lifes left and the player is eliminated. Now heres the kicker, as the ball gets hit more and more, it gains more and more speed, extreme amounts of speed one could say and the colours of the game starts changing to match the intensity and the speed that the ball is going at. All while a kickass soundtrack plays in the background. Definetly a fun game although I wish more people played online :(			"

												There are many games which have multiplayer mode and only a number of them ends up as global hits which are played by lots of players and in which connection issues are rarity or aren't issues at all. While this game isn't this kind of title yet, I need to say this game is a little gem which should shine really bright in near future. But let's start from the beginning.Lethal League is a game where your main goal is to control ball and hit it as hard as possible to hurt your opponents and knock them down, while also using unique techniques limited to each of playable characters. Sounds simple, right ? But I assure you it's not that easy, especially when the movement with which ball move after few hits may reach RIDICULOUS speed and hitting the ball itself (or counter it by pressing X which is a kind of a block which stops the movement of it) may be a really tough challenge. This game will test your dexterity, reaction time and timing, which are really crucial here. So in other words I would call this title easy to learn (it's literally jump, hit and block buttons), but hard to fully master. Graphics are as simple as in screenshots, but I need to say they are still estethic and look nice with bright colors mixed in (I also like in overall the style game brings with interesting characters). And I need to mention one more thing, which is really, REALLY crucial - music. My gosh, music in this one is one of the best things I heard in gaming history. Electronic climates created by really talented artists like Grillo, zeroSCAR or Klaus Veen fits the climate of the game perfectly, while being perfectly well made. I would say music alone in this game make this game worth to purchase, it's THAT good. To sum it up game is really well made flash-like game with incredible competitive potential. Game basics are simple to learn, but this game has this crucial element, which make it fun, challenging and mostly work like some sort of a drug, which forces you to play it as much as you can. I give it 9,5/10 as I feel 5 characters is kind of a small numbers of possible options if you ask me. But I assure you - this one will become one of the best gaming hits ever. At least it has great potential to become one.			"

												Fast-paced non-traditional fighting game that relies less on player execution and more on getting into the head of your opponent. One of the freshest takes on the genre I've seen in years. Fantastic fun in both 1v1 and 4-player free-for-all.It offered some of the most competitive moments this year, and is easily one of the best games of 2014.			"

												Game is fun!I've seen many call this game ""Smash Brothers meets Pong"" and that's roughly correct. Lethal League is similar to Smash titles in its ease of access (being pretty simple to understand and play) and its competitive depth. Its similar to Pong in being focused around the ball, the one lethal element of the game. You and your opponent(s) are striving to hit this ball, tagging it to yourself and making it lethal to your opponent until they successfully hit it back (or miss, get hit, and die). The ball will steadily speed up after every hit as long as players remain alive, ramping up the intensity. Continue this until all but one player have lost all their lives, and only the champion remains!Local and online multiplayer are supported, with 2-4 players. You can play 1v1, FFA, teams, or strikers (similar to soccer) modes. There are a couple different ball types you can try as well to mix things up, along with general options (stock count, time limit, etc.) There is matchmaking, but it's not skill-based (the community isn't large enough to support skill-based matchmaking anyways).The game is great if you want to just hit buttons and peg your friends with baseballs, and also great if you're looking for something with competitive depth. While the execution barrier is fairly low, you have a lot of freedom of movement/options, and the smarter and more experienced player is still favored to win. Regardless, the game does a great job of hypeing the player up, as hits take progressively longer to complete as the ballspeed increases (giving the feeling of them putting more and more force into the ball), and the screen starts to shake, the background changes, 'impact distortions' occur, all the colors go negative, characters get speed afterimages, and finally the stage goes completely white if you get the ballspeed up enough. Each notch of this progressively makes things more intense, especially the first time you see them!The only drawbacks to me of this game is the playerbase size and occasional crashes. This game has seen occasional boons in playerbase (usually following sales), but on average there's about 60-100 people playing at a time. Games go fairly quick, and you usually won't be waiting more than a minute in quickmatch queue (at least during peak EU and NA hours), but you may run into the same people multiple times. What you don't have in quantity, though, you do have in quality. There's almost always a few people in the group chat willing to play, and many are experienced players who are welcoming and helpful. The competitive LL community is, overall, one of the best communities I've been in.The other drawback is a recurring crash that can occur in multiplayer games of more than 2 people. This only occurs maybe once every 6-7 games, but it can get annoying fairly quick. Fortunately, the game loads almost instantly, so getting back in the action is fast. It's annoying but manageable.I highly suggest you try this game out, especially if you have friends to play it with. $15 may be a bit expensive for some (it was well worth it for me, 450 hours of play and counting), but I would definitely recommend this to anyone at $10 or less.

												This is by far the best ""casual"" fighter in the market. Excellent sense of depth hidden in simple mechanics. When you start out it seems fairly simple like the prototype, but the bunts, supers, and character movement really make the game engaging as time goes on. For example Sonata feels extremely weak early on because of her slow hitting motion and jumps. These are offset by the best early super which is you can get easily while staying high in the air and getting free hits in. Candyman's strengths are obvious with his portal super grabbing easy games off of weaker players but tends to not be as powerful as players get better. Raptor has solid movement and has one of the best late game supers by (fully?) removing the hit stop animation making it sometimes impossible to hit back. Switch seems to be a mid game character with fast movement and his super which redirects the ball. His super has some good potential to net kills fast but becomes much harder to use later in the game. Latch is an all game character with the most broken super which can almost always guarantee kills after 128 speed. The only problem is the online which suffers from is lack of players for non-American/European people. The entire time spent writing this review I have been sitting in queue and still haven't found a game. If you don't have local friends to play with or a tournament scene for this you might not have the best time with this game.			"

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  Fun game with unique art style and a pimping soundtrack, gameplay is simple but addictive yet I can’t fully recommend it. Lethal League focus is on multiplayer but it's somewhat dead as finding a match can be problematic, only after looking for people in the forum or chat was I able to  play online so bear that in mind.The game also has a single player mode but it's pretty short.  Español:  Juego corto y entretenido con un estilo visual único y una banda sonora bastante guapa, es algo simple pero altamente adictivo. Desafortunadamente no puedo recomendarlo por completo pues Lethal League se enfoca principalmente en el multiplayer el cual parece estar algo muerto, en varias ocasiones estuve buscando una partida y no fue posible jugar en linea hasta que busque por otros medios (foros, chat) y eso señores, es una patada inmensa en las bolas.En definitiva, un buen juego mas no lo compraría a menos que tuviese amigos con los cuales hacer co-op.

IntroductionHave you ever wondered what it would be like for superheroes (or beings with superpowers) to play various sports? Perhaps dodgeball? Or baseball? No doubt they would take things to a new extreme, with smashes that break the laws of physics and reaction speeds at mere fractions of milliseconds. Lethal League is a little like that. Imagine Super Smash Brothers but on PC and instead of fighting, you're essentially playing dodgeball in a fairly small arena. Things can get real chaotic, but boy is it fun!GameplayLethal League combines sport, with a highly competitive and slightly strategic game that requires you to have good timing, or a good understanding of angles. This does not mean it's a math or physics game. It simply means Lethal League has an extremely high skill ceiling whilst having a very low barrier to entry. Anyone can pick this up with their friends or play vs bots and have a really great time, and those with the best reaction times can duke it out for the top spots.Your goal is to eliminate all your opponents, by hitting the ball into them. The standard game mode allows you to tag the ball which puts it in your colour and makes it pass through you (so that you don't hit yourself). You can also disable ball tagging for a much more challenging experience. Each time you hit the ball, it goes a little faster. You can hit it up or down depending on whether you are in the air or on the ground. If you smash a ball (air hit) the ball speed is doubled. Now this is where the real fun comes in. If you manage to get 3 or more smashes in, the ball speed is going to ramp up so fast that it quickly becomes a blur of lines in various angles. This is where a knowledge of angles can help you to overcome your opponent. The maximum speed seems to be capped at 1 million. As you break through known speed limits, your hits gradually have a longer delay but the ball speed is so fast that it becomes ALMOST impossible to react to it. You're likely going to struggle with this until you learn the timing windows for various hits, and it is oh so satisfying to counter a ball ping-ponging across the room at over 100,000 (whatever the speed measurement is) into your opponent.You can also bunt the ball in various directions, temporarily slowing it down and allowing you to regain control and possibly change its direction. This is used in combination with regular hits to quickly rack up speed or pull off an unexpectedly fast smash, because bunting a ball reduces the delay on a hit (even the insanely fast ones that require 2-4 seconds of delay) to almost nothing. CharactersThere are 6 characters to choose from and each of them have distinct strengths and weaknesses. Some of them can jump higher than others, some can jump off walls indefinitely etc. This alone would make it fun, however the devs decided this is not enough so they added special abilities. Where do I even begin? Special abilities can drastically change the course of a match in an instant! By hitting the ball you gain charges of your special meter. At 4 charges you can use the ability by double tapping the regular hitting button. Each character has their own unique move that you'll discover on your own, and it adds so much more fun to the game along with previously mentioned elements.VisualsThe visual style of this game is unique, but still quite simple. Characters have some lovely color variations and stages are fairly well designed.AudioI absolutely love the music in this game, as well as the other assorted sounds in the game. When you break the sound barrier, the hit sounds are so impactful and sound like rockets or small bombs going off.Other ThoughtsRunning at 60 FPS is pretty much required to be able to learn your timings properly. The first time I ran the game, it had some very weird frame drops that may have been an issue on my side, but it initially turned me off from the game. However subsequent play sessions did not have that issue, so it must have been some other unrelated issue. The game is very lightweight and runs flawlessly.I would have liked to see more characters in the game, as 6 is hardly a roster of characters compared to other games in this kind of genre. I mean not even the Scout from TF2? That's an iconic character that would have been perfect here.SummaryLethal League is the type of game you can pick up at any time and play with friends. Even as a solo player, you'll find that the bots are quite challenging, and there's enough single player content to keep you interested for even a couple days. The gamplay is fun and rewarding, and is definitely worth checking out if you're interested in a fun, fast, sport-action game.8/10 - The game that destroys friendshipsIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Lethal League is a what you get when you cross a fighting game with dodgeball in all the best ways.  Players jockey to control a small ball, hitting it around the screen in an attempt to knock out eachother.  Every hit on the ball speeds it up, and it quickly moves from an easy to predict slow moving projectile to a streak that bounces around the screen, ricocheting off ceiling, walls, and floor to take out players.  This simple set up leads to an exciting and incredibly fun game.  Unlike most fighting games, there are no long lists of special moves to learn and memorize (each character has slightly differnt angles they will hit the ball at, and a special move that can be powered up during play and used, but no difficult button combos are required for any moves).  This makes the game very intuitive and easy for players to jump in and start playing, even if you are not into fighters.  However, the interplay between player and their specials does lead to a suprising amount of depth in the combat, and learning the timing to intercept balls as they come off of other players at higher speeds will take practice.  If I had any criticisms for the game, it would be that the simplicity of it can be a double edged sword.  Games can start feeling repetative during long play sessions.  Game options can extend this a bit, but in the end most feel gimicky and I find myself losing interest after 30-60 minutes.  However, that being said, I still find myself coming back to this game to get in a few quick rounds against friends when we don't have time for a long playsession, or to finish out a night of gaming.  And that is where the game shines imho, quick bursts of action and excitement when I don't have the time to spend hours playing.This games perfectly fills a niche in my gaming library.  It is well worth the price (and worth getting a few extra copies for your friends as well).  An unreserved thumbs up from me.			"

												Lethal League (LL) is the quintessence of competitive arcade gameplay. Being completely free of over complication, Team Reptile have fortunately channelled the most special elements of the nostalgic games of the golden era, where a sole focus on gameplay has driven design and development. The result being a game with no apparent story, not character progression, and no cheap ways of making you feel as though you should be playing the game, instead it slaps you in the face with a fresh take on Fighters, that is plain and simply, unsullied fun.The gameplay and structure of LL lends itself perfectly to the resolution of longstanding disagreements (1-on-1 Fights), bouts of personal worth and glory (4 way FFA), and also to bond-building exercises (2-on-2 Team Fights). The beautiful thing about the simple gameplay is it works so well not only in the hectic 4-way FFA, but also in 1-on-1 combat, where the simple mechanics eventually boil down to a game of whits, where you are more trying to force the other player/s to swing at the wrong point, or you are trying to think and act fast enough to catch them off-guard.That long winded jargon can be distilled down to; this game is perfect for playing with friends, and that is exactly how it should be consumed. This game has one of those qualities where if you get served too hard, you will hate it; so take it in with friends and you will instantly see the gratifying outcome of learning together, while also pulling off some badass manoeuvres resulting in you all squealing like manly Girl Scouts. We have not tried it in Online Play as my internet services would make the game run like an interactive slideshow. But we can safely say that by grabbing a few ales, a few controllers, and huddling around your PC, you will be parting in the finest display of competition I have seen in a video games since Mario Party 64.Team Reptile have not given this game a huge amount of content, with 5 characters and 6 Levels, BUT, the content in the game is so perfectly polished, I question whether the development team is really as small as they say. We would love to see more playable characters and levels in the future just to give the game that bit of spice, but where it stands now is a testament to where AAA game development falls short in modern game development; where such heavy focus on being the next money making machine makes games lose that…specialness.From a developer’s standpoint this game has soul, you can feel the love that went into it when you play it. So get it, you won’t be disappointed.3 / 3 Worth Playing-C "

												It is one of the most addicting games I have played in ages. Best described as Battle Pong on Steroids with a hint of baseball, the aim  of the game is to bat the ball back and forth between you and your opponent until one of you slips and gets hit. For such a simple premise it is really a challenge when battling against other players and CPU's, thankfully though with the very tight and responsive controls, any mistakes the player would make would entirely be their fault and not due to the game.

												Lethal League is a truly hillarious, over the top take on pong and fighting games.The general concept is to defeat your opponentt and reduce their stocks (think smash bros) by smashing them with the ball. The ball will deal damage to your opponents after you hit it, but can be hit by them, which can then cause it to deal damage to you. As in pong, you keep rallying the ball back and forth, with it getting faster and faster until one of you is hit, at which point you lose a life and the ball resets. What sounds like a very simple concept rapidly becomes a hillarious series of ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥"" moments in which the ball is going so incredibly fast that you'd think it impossible to hit, but then someone does, and it gets even faster.Throw in a bunch of colourful and creative characters and stages, along with an incredible sound track, and some very fancy and flashy visual and sound effects that wouldn't feel out of place in an Anime or Manga, and you get an enjoyable and hillarious experience.Would reccomend playing with friends (up to 4 player) for added hillarity and fun.

tl;dr -> Ultimate dodgeball - but with objects to hit the ball at your opponents - that can get to Dragon Ball Z-level speeds and ruin friendships forever.My brother was really interested in this game, so I got it for him - eventually, I got interested enough from watching it to buy a few copies for myself and some friends. If you like projectile-based fighting, multiplayer frenzies (both local and online), flashy animations and trick shots, and simplistic (but very fleshed-out) gameplay mechanics, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are very good - the character models are nice, and the level of detail put into the visuals is well-done. The music is set to a single, level-specific track, but the playlist is pretty good and matches the atmosphere of the game. The special effects are fantastic, and the background will even turn completely white once you achieve ball speeds nearing 1 million. The controls are easy to learn, but mastering them will take a bit of time. The practice is great for getting you familiarized with the gameplay mechanics, and there are many well-written guides available to teach you the advanced techniques. You can play with a controller, and I personally prefer this over the keyboard. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, the most challenging thing being how quickly you can understand the timing mechanic. The main goal in Lethal League is to hit your opponent with the ball. By default setting, you cannot get hit by the ball if you've hit it last (indicated by the ball's outline matching your assigned color). If a ball is ""tagged"" with your color, it will pass through you and any allies, however, you can also hit it again. Each time you hit the ball, it's speed will increase and your special gauge will fill up by one bar (to a total of 4). Bunting the ball and hitting it before it touches a surface will fill your special meter by 2 (and serves other purposes). A bunted ball will have a pinkish outline, indicating that it is a ""free"" ball - anyone can hit it, and it is not hostile to any player until it is hit. When a burst (round) is over, the first player to have been knocked out in the previous round will have possession of the ball, indicated by a matching outline around it. After a few seconds, however, it will lose it's outline, allowing anyone to hit it.At higher speeds, hitting the ball will cause a hit lag animation, where your character will stay in one spot to charge up, then release the ball. During this time, all other characters can move around to try to position to hit or dodge the ball. There is a mirrored ball-release gauge at the bottom center of the screen, which is a critical tool to use - it will show you how long you have before the ball is released from the hit lag animation. Traditionally, at slow speeds, the gauge will fill up super fast. Bunting is important because a successful hit following one will shorten the ball-release gauge time. The different characters telegraph their moves, so bunting during a long rally (back-and-forth hits) can really help you throw off people's reaction time if they're expecting you to hit a ball immediately back at them. Each character has a unique special, and many of them allow you to do things like bypass the ball-release gauge time (causing the ball to be released regardless of the gauge status), redirect the ball's trajectory (especially dangerous when people have positioned in an angle to catch the ball), or even curve the ball (super awesome trick shot potential). One character has a special that allows the ball to phase through the map (so instead of bouncing, it will continue through and appear on the opposite side). The characters also differ in playstyle, and you will notice things like quicker hits for some, higher jumps, longer hit range, etc. One character, Sonata, can double jump. Raptor, who cannot double jump and has a fairly short vertical range, compensates for this by being able to wall hang and wall jump. Latch can, well, latch onto the wall, moving up and down freely. If you and an opponent swing at each other at the same time, you will clash, pushing each other backwards and stun-locking you for a few seconds. This is especially dangerous if you are stun-locked by an opponent who just finished hitting the ball forward because it will instantly hit you. This game really rewards skill and patience - if you just spam the hit/bunt button, you will get hit by the fall often because it takes time for each character to recover from the hit/bunt animation, leaving you vulnerable. You can even do something as face the wrong way, and will meet a sudden (temporary) death.There is a singleplayer challenge mode you can do, which has the same opponents regardless of which character you pick, and a unique boss match. The game's AI is fairly challenging, and at times seems to randomly turn up to a ""destroy all hope in the human opponent"" rating. There are other variants to play, like a score attack (versus stock), and a team scoring game where you have to hit a target on the opposite side (you cannot hit each other in this mode).Overall, the game is extremely fun, and will be enjoyed by people who like projectile-based fighting.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Legal League is a wonderful simulation of the Legal systems of many countries across the world. The league of five Lawyers meet up day after day battling for justice in their countries, and working nonstop to get the just jurisdiction. All the Lawyers have wonderful story lines, such as Raptor Attorney at Law constantly struggles due to being young, however in the court he is very agressive and a wonderful Lawyer. The hardest part of Legal League is when you travel to Somalia and try to convict various people of their horrible war crimes on behalf of the United Nations' Legal Department. This is evident as Somalia has not had a fully functioning government and thus Legal system since 1991.Overall Legal League has show a great deal of the world's Legal Practices and thus recives a 10/10 for being such a great and interesting educational experience. Thank you, Legal Team Reptile for creating and expressing your works in the legal side of the world.			"

												I've been playing this game for a decent amount of time now, and I have almost nothing but positive things to say about it.- It's a very fast paced game with a rather high skill cap to achieve.- Easy(ish) to learn, and all around fun to play for hours on end.- A somewhat small yet very friendly community towards all players.- Community held tournies keep the playerbase intact and alive.- The game can be played with either keyboard or controller with only slight advantages using the controller.- The game is brutal with it's matchmaking and really lets you know what you're in for when you face opponents with over 1k+ hours. (It's okay to suck, you'll just suck less next time!)- The game runs smoothly consistently; ie: no sudden frame drops, no visual tearing, etc.One of the only bad things I've found about this game so far is how long it can take to get a matchmaking game sometimes, but the gameplay definitely overwhelms that con so it all works out in the end.I give this game an honest 10/10, it's really a great game but sadly doesn't have as much of a player following as I wish it did.

												This game is just INCREDIBLE. Fun to play, takes about 30 minutes to get to the ""decent"" level of skill, but a lot of time to master the game, giving it some replayability. The characters are diverse, each with their own unique special moves and hit angles, and best of all, it's getting constantly updated and rebalanced if need be. The community is constantly growing, and the game has a great competitive side to it. 10/10, GOTY 2014 for me. It's just that good, try it, seriously.			"

												This game is a wallball-esque/tennis combat system where you time your swings and kick the ball back to the opponent in hopes to hit him before he has time to respond to the ball. Sounds too simple to be fun, right?Wrong. My friend and I bought this game as a bit of a joke but ended up playing it for hours. I had raw fun while playing this, the kind that you experience only rarely in quality indie titles like Hotline Miami, Skullgirls, etc.With 2-3 different game modes, 6 characters, and 7 maps this game is quite small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in strength. The characters are unique, with mildly entertaining special moves for each of them. The maps each have their own music (The music is surprisingly good in this game). The most interesting aspect of the game is the D-pad+Y shout out. You can taunt, or interact, with your opponent by stating,""Oops"", ""Wow"", ""Nice"", and ""Bring it on"". The tricky part of the game is the ball speed. As you paddle back and forth the ball speed will increase and you'll have to be much more instinctive about your response times. I saw an achievement for 1,000,000 ball speed. My friend and I have only gotten to 1,000. Is it a good game? Yes. Is it worth $10-$14? Not really, but you can always get it on sale. "

												Lethal League is an extremely fun fighting game up to 4 players fighting with super balls to take down each other.Seriously it's very addicting if you have friends to play with.You have ""Free for All"", ""Team Deathmatch"" and ""Strikers"" modes, and several characters to choose from and each character has unique movements and abilities.However, i never found a multiplayer game, i think the game is dead, but had a lot of fun playing it locally with my nephew.Technically the game is smooth, bug-free and very stable while the graphics are cartoonish.Single Player: 7.5/10Multiplayer: 10/10Totally Recommended to buy it if you have friends, if not check the forums to get players to play together.

												It's like a mixture of Mortal Kombat and Pong, a great game for playing with friends; however, most people I know own a MAC and I can't play with them.  It is still a ridiculously fun game, even if none of your friends can play with you, especially 1v1 battles.  And when the ball speed is to the max when you start, it's even more difficult and fun.100/100 Would buy again.(Note: There used to be 5 characters to choose from [Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Latch, and Sonata] and they've added a 6th recently [Dice] and it's a great addition for people that have a difficult time playing this game.  Down side is that his jump is half of what others are and he's quite slow.  His ability is like a Yo-Yo movement.)GET THE GAME WHILE IT'S HERE!!!			"

	TL;DR: I reccomend Lethal League to people who have friends that also play Lethal League. Pros:-Good music-Easy to learn, hard to master -Good controls-Fun with friendsCons:-Small bugs-Boring single player-Not updated too often-Matchmaking is clunky-Costs too much (I recommend waiting until this game is on sale or buying it off G2@)Rating: 7/10Honestly I have had some of the best times with my friends playing Lethal League. The feeling of tying all of your hits together and taking out your opponent is one of the most rewarding feelings I have ever had in a video game. This game has been fun (for me) ever since the day I got it to now. Although I love this game very much, I don't think it is for everyone. If you don't have any other friends who own this game, then I think you should either buy the four pack, or just not bother buying the game. The single player is boring and repetitve and the matchmaking isn't really worth your time due to connection issues and bugs.			"

												A unique, fun and quirky fighter where the aim is to hit your opponent with a ball you hit at them. You could argue the premise is simple and the lack of story mode may put people off.

												TL:DR Whether you're good at fighters or not, this game is extremely fun and easy to learn, BUY IT!Alright. Welp. This game is GREAT. Lethal League is a unique fighting time that's pretty much based on timing. You must hit the ball in time so your opponent doesn't kill you. You're basically playing ball tag with your opponent. You try to hit the ball to each other and whoever hits too early or doesn't pay attention will get hit and die. I'm kinda bad at explaining this so maybe it doesn't sound like the funnest game, but trust me ITS FUN! You know one thing I really like about this game? Call me a f*cking casualist if you want, but, ya know, it takes more Rythm than skill. This game you can ACTUALLY WIN without hours and hours of experience. Unlike Skullgirls, where you need to watch sh*t to learn combos or take hours to learn on your own or even been born in the 80s playing fighters at da arcade. The thing is about Skullgirls, if you go in online with a couple hours of play, you'll get the sh*t beat out of you. I guess what I'm saying is, I'm not really a fan of arcade fighters. My issue with dem arcade fighters is the crazy♥♥♥♥♥combos you have to make to do powerful attacks. But, anyway yea. BUY LETHAL LEAGUE!!! It's a competitive and Casual game!			"

												I eye my top-heavy crocodile opponent from across the field as a purple coated ball begins to spawn between us. He points his stout towards the object, knowing that he's going to smash this into my cold, yellow face. Not today, Latch. Not today.The ball materializes and we rush towards it. My cane is already extended for an over the head smash to hit the reptilian foe below me. Time seems to stop as I connect with the latent power resting within the ball. The crocodile was quick to react and seemed to stop all momentum I had with my initial hit with one tap of his nose. The ball soared over me, and before I connected with the ground the crocodile was already rallying the ball against a wall, hoping to power up another devastating blow.I rush to intervene in his sadistic wall-ball ritual, tapping the ball out of his rhythm at an upwards angle. Furious, Latch's eyes glowed red towards the cane that brought an end to his games. He claws the wall in front of him and begins to climb up its structure to catch up to the ball. Flipping outwards, he catches the ball in his mouth and my world goes dark. All I can see is the crocodile's burning descent from the wall, his eyes reflecting my helpless yellow face.I jump upwards to dodge the assult, but Latch releases the saliva-covered ball angled with precision towards my jump peak. The counter at the bottom reads into the hundreds, and I know that reflecting this is going to take all the luck in my thin smiley-faced bones. My cane relexively reaches in defense, and this was all the luck I needed. The ball's momentum is reversed right at the crocodile's pointed nose. But what stops him from doing exactly what I just did?I try to land a second hit and throw Latch off his prediction. He sees this and attempts to outsmart my own moves. We negate each other's attacks with a twang of cane and stout, the ball landing just behind Latch. I see it bounce off the corners of the rotting arena with bliding speed, and I process that it's coming right back at me. Cane out, I bunt the ball directly downwards into where the crocodile attempts another intervention. His tail whips around, but he is too early.The ball lightly bounces off the top of his scaly skull, and he's sent below the arena.BURST 2, BEGIN!			"

Verdict: BUY. THIS. NOW.OverviewI'm not one for Fighting games. I never could get those complicated button combos down.I liked Super Smash Bros. in the first two iterations, but from Brawl on it just felt like... something was missing.And while I like the simplicity of games like Dive Kick, the limitations on the controls limit my interaction with the game itself and thus my investment.This game is like all three rolled up into one perfect dodgeball.The mind games and opponent prediction of a fighting game is all there, and immensely gratifying.The controls are simple move, jump, hit, and bunt, which are easy to learn but hard to master.Each fighter has their own special move and strike ranges, some of which are easier to pick up than others, but everyone has a ridiculous skill ceiling to reach. (Don't believe me? Play a few online matches and you'll see what I mean)And the chaos. Oh my GOD the chaos. Imagine Smash, but you're fighting 100 people at once, all of which with reflectable projectiles that one hit KO. There are hilarious times, frustrating times, intense times, but most of all fun times.This game is essentially Pong, where your paddle has to swing, and can move around the entire map, losing a point only when it's struck.It doesn't sound like much, but *everything* in this game is executed perfectly.I have roughly 5 games that I will recommend whole heartedly, because I believe they are perfect experiences.This game has been in my library for about half a month, and it has been newly added to that list.MusicThe sound design, just force-feeds you adrenaline. Once the ball starts reaching hundreds of miles per hour you can feel the strength behind each swing with the crashing sound effects alone.Each stage has a unique song that just gets your heart pumping. Even in the oddball case of Candyman's ""Ordinary Days"", you focus a lot more simply because of the music and quite simply play better.GraphicsThe graphics look like something from the early 2000s.But don't let that take away from the visual design. No it's not using 4k 2440p ""oh my god I can see his nose mole"" realistic graphics. It doesn't need them, and it is better for it. Each map is based around a character and provides a little more insight into their background WITH the background. And god forbid you reach ball speeds above the thousands... Let's just say, that's a trip.Plot(As of my writing this) There isn't much (if any) story presented to you through the multiplayer or the Challenge mode (though there is a final boss), but this game really doesn't need one.You're playing this game to smack around your friends and strangers with thousand mile per hour dodge balls.Really, does it matter if there is no cosmic threat you have to defeat, or evil artifact you have to obtain? Hell no. Even if there was, you'd still smash their face in with the dodge ball all the same.Final WordsWhy are you still reading this? BUY THE DERN GAME AND START PLAYING!!			"

												It's a fighting game, it's pong, it's expressive, it's a party game, and I never would have bought it if I wasn't introduced to it at a party, because trailers have a really hard time capturing why it's so much fun.The gameplay lives off a wide array of mechanics that are all accessed by basic movement keys and 2 more buttons. Different characters don't only have unique special abilities as showcased in the trailer but also subtle differences in the way they move, their hitboxes and the angles in which they hit the ball.At first, the game is just enjoyable without having any clue of what's even happening, but once you play more you get an idea of how high the skill ceiling actually is. To become a master, you don't only need high knowledge of/experience with the characters and perfect reactions, but also the ability to read, surprise and outsmart your opponent.			"

												This game is great AND YOU SHOULD GET IT RIGHT THE F*CK NOW!!!Seriously though, it's an awesome game which you should definitely check out. This game follows the style of several recent games in that it is easy to learn, but hard to master. The gameplay is very addictive and each of the 5 characters (with a sixth coming soon) has its own special, movement style and angles.Furthermore, you will find that the community is very friendly and eager to help a newbie. If you do not find a match online you can usually find someone to play with in the Lethal League chat (found on its community hub page).A prototype can be found on the Lethal League website here:http://lethalleague.reptile-games.com/prototype/Take note: as it is a prototype, not all features of the full game are implemented in it.Overall I would definitely say this game is worth its price!

												Just started to play and what I've seen so far is enough to recommend this game to everyone.Mechanics are rock solid (amazing with every game mode, from 1v1 to 2v2 to free for all)Animations are really well done and backgrounds are just as simple as fitting to create a futuristic (cyberpunk) atmosphere.Music, just a cherry on top, blends perfectly and gives a certain enjoyable rhythm to the matches.It's not a ""deep"" fighting game, but it is definitely a unique one (no other fighting/brawling games have a dodgeball-like mechanic as far as I know) and even if there are no fancy commands/moves it gets pretty technical with angles/feints/tactics.Again, strongly recommended to everyone.

Although the game has a lot of problem, the community has slowed down nowadays, and I don't really play it that often anymore, it's still one of the best games I have ever spent my time with.			"

												There’s so many addicting yet simply games, but Lethal League isn’t one of them. It’s a sort of a dodgeball, or squash rather, where you hit a ball (obviously) which gets faster and faster any time you score a combo. Your goal is to K.O. your opponent. Easy to pick up rules makes a very simple concept for the game that anyone’ll understand, but it gets so old very quickly at the same time. Seriously it’s just boring as hell. On top of that, there’s hardly anyone playing this game online. Still there’s a local multiplayer I guess, so if you’re into that kind of games than you’ll be happy about it. I’m certainly not, so I’m not recommending it.			"

												I usually don't write reviews after only playing for a half hour. I tend to wait until I've either finished the game or played a large enough portion before getting bored with it to come to a valid conclusion.What I've seen of Lethal League so far indicates that it's a supremely addictive game. Simple mechanics are coupled with a very high skill ceiling and lots of challenge, which over the course of each match escalates to ludicrous heights. Each character has a very different set of abilities beyond simply tossing the ball around and the combination of a variety of characters make on-the-fly strategizing against them very entertaining. Overall I'd give Lethal League a big recommendation on that front.However, the connection issues are what absolutely kill this game for me at the moment. Every other match doesn't load properly and I've had plenty of disconnects even with players in my own region. Mind you that I have a 15MB/s (that's Megabyte, not Megabit) connection where my PC is connected via Ethernet cable and not Wi-Fi, so my connection is about as solid as you can get, and yet it still fails around 50% of the time. I won't cry about connection times since I realize that they're mostly down to the amount of active players, but once a connection is established, it's amazing how bad the game manages to function. Not to mention that when the game does actually hang up and never starts the next match, you can't simply get out again by pressing Escape or any other keys. You have to terminate the application with Alt+F4 every single time this happens, and it can get very annoying. I was fortunate enough to have bought the game with the recent Humble Monthly, so it cost me around $1.2, or 90% less than what's asked for here on Steam, which is why I'll keep the game and give it a mild pass in order to see if the issues get resolved in the future. But for the record, had I paid full price, I'd have refunded this broken mess immediately. Which is unfortunate, a game with solid mechanics and the potential for hours of fun is shot in the kneecaps by terrible connection issues.If the issues get resolved, I will edit this review to reflect any future changes made here.

												So basically you start out hitting a ball at pretty decent speeds until one of you gets their skull cracked open. The longer you survive the more ridiculous it gets, to the point where I'm pretty sure I was hitting the ball at light speed. It was terrifying and hilarious. Especially since faster hits have weird visual effects on maps (like, on one map all the windows break, an eclipse happens, and rioting mobs appear.) that then vanish when the ball is no longer being hit. Its like youre ripping into an alternate dimension.I should mention that my first (and so far only) play session lasted two whole hours, but felt closer to 30 mins. So, overall, pretty damn great. I usually complain a lot in reviews (...on Amazon. I rarely do Steam reviews) but I don't even have any complaints about this.If you're unsure about buying it, just do. You won't regret it.			"

												Well now that I'm almost at 30 hours of game time I might as well say something about it. I purchased this game right after seeing Total Biscuit and friends play this in his first impressions video for this game. It looked like exactly my kind of game, and it is.This game is awesome. There are many things about it that will remind you of Super Smash Bros. I'm an avid super smash brothers fan. I problably have played close to 10,000 hours of Melee. This game just hits the same spots for me. The controls are so tight and the animations feel so right. Every stupid little combos and moves you concoct feel so satisfying and absolutely amazing. The gameplay is very simple but to master it would take a very long time. At first it might seem like the game is just luck, but believe me, there is no luck involved and you will know immediately when you are playing against someone of a higher skill level than you.It seems like the game does not show you how to do anything other than the very basic stuff. You've got to figure stuff out for yourself in Lethal League and that is a great thing.I will be playing this game for years to come for sure and you should too!			"

												One of the most insane fighting games I have ever experienced. Lethal League takes the fun party game feel, and colorful roster of characters from Smash Brothers. And combines it with the the most intense dodgeball game in the universe. The only way for you to knock out your opponent is to smack the ball in to their face. Bring in 2 or 3 of your friends and you have fun in its purest and hypest form. The single player is a challenge, especially the final boss. You'd really have to dedicate yourself enough to actually become skilled enough to stand toe to toe with it (or you could actually be good at video games, which I am not). Overall a fantastic fighting game, and if there is even a chance of it getting a sequel I'm all on board.			"

												Fun game, can be crazy at times and I recommend using a controller because of the better control, only good for playing online against people because bots are terrible. Each character has a automatic modifier on the ball after hitting the ball 4 times. Dont play against bots because they are crappy and cheap to play against, they should remove the achivments for it and really fix them so they are more human-like on the reactions. ie. Following the ball and always hitting it the split second its near them. If you ever get stuck hitting the ball back to eachother when standing next to the harder level bot they will ALWAYS hit it the second the ball starts to move so its almost impossible to win, if you put a high level bot v bot in that situation the game wouldn't end.)

Each character has a special ability, a 'parry', and some sort of jumping ability.

												Lethal League is a competitive ""battle pong"" that has you take control of one of six players, each with different styles of play, in a deadly game of tag-by-baseball. The fundamentals of the game are pretty simple: Hit the ball and it changes to your color and will damage every enemy player but not yourself. Bunting will send the ball upward and give you a chance to reposition for a better attack. Any time you hit the ball you build up a super meter that will allow you to perform a special attack once filled. The majority of strategy in LL revolves around two things: hit meter/lag, and angles. You'll need to pay attention to the hit meter at the bottom of the screen to know how much longer it will be before the hit lag ends and the ball continues on in play. Knowing when it will re-enter play will allow you to position yourself accordingly and begin your counter attack. Another important factor is being aware of the angle the ball takes (or will take if you can predict it) since knowing that will allow you to take control of it with your own strike or avoid getting knocked out. Lethal League basically has two modes spread across several categories: Versus (Online/Local/Challenge) and Strikers. Versus is the basic game mode where you have a limited number of life stocks and the game ends when you or your team run out of them. Strikers puts you in position of a goal that you must keep the enemy team from hitting with an enemy-charged ball. There is also a point game in the challenge mode which is like versus but you play until one player gets a set number of kills.Since the game only has six playable characters, six stages, and really just two modes (only one of which seem to be played online: versus). You'll probably find yourself running out of things to do without having a bunch of friends to play with. Not to mention the online community is rather small and it can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes just to find a match, and when you do find a match, having any kind of lag between the players can make some rounds pretty difficult as the ball bounces and hit lag can become downright unpredictable. There are definitely some fun times to be had when you get matched up with a decent opponent, though.I would recommend grabbing this game somewhere around $5 or cheaper to really get your money's worth. It's not a bad game per-se, it just needs more content.			"

YouTube™ Video: Lethal League - 4 player bonanza on Steam 

			Views: 742		

			This game is excellent fun, and gets pretty chaotic with 4 ballers at once. First match is with a highly agitated ball setting, 2nd match is more how it usually goes. Players are my nephews and me.		

No really. If you need a fastpaced, short but addicting game that's playable with 4 of your buds, or some strangers online, this is for you.Lethal League is comparable to a game of tennis or pong. Except totally insane and chaotic. And you aim to kill your opponent with the ball instead of passing them. While there's order in the chaos, nothing is more fun to get the ball speed up to insane heights and hope you survive. The game rules and controls are simple and to the point; hit the ball, bunt the ball and jump to avoid the ball, while trying to hit other characters with it. Each of the 5 characters has their own specific special abilities.There might be a learning curve when it comes to timing your shots and being able to track the ball the faster it goes, but with practice comes alot of fun, and when you master it, it gets EVEN BETTER. It's recommended to play with friends, locally or online, but randoms can be fun too if you find the right guy.GGPO, this game's online component, is a little more tighter than done with Street FIghter 3: Online edition, altho sometimes you notice people dying yet not, but the game is so fast you don't care anyway and adjust accordingly.If there's one slight I would give this game: Not too often, It can and will crash at a certain point, persumably one of the characters specials will hit the ball and might crash one of the players out of the game. It's a sad thing too, because other times it won't happen and gameplay flows fine. I'm expecting this to be fixed in an upcoming patch of some sort.All in all, an excellent fun and simple game that gets deeper the more you get into it, and a great way for a bunch of buds to spend some time smacking each other in the face with high velocity balls.Yeah.8.7/10			"

The game itself is very simple in execution and content. You hit a ball back in forth until one of you gets hit, but heres the catch.The ball doubles with speed everytime. Every hit you do will take longer and longer with the hit lag and bunting...Don't even get me started on the amazing drug that is bunting.I can drop out all of this game because you really need to play it for yourself.

Everything about it feels good to do, and even when you're at vastly different experience levels from your oponent you can get a win that doesn't feel unfair for either side.It goes about eight layers deeper than the trailer shows - specials, parries, bunts, clashes, it's all good and it all works together  seamlessly. The community is still figuring out how to really go nuts with them, but they're finding better and better tech. Get in here.			"

												There's not a lot to say about Lethal League. And that's by no means a bad thing, I wish I could say a lot of things about this game, because I find it to be one of the better PvP games I've played in a long time. The game is simple: think of it like... racketball, with an anime escalation twist. Battle Pong. The game gives you a good amount of option, the characters are varied, and the game is simple enough to pick up and play, but just complex enough to really garner competitive spirit. My only complaint (and this goes for a lot of fighters, as well) is that certain parts of the system are not presented to player really at all. But other than that, Lethal League is a well crafted game that's simply a blast to play.			"

Overall, this is highly recommended if you are looking for a great multiplayer fighting experience.			"

												Ok, so first of all, some people think that the actual content that this game offers doesn't really justify it's price. I don't share this opinion, the game isn't really all that expensive and while the content may be limited, there is just a lot of fun to be had with it. However, I still strongly urge anyone who considers buying Lethal League to get some friends to play this game with and buy a 2 or a 4-pack and split the price. The multipacks are pretty good deals, and the game is the most fun when you are playing it with a friend anyway.Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about why you should buy this game, because you absolutely should.Lethal League is a projectile based 2-D fighter with an interesting, kind of jet-set-like style to it. It features a surprisingly good soundtrack that really complements the gameplay as well as the overall feel of the game. Lethal League actually has very few mechanics, yet still provides a decent amount of depth, so it is pretty easy to pick up while being able to entertain and challenge you for a long amount of time. Basically, the goal in this game is to hit your opponent with an anti-gravity-ball which will cause them to lose one life instantly. You can hit or bunt the ball in various fashions to make it reach ludicrious speeds and bounce around in crazy patterns, and believe me, it's just mad fun. The sheer insanity of the gameplay paired with the incredible soundtrack and cool visual just makes it a blast to watch or play. There are currently six characters which differ in mobility and special moves, as well as the angles they can make the ball travel at.The game doesn't really offer all that interesting offline modes, but it's most enjoyable in multyplayer anyway. You can play free for alls, team fights and 1v1s. Lethal League, just like Skullgirls, uses GGPO and it results in super smooth feeling online play.So, if the concept sounds at least a bit appealing to you and you have someone to play it with, you really owe yourself to pick it up, especially since there are not much games that are able to offer you a similar expierence out there.

												Crazy fun game with friends.I first played the original ""Browser"" version of this game a long time ago.It was insanely fun then, and even more so now that they have an updated version.The concept is simple: You hit a ball back and forth, trying to knock out your opponent.The catch? The ball picks up speed. BIG TIME. There are 5 characters, and each have their own special abilities and characteristics. Some can cling to walls, Double jump, Skate along the ceiling, Wall jump, etc.They also have a special meter that builds up after 4 sucessful hits, allowing your character of choice to unleash their own unique special move.The animation is fluid and the environments are well done, and each stage comes with a pretty sick sound track.But back to the speed. The game picks up insanely quickly, and you can easily lose focus and get frustrated amidst all the chaos. (I had one friend who was turned away from thisgame just because it was way too fast paced for him)It's not for the weak. Haha.It's easy to master the timing, but I can also see how some people would think the game lacks depth beyond just hitting a ball.  I personally find great satisfaction going up against another person who can keep up.The matches are extremely exciting, and this is a GREAT party game to play locally.Hours upon hours of fun if you're competitve, and love getting hyped up during intense moments.Highly recommended... The price is debatable as far as content goes, but I'm the type of person whodoesn't care too much for that.			"

I'm expecting this to be fixed in an upcoming patch of some sort.All in all, an excellent fun and simple game that gets deeper the more you get into it, and a great way for a bunch of buds to spend some time smacking each other in the face with high velocity balls.Yeah.8.7/10			"

												Crazy fun game with friends.I first played the original ""Browser"" version of this game a long time ago.It was insanely fun then, and even more so now that they have an updated version.The concept is simple: You hit a ball back and forth, trying to knock out your opponent.The catch? The ball picks up speed. BIG TIME. There are 5 characters, and each have their own special abilities and characteristics. Some can cling to walls, Double jump, Skate along the ceiling, Wall jump, etc.They also have a special meter that builds up after 4 sucessful hits, allowing your character of choice to unleash their own unique special move.The animation is fluid and the environments are well done, and each stage comes with a pretty sick sound track.But back to the speed. The game picks up insanely quickly, and you can easily lose focus and get frustrated amidst all the chaos. (I had one friend who was turned away from thisgame just because it was way too fast paced for him)It's not for the weak. Haha.It's easy to master the timing, but I can also see how some people would think the game lacks depth beyond just hitting a ball.  I personally find great satisfaction going up against another person who can keep up.The matches are extremely exciting, and this is a GREAT party game to play locally.Hours upon hours of fun if you're competitve, and love getting hyped up during intense moments.Highly recommended... The price is debatable as far as content goes, but I'm the type of person whodoesn't care too much for that.			"

												this game... is amazing my only problem with it is the connection i have with most people online and that barely anyone plays in my region and it accasionally takes forever to find a game,but on the other hand if you have a few friends to play with this game is a blast to play even if it takes forever to get in a match cause the singleplayer is enough to keep my attention this game is one of the amazing games on steam and deserves more love and attention! :D			"

												The best way to describe Lethal League is as a simplification of the fighter genre mixed with a projectile game.Divekick did that in that fact that instead of having complicated moves, it became more about timing and mind games.Lethal League does that in your positioning, your timing (although its pretty easy to get good at that), and your ability to change things up enough to freak out the opponent. If you don't mess with their head, and you're both good at the timing and positioning, the game can go on for a long time.It's a lot about making less mistakes than the other person. In fact, that's pretty much how you win.But enough about that, why should you play this game?PROS:- Easy to just play, easy to get good at, but relatively hard to get REALLY good at- Can keep you busy with just the singleplayer, but has a decent online matchmaking system, as well as local and online 4 player, similar to smash bros- Good at not frustrating the player, the most fun way to play if the best way to win- Gameplay that manages to be fast but also slow??? It works, trust me- Awesome music- Funky art- No weak♥♥♥♥♥♥br>CONS:- Small character roster (Also a pro because it's easier to learn everything)- Much lower skill cap than other fighters (doesn't mean it can't be competetive)- Really grindy level up system (at least you get rewards for every level in the form of colour palletes and different balls which change up gameplay)In short, if you like unique fighters, or Jet Set Radio, or both (like me), this game should be appealing to you.Also a good party game.

												I said this might be the next Windammers, but it's a whole step beyond that. It's a 4 player party with working internet play that is essentially the time-tested gameplay of Pong mixed with the brutality of Super Dodge Ball at supersonic speeds. It just feels super satisfying to hit that ball, it's pure excitement. It's also got actually challenging challenges, working Internet play using the GGPO framework (which is a marvel in itself) and some unlockables.It's light on content, but when what you have is SO GOOD, i'm not going to complain about that. A nice simple game with askill ceiling of practically infinite height, the ultimate duel for bragging rights. If you take home 1st in this you will KNOW you earned it.			"

												This game is the perfect definition of 'Easy to learn, hard to master'. The playability is amazing, the fun with friends is unparalleled, and the epicness of making a great play, whether by chance or skill, is absolutely rewarding.This game made me scream and jump out of my seat as I have never before. Getting the 'Grand Slam' achievement left me without words, as it was epic.It only lacks a stable server base to play online, and also the capability of parting up with some friends on my local PC and then going online.Other than that, it's amazing. The drawing style, the soundtrack, the characters and their looks and abilities, the replayability, the dystopian-urban future. Excellent.Definetly a game worth buying.Would love to see an animated series of this 10/10			"

												If you're considering buying this game to play it with friends, stop reading reviews and just buy itIf you don't have fun, I will personally come to your house and refund you the money you spentFun party game with a very competitive multiplayer scene, similar to Smash BrosVery simple, intuitive mechanics - it's easy to pick up and play, while maintaining a high skill ceiling (see: candychaining)Some mechanics aren't presented with much depth in the tutorial, so consider spending a while on Google to learn about parrying and Switch's specialOnline will have you disconnect once or twice before you can connect to an opponent, but once you find a game it can continue as long as you like, I've had one 1v1 go on for a few hours - relatively short queues, 3 minutes is considered a long queue imoAll that being said, I picked up this game recently and have been hooked ever since, and I don't see myself losing interest any time soonEDIT: One year post-review and the online is mostly dead. The only people playing right now are the die-hards and tryhards, which makes it difficult to learn the game. Pick it up if you plan to play with friends or if the game is on sale.			"

												Lethal League is a competative baseball/dodgeball hybrid that supports up to four players in one match. With each strike of the ball, the speed is doubled, sometimes even quadrupled (and in serious cases, maxed at one million). Maybe you and a few friends sit on the couch and hit the ball back and forth a few times. Maybe it's you and a stranger online. Regardless, every hit and dodge are anxiety and adrenaline riddled. With more than four friends who've enjoyed this game with me, we've never experienced any rage or upsetting losses, only awe at how insane it is to bunt the ball at such ridiculous speeds and then pelt it right back at the poor soul who bashed it towards you in the first place. Each character has a special ability that makes the matches all that much more interesting once they've filled their blue bar. Beware Dice and Candy Man. There's also an interesting secret character which you can play as in local matches; I'll let you google the code for yourself.My friends and I give this game a 10/10 for competative shenanigans and I give it a 9/10 for the minor network bugs. Worth the price, but I'm glad I snagged it on the humblebundle for a buck.			"

												Good gosh this game is one heck of an amazing ride.Your goal of the game here is to use your ball (it becomes ""yours"" when you hit it) to take out your opposition. What starts as a decently paced back and forth versus match quickly can turn into a frantic twitch batter as the ball flies feverishly across the sceen with each successive hit. The game is smooth and intense, the controls fluid and responsive, and I without friends now. Totally worth it. Do yourself a favor and get this game! Better yet, do everyone a favor and get the 4 pack so more of us can game together.Gosh I love this game, and you will too!!			"

												Simply put, this game is smash bros and pong combined into one. instead of fighting eachother, you hit the ball back and forth increasing its speed with every hit, eventually killing an opponent. It instantly became my favorite game after the first round!. Best played with a controller. Candiman ftw<3			"

												A very underrated little gem on Steam. The characters are diverse and are all mechanically unique in someway, but I find they are all equally fun to play as. Surprisingly a lot of depth and skill is needed to master the seemingly simple gameplay here as well. Online works pretty well too but a decent ping will be needed, but is nonetheless very fun with friends. Give it a shot!			"

												You like baseball? You like Street Fighter? Then this game won't be for you. You hit the ball in the middle to gain control and it goes just a bit faster.Someone else hits it, it gives them control and goes even faster.The ball can go up to 1 million in speed and then it can't go faster.You will get used to the game after a while and you might choose Switch. The most complicated person you can play on this game.Everyone has a special move by double tapping the hit button when you hit it. But with Switch you have to double tap the jump button to do his special. It's complicated like that.With this community base also, it's worth every dollar you use for this game.Just pick it up and play around in Challange mode or vs your friends or just strangers.Either way you'll have fun. The sound track is also amazing to listen to while playing this awesome game. Just pick it up.			"

												Definitely my pick for the most fun to be had in a game in several years! Lethal League is a projectile fighting game which starts off easy to learn, then quickly scales into either a chaotic mess of fun to be had with your friends or a very interesting competitive experience. With a gameplay system that's much deeper than it would seem at a glance, Lethal League provides fun to whoever is willing to give it a shot, and I'd highly recommend you fork out a few bucks for the game that keeps on giving.It being a multiplayer game, it does suffer from the usual lack of opponents issue when you want to play against someone in less than ideal circumstances. The art of the game certainly isn't particularly striking or unique in any way, just enough so to serve its purpose. Lethal League also suffers from a lack of diverse content, but that's forgivable as what content there is has been polished to a mirror shine.Every shortcoming listed is easily ignored in favor of a Higher Fun, and you should definitely get in on the chaos everyone's talking about!

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.			"

Bunt to throw off your opponent's timing. When the ball starts picking up speed, there is a hit pause that keeps growing and getting more intense warping reality as you do it.

												The craziness that can unfold in this projectile fighter is off the charts. Despite having simple controls, the mechanics go deeper than just ""hit the ball and hope for the best"", as each fighter/character/baseballer has their own unique tricks and twists to their swings that tend to make things tricky in regards to retaliation. There's a distinct 90's-era style about it, as anyone who enjoys Jet Set Radio would be able to pick up on almost immediately; music included. It's also a blast with friends. A great game and experience.			"

												This game is.. good?It's fun when you start but I find it's not a very good ""fighting"" game.  It makes you hit a ball around the arena and if you get hit with the ball your out for the rest of that round.  It doesn't get interesting in anyway and every match feels the same, but the ball will speed up one speed unit.. thing(?) every time you hit it and the speed doubles if you do a ground shot.  It is defenitly a good game to play if you have two or three friends to play with because the game is very boring with only a CPU, and you will almost always win against the comp.  The one thing I do enjoy about this game is that each character DOES have unique features that actually can make a big difference in a battle.  Raptor has a wall jump, Candyman can jump real high and has slightly faster fall speed, and Switch can ride up the wall and on the ceiling if you run and jump at a wall from half way across th stage.  ALSO!  The stages.  They are all the same lay out like in most fighting games, since the game is kind of a, Cool, hiphop, street kinda game, the music is always fitting(if you understand any of those descriptions).Like most games on a modern platform there are a lot of Acheivements.  They all are pretty easy to unlock but one or two might force you to play more than you want to.  This game also has a level up system like in Injustice.  They only unlock extra skins for characters and maybe once or twice a new ball type but it isn't anything special.  The basic arcade mode is featured in this game, but feels very dull due to the small 6 character roster.  There's also an online battle mode but I NEVER found any one online so it's a bit nonexistent.I really wanted this game to be good but the small roster and some what dull gameplay don't really grab me.  But the music is very good and is a small thing to keep the maps fun.I think that with all considered, I give this game a rating of 5/10.Hope you can get more out of it than me.			"

												Personally i think the game is fantastic to play with friends. I saw videos of people playing it on youtube and loved what i saw. got in and realized... the game is hard, still fun, but hard. the ball goes up to high speeds quicklyso an average game is around 3-4 minutes at 8 lives starting at the default speed. there are a surpriding amount of strategies you can come up with after you figure out the nuances of the characters. my personal favorite is the fact that if you aim up with Switch (the robot skateboarder) the ball goes up and behind you, the hammer girl (Sonata) can change the ball direction with her special, my girlfriend even enjoys playing the aligator (Latch) because she can play ""Walligator"" by clinging to a wall and swinging until she can grab the ball and shoot it at me point blank. all in all it's a good gamesolid sound tracka ""challenge"" mode that reminds me of super smash bros classic 1P mode.art style isnt much at first but it grows on youminor connection issues in online multiplayerlocal multiplayer as well as onlineeasy to learn hard to master i would say (a lot of little details that make you better, but arent needed for casual play)-basics  - swing (hit ball, ups speed by 1) [aimable]  - bunt (knock ball up next to hit it gets bonus special meter) [aimable]        - once bunted the ball will move at a low speed but resume previous speed when hit by a player or hitting the ground  - parry (hit bunt during a hit to drain your special and knock back nearby players) [must be trying to hit the ball]  - slam (downward air swing that doubles the speed of the ball)specials and traits-candyman  - ball will teleport to the wall opposite the next wall it collides with keeping speed and direction, refreshed if CM hits it again  - candyman has no heavy falling  - candyman has the sharpest slam angle - sonata  - special hits the ball 3 times after release, can reaim the ball at these points  - has a double jump - latch   - can climb walls   - largest hitbox   - special eats the ball, carries it, and releases at speed it was caught - switch   - can scate on walls and cieling (limited time)   - upward aim goes behind him   - special is activated as a doublejump, if the ball hits switch during his kickflip the ball is hit by switch (counter) - Raptor  - smallest hitbox  - can bunt if ball is above him  - fastest hit  - special hits the ball twice and can change the direction of the ball on release			"

But the combination of a great concept, percise movements, and colorful world make this a must have for game night! ONLY downside I can state is the lack of characters. Six truely isn't alot.

												To start off. This game is defenitly different than your average 2D fighter. With a very simular aspect of a Super Smash Bros. game, It's A four-player game with a objective that's not beating up another player until their health gauge is gone. Instead your hitting a ball at intense velocities slowly creeping up in momentum until one of the players hits it back faster or is knocked out by the ball. This is where it gets insane. Each character, despite its low roster, has special abilities to either make the ball move faster or cause insane mix-ups on the other players. They all have simular properties to SSB characters: like fast falling, Dash Dancing, and floaties. The big thing that you need to learn in this game is not really the technical prowess, but learning the frames of the game, predicting where the balls is going to go, and timing every hit correctly. Aside from all this jibber jabber, this game offers minimal stuff to do aside from leveling up, unlocking skins, and comepleting a offline challange mode simular to a arcade mode of somesort. The online takes a while to  find any kind of matches including 1 on 1 or a free for all battle but I have yet to run into a  match where it's just miseriably laggy. If you want a hype, over the top, different 2d fighter game; play this, enjoy it with your friends or go online and smash some scrubs. I'd definintly recommend this game.			"

												The craziness that can unfold in this projectile fighter is off the charts. Despite having simple controls, the mechanics go deeper than just ""hit the ball and hope for the best"", as each fighter/character/baseballer has their own unique tricks and twists to their swings that tend to make things tricky in regards to retaliation. There's a distinct 90's-era style about it, as anyone who enjoys Jet Set Radio would be able to pick up on almost immediately; music included. It's also a blast with friends. A great game and experience.			"

												This game has to be one of the best 4 Player casual games out there on steam. Seriously, there is a real sense of competitive gameplay and smoothness in this game. I recommend this game to anyone looking for some quick free-for-all baseball action. Not that many characters to choose from, which is not really a problem for me but other people like fighting games with mor diversity. Overall 9.5/10.

												Lethal League is a super fun, Smash Bros style (not objective wise) game that is extremely fun with friends. Now, if you don't have friends, maybe you shouldn't pick this one up, as the BOTs are fun, but not near as fun as playing with someone you know. While playing with my friend, with other people watching, I heard many ""dude that was awesome""s or histarical laughter as someone gets hit by a super easy ball. The gameplay consists of hitting a ball back and forth between 1-3 other players, if you hit the ball last, it is outlined in your color and is lethal if it touches the other player. The other player has to hit the ball back to make it their color and to try and get you. This simple gameplay leads to hilarious moments where people get lucky shots and send the ball back even faster to the next player. The ball speed is really fast and sometimes hard to predict when you first pick up the game, so you can feel a real sense of getting better as you play the game. Super fun game, the AI is good, but not outstanding, pick it up if you have friends to play it with.			"

												short version: worth the buylong-ish version: great multiplayer game that brings smash bros to mind in it's relatively simple yet chaotic gameplay. the kind of game thats easy to learn and hard to master. characters skills leave a nice twist on the gameplay. awesome soundtrack. art is pretty neat, especially when the ball really gets moving. leveling system unlocks skins, which is nice, but nothing game changhing, obviously. overall just a pretty fun game for fighting game fans looking for something new and different, but i doubt that it would ever be played hardcore mlg like street fighter or tekken. one thing to note, however, is that i DID buy this with 2 friends, so i've been playing with them pretty exclusively; if/when i get around to trying more of the single player or trying random multiplayer i'll update the review, but i wouldn't count on it since i'll probably forget/am incredibly lazy.solid 8/10.

												How do I describe this game?.......Lethal leauge is how many peopke describe it, a mix between PONG and Super Smash Bros. The main idea is you and up to 3 other players hit a small ball that seems to lack gravity or air resistance inbetween each other. When you hit the ball it get's 'tagged' with your color, and if someone gets hit with the ball when it's not tagged their color they're out.There's a lot more to it than that, like stage sizes and hit angles, but if you want a fun little game you ca jump into whenever and mess around with friends, or compete in actual tournaments, this game is for you.It's also a very chaotic game, however. At times you and someone else will end up getting one of you out, then thinking 'What the hell just happened?' And usually it can be a bit jarrring, especially at higher ball speeds when the screen starts shaking and you have to factor in hit lag.Overall, I give this game a 10/10. Really. I have no complaints.			"

It is worth the money. the only problem i had was connection problems but that was like once every 6 games and only one person would drop from a free for all. I recommend to get this game with a few freinds for a lot of laughs and good times. The contorls are easy to learn and the game is pretty straight forward. Hit your oppenent with the ball but the really good thing about this game is the time dialation when the ball breaks the sound barrier.  Definately a fun game to keep you occupied for awhile.			"

												Based on the time I've played so far I have to say that it's entertaining to play by yourself, and with friends it's absolutely hilarious. This to me is sort of a mixture between the classic game Pong and the Super Smash Bros series.The idea of making a fighting game where you don't hit each other but instead shoot a projectile at your opponents is something I personally haven't seen before.If I were to complain about something, it would be that the game should have more playable characters and more maps to play on. The game has a lot of potential but kind of falls on the lack of updates.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a good laugh.Also, NEVER underestimate the speed of a ball.			"

To make immediate comparisons, it's like Smash Bros meets Pong meets Divekick, with a lot of emphasis on the Divekick part. The goal of the game is incredibly simple: hit the ball to gain control of it, try to smack it into everybody else. If someone else hits the ball, don't get hit and try to return the ball.This game is deceptively simple, and I say this because even though the mechanics are limited, the ways in which you use those mechanics are actually fairly deep. You have two main actions you can take, you can hit the ball or you can bunt the ball. When you hit the ball, you can either send it flying straight, or angle it up or down. Bunting the ball will slow it down to its lowest possible speed and pop it in the air, giving you time to place your next hit strategically. Every hit will cause the ball to gain more speed, making it harder to keep track of, dodge, and hit.But it turns out that there's WAY MORE STUFF YOU CAN DO THAN THAT. There are six ways of hitting the ball: on the ground, you can angle it up, down, or straight forward, in the air you can angle it up, forward, or spike it to the ground. Spiking the ball automatically doubles the speed, so you can cause the ball to get faster multiplicatively by spiking it over and over again. You can also bunt the ball up, forward, backward, or straight down, giving you options on where you place the ball. Hitting a ball at the same time as your opponent causes you guys to clash and bounce off each other. And with the five characters, each one has their own super move, swing speeds, swing arcs, and hitting angles. This game hits every fighting game requirement in respect to its depth, but at the same time it has that appeal that Divekick has of being super easy to pick up.The music is amazing in this game, all the tracks are taken from independent music creators, and it sets the entire tone of the game really well. Tracks are intense and fun, matching the frantic gameplay. The sound design isn't shabby either, as the ball increases in speed you hear sonic booms, the hit sounds are really nice and snappy, this game loves to bombard you with its really solid sound design.The art style is really great, too. Well drawn backgrounds that aren't too busy, but are still dynamic and change as the ball moves faster and faster. The characters are really interesting looking and are animated well, and your moves feel like they have weight behind them.As for the online, it works beautifully. Lag is completely unnoticable, when it works it works well. I did have occasional disconnection problems, but it was pretty negligable as me and my friends could jump back into the game really easily if anything went wrong and pick up with a fresh round.The only possible complaint you can levy against this game really is that the content is slightly lacking.

Each playable character is unique in their own way, along with skins you can unlock for further customization.

												If I had to give this game a tagline, it would be ""very fun, but really only if you have friends to play with"".Really, this game has the potential to be very fun. In the most basic game, you hit a ball back and forth; if it hits you, you're out for the round. And it gains speed at every swing. So pretty simple, really. And hilarious. You can play local multiplayer or online multiplayer, and there's also a single player mode (""challenge mode"") which is a set amount of matches against set characters and combinations. The game modes are free-for-all (just hitting the ball until only one player remains), team play (works best for four players, obviously) and strikers (hit the other team's goal instead of its players).The problem with this game is that if you're playing alone, there really isn't much to do besides challenge mode - which, honestly, I didn't find it as fun as multiplayer. You can try to search for matches online, but most of the time it's just unfruitful, and the online mode has quite a few connectivity issues, especially if the match has more than two players. The game also gets repetitive quite fast, and while leveling up does unlock new things, they're mostly skins for the characters (there are 6 different in the game) which are purely cosmetic and honestly not that rewarding.Still, if you have a couple friends willing to engage in some pong-esque shenanigans, maybe over a skype call or even some pizza at your house, I can recommend getting a multi-pack of this game and bash away.

												Personally i think the game is fantastic to play with friends. I saw videos of people playing it on youtube and loved what i saw. got in and realized... the game is hard, still fun, but hard. the ball goes up to high speeds quicklyso an average game is around 3-4 minutes at 8 lives starting at the default speed. there are a surpriding amount of strategies you can come up with after you figure out the nuances of the characters. my personal favorite is the fact that if you aim up with Switch (the robot skateboarder) the ball goes up and behind you, the hammer girl (Sonata) can change the ball direction with her special, my girlfriend even enjoys playing the aligator (Latch) because she can play ""Walligator"" by clinging to a wall and swinging until she can grab the ball and shoot it at me point blank. all in all it's a good gamesolid sound tracka ""challenge"" mode that reminds me of super smash bros classic 1P mode.art style isnt much at first but it grows on youminor connection issues in online multiplayerlocal multiplayer as well as onlineeasy to learn hard to master i would say (a lot of little details that make you better, but arent needed for casual play)-basics  - swing (hit ball, ups speed by 1) [aimable]  - bunt (knock ball up next to hit it gets bonus special meter) [aimable]        - once bunted the ball will move at a low speed but resume previous speed when hit by a player or hitting the ground  - parry (hit bunt during a hit to drain your special and knock back nearby players) [must be trying to hit the ball]  - slam (downward air swing that doubles the speed of the ball)specials and traits-candyman  - ball will teleport to the wall opposite the next wall it collides with keeping speed and direction, refreshed if CM hits it again  - candyman has no heavy falling  - candyman has the sharpest slam angle - sonata  - special hits the ball 3 times after release, can reaim the ball at these points  - has a double jump - latch   - can climb walls   - largest hitbox   - special eats the ball, carries it, and releases at speed it was caught - switch   - can scate on walls and cieling (limited time)   - upward aim goes behind him   - special is activated as a doublejump, if the ball hits switch during his kickflip the ball is hit by switch (counter) - Raptor  - smallest hitbox  - can bunt if ball is above him  - fastest hit  - special hits the ball twice and can change the direction of the ball on release			"

												One of the most interesting and inventive nontraditonal fighting games I've seen. Lethal League hides a ton of hardcore competitive depth beneath a deceptively simple and accessible surface. It also does an perfect job of making all the characters' playstyles and matchups feel unique despite the lack of large movesets, instead differentiating them through movement techniques, launch angles, and special mixups. An absolute must-play for both hardcore fighting game fans and casual players too.			"

												I found this really interesting game on YouTube, and it looked appealing. So I waited for a good sale, bought it, and just had a blast. When I first saw this game, I thought it was your average fighting game that you could land all the sweet combos with friends. But Lethal League is so much more than just a fighting game. With the only way to blast fighters out of the arena using a ball that is consitantly gaining speed, bouncing, flying, and who knows what in any direction, this game adds an intense factor in trying to stay alive.I remember when I had three friends over and we all had out own wired controllers, so I suggested we played Lethal League. I had already been playing a lot of it, and they had never played in their life. Now, when I thought playing alone was fun, I never accounted having friends to play with. But when more people joined the game, it becomes hilariously joyous, with a lot of tense moments of only two people left and the ball being at over 1000 speed, some people figuring out new attacks, or people getting that three-hit wipeout, mostly on accident.All in all, Lethal League is a sweat-inducing and creative game, bringing a fresh idea to the fighting game genre, and one that works incredibly well. The multiplayer works great, hit detection is fine, the characters are interesting, and the gameplay is just plain awesome.			"

												Based on the time I've played so far I have to say that it's entertaining to play by yourself, and with friends it's absolutely hilarious. This to me is sort of a mixture between the classic game Pong and the Super Smash Bros series.The idea of making a fighting game where you don't hit each other but instead shoot a projectile at your opponents is something I personally haven't seen before.If I were to complain about something, it would be that the game should have more playable characters and more maps to play on. The game has a lot of potential but kind of falls on the lack of updates.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a good laugh.Also, NEVER underestimate the speed of a ball.			"

The mechanics are elegant and well-considered (unlike Divekick), there's some thoughtfulness to the action (more than Samurai Gunn), it's easy to see what's going on, and fun for any level of play (the bad part of Towerfall), and doesn't lend itself to standoffs or ever get slow (Nidhogg). The music is great. It looks bad, but don't let that stop you. Netplay is fairly good (!). My favorite local multiplayer competitive game of 2014.			"

You will be spending most of your time in this game playing online, however, as there are few single player modes.

												Lethal League is pretty unique in the world of fighting games. The focus on a single projectile livens up an old genre with pong-like battle mechanics.Lethal League is also quite easy to pick up. The controls are simple, though there are a number of little tricks to learn, as well as ball trajectories. It will make a great party game, and it's a lot of fun for 2-4 players (the more the merrier IMO, though a good 1 on 1 can be intense).The solo 'challenge' mode is sufficiently challenging, and if that's not enough, you can also hone your skills against hard bots in versus play. As a solo player, you'll likely spend most of your time in online matches. My experience with online play has been good so far, often feeling as good as the local game.The art style is a matter of personal preference. I love it. I also love the way visual effects are tied in with the game's core mechanics, with distortion animations playing when the ball breaks certain speeds.The game's starting roster is small - just 5 characters - but they play quite differently. Some of the differences are obvious, like special attacks, jumps and special movement (like clinging to walls or skateboarding on the ceiling), while other differences are more subtle (like the angles of upwards and downwards strokes). There are rumours of more in the works, and it has been said that new characters will be added to the game in free updates.With all this in mind, Lethal League is a wonderful gem of a game, perfect for people who want something to play with friends, locally and online, and also great for competitive fighting game players looking for new ways to test their skills and reflexes without memorizing long combos.

												Lethal League is like a glorified Pong with a Smash Bros. skin. The basic objective is to knock your opponent(s) out using a ball that you keep knocking back and forth in between each other. Sound simple, yeah? But the catch is the more the ball gets smacked around, the faster it goes. Soon enough it reaches insane speeds to where you can barely keep up with it. The enviornment even changes as the speed gets faster and faster.The game is played in ""Bursts"", or rounds, and the ball's speed resets every round. The use of bursts make every round very intense and heart-pounding when the ball reaches the incredible speeds. Dare I say you may even be on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack is great, too. Definitely fitting for the game, having nice funky tunes with you. Take a listen sometime.The characters are pretty unique in their own right. They each have a distinct character design and personality that you can easily recognize. I'm sure you'll find someone you like. Also, each of them have special abilities that have different effects on the ball, such as Candyman's ability to make the ball phase through the walls.In short, Lethal League is a fast paced, blood pumping action fest that you'll surely get a kick out of. I highly recommend it.			"

												Lethal League is probably the craziest game I have played to date. The introduction of a projectile in a fighter is absolute genius and works extremely well to my surprise.The goal basically is to hit a baseball around the screen and hope it hits your opponent but after playing a couple of games you are able to start predicting where the ball will go. Player modes include free for all, teams, pvp and multiple opponents. The more players you have the more crazy the game becomes, it’s great!!! I also found we were starting to use teamwork to work combos a lot more, which is a good thing. At the start of each game the player/s can choose a game type and also have the option to tweak ball speed, stock amounts, hit tag on and off and game time limit. I guess this is basicly a customizable hard difficulty but I never found myself using it. This is probably something for the more advanced hardcore players because you can max out the ball speed to hilariously stupid speeds. Try this straght away.The use of the different abilities and the build up of the little bar under your stocks, is extremely satisfying when you pull out a planned play, as if that ever happens. Even though each character has different abilities and some characters abilities are easier to play than others the game still seems balanced while playing. It’s like they have designed the characters based on players skill and it’s easy to see this especially with the layout of the character select when setting up a new game. The game is resolved when there is only one player left with stocks  or if a player has the most stocks at the end of the time limit. Though I found the time limit was unnecessary in most cases because the game usually ends far before the time is up.The games controls are simplistic in the way that there is only a couple of buttons to learn before you can start playing. The tutorial explains the basic controls and lets you practice them after they show you although the tutorial was forced at the first opening of the game, which actually wasn’t that bad as it was only quite short. There is also a practice mode available where all the try hards can spend all day to practice more difficult moves and combos, don't be that person.My favourite part of Lethal League would have to be the game soundtrack and artwork. The music works well with the hit lag as well as the different stage artworks. This is one of the first things I look at when playing a game. Once it hit the starting screen when I first opened it and the music started with the announcer and his thundering voice saying “Lethal League!!” I knew this was going to be one of those games. Both the art style and the soundtrack to me give a 90’s american hip hop feel with some of the environments reflecting this. Yo! Like boom boxes and♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game gives that persistent feeling like all the individual components of the game gel together. "

												I played this back when it was a free flash game. When I saw a full version was on Steam, I picked it up immediately. It's an extremely addicting game coupled with some pretty awesome music I might add. Easy to pick-up, tough to master (though you can get lucky at times). You will be spending most of your time in this game playing online, however, as there are few single player modes. It's a great down-time game, though, as an individual match is only between 2 and 5 minutes each.9/10, very addicting, easy to play, awesome music, wish there were a few more single player modes.

												Lethal League is a fantastic fighting game that shines at its brightest with friends due to its accessibility, complexity, and consistency in providing incredible moments during matches. It plays like a fast-paced and dangerous game of ping pong and dodgeball where the ball will knock the stuffing out of you if you're hit.The accessibility comes from the simple concept of hitting the ball is good while being hit by the ball is bad. The tutorial  (located in EXTRAS) will take you through the basics and teach you enough to start smacking the ball around in different directions in different ways. You'll be exposed to the basic attack which adds only one speed to the ball, a charge up attack which can add up to x2 the current speed of the ball, and the down smash which always doubles the speed of the ball. You'll also be introduced to bunting which pops the ball up into the air no matter how fast it's going, your special which is usually the attack button during hit lag/pause (that freezing moment before you release the ball), and the jump button. You can also taunt or taunt + direction to emote. The complexity comes from all the subtleties found within the game. Each character has their own special moveset in regards to how they move, jump, and control their special. For example, Sonata has a double jump, Candyman have a floaty jump that reaches the top of the screen, while Latch can jump onto and then climb up and down walls. You can clash with other players resulting in one or both being stunned, bunt attacks, bunt bunts, control the direction of bunts, adjust your attacking angles, reduce the hitlag/pause by bunting before performing an air down smash or a charge attack so your opponent can't counter easily, and so on to the point that there are some helpful guides in the Community Hub that can improve your game once you're ready.As for moments, there are so many. One of my favorites happen to be this one match where I exchanged a ball going at 1,000,000 speed several times with a worthy opponent. Keep in mind the ball starts off at a default speed of 8 unless you change the settings. Here's a video showing some three player gameplay with different settings: 


YouTube™ Video: Lethal League Multiplayer 

			Views: 22		

			Just three matches.		

Finally, I'll mention the settings because you can drastically change the approach of how to play depending on what you choose. The game has two modes that I know of, stocks (think SSB) and points. Stocks rewards the player who's able to stay alive. Points rewards the player that can attain the most kills/knockouts. Ball tagging on means you don't have to fear the ball you just hit while turning it off means it's a danger to everyone at all times. You can also change the ball if you're at a high enough level. So far I've only played with the Big Ball which seems to have a bigger hitbox and a longer hit lag. You can also set the time limit or turn it off if in case you want to play for the most kills in five minutes or first to twelve kills.P.S. Play with friends or people. It's much, much less fun to play against the AI. You can use the in-game matchmaking or peeking in the Community Hub chat to find pick-up games if you don't have a group of friends for ball smashing.			"

												Fun and exciting to play, and to watch. While still being legitimately competetive. Lethal League is relatively bare, being a game about hitting a ball into dudes, with all the different buttons being different ways of hitting said ball, yet it is highly focused and concise.If you were one of those people who thought Divekick's bare-bones gameplay was quite a groundbreaking thing, but were bummed to discover the novelty wore off very quickly or otherwise never understood it in the first place, then maybe Lethal League will leave a better taste in your mouth. Even if you don't plan on playing it until you're one of the best ball-bunters online, you will be giddy with excitement everytime the ball accelerates to mach speeds and every strike is empowered with tense build-up. It is the most anime thing ever and it is great. (Disclaimer: This user does not personally invest in this application of the term ""anime"". Interpret loosely.)Here's to hoping Lethal League gets continued support, as well as sustained recognition.			"

												A great indie fighting game that combines the neutral game mechanics of 2d fighting games like street fighter and mortal combat, and the fun factor of the smash brothers series. Pros:A fun experience for people who enjoy fast paced, crazy fighting games.Relatively cheap, only $20 at the time of posting this.Great and helpful community.Cons:High skill ceiling, many people that are still playing have been for almost a year, and very good players with 400-500+ hours are usually going to be found in online matchmakingUnranked matchmaking, there's no ELO system of sorts, so you can play anyone from the range of a braindead squirrel, to a winner of 20 tournaments.Low player count in matchmaking, Lethal League usually does not have a high player count, and they're not always in online matchmaking, so you will sometimes keep matching up against someone you don't want to play against due to them being the only person online who you can play.Regardless, Lethal League is an incredibly fun and surprisingly complex fighting game, and if you're willing to put in the time and effort to get good, it can be a very self rewarding and fun experience.

												Lethal League is like a glorified Pong with a Smash Bros. skin. The basic objective is to knock your opponent(s) out using a ball that you keep knocking back and forth in between each other. Sound simple, yeah? But the catch is the more the ball gets smacked around, the faster it goes. Soon enough it reaches insane speeds to where you can barely keep up with it. The enviornment even changes as the speed gets faster and faster.The game is played in ""Bursts"", or rounds, and the ball's speed resets every round. The use of bursts make every round very intense and heart-pounding when the ball reaches the incredible speeds. Dare I say you may even be on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack is great, too. Definitely fitting for the game, having nice funky tunes with you. Take a listen sometime.The characters are pretty unique in their own right. They each have a distinct character design and personality that you can easily recognize. I'm sure you'll find someone you like. Also, each of them have special abilities that have different effects on the ball, such as Candyman's ability to make the ball phase through the walls.In short, Lethal League is a fast paced, blood pumping action fest that you'll surely get a kick out of. I highly recommend it.			"

												Lethal League is pretty unique in the world of fighting games. The focus on a single projectile livens up an old genre with pong-like battle mechanics.Lethal League is also quite easy to pick up. The controls are simple, though there are a number of little tricks to learn, as well as ball trajectories. It will make a great party game, and it's a lot of fun for 2-4 players (the more the merrier IMO, though a good 1 on 1 can be intense).The solo 'challenge' mode is sufficiently challenging, and if that's not enough, you can also hone your skills against hard bots in versus play. As a solo player, you'll likely spend most of your time in online matches. My experience with online play has been good so far, often feeling as good as the local game.The art style is a matter of personal preference. I love it. I also love the way visual effects are tied in with the game's core mechanics, with distortion animations playing when the ball breaks certain speeds.The game's starting roster is small - just 5 characters - but they play quite differently. Some of the differences are obvious, like special attacks, jumps and special movement (like clinging to walls or skateboarding on the ceiling), while other differences are more subtle (like the angles of upwards and downwards strokes). There are rumours of more in the works, and it has been said that new characters will be added to the game in free updates.With all this in mind, Lethal League is a wonderful gem of a game, perfect for people who want something to play with friends, locally and online, and also great for competitive fighting game players looking for new ways to test their skills and reflexes without memorizing long combos.

Lethal League is extremely fun in it's current state, however the developers seem to be of the mindset that what has been released is enough, and in my opinion, that is far from correct. More maps, more characters, and the option to add AI controlled bots to private matches is needed to keep the game interesting all around. It doesn't do anything amazing, but for the current price, and if you have at least one other friend to play with, it's well worth your time.			"

												Based on the time I've played so far I have to say that it's entertaining to play by yourself, and with friends it's absolutely hilarious. This to me is sort of a mixture between the classic game Pong and the Super Smash Bros series.The idea of making a fighting game where you don't hit each other but instead shoot a projectile at your opponents is something I personally haven't seen before.If I were to complain about something, it would be that the game should have more playable characters and more maps to play on. The game has a lot of potential but kind of falls on the lack of updates.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a good laugh.Also, NEVER underestimate the speed of a ball.			"

												short version: worth the buylong-ish version: great multiplayer game that brings smash bros to mind in it's relatively simple yet chaotic gameplay. the kind of game thats easy to learn and hard to master. characters skills leave a nice twist on the gameplay. awesome soundtrack. art is pretty neat, especially when the ball really gets moving. leveling system unlocks skins, which is nice, but nothing game changhing, obviously. overall just a pretty fun game for fighting game fans looking for something new and different, but i doubt that it would ever be played hardcore mlg like street fighter or tekken. one thing to note, however, is that i DID buy this with 2 friends, so i've been playing with them pretty exclusively; if/when i get around to trying more of the single player or trying random multiplayer i'll update the review, but i wouldn't count on it since i'll probably forget/am incredibly lazy.solid 8/10.

												For the love of all that is holy, don't get this game unless you want to lose any semblance of friendship you ever had in your life. I beg you, do not smack balls at speeds that put the sonic boom to shame into your friends' collective faces. I beseech you, do not bunt the ball out of their reach just to strike it into the earth and then bunt it for a special. I can only hope you don't taunt after every win that leaves craters in the ground, walls, and ceiling.For the love of God, only get this game if you hate happiness and companionship. You will find only misery here.			"

												My favorite local multiplayer / casual fighter game on the market, as I write this.It's simple enough for new players to pick it up and actually have fun immediately, with enough depth and split-second timing to keep things fresh. The mechanics are elegant and well-considered (unlike Divekick), there's some thoughtfulness to the action (more than Samurai Gunn), it's easy to see what's going on, and fun for any level of play (the bad part of Towerfall), and doesn't lend itself to standoffs or ever get slow (Nidhogg). The music is great. It looks bad, but don't let that stop you. Netplay is fairly good (!). My favorite local multiplayer competitive game of 2014.			"

Now this is a well-made party game.Sheet gets real man, this game is more fastpaced than trying to dodge the memes on 9gag when john cena came out. Trust me you do not want to be on a touhou in which John Cena participates. Not good for your mental health.Like, damn son, this is sick.Lethal League is an arena VS. in which you inflict damage only via ball. This just adds another layer of mindgames and cheeki breeki tactics.There are only 5 basic controls: move, jump, hit, ""bunt"" aka MINDGAMES (lob the ball for a very brief amount of time, goes back to whatever speed it was whenever it touches a surface else than ceiling), and of course, TAUNT.The ball gains speed by hitting it and it slows down by bunting it. But thing is, aerials *MULTIPLY* the ball's speed. Everything else just changes its speed by 1.When the ball's at high speeds it becomes a very intense dumbfest of epic.There are specials, by filling up a 4-stage gauge. Easy to do, and the specials are very dumb.Just with that, there's just a lot of tactics and tech shtuff you can come out with, characters have different perks, like double jump, faster weapon afterswing, more range, better lobs, more angle freedom on some moves...After all, it's addicting as all hell known and very fun to play. There's also a ""challenge"" mode (singleplayer arcade), which has a damn cool boss at the end.OST: Good, and very fitting.Character design: verry nice.Gameplay: Top Kek from Quebec. "

												Lethal League is an fun  game with simplicity. It takes a while to get used to it controls, if you have a controller it's a tad easier. Once you start out you'll be walking around aimlessly without knowing what to do. After a few matches you'll grasp how to move and the timing of the ball. After about an hour you'll be a pro practically. Knowing the exact patterns and timings of the ball, getting it up into the 10,000s. The game is extremely fast paced at that point. The music in this game is rythymically amusing and the secenery is good enough that it provides a good amount of stuff in the background. 10/10			"

												Do you like fighting games? Do you like fighting games that have nothing to do with fighting?Lethal league is an amazing skill-based game. The idea is to take out your opponents by hitting them with a ball which speeds up to insane velocities. It gets to the point where you just can't see the ball and react with enough time, you must figure out where it's going and time your hit correctly. The game has multiple characters, each with their own abilities, movement characteristics and angles at which they respond the ball which keeps the matches varied. The music is good, but the art is amazing. The scenary and the colours change as a match gets more hectic. There are also a couple of play modes. Death mach, team death match and some goalkeeping game. The only problem is that sometimes finding a match takes a while.I fully recommend this game. I totally love it.			"

A game of Russian Roulette where you and your competitor hit an antigravity ball back and forth at increasing speed until somebody gets wrecked and dies! I say this is the line of boys and men because I have had many a time where I've been cowering in fear, PRAYING that God will take the ball and protect his child from it.

												What can I say about Lethal League that hasn't already been said? It's a fantastic game, and one worth playing for quite a while! Team Reptile did an amazing job with this title, ranging from the excellent gameplay, to the beautiful soundtrack, even to the art the game displays so well. Let's have a jawbreaker and take a look, shall we? Intro: Lethal League is a game that will test you and make sure you make the right decisions, or you're going to strike out fast! The aim of the game is to smack a ball and try to hit your opponent with it to knock him out, which makes him lose a piece of health. Everytime you hit the ball it turns your color so you can't get hit until he hits it back! You play as one of six total characters: Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Sonata, Latch, and Dice. Each character hits the ball in different angles and has their own jump heights and abilities that make each of them stand out from one another. You've got your basic 15 year old baseball player, all the way down to a cyborg crocodile that uses his tail to hit the ball and a robot with a skateboard!Gameplay: The gameplay in Lethal League is absolutely amazing. It is so fun making the ball go thousands of miles per hour and always wondering if you'll hit the ball, or be hit yourself! You have some options of hitting the ball, such as doing a downward smash that doubles the ball speed, or just hitting it straight forward to try to trick your opponent into thinking it'll go somewhere else. Characters fill up a four bar meter everytime they hit the ball, and when full they can use their special attack which can do things like make the ball travel through walls or just eat it and spit it back out! The fun in Lethal League is the simplicity of it, and while simple, it is incredibly fun and satisfying.Music: Music in any game is usually why I keep playing. Lethal League's soundtrack is some of the greatest in indie game music that I've heard. Team Reptile really hit it out of the park with this one, and there was not one single song I disliked in this title. The menu music alone is just phenomenal, and tracks like Ordinary Days and Scream just add to the awesomeness of it. They all loop pretty nicely and sound very well done. The soundtrack in Lethal League will surely not disappoint you at all!Graphics: Lethal League overall looks pretty good for an indie game. The art of the characters is pretty sweet, and so are the backgrounds of each stage. It's also amazing to look at the stages changes the faster you hit the ball, and I feel just makes it way more satisfying to reach insane speeds! The animations feel a bit clunky and weird though, but not something that I really payed much attention to. I will say though, if you want a headache then go ahead and play this game for hours, as it will probably hurt your eyes! Conclusion: I most likely missed some elements and whatnot but I really only wanted to touch on those three topics. That being said, this is a game you MUST play. I recommend it for everyone who loves fighting games and playing with friends. To have the best experience, please do grab some friends and enjoy the hell out of this game! You might not like the 14 dollar price on this game, and that is reasonable due to how simple the game is, but it is worth the money. If you can get some friends, then no doubt you'll be hitting homeruns in no time! Rating: 9/10			"

I say this is the line of boys and men because I have had many a time where I've been cowering in fear, PRAYING that God will take the ball and protect his child from it. I then got to see God grab the ball and SLAM JAM it into my face screaming,""GET ♥♥♥♥ED BOY!""			"

												This game is multiplayer gold. It has single player, but you really shouldn't be expecting to put much time into it if you plan on just playing that. Despite appearances there is a huge skill ceiling and a lot of ways to approach each round. I'm nowhere near skilled enough to pull said moves off, but as a person that plays casually with friends Lethal League has given me more than enough fun. Wait for a sale if the pricetag puts you off, and get a pack for friends as it really is meant to be played with a group.			"

												10/10If you like fighting games, pong, DBZ, or any variation on those themes. You are in the right place. This game is literally the best fighting game, both soundtrack and gameplay wise, I've ever played. It incorporates simple, easy to understand concepts with intensely reactive meta game in order to accomplish a speedy-twitch strike style of gameplay you'll find nowhere else. Lacking slightly in content, the developers plan to make at least one more stage and character for the game with the hope that more will follow! Pick it up and I'll see you in game. ;)			"

												Most fun I've ever had in any local multiplayer game, even if I keep losing TT_TT---ReviewAs I have said, Lethal League is a very fun multiplayer game. It is easy to learn but hard to master, and has a pretty high skill cap.Pros: Memorable catchy house music. A unique concept of pong/baseball/fighting all combined into one game that is really blood-pumping and may cause some screaming if you're playing a LAN. Solid mechanics The controls are tight 6 different characters you can choose from with different abilities (and hit angles). You can play in quick short bursts, maybe when you're queuing for a Dota 2 game, CSGO, anything really. The art is unique. The animations are very smooth. The voice acting isn't cringe-worthy and is very well done. Playing with lag is somewhat manageable, unlike in some FPS and other games where lag is very important to not have. Hardly any bugs.Cons: Current playerbase isn't too big so actually finding a game is sometimes impossible. You can check on SteamDB[steamdb.info] to see how many players are playing at the moment so you can actually find an opponent. Price is a bit too expensive for some people. Rare crashes.That's all I could think of for cons, really.WishlistThe things I wish was in the game More characters A cheaper price to increase the playerbaseFINAL VERDICT:85/100This game is really different to most other fighting games, if you can afford it, buy it when it is on sale, usually it's around $5, so get it!

												Great game, deserves a reward.The game is a strange competitive game, you try to hit the enemy with the ball you hit, each hit increases the speed making it somewhat challenging to hit the ball and satisfying when you hit it.The music is great for each map, the art style is awesome, brings me back to the good old Jet Set Radio art vibe and all around beautiful.The characters are not serious, making the competitive aspect of the game less fustrating as you feel like you're having fun. When you die you know what happened to you and you just want to improve from it, it's one of the main things what I love about lethal league.7/10Reason why I give it a 7/10 is because it lacks communication to the community, yeah, there's almost like an update almost every month or two, but, I mean, with the newer games these days, developers normally make blogs about what's going on. Fan art and things like that, I'd really love to see some from Lethal League.			"

												Lethal League focuses on its core mechanics, ball speed and hit lag, and does these very well. The game is a blast to both play and watch, with DBZ levels of intensity when you reach the higher ball speeds. It's ridiculous, over the top, and I love it. Problems with the game are mainly the lack of players, but this game is perfect for local multiplayer.The movement is excellent, and it feels good to play.Definitely worth your while.			"

												Yeah this game, to describe it in a phrase is a baseball fighter with as many dramatic pauses as your standard Dragon Ball Z fight. Suffice to say its really entertaining, the moment your screen starts shaking and the map starts to look like a hurricane tsunami earthquake is running rampent with every hit you manage to slap back at your opponent. Well what I'm trying to say is that its ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. There are not O.P. characters or energy blasts just a ball that is going light speed and is about to shatter your skull along with any reservations you held towards this game. While it is lacking in content, which I'm fairly certain all games today are, it does one thing better than anyone and that is smashing faces. As the game claims there is ""No Weak♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; in there arena baseball brawler.			"

												This game is AMAZINGLY AWESOMELY AMAZING!I saw it i was like it looks cool id enjoy it for while but no i played i and i have to keep hit that ball faster and faster and faster! GOTTA GO FAST! -SonicIf your looking for a game with good music, cards, achevments, balls, online, and more this is the game for you.But it is new so there aren't many people on multiplayer, but you can still hit balls in singleplayer.This game is amazing you should buy it right now, stop reading and buy NOW!If you dont buy you will miss out on tons and tons of ball hitting and speedy balls going flying past you so fast your brain might explode.  I Recommend this game to every one that has a brian, is breathing, and is a person. 20/10 would wack a more balls again (and will)			"

												Yeah this game, to describe it in a phrase is a baseball fighter with as many dramatic pauses as your standard Dragon Ball Z fight. Suffice to say its really entertaining, the moment your screen starts shaking and the map starts to look like a hurricane tsunami earthquake is running rampent with every hit you manage to slap back at your opponent. Well what I'm trying to say is that its ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. There are not O.P. characters or energy blasts just a ball that is going light speed and is about to shatter your skull along with any reservations you held towards this game. While it is lacking in content, which I'm fairly certain all games today are, it does one thing better than anyone and that is smashing faces. As the game claims there is ""No Weak♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; in there arena baseball brawler.			"

												""Lethal League is a competitive projectile fighting game where you have to hit an anti-gravity ball into the face of your opponent to win."" That description is spot. Lethal League is a ton of fun though. Once you got used to how the game works the ridiculous amount of things that can happen are endless. The game offers three different game modes; free for all, team, and strikers. Free for all is exactually what you would expect up to for people all trying to knock eachother out by hitting the ball. Team is the same way other than being able to work with your teammate to control the pace of the game. Stirikers is basically soccer where each team is trying to hit the ball into the other teams goal while also trying to protect your own. For free for all I would reccomend three people because with four people the game gets to hectic for me personally. Also the soundtrack in this game is sweet! Overall though I would highly recommend this game to anyone as long as you have friends to play with. I would give this game a solid 8/10 with the only thing holding it back being the replay value since it relies so much on one type of gameplay some people may get bored fairly quickly.			"

												It's hard to find games that are playable in local multiplayer, are really easy to pick up, and ALSO have a lot of depth and challenge. Lethal League is pretty simple overall, but is just perfect. Its controls involve just three buttons; not ""Divekick"" excessive simplicity, but enough that people won't shy away from picking up the third or fourth controller. Even so, there's definitely enough variety of play at work. There's also a great tactile feel to mashing a ball around at each other,I've been bringing a laptop loaded with this game to a local bar, and people were very quick to pick up on it; several people there are probably better than I'll ever be already.

												Lethal League is one of the most original fighters I've played in a while to the point where I'm not even sure if it could be called a fighter. But, its lack of content (especially in the singleplayer front) makes this game only worth it for a few laughs with friends.The story is non-existent in this game, but the characters you get to play as and the stages you play in are really interesting and have a very unique style reminiscent of something like Jet Set Radio. The world presented in the stages looks very interesting but you never get to explore it or get to know more about it. Nevertheless, they make for a good visualizer inbetween rounds for this game's excellent soundtrack.The gameplay revolves around a ball which you hit to make it turn your color which means that any players hit who aren't the same color (assuming you're in a team battle) die instantly. They can hit it again though and make it go faster and faster and faster until someone is hit. This game is so simple yet so mind numbingly complex in its mechanics that it welcomes players from any skill level. Casually, this is a fun game to play with up to 3 friends. Competitively, this is a game riddled with mechanics to be discovered and tactics to be used. This is the perfect balance for any fighter.But then there's that. This isn't quite a fighter... This is more like ""Super Pong Bros."" in a way. But unlike the Nintendo money machine, this game isn't riddled with content, unlockables or anything really to make for a solid singleplayer experience. This game's only content as far as I'm concerned is playing with friends and to some extent online play. It's unusual mechanics don't really make it pro tournament and competitive play material, although I could see it entirely.In the end, Lethal League's mechanics more than make up for the lack of content, and while its visual aesthetic can be called archaic for some, it can be seen as artistic. The diversity in the very small roster of characters is there, albeit not too game changing since the only change is usually only the special attack that can be used after 4 successful hits on the ball. Skins and trophies are there for a singleplayer experience, but... I wouldn't advise you playing this game unless at least one friend would play with you as well.Worth checking out.			"

												What can I say about this gem?Well I can say this; this game is the most fun I've had with a multiplayer game. Playing this game with friends is an awesome and frantic experience. Equally I just enjoyed batting it about with the CPUs when I bought the game the day after I played it at a friends. My one suggestion to the developer is to add some custom features (like changing the default ball speed or the gravity) and some other modes would be cool (tag team matches or something)Probably one of the best examples of a good indie game. The soundtrack is mind meltingly good, the thick electro and trance providing the perfect backdrop for a flawless game. The controls feel good. The sound design has that great new retro feel - evoking sweet sweet tones of Jet Set Radio. Rarely has the word eargasm been so applicable. The voice acting has that cool 90s feel - ""WIIIIIIIIPEEEE OUUUUT""If you want to buy any party game, or a game for just chilling with or a game that is just plain amazing. Then buy this. A nice change from boring bland  brown survival games that seem to be churning out from some early access hell hole. This game deserves your money and it deserves to be on every platform available - probably even the NeoGeo			"

												Lethal League is one of the most fun games I've ever played.First, It's got one of the best GGPO connections out there. I can play with my friends even when the family is destroying my internet connection with streams and netflix.It's Pong, but you control a character and smash the ball against your opponent, until the ball goes so fast it breaks the universe and one of you takes it to the face. Not only that, but Lethal League has a 4 player feature, making it even more chaotic. Packed with a Artstyle that will probably remind you of Jet Set Radio, it also has one of the best soundtracks out there. It's 10/10 on anyone's list, I'm sure.What are you waiting for? go buy it and play with your friends! You'll have a lot of fun.			"

												What can I say about this game, it was a really super duper awesome fun time to play this game, especially with friends. I don't feel like the mechanic that this game uses has really been implemented in many other games and therefore gives this game a sense of originality. Considering that in it's most basic form, it is a more complex game of ""Pong"" I highly reccommend playing this game with a friend for hours of fun!			"

												This game clearly draws a lot from 2-D fighters, and games like Super Smash Bros. While it is somewhat lacking in depth of mechanics and focuses more on memorization of trajectories, this game is certainly enjoyable to pick up with some friends. The art in the game is nice, albeit unpolished, but if you are going to play the game for longer than a few hours I would recommend muting it, as the sounds made by the characters are infuriatingly awful. I would recommend this game if you are looking for something inspired by Super Smash Bros but don't want an actual fighting platformer like Rivals of Aether.			"

If you like fighting games at all, and remember the hype of the UFGT 9 Finals match, then you really should try Lethal League in its Steam form. The music is extremely bangin', and you can easily find the tracks in the music folder, to rock out to whenever. No weak ****. No complex move lists. No johns.

												Lethal League knocks it out of the park, without even trying. The mechanics to this fighter are straightforward and very easy to understand. Two to four characters hit a baseball around an arena, trying to hit the other players with it. If a player hits the ball back, the speed of the ball increases. You can “bunt” the ball, temporarily knocking it straight up, but once it’s hit again or touches the ground it will resume its previous velocity. If a player manages to hit the ball four times, they can do a special move that varies by character.It sounds simplistic on paper, but the ball velocity gets so high that your only view of it is as a straight line bisection the arena. Timing is critical, strategy vital, and seat-of-your-pants tactics (wild panic works too) all combine into a high-octane fight unlike anything I’ve seen before. In a very strange, oblique way, it reminds me of high-level play in Rockstar’s Table Tennis. Lethal League has even replaced Soul Calibur as my favorite fighting game.If you’re curious about the game, you can play the original prototype of Lethal League here: http://lethalleague.reptile-games.com/prototype/ - it’s not quite the same as the full game, but it’s enough to give you a good impression.

												Lethal League, despite its simplicity, is an amazingly fun and challenging game. I am horrible at reviewing games due to me being somewhat of a moron, but this game is so simple to play, that even people who are not fans of traditional fighters (Myself included) will absolutely love it's simple but challenging to master gameplay. If for some reason it's TL:DR for you, 10/10 game, get this♥♥♥♥♥♥now.			"

												Fighting Games and Pong had a lovechild, and an intense little child it is.Lethal League is the essense of fighting games boiled down to its most base parts. The concept and controls are simple, but timing, positioning, mindgames, prediction, and countering all feature just as heavily as they would in a more complex game. "

												i recommend this game because its fast-paced but you still know whats going on. It has music playing that really goes well with the gameplay. Its a game that you have fun with a group of four friends or 1 on 1 because of the many maps and character selection you could have fun for hours on end and because of each character having a differnt special move it makes the game have more of an skill than a button mashing kind of game.

												Jet Set Pong Smash Bros.This game is great fun.  Controls are snappy and the music is awesome.  My only gripe is one of the characters ""death"" soundfile is ""<grunt>, D--nit, D--nit, D--nit!""  Not too bad unless two people choose Candyman and you are listening to it 5 times a minute.  And it seems louder than the other voices.  Really a problem since my kids enjoy playing this game, and its difficult to explain to their parents in a party setting.  --PCMasterRace Solution--------------The offending file is ""candy_gethit_b.wav""It's located at ...\lethalleague\resources\audio\voiceover\candy\Open with Audacity (free software, and awesome), delete the swearing, and export/overwrite back to .wavNow it's just a grunt.  -----------------------------------------My kids' favorite party game on PC.Paid full price.

The sounds of the game are very good for what they are, hitting the ball at a very high velocity DEFINITELY makes you want more.

												You hit a ball, change its colour and this way the ball can KO your opponent. When he gets hit a number of times, you win.The premise is interesting but gets old quickly. Changing the direction of the ball when hitting it is difficult because of the controls (you can direct the ball with up and down keys and you jump with another key). This game would be easier to play with keyboard plus mouse, using the mouse to direct the ball. It would also be easier to jump using the up key instead of a separate jump bind.Music is decent. Graphics are so so. Characters don't seem to have any story about them and instead of a Story Mode you have a Challenge Mode which for some reason is in a secondary menu. I think that, given the simple gameplay, there should be some other play modes to keep up your interest. Specially for single player.It can be fun to play with other people on same screen. It seems there are not many players left for online multiplayer games.			"

												I`m not sure where to begin, The intensity in this game and the thrill are so real, even though it could look like a normal game, yet if you try it and played it with some friends you will notice that you are slowly getting addicted to it, Each character has some abilities and special move, each of them has a characteristic and a personality acting according to their own, I`m honestly surprised not many of my friends had this game yet.It`s a total recommended, like hell worth every penny.

												Now before I start, this is not a bad game. But even though it's playable alone, multiplayer is practically a requirement for this game to be worth it. The Challenge mode ranges from unduly hard to boringly easy. Sometimes, you'll never get the ball speed over 50MPH, other times, the CPU you took out with a lame 40MPH ball will deflect your 250MPH shot with a single frame of notice. The AI is inconsistent and doesn't prepare you for multiplayer play at all, because they do not behave like normal humans. Some will charge you and stay on top of you when it's the least safe situation to do so, just so they can hit the ball where you have a single frame to react. Others will bunt the ball repeatedly on one side of the arena for no discernible reason. You would think there would be enough people around to pick and play random people online, but no amount of waiting eve seems to get me to find another person. So what does that mean? It means you're only going to be able to play this game with people you expressly invite to play with you. And at a $14-$40 price tag to get everyone equipped with their own copy of the game, it's not worth what will probably be a half hour session. Or less. With only six characters to choose from, there's very little replay value in the same session, let alone over multiple ones, so like many other Steam games that fill a super specific niche, get this one on sale. And get some for your friends too, because you're going to need them if you plan to have any fun with this game.			"

												This is one of the best games I have played in a long while.  This game is extremely fast paced as you smack a ball around a single room and hit other players with it, while avoiding the ball when someone else hits it.  This game has many zany characters that have different special abilities which make the game even crazier!This is one of the few games that I STRONGLY reccommend to anyone who loves certain Super Popular, Super Smashing games *cough* Super Smash Bros *cough*, because it plays like Super Smash bros but in a Pong-like fashion.  I give this game a 5/5 in my books!If you have the spare money, again, I STRONGLY recommend getting this game.			"

												Initial impressions. Very addictive! I regretted buying it at first, no idea why. Totally fun. I'd have to say it's 1 part luck, 9 parts skill. For how simple the controls are, there's a surprising amount of strategy that factors in. Timing is huge as well. Worth a buy for sure. Online matches are fun as hell, and every character handles differently, in major and subtle ways.If you like fighters, but want a simpler alternative to all the combos, this is fun to pick up and play.

												I learned about this game from Star_ and Jerma985 -big shock- and although I haven't played too much it's quite a fun game. Not something one would play primarily but a damn good time-killer and doesn't require a very good computer. I'd recommend it if you enjoy semi-competitive games -esp. with friends- that requires reaction speed rather than mashing one button repeatedly.			"

												This game is really fun. If it weren't for youtube I would;ve never found this game. I love the uniqueness of this game from its characters to game design. There's only one problem with the game is it's multiplayer. It tends to not even connect to online matches or sometimes it's really laggy even when searching with close range. Other than that, it's one of my favorite games. But I hope the developers fix this multiplayer issue quick.			"

												Let me start out by saying I really dont like arcade style fighter games. This is the first exception I have found.Lethal league involves hitting a ball into other players. The ball gradually speeds up until it gets to insane high speeds. Unlike most arcade fighter games movement in incredibly important and memorising combos is unnecessary.You have three skills, hitting the ball, bunting the ball (which stops the balls movement, and a special attack cast by double hitting the hit button after scoring four previous hits on the ball. Each character has a different special attack.Lethal league is graphically and musically stylish and appealing as well as insanely fun.Subscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/Check out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM "

												OK with 2 players, decent with 3 and good with 4.It takes more than 5 minutes to find a 4 player online game (I gave up at 8)... I guess there is a reason why Steamspy reports the average time per player to be at 1.5 hours and the median time per player to be at 0.5 hours.

												I personally love this game, it starts out seeming pretty easy but when it speeds up its all about skill and timing, but what I love about this game when you play with some friends is when you start really speeding up the ball and preparing to hit back with even more force, adn at a million speed (the max) the game goes crazy, if you aren't one to be ready for some crazy speed, then this game isn't for you, but for me. It's. Just. PERFECT!			"

												First thing first: This game is not perfect. It has online problems. sometimes if you can't connect with other players the game will crash all together, but the game boots up extremely fast.This game however, is an absolute blast to play. Super easy controls, great music, cool characters (Candyman especially), nice visuals that are easy on the eyes even though the game is batshit insanely fast. While it may not have a lot to offer, it offers a ton of replayability.Easily recommended.TL;DR Alright online, but fun as ♥♥♥♥.			"

												In a dystopian future where baseball is actually entertaining, a skateboarding robot, a deranged candy salesman, and a hipster crocodile battle it out for supremacy.Lethal league is a fighting game based around the premise of pong. While each character has a special move and the ability to attack one another, the only way to knock out your opponent is by smashing an oversized baseball into them. A deceptively simple premise that turns out to be a lot harder than it sounds, the ball will continue to move faster with each hit making it harder to predict and counter.Pros-Shockingly addicting-Great Sound track-Decent number of game mods with up to four players (1v1, team battle, ffa, stock/point etc)-ggpo netcodeCons-Not much of a single player (granted it is a fighter)Definitely worth a buy if you're looking for a quirky fighter to play online or with friends.

												So this game is only just released today, and you might think, ""How can he write a review so early after release?""Valid arguement, but counterable with: the game is super short and super simple. I am not an expert at this game, far from it. But the games' mechanics are very easy to learn, infact the tutorial is ~2 minutes long. That being said, I am going to continue playing this game for quite a while, it feels absolutely WONDERFUL to smack the ball around, especially the faster it gets, and you start shouting at the screen to get it.The price point is imo too high, 14 isn't pocket change, considering how much the game actually has inside. I got super hyped and bought it anyway, but that decision is up to you.The online connection is phenomenal, very very few cases when it felt off or jumpy. If I didn't know I was alone, I couldn't tell that the players weren't right next to me. One big probelem though is that if it desyncs, then it's just about over for that room. But i've only had that happen once in the ~16 games I've played as of writing this.Now, if they added Local Play, this game would be completely worth the price, hopefully they add that feature. If you're worried about dumping the cash to pick this up, wait till it goes on sale. Even 10 would be good imo, but I also thought 14 was an acceptable loss			"

												I got this game on sale quite a while ago - and at that point my only experience was with single-player. I held off on a review, because I would have thumbs-downed it. Why does this title have overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam?!It must be played with controllers on a couch with local multiplayer. This is where this game shines. There is alot of screaming and shouting and laughing. Lots of twitching. Great fun. Pros:+Excellent concept - bringing such a fresh breath of life to stale fighting games+Brilliantly simple controls - no tedious combos to memorize+Characters each have their own specialties - it seems subtle, though+Music is pretty goodCons:-While this game is crazy fun, there is wasted potential at this point IMO, I really think there is TONS of room for expansion, such as:-Needs more playable characters-Needs better artwork, IMO-Needs more playable levels-Needs more gameplay modes (only 3 right now)Overall, the fun factor is pretty much through the roof with this title. If you have couch coop opportunities, this is a no brainer.			"

												I don't remember how I was introduced to the prototype, but I shared it with my housemates and we've played hours worth of games over the course of the last six months. The simplicity, the visceral feedback, and the mindgames are what really make this game special. You can learn all the mechanics there is to learn in about 2 minutes, but what really takes a long time is learning how to read your opponent, what they're going to do and how to prepare for you. TotalBiscuit criticised the art style, but I have to disagree with him - The Boombox culture of south central los Angeles personified in cartoon form is a really fresh direction for a game to take. Maybe the palette has been exaggerated and might be a bit noisy, but I'll be damned if every single hit, every single return of the ball with the little flash particle animations isn't an instant dopamine hit.TL;Dr - simple game with a lot of strategic depth, great music, fresh art, solid mechanics. Recommend to everybody, I hope the guys at Reptile make millions of dollars.			"

												This game is as if Jet Set Radio, Pong, and Baseball had a super-baby and somehow incorporated crocodiles into it. It's a fast-paced arcade-style game with catchy music and competitive gameplay, and it's extremely fun with friends. If this doesn't sway you, I don't know what will. Then again, I'm not a very persuasive writer... but I digress.Sadly, it doesn't have much singleplayer aspects to it and the multiplayer can be repetitive against people you already know. I wish there was more of a community to it, it'd be a shame if the whole MNC incident happened to this.			"

												I can finally tell my friends I play League.... Oh, right. I'm writing a review. Here's my pros and cons list if you don't want to read the rest of my review.Pros: Fast-paced high-intensity gameplay that only increases in speed and intensity as the match goes on Beginner-friendly with an optional tutorial that can be replayed as many times as needed, as well as a practice mode 6 characters to choose from with unlockable character colors the more you play Online and local multiplayer supports up to 4 players Free-for-all and Team Battle game modes Single player campaign mode available (and achievements for beating it with each character) Gameplay is fluent and customizable with either keyboard or controller, controlled with 3 buttons outside the four directional movement buttons Amazing Soundtrack (at least, I think so)Cons: Lethal League online translates to Lethal Lag; I'd recommend not playing online if you and your friends do not have a fast and reliable internet connection Not much variety in terms of content; the single player campaign is just a series of battles against CPU opponents. Depending on your musical tastes, you might not like the soundtrack. This can always be remedied by adjusting the in-game volume settings and playing your own music over the game. The long version of the review If I was to describe Lethal League in one sentence, it would be Baseball Combat. You play as one of 6 characters, each with a different ability, and you hit the ball back and forth until it hits someone. When you get hit by the ball, you lose a life; when you lose all your lives, you've lost the match. I should note that hitting other characters directly does absolutely nothing, so you have to focus on hitting the ball such that it collides with your opponent. Up to 4 players can play at once, and the game modes include a free-for-all deathmatch as well as a team battle mode which supports both 2vs2, 1vs2 and 1vs3 modes. Friendly fire is optional (referred in-game as ball tagging) to allow a more intense experience should you choose to play with it. This game is very keyboard friendly if you don't have a controller (as I don't have a very good controller); controlled with the directional arrow keys for movement and the Z, X and Spacebar for other movements, you can re-map all the controls as you see fit in the options menu. My friend can confirm that this game plays great with a controller as well.Where I think this game shines brightest is its multiplayer, especially when playing with friends. With friends, regardless of how much I was winning or losing, not a moment went by where we weren't having the time of our lives. This game is very easy to learn as the controls are limited to movement, jumping, hitting the ball and bunting the ball (hitting it lightly), and the optional replayable in-game tutorial explains things sufficiently. Overall, this game is best played with friends, but can be played just as well solo. Definitely recommended, especially if it's on sale.			"

												It's pretty much fighting game perfection. It's a simple concept but with a surprisingly huge amount of depth and nuance to it, from the way the characters have their own individual quirks to the slight differences in stages changing the gameplay.If you're a big fighting game fan either competitively or casually, you'd be doing yourself a disservice in not picking this game up.

												Like a good sequel should,  Call of Duty: Ghosts  Lethal League doesn’t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the multiplayer experience. It’s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.Despite sharing a name with one of  Modern Warfare’s  Lethal League best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north and coming to blows with the U.S.The prelude establishes a harrowing vision of a United States homeland that's broken but not beaten – not quite Red Dawn, but not Fallout 3, either. It’s a space not often explored by modern shooters, and its mood is heightened by missions set in a besieged Santa Monica and the wasted remains of San Diego, to the tune of an excellent, somber score from David Buckley (The Town, Metal Gear Solid 4). But ultimately, time on the poignant homefront is short lived as the story goes behind enemy lines in Caracas, the Andes mountains, and other exotic locales.Those might lack to familiarity, but the variety of environments keeps the campaign fresh, not only in terms of visuals, but in gameplay as well. Instead of just fighting waves of enemies through a linear stage at ground level, you’ll find yourself rappelling down skyscrapers, flying helicopters, having firefights in space, commanding tanks, scuba diving through shipwrecks, playing as a dog, and evading shark attacks. Each requires new strategy, acute situational awareness, and – in the case of the space and water missions – special consideration for verticality and physics.Of course, it wouldn’t be a Call of Duty game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Ghosts delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation’s space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.But like previous CoDs, the story of Ghosts struggles to remain in focus amidst the fray of explosive cinematic moments and relentless firefights. Narrated loading sequences with stylized story animations push the campaign forward, but only last for one or two minutes before launching back into the action. It’s there, on the front lines, that much of the plot progression is presented and oftentimes lost.It's by no means an achievement in dramatic storytelling — it's more about dumb fun — and it lacks the player-choice element introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but when given time to breathe Ghosts actually offers some interesting human drama. The story centers around two brothers, Logan and Hesh, their father Elias, and yes, their dog Reilly as they fight the Federation as part of the battered remnants of the U.S. military, and later as the elite Ghosts squad. The family ties, specifically the relationship between Logan and Hesh, made me care about the protagonists in a series that's habitually made its characters a dispensable commodity. The voice acting is decent overall, though there are periodic moments of cringe-worthy dialog, like one superfluous moment when Elias reveals he’s a member of the Ghosts. And then there’s Riley. Though the subject of many a meme at this point, Riley not only acts as a useful tool for recon and silently dispatching enemies, but is integral to several dramatic sequences, saving your character on more than one occasion.The story stumbles in the second act when it strays away from the more evocative character focus in favor of a long stretch of back-to-back missions driven almost exclusively by guns-blazing combat. While not poorly done, this visually arresting, action-packed, but ultimately hollow middle stands in stark contrast to the effective first and final acts. On the bright side, that padded out my play time to roughly 10 hours, making this campaign one of the longest CoD single-player experiences.The Verdict Call of Duty: Ghosts  Lethal League isn't a reinvention of the franchise, but proves there's still room for innovation within its existing formula. Though at the risk of overcomplicating things at times, its robust multiplayer gameplay, surprisingly fun co-op modes, and lengthy, challenging, and varied campaign makes  Ghosts  Lethal League one of the best Call of Duty games to date.

												I gave this game many chances to improve me because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but I've come to the conclusion this game does not work well with the controller.  I've tried using both a steam controller and x360 controller and this game has the weirdest problems with my controllers.  Whenever I press left on the analog controller, it would pause the game.  Also, the game was clearly designed for keyboad and mouse because when you use the controller the analog stick becomes a pointer and in order to select your opponent in a CPU game you have to click this little narrow box.  It's very unintuitive.  If this dev really wants this game to take off like Rocket League or some such (this game was recommended to my because of my love for RL), they need to make the interface with the controller more intuitive and iron out many bugs.  At it's current form, I can't recommend this game for people with controllers.			"

Was a terrible joke. But really the game is worth picking up. Havent had this much fun playing a game in a while. Screaming at my screen at times getting so hype, amazed at the returns back and forth.  Easy to learn hard to master mechanics with complex tricks and traps to practice. As far as I've seen online is clean as hell with only the rare DC here and there. It would have to be to support the insane speeds the game can reach matched with the reaction times it takes to return the ball. The price is a little high but well worth for the pure fun of the game. Pick it up take a swing at it...sorry ill stop.			"

												The core game here is quite fun, but the online play has been nothing but laggy for me.  In fairness it's not comparatively that much lag - but anything about 200ms delay in game where the target can move across the entire screen in 2 frames basically makes it unplayable.  But if you get people locally, I think there's a lot of fun to be had here.			"

												This game is a nice twist of fighting and dodgeball. The gameplay is simple, you hit the ball it goes faster, if you hit your opponent, they lose a life. And even though the controls may be minimal, there are a lot of complex combos you can pull off with the ball.If you have no friends to play with, no worries! There are 2 (3 if you count training) SinglePlayer gamemodes to try out by yourself.This game is fun to play with your friends, or a fun way to chillax on your own.Cons:-Buggy-Online is Laggy-Menus do not have the ""life"" they deserve-Minimal character choice-Random seems rigged, if two or more people choose random, they will usually always be the same character (not 100% proven)- Final Rating: 88/100 -			"

												So you like Super Smash Bros? Ofc you do.You like skating robots fighting aligators? Again, ofc you do.And you like balls? I mean who doesnt?Well look no further. This game have it all.High speed balls, fancy outplays, derps and so much more. This game is great.Play it vs a friend and show him why you are the master of ball handling. Play with more and let the chaos unfold.The game itself is very simple and easy to play, but the skill ceiling is very high. And though you fight in a square box the game picks up speed so fast that even The Flash is like ""Daymn!""Get this game NOW!Im sitting here wondering why you are still reading this when you could have bought the game and started playing by now.

												If you like big party games like Smash Bros or fighting games in general, you will love Lethal League. It is FREAKIN AWESOME!The game gets really intense if someone doesn't lose a stock. That is because the ball gets closer to the speed beyond the naked eye. I have been following this game since the prototype. Whenever I get into nightmare mode where the screen color changes, the adrenaline is running (Because somebody has to go and it's not gonna be me!). I just wish more people wouldn't be hogging the wall and smashing the ball from there for the whole time. It sometimes works but it is very cheap. So guys, come online more often and let's play ball.			"

												Pong Fighter is the simple description of lethal league, a cool new games from Team Reptile makers of megabyte punch another suto fighting game. lethal league is simple to learn  but at its core it has a very high skill level. Only 3 buttons jump, strike, and punt but using good timing and learning angels with these tools you will be striking your opponent out while you're running home on a Grand Slam R.B.I.heres my full written review Lethal league is a game where the hype never stops  and neither does the ball. the core game is like combat pong  or dodge ball but there is a lot of nuance moves and tricks the make this game competitive and really fun.play with your friends. even if you don't have any, GO ONLINE and play against some other online warriors, don't want to get rekt. the challenge mode will keep you busy the fun never stops with a myriad of different stages and retro music that will remind you of jet set radio- always a good thing. the game is by team reptile the same people behind megabyte punch which came out august of 2013.after making megabyte punch the games developers were showing off a new kind of fighting game at major competitions the game was praised and so lethal league was born.the gameplay of lethal league is simple you can't really do much you can jump strike and punt. only 3 buttons but the maneuvers you can string together using these 3 buttons are essential to mastering the game. each one of your moves jump, strike, and  punt all have a different functionality depending on the situation and character.each character has a unique jump mechanic such as wall jump double jump ect. all characters have a downward strike will jumping. and all characters have a special move after hitting something 4 times.there are 5 characters so far. switch,raptor,sonata,candyman and latch. learning your characters move set, mobility, and strengths is key to knowing what to do in each situation and really adds depth to the game. my 2 favorite character so far are switch and sonta, switch  can ride on the walls and has a pretty horizontal swing. on the other hand sonata has a double jump and had a pretty vertical swing . each character differences do add some subtly to the game and doesn't change the core gameplay. unlike other fighting game where u have to know each character's inputs and timing this game is all about timing so u can hope on any character pretty much and still be competent. the moment to moment gameplay can look a little daunting to new players but the simple mechanics make it easy to hop in the game and just play and once you start to learn how to predict the ball then thats when you'll really get into the deep nuance  of this game. the developers did a good job of showing you the basic of the gameplay in their tutorial while still giving you the opportunity to discover new game mechanics on your own. overall the gameplay is simple yet hard to master and thats what u want ina competitive game getting into a game online is really easy its been a good number of people playing everytime i how on must i had to wait for a game was 1-2 minutes but most happen withen 30 secs. im on the west coast so your milage may vary the gameplay is great and all but what i think really deserves praise is the music and art tim and dion did a great job with a game art the style of the art really fits the game a sorta pixel art of future streetscapes and urban environments really adds to the feel of the games atmosphere the music gets me pumped to play so lethal league. i can listen to the music without the game. thats the sign of good music. a sorta mix sounds like the music for the jet set series with a modern twist  im having fun with lethal league and even though it won't be my go to competitive game i'm glad i have it in my library and i can hop in anytime and play the best version of pong there is :D7/10slightly abouve wolfstien the new oder Video Impressions

												Hitting the ball back and forth has never been so much fun! It sounds simple enough, but you have to time your hits.. just right, and online play can be a bit rough. It does seem to be pretty active, even late at night with online play. Log on at 1AM find a match, during the day, find a match, so on and so forth. Downside to this game is it allows people that can be way outside of your region to join which can make the games sometimes laggy. Online play, Offline Multiplayer, andd. Challenge mode! Got it all for $5, and although there is better games out there.. this is the only one that I am aware of that plays the way it does. It's unique, and definitely worth it to get it during a sale price.Goodluck and have fun if you decide to get it :)Update: Game is fun yes, but after playing more there is way too many laggers, too much game crashing, and the people on the forums are rather condescending to those stating facts. Heck. Even some long-time players agree that hte game crashes way too much. Not exactly promising it would get fixed. Also, gets a bit repetitive. It's fun.. but not fun enough for a thumbs up anymore. I'll still play it on occasion, but meh.Side note: Being taunted by laggers in games is kind of annoying too. It's like. ""Hey, you're bad but in reality i'm the lagger that can't get a good connection."" and no, i'm not referring to those that are not even close to your region, i'm talking those in the same area as you that somehow have a ridic ping.

Heavily dependent on how dedicated you are to playing in a box.- Taunting (personal hatred)- Playing game with people who know what they're doing can be very disheartening.Would I recommend this game to an ordinary person? Not at all. The price is honestly insane. But would I recommend this game to a person who enjoys competitive games? Yes.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing YES!The idea of a competetive sports game isn't that uncommon. In the early days there was Windjammers. A discthrowing 1v1 pong-like game in a form of a fightinggame with different specialmoves and characters.This game on the other hand takes those Ideas and give them a new look and feel and resembles one of the most unique games of this decade.#### What are we doing exactly? #####The goal of the game is getting a ball to hit your opponents. You can hit the ball in many directions and the ball is bouncing of the walls. There are different attacks and specials you can do to speed up the ball or causing it to change directions.####### Gameplay ######Smooth as butter. Easy to learn, hard to master. You can get relatively far with just playing with feel and a little bit random button presses. But if you learn how to combo, parry and reducing your hitlag, you can get constant wins.####### Graphics #######The graphics are completely 2D. It looks like it was done by MS Paint, but it has its own funky style. The graphics are snappy and look good. Especially the effects when you hit the ball as it reaches the speeds of  max 1000000pixel/s (I think thats the speedindex)####### Balance ########The game seems to be well balanced. Every character is different and has a specialattack and peculiarities like walljump, doublejump, wallclinging and driving across the ceiling with a skateboard. Also the angles, in which the ball flies after a hit, are different aswell. Because it is more about how you handle the ball, i don't think there will be overpowered characters.####### Network ########The netcode is powered by ggpo. You can feel how good the netcode is.. even with 4 players it's smooth as hell. There are some hickups, witch result in disconnects, but considering the age of the game, I wouldn't be surprised if the game got some updates to fix this. After all it's just a little annoyance, which is forgotten after you desperately try to reconnect to the massive fun. (which is fast anyway)###### Conclusion ######The game is a must-have. The fun we had in just 6 hours was tremendous. The game is best played with 4 players, in a 2v2 teammatch.			"

												I like this game, I just don't know if I can recommend it. Pros:- I love the art style, it's awesome and the art is awesome, from the characters to the stages.- The music is also really great.- Gameplay is interesting and a different take on traditional fighting games.Cons:- Finding lobbies is difficult- The mechanics don't have a ton of depthAt the end of the day, I was already bored of it after a few hours. Trying to find lobbies just to play a fighting game with not much depth to the mechanics wasn't worth it to me. I'm not sure if the concept of a 2 button fighting game is supposed to be a selling point, but to me it wasn't. There's no combos, no blocks, no grabs, and nothing that really gives you  the rock-paper-scissors aspect of fighting games you expect in the genre. If you're new to fighting games and don't expect much in the way of depth of mechanics, this would be fine. For me, it's not enough. I wish I enjoyed it more though, because the art and the soundtrack are all amazing.			"

												There's no point to playing the game with dead multiplayer.It's fun with friends, yeah but that's a once-in-a-blue-moon experience.And the offline ""challenge"" mode is nothing but laughably terrible.  If I wanted to play an input-reading game  where the computer can counter my inputs the instant I press the button, I'll go play any fighter game on the gamecube either that or I'll try fighting psyco-mantis without unplugging my controller.  See how that turns out?Overall, only a fun game if you have friends around.2/10.			"

All that being said, I know that this is just stylistic preference and I could see how some people might enjoy this game. Just not for me.			"

YouTube™ Video: First Try: Lethal League 

			Views: 94		

			Disclaimer: I was provided with a reviewcopy of the game. Get it on steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/261180/		

Lethal League is an interesting take on a projectile based fighting game.The controls are reduced to their bare minimum, giving you the option to jump, hit and punt, but the timing of these commands is what divides the good from the best. Since the ball can be hit in any angle you want there are a lot of factors to consider on how and when to hit it or if you want to slow the ball down with a punt to smash it more acurrately. Currently there are 5 playable characters available, which for a launch line-up is okay, but I hope that more characters will be added soon. Each character has its own special ability which you can use when your power meter(I haven't heard an official name for that yet) is full. You can fill your power meter by hitting the ball and when it's full you can release your special ability by pressing the hit button again while you are hitting the ball. What is quite notable as well is that each character has special movment and jumping capabilities. For example, Candyman cannot walljump, therefore he is able to jump higher.There are also 6 levels, but here are some weakpoints the game has in my opinion. The levels are just backgrounds, there is no real interaction with what is going on in the front. For example there is a level where you are on a street. In the background you see a tank(at least it looks like one to me) and buildings. Wouldn't it be awesome, if these elements would come into play, for example the tank shoots one of the buildings and rubble is coming down and affects the ball or makes you go away from certain areas? At least I would like that.Another thing is that the graphical fidelity leaves a lot to be desired. While I dig the artstyle that looks like jet-set radio in 2D, the backgrounds just don't really look that good. What is great though is the animations quality which give you a nice feel of the velocity of the ball and let the controlls feel really good. It also has to be noted that the stop motion moments when hitting a very fast ball are extremely funny and change depending on what level you are currently at.The game also features a progression system which lets you unlock new colouring for the playable characters. Last, but not least, let's talk about the soundeffects and the soundtrack. The soundeffects are quite nice and there is a nice variety on sound cues available. The soundtrack itself features different artists. To be honest, it is not my style of music, but I found it really fitting and enjoyable at times. Having not tried the multiplayer yet, there is one big component missing, but from what I've heard, the netcode is working fine, only disconnects seem to make big trouble. Now to the conclusion: Is the game worth it? In my opinion there is a lot of fun and enjoyment to be had in this game, especially when you have 3 other to people to play and talk with in Skype or Teamspeak. It is easy to learn, but hard to master(I normally hate these sayings, but when it's true I can't help it). So even if you are not that good at the game, you might be able to get your enjoyment out of it.The only thing, people might be turned off by is the graphics, but in my opinion this game is a case of gameplay beating graphics in terms of making a joyful experience. The price is 12€ or your regional equivalent. Buying a 4 or a 2 pack is even more recommended, because of the reasons that are stated above.			"

												When I first opened this game I immediately sank to my knees and wept tears of pure joy, and by ""pure joy"" I mean ""pure Jack Daniel's"". Suddenly my max bench press increased by a 100lbs. I wiped the whiskey from my face, looked in the mirror, and in my reflection I saw him behind me.George Washington. Looking stern and powerful. He nodded once, an affirmation. I knew what I had to do.I flung myself from the bathroom window and this game turned me into a bald eagle, I flew over Iraq and pooped tomahawk missiles on ISIS positions, then I flew back home and turned into a 1967 Pontiac GTO and drove all night until I arrived at ♥♥♥♥♥town.

												 World of Tanks is the first and only team-based massively multiplayer online action game dedicated to armored warfare. Throw yourself into the epic tank battles of World War II with other steel cowboys all over the world. Your arsenal includes more than 150 armored vehicles from America, Germany, and the Soviet Union, carefully detailed with historical accuracy. A flexible system of authentic vehicle upgrade and development allows you to try any of the vehicles and weapons in the game. Whether you prefer to exhaust your foes with fast and maneuverable light tanks, make deep breaches in enemy lines with all-purpose medium tanks, use the force of giant tanks to eliminate opposing armored forces, or become a heavy sniper with long-range howitzers, each unit type has its own advantages and can be extremely effective when operated by a true tank ace. But being a great tank commander alone isn't enough to win! In World of Tanks, it's all about teamwork. Victory is achieved by combining your combat skills with those of the other members of your team, each playing their own role on the battlefield. Just add your favorite strategy to build your own iron empire and manifest the indisputable authority of the tank! Feel the tank power!(Mei is thicc af)			"

												Would work as a $5 early access game. Not even the Jet Set radio graphics are enough to keep me playing. Online multiplayer seems to work, at least when you play with randoms. Playing with friends? Forget it. 99/100 times the game says I stopped hosting even though I hit start game. Yes me and my friend have closed down and restarted the the issue still persisted. At one point I wasn't able to click with my mouse or PS4 touchpad (could have been the DSR I was trying). The gameplay itselt feels pretty off. It could be fun if the characters moved more like characters in Smash rather than Little Tikes My First Video GameTIM. Maybe try making a few more characters, for the same price I can get fighting games with triple the roster and more that also have better gameplay, more stages and don't crash everytime you start an online match. Maybe buy this if you want to waste $14, or save that money and get a copy of Brawl for your WIi that's just lying around and play a real party fighting game and not this early access tier ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

Must buy at any price [x]Worth the money but wait for a small sale [x]Wait for a huge discount [x]Avoid at all costs [✓]Yes, I've only got 0.2 hours on this game but it was enough to tell me the summary of this game.First of all, I've got this off of Humble Bundle so I didn't think much of it, then I remembered what this game was and couldn't wait for the ""amazing"" experience.The game is indie so you won't expect much, but wait, the game is 12Euro (£10 , $13). That's alot for an indie game, especially for such a simple one.I'm pretty sure when this game was new the devs basically payed youtubers for good advertisment, from videos this looks fun, on paper it was a good idea. But the developers need to learn on alot more things.GRAPHICS This is a 2013 indie game, I wasn't expecting much for graphics, they're good but the only problem is that it feels like 720p (I played on 1920x1080 16:10), the rest of the graphic options don't exist, don't really mind that as the game doesn't have that much visual requirements. GAMEPLAY Offline is ok, the bots are very weird though.You can select difficulty (1-7) , at 1 they wont do anything except hit the ball once, 2 they're VERY difficult, like how does one play offline without getting frustrated trying to find the ""medium"" difficulty.Online is unplayable, I've realised that it is a bug which you can fix by restarting the game which is false for some users, but either way the developers should focus on fixing glitches, not hoping the community could do something. MENU LAYOUT My favourite part about this, the menu layout is something.You know how there was that kid in class who did everything the totally opposite way? That's this menu, when you click on ""Back"" (which is obnoxiously big) it has a chance of EXITING THE GAME. There is an exit button which appears where the back button does, but even mid game if you go into options, press back you won't simply leave the menu (even though you have chances of leaving the menu and staying in game) you won't get kicked out the game and back into the menu because the game thinks you somehow pressed quit, you quit the whole game. ONLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS GAME Getting the glitched fixed and playing with friends. REQUEST Good idea on paper and would love to see any game dev do this better (Even on Garry's Mod you can probably pull off a better game tbh)			"

And not just once... he screamed ""D**** it, d**** it, d**** it!!""This really made me not want to play this game again. I wish this was removed. Like, please, give us an option to turn off cursing. There is the option to turn off voiceovers, but where's the fun in that? I like hearing the characters... except when they curse. Again, please give the option, at least, to make the game more kid-friendly and enjoyable for those who don't like to hear cursing.			"

												This game is not for everyone, and its not for me.Sure, the multiplayer can be fun (especially local co-op).But here's the deal: there is nothing to achieve.Sure, there are skins to unlock, but those do nothing, and you'll probably just stick with one skin in the end.The game lacks content. I feel like if it had more to offer other than multiplayer, I'd give it a thumbs up.			"

												Single player is worthless, the bot AI is so useless it's scary. But this game isn't about playing with bots, right? It's about playing with people. Don't get me wrong, LOCAL multiplayer is GREAT. Lots of fun. However, online multiplayer is absolutely the worst online gameplay of anything ever. The controls become completely unresponsive with connections of anything above 20-ish ping. In this day and age, when the majority of multiplayer gaming happens online, you'd think your netcode would be something important.I can't reccomend this game, because the only real way to play is with others, and with others it becomes impossible to play due to poop netcode. Stay away.			"

												in recent light of blizzards less popular work, dota 2, dropping, i thought that this game would be similar to dota. boy was i wrong. Hiroshima Nagasaki owner and CEO of blizzard, though worked on both games, made sure to vary between these two masterpieces. in this game, we follow main protagonist, Desmond Miles, as he trys to find himself in highschool, along the way, meeting new friends, sharing some goofs together, and even stealing the opposing high school's team mascot, Colin the Cran-raisin! You will experience a rollercoaster of emotions, from despair to helplessness. All in all this game is comparable to none other, leading me to hate it for its originality.			"

												My review used to say ""Don't play this, the netcode sucks""Well the netcode is fine now. At least in my experience. However, I can't find ANYONE at all to play against. On every single filter, I have to wait 20 minutes to get a game. My friends aren't even that lucky.That said, if you have friends, this is a game to get. It is fuuuun. It's so fun, that I hate how difficult it is to find a public game. Why can't I host a public game? Why can't I have an open slot for a stranger if I have two friends? Speedrunners does this perfectly. Why can't it be the same here.I rate this a neutral or horizontal thumbs. But that's not an option so I rate this a ""NO"" on the recommendation, with the exception being if you have 3 other friends, it's a must buy.Hopefully the community comes back one day but I doubt it.

These developers are really incompetent if they cannot make a 2D fighting game like this run on any modern computer. This game have nothing that should be graphically demanding. And my computer meet the minimum requirements.I asked Steam support for a refund but they don't answer my messages. The game was very expensive for what it is and i cannot play it.

												A very fun arcade-y game. The pixel art is great, the music too, the overall style is nice also.However, this game is missing depth. It does provide a fun party thing you could try with your friends but it does not make for a substantial, long-lasting experience. Once you figure out how to play as each character, there is not much else in the game left to do, there are not many techniques or ideas you could try once you got the basics done. So I would say it is good to get this game for you and your friends once it is on sale, it is still an excellent game, but do not expect to keep playing this game for hours.			"

												The only competetive multiplayer game you'll ever need.  Easy to pick up and tough to master, even several hours into the game I'm still discovering hidden tech.  I literally have friends over for Lethal League nights, that's how much we love it.  Think of it kinda like a fighting game with very simple mechanics, where the ability to think on your toes and trick your opponent is necessary without you having to study the frame data of 20+ characters to master it.Get this game, especially if it's on sale now.

												Lethal League is best described as ""Battle Squash"". Similar to the indoor sport, the object is to hit a ball as fast as you can so it will rebound towards your opponent, the only difference being that you are TRYING to hit them. It's the first fighting game I know of where player contact is actually very discouraged. The ball will gain speed with each hit, and with each character boasting their own unique 'special' moves, the game can get extremely tense very quickly. If you like fighting games, this translates very easily, and becomes basically hardcore tennis, where the object is to get the other player 'out' by hitting them with the ball. As you can imagine, with more speed, this becomes trickier, as the frame window where you can hit the ball is VERY small and requires a keen sense of timing. Very fun, very easy to get used to, and allowing up to four players at a time, which is very rare in the world of fighting games.			"

												Lethal league is the right mix of casual multiplayer fun, and competetive, high-skill-cieling competition. The local multiplayer works to perfection, and the game is amazingly full, even with only six playable characters as of now. Whether you enjoy the zen, back-and-forth projectile control, or the frame-and-pixel-perfect, high-octane action, this game can appeal to just about any gamer. It's easy to pick up, the controls are solid and fully rebindable, and with access to online play and a single-player challenge mode, this is one game that's hard to put down. I highly recommend lethal league.			"

This game is really quite awesome, It is a very simple concept but is the craziest thing to play when the ball is going about 2000 miles an hour. The game has a great soundtrack for it as well as some great levels that change depending on what happens in game (some environments get destroyed)  Only real problem i have is there isn't alot of longevity and could do with more characters and levels, even in DLC. Still though, it's a fun game to play for 20 or so minutes when you have some spare time!			"

												The world of hitting balls, may seem boring but it's not like any other game of baseball, you hit each other with it. Go against your friends online or go solo and battle the evil doombox, play as a baseball player, a table tennis master, a mutated happy man, a cyborg crocidile, a funky robot, and a music girl with a giant hammer.

												This game provides some hardcore skill-based fighting.  I especially appreciate the multiplayer option for one PC.  There is a really fun sense of barely-controlled chaos to this game, which makes it great fun for a couch full of friends.  I'm glad to have it installed on my PC, but it honestly is a second choice compared to other games like Towerfall or Rocket League.			"

												It's only been one day, but i'm already completely in love with this game. The feeling when you get the ball going at almost the speed of light is awesome, the character designs are awesome, and the game design itself is awesome. I do have one minor problem with the game though, one being that it seems Candyman is stronger than the rest of the characters at the moment, although that could very well be my imagination. Other than that, the multiplayer is just as fast as the challenge mode, with little to no lag in matches. If you were a fan of divekick or just like fighting games in general, I highly reccomend this.			"

												The love child of Super Smash Bros and brick break we never knew we would have wanted! Seriously this game is crazy fun!There's quite a bit to love with this game...with a coupe of things that i don't care for such as the limited character selection and kind of high learning curve but maybe i'm just nitpicking a bit much. Now for the good stuff, Stylistically the game is vibrant, colorful and fun which fits the game's tempo so to speak as well as the music which is awesome and fits the stages rather well, Not to mention how cool each of the characters are. I got the four pack for me and my buddies and it's makes for quite the game night!and lastly....it's a brand new way to beat your balls... :-)Also sidenote: Would totally cosplay as Latch.			"

												Here is my review of Lethal League, (for lazy people scroll down to the bottom for the pro's and con's) and I do hope to play it more in the future. I hope you like or find my review helpful, and if I do mess up or misspell something please don't bash me with mean things. :)Lethal League is a sort of arcade game, you don't exactly 'need' friends to play it with, although it is a thousand times more fun with friends you know, as the game has 4-player lobbies to enjoy. The map's don't change anything except the background much, but it is nice to have some variety. As for the characters, they are very interesting and each have their own special abilities, which you can get by hitting the ball 4 times in a row. They very well aid in your victory. I highly recommend you play with a controller, and yes of course, it has controller support, you can play with the keyboard and be very good still. Although me personally I am much better with a controller. It has pixel-style graphics, which I quite enjoy. Overall I would recommend this to anyone with friends and spare time, I would get it when it is on sale, although it's good for the price too, although I ran into a few bugs, when I made the game full screen it wouldn't let me move the mouse out of a certain box, making the game unplayable, I later fixed it by messing with the properties of the game. The second bug I ran into was the online, after a match if you didn't click the ready button in order from which you joined it lagged all of the players out, leaving the host with a new lobby screen. Although those are the only 2 bugs I ran into.Pros: -Nice graphic style -Feels like an arcade game-4 Player co-op-Interesting characters-Fun gameplay-A great time waster-Not too pricey Cons:-Not many game modes-Not many tweaks to the matches, making each match feel like the last one-A few irritating bugs-Online is a little buggy.

												Lethal League stands as one of my go-to games for friends that love the feel of fighting games, but hate the complicated inputs. I can't express to you how simple this game is, but how it can be taken to an entire new level, given enough experience. It's not just hitting a ball back and forth: it's timing your hits, learning the geometry of where the ball will bounce, positioning to make sure your hit connects.Great with 4 players, truly amazing with two. Grab two copies, play with a friend. I promise you won't be disappointed if you're even slightly interested.			"

												I liked the concept of the game, and had a lot of fun playing with three of my friends. I liked the overall design of the game including characters and music. I wish there were some more animations for the different directional hits. I felt like often when I was jumping, and trying to hit at the same time, it was difficult to connect. The hitboxes seem like they could use some tweaking. Overall we had a very good time playing the game and would absolutely recommend it and look forward to playing it again.			"

												On the surface it's a very simple and fun party game. However, if you scratch beyond the surface you'll find a very deep and complex game that is backed by many unofficial weekly and bi-weekly tourneys as well as annual official hosted tourneys.Every character feels unique and has its own advantages and disadvantages making for a fairly well balanced gameplay experience. Though some characters can more easily crush newbs easier, everything is balanced pretty well at the high level.The only thing really hurting the game is the small community, which is solved easily enough by just buying and playing the game yourself >=O			"

												Lethal League Is a fast paced pong like fighter. It has a SSB Melee look which is simple, yet fits well to the play style. Each game starts with someone hitting the ball Toward the other player/players, who then hits it back. The ball Increases in speed until someone gets hit. This is a great game to play when Bored or when you want to Goof off with friends. The small amount of playable characters Isnt so bad, Considering they all have differences between them. Over all I would say that this game is worth the buy, Although you might want to wait for the summer sale and get a 4 pack for you and your friends.			"

This didn't really surprise me, but it is pretty bad when the ball gets to the point of 1 frame windows to hit it.Other than that, it's a great arcade style game, with good music, animation, and gameplay. Even if it's not on sale, consider picking it up.			"

												A satisfying pseudo-fighting game in the vein of Divekick.Feels good to play, rounds get very fast even with 2 players, with up to 4 supported at once either locally or online. Simple, punchy, and hilarious to play. I'd like to see more characters, stages, and music added but as far as the gameplay goes it feels perfect.			"

												I learned of this game from watching TotalBiscuit's ""WTF is..."" about it and to me it seemed like a hilarious game concept.Now after about 3 hours spent in in, getting myself to lv10 I feel I can write a review of my own.This game is Awesome xDIt might seem simple, and it is, but sometimes simple fun is better than overly complicated things. In this game you fight your opponents by hitting a ball at them and that's it, on the surface. It's basically an easy to learn and hard to master game.Each character of the 5 you (at least currently) have to choose from has their own abilities, for one they all have different jumps of varying height and I think their movement speed varies too but it might be the visuals tricking me. On top of that they all have different special attacks, one makes the ball warp through the arena wall and come out on the other side, one double swings at the ball to increase the speed by ridiculous amounts and so on. Making use of those skills correctly is what will set you apart from the rest in the end.The game has a singleplayer component but I don't see why you'd wanna play against AI opponents in a game like this.The netcode for the multiplayer seems quite good, but it you want a lag free game I still recommend just going 1 vs 1. From what I gathered it's not perfected for more players yet but it's still posible to play a 4 player free for all with no issues, but know that there might be disconnects or desyncs happening in those.The visuals aren't amazing but for this kind of game they work quite well. Not all games has to be super flashy 3D and stuff, if the game works better with a simple 2D look then that's the better choise in my opinion.The music for the game is great. I haven't heard a track in there that I wish wasn't playing, overall really good sound effects too.I personally recommend playing on a controller but I'm sure it works fine on keyboard too, all keys are cusomizable for your comfort.Scores for those who need them:Graphics - 7 - It fits the style of the game but I'd be lying if I gave it a higher score.Sound and Music - 8.5 - Overall great, but not quite enough to get me to want the soundtrack.Gameplay - 9.5 - For such a simple game it's amazingly fun, probably even more so if you have three friends to play with.Overall score - 8.4 - I recommend you get it, if you're hesistant wait for a sale :D			"

												exactly what it says on the tin: ""no weak♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;.basically, if you've played and enjoyed pyro tennis on TF2, this is basically that but the rocket is a ball that bounces off walls. others have said it's like pong mixed with smash bros, which i also will agree works here.but the true genius lies in how simple, yet how complex this game is, for a game where the characters are only different in thier special move, and whatever special mobility they have. give it a go.EDIT: okay the characters also have differences in how they hit the ball. still pick this game up. we got a gator.

												Lethal League is probably one of the best local multiplayer games on steam. The soundtrack is great, the characters are great, everything is great.If I were to criticise anything, it would be that the character Candyman is a little over powered. He might need to be nerfed in the future.Overall, if you like local multiplayer brawlers like Super Smash Bros or Nidhogg, then you will probably enjoy Lethal League as well.			"

I had to do it manuallyCONs- only 6 characters- theres a solo ladder and a practice mode, but solo gameplay is kinda lacking- its charming and it is the fruit of a very skilled artist, but the characters has been drawn in paint- online works well, but there are no lobbies or chat- you can't just play while waiting for somebody to connect.

												Lethal League is a fast pace fighting game using Pong-Like Gameplay Mechanics.What makes Lethal League A Unique Fighting game is that no hand to hand combat is involved, only a baseball. Have you ever watched a anime or cartoon about fighting and they hit so hard the world shakes? Well thats how intense Lethal League is, Having the skill and timing to hit the ball alone makes lethal league good for Pros and the slow pace for new players is good too.When I first played Lethal League I instently knew how to play. Its a great game and really fun, get some friends and so them you can hit twice as hard as them.			"

												In this game you have to do two things:1) Hit the ball to turn it into your colour.2) Don't get hit by a ball that isn't your colour.Sound boring? A factual description often is. Now, every time the ball is hit, it gains 1 Mph (or is it Kph), if you hit it with a charge attack the speed increase varies from 2 Mph to double the current speed, the balls top speed is 1000000 (million) Mph. Now all you need is 3 friends and skype and this game quicly becomes the most friendship breaking, laughter inducing swear-fest since mario kart introduced blue shells.Put simply, this game is lan party heaven, its quick, has characters with unique specials and each game can last as little as 3 seconds, nobody cares about winning and everyone cares about fleeing from the little ball of doom! It is just fun, nothing else.Players have 5 characters to choose from at present:Raptor (aka cockblock) - a baseball bat toting kid who can intercept a ball before you have even finished hitting it, causing an instant K.O for you and can rebound off walls. Special move - Spin attack - massive increase to ball speed.Switch (aka Chav-o-tron 5000) - A skateboarding 'dude' robot who can skate on the roof (because reasons) and long reach to allow better reversal timing. Special move - Kickflip - double jump to reverse the ball in the direction it came from at double speed, oh so irritating.Candyman (aka DUDE! wtf is that!) - a cross eyed emoji that has possessed a ringmaster and stolen an old war vets cane who can jump high and float, peach style. Special move - it came from...behind! - turn the ball into a pac-man wannabee that can pass through walls and come out the opposite wall at the same speed and angle.Sonata (aka token) - The games only female, she carries a speaker modified into a two handed warhammer and can double jump, that hammer allows to increase the ball speed better than others but is slow to wield. Special move - sonic boom, launch the ball and stop it for an instant 3 times, at each pause the direction of the ball can be changed at will.Latch (aka Op POS) - A Beats wearing crocodile with a mecha tail that can latch (haha get it?) to a wall for as long as he wishes, slow attacks but second only to Sonata in strength - Special move - Don't be that guy - Eat the ball and carry it for 2 seconds before spitting it back out in the direction you choose, you can move normally while you have the ball and release it inside people for guaranteed K.O and loss of friends.~Round up~Story - N/A - there is a challenge mode with a boss, but thats not why anyone bought this gameGraphics - 9 - A comic book/graffiti style of cell shading that really fits the game.Sound - 7 - the music is fitting if not to my taste but the ball impact sounds soon drown that out, pro tip, turn volume to 50% before playing, seriously, that ♥♥♥♥ is LOUD!Gameplay - 10 - fast, fun and always entertaining.Overall - 9 - Don't play online, people are too good. As a game to play with friends over, this is a must, even if just to get people in the mood. add it to your wishlist. I SAID NOW!			"

												Don't underestimate this game. It's pretty simple to understand. But the things that can happen once you get a good game going...You might be just hitting a ball back and forth when all of the sudden your opponent and yourself are transported to a hellish psychdelic dimension where time means nothign and balls are faces.Get it cheap, get a friend, and have a good time.

												NOTE: This review was made during the current build of 8/24/16Lethal League is a 2D unique fighting game that has several similarities to other fighting games and even non-fighters. and has a unique gameplay style consisting of a single dodgeball that can be comboed. Other than that gameplay mechanic, the game itself is quite similar to Super Smash Bros. since the character moveset functions identical to it and the percentage/launch speed goes to the ball instead of the player, and the Stock/Time mechanic is still there, but instead uses rounds similar to other fighting games like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. The game has a special bar that functions like the PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale one since it increases while doing direct hits. The small but varied roster consists of iconic characters with there own unique gameplay styles and special moves. Maps are all very similar but have different height and width, but no real stage hazards. The soundtrack is a love/hate thing and is really just based on your taste of music. The art-style is nothing special and unique, but combined with the soundtrack, it feels like playing a fighting game based off of Jet Set Radio. However, the lack of content in this game is not really worth the price considering the low ammount of characters, stages, and things to unlock in this game. Overall, this is a peculiar but decent indie fighting game that should be bought when on sale, because of it being a bit overpriced for what it's worth.Verdict: 7/10 ""...a peculiar but decent indie fighting game that should be bought when on sale...""

												A simple premise, a very fun game. Lethal League puts you in control of one of multiple fun characters, playing a mix of dodgeball / squash against others. Expect essentialy a multiplayer game... single-player is available in the form of challenges, but it falls quite short of the game's true value (which resides in PvP). Choices go from simple 1 vs 1 matches, to all-out 2 vs 2 team fights.Very fast-paced, Lethal League plays just like a console fighting game, button-mashing included! You'll have to be precise in hitting the ball, while pulling serious acrobatics to avoid being hit. Each character has its own style and personality, making it fun to test them out. Also, special moves provide you with flashy high-powered attacks, sure to impress (or more accurately depress, if successful) your buddies.As a personal opinion, the game is best played locally against friends, something which will likely result in a lot of fun & mayhem. There is of course the option to play on public servers, but it can take a while to find a match, especially with a good connection (with lag and connection issues being commonly reported problems).

												I've been trying to find a great PC party game that doesn't need a lot of explanation for friends, and this one is it. The concept is simple enough, but there's a lot of skill that can be at play. Unlike Super Smash Bros and other fighting games, the moves you can use aren't complex (just three: jump, hit and bunt), so you can focus on playing the game rather than figuring out what all the buttons do.

												Lethal league is the right mix of casual multiplayer fun, and competetive, high-skill-cieling competition. The local multiplayer works to perfection, and the game is amazingly full, even with only six playable characters as of now. Whether you enjoy the zen, back-and-forth projectile control, or the frame-and-pixel-perfect, high-octane action, this game can appeal to just about any gamer. It's easy to pick up, the controls are solid and fully rebindable, and with access to online play and a single-player challenge mode, this is one game that's hard to put down. I highly recommend lethal league.			"

I like playing as female characters as their is only one. A soldier themed girl or an buble bee girl, just some more female characters would be nice. Also wish we could get a few more levels and songs. But those complaints are because I want to play more without it feel like its all the same.			"

												Here is my review of Lethal League, (for lazy people scroll down to the bottom for the pro's and con's) and I do hope to play it more in the future. I hope you like or find my review helpful, and if I do mess up or misspell something please don't bash me with mean things. :)Lethal League is a sort of arcade game, you don't exactly 'need' friends to play it with, although it is a thousand times more fun with friends you know, as the game has 4-player lobbies to enjoy. The map's don't change anything except the background much, but it is nice to have some variety. As for the characters, they are very interesting and each have their own special abilities, which you can get by hitting the ball 4 times in a row. They very well aid in your victory. I highly recommend you play with a controller, and yes of course, it has controller support, you can play with the keyboard and be very good still. Although me personally I am much better with a controller. It has pixel-style graphics, which I quite enjoy. Overall I would recommend this to anyone with friends and spare time, I would get it when it is on sale, although it's good for the price too, although I ran into a few bugs, when I made the game full screen it wouldn't let me move the mouse out of a certain box, making the game unplayable, I later fixed it by messing with the properties of the game. The second bug I ran into was the online, after a match if you didn't click the ready button in order from which you joined it lagged all of the players out, leaving the host with a new lobby screen. Although those are the only 2 bugs I ran into.Pros: -Nice graphic style -Feels like an arcade game-4 Player co-op-Interesting characters-Fun gameplay-A great time waster-Not too pricey Cons:-Not many game modes-Not many tweaks to the matches, making each match feel like the last one-A few irritating bugs-Online is a little buggy.

												The love child of Super Smash Bros and brick break we never knew we would have wanted! Seriously this game is crazy fun!There's quite a bit to love with this game...with a coupe of things that i don't care for such as the limited character selection and kind of high learning curve but maybe i'm just nitpicking a bit much. Now for the good stuff, Stylistically the game is vibrant, colorful and fun which fits the game's tempo so to speak as well as the music which is awesome and fits the stages rather well, Not to mention how cool each of the characters are. I got the four pack for me and my buddies and it's makes for quite the game night!and lastly....it's a brand new way to beat your balls... :-)Also sidenote: Would totally cosplay as Latch.			"

												    Although, at the current time I don't have much play time. (As of 12/31/14 I have 0.6 hours of gameplay) It didn't take me much to realize that this game, IS FREAKING AWESOME. I MEAN WITH ALL THE HIGH SPEED BALLS AND THE KICKIN' MUSIC. Oh, excuse me.    Anywho, the object of the game is to eliminate your opponent with a dodgeball that gains speed as you hit it a repetitive amount of times. You can charge up each shot by holding down the Z key (default key). You can play in either online mode or against bots, if you choose to face the bots you can increase their levels of difficulty. The maximum difficulty is 7. There are also ""flavors"" you can collect for each character as you level up in the game.    Overall, the game from my current view and experience with the game, I would recommend it for anyone. Whether you are a casual or competitive player.			"

												Lethal League is easily my favorite indie game of all time. It mixes an excellent blend of skill and experience into a game that is deceptively simple looking. Getting better at the game gives you a great sense of accomplishment as you go from helplessly spamming the swing key in your early days, to predicting the angle in which the ball will bounce off the walls and positioning yourself to intercept it before it even leaves your opponent's swing. Supported by a tight and friendly community, people can ask for practice or advice from people with far more experience than them.The only downside of the game is the cost and player count, which are not mutually exclusive. While you can still find players, it takes a few minutes rather than a few seconds from the glory days of the game. This can potentially make it harder for new players to get in, as they may have to choose whether to continue to play against someone who destroys them or potentially wait for 5+ minutes in a queue. It can be hard to justify a $14 purchase on a game where getting a fair, fast match isn't guaranteed. However, the game goes on sale fairly often. Despite these risks, I think that a purchase of Lethal League is one that somebody with a competetive spirit owes themselves. Even if you cannot find a game using matchmaking, it shouldn't be too hard to find someone willing to play in the multiple steam groups for the game. This game is legendary. Have fun.			"

												Extremely simple to learn, yet highly addictive. Depending on how you're playing and who you're playing against, this can be a great game to just take out some aggression with and turn your brain off while enjoying some sweet jams; or it can be an intense game of 'stay away from the ball'. I find the single-player challenge mode, well, challenging, and it keeps me coming back. I have come very close to beating it but haven't yet. The real heart of this game, though, is in its multiplayer and that's where the real fun begins. Waiting to get into a match with strangers can be annoying, as sometimes it seems no one is actually online to play, but playing with friends you're guaranteed to have some laughs.The whole thing is topped off with lots of style. It's a fun, frantic, silly game that I think everyone can enjoy.			"

												When it comes to fighting games, I'm not usually a huge fan. Lethal League brings a new and engaging twist to the idea: Instead of hitting each other with your fists, you hit a ball at them, and they can hit it back. It turns into a game of timing and skill, rather than just button mashing. A relatively easy concept to learn, but beyond that, there are plenty of ways you can go about out-balling your opponent. Very cool, and very fun.			"

												This is a strange mix of dodgeball with baseball and it is a very fun, competitive, game.Games may be played 1-on-1, 3 or 4 free for all, and 2-on-2.It is actually harder to master than one would expect, raising the competitive bar. Balance is akin to fightning games, with swings having a certain number of hit frames and recover frames. All characters have a special and parrying is possible (very few frames). Due to these mechanics, if you like fightning games you may like this one just for the balance itself. Each character has a different speed, hitting angle and style of jump.Can't say much more since the gameplay videos are pretty much explanatory. If it looks cool to you then you will probably like it.			"

												A great game to play with friends!Has a local and online modes, both are up to 4 players and are extremely fun!Really easy to learn the basics, but getting the timing right is not that easy (well, for me at least. And I'm not that good with games anyways, so don't count on that bit too much.)Singleplayer has a challenge mode where you go through a line of opponents. It's really great, too.I don't think I have anything bad to say about this game, but who knows what's wrong with it. I'm just writing this to say, that yes, this game is good in every aspect from my point of view. Try not to just count on one review, and go through videos, more reviews etc. to know if you really want it.			"

												A strange combination of Smash Bros and Dodgeball, Lethal League is a fast paced fighting game revolving around smacking balls at speeds of up to a million miles per hour right into your opponents noggin. Simple, but elegant.			"

												I enjoyed my time playing Lethal League, especially the local multiplayer. I'd reccommend it to anyone who enjoys competitive local multiplayer (Ex: worms, leiro, etc). My only problem with the game is its fps. When I first got the game, it ran amazingly well on my horrible PC, at a constant 60 fps. No hiccups or anything. But after leaving it to gather dust in my library for a few months, I decided I wanted to go back to it. But I booted up the game and, no matter what graphics settings it was set to, the game only ran at a maximum of 25 fps. Other than that, the game is great. By the way, if you happen to have a fix for the fps problem, it'd be greatly appreciated.EDIT: fps problem is completely fixed now for some reason.			"

												A fun game, with reasonably original gameplay. Does get a bit dull however as there are only a couple of gamemodes which are in essence similar, and only six characters and six arenas which offer little variety in styles and attitudes. If you have a friend or more for local co-op it is great fun. My girlfriend and I have had a lot of fun playing it on occassion for a laugh. After a couple of matches at a time (10mins or so) we do get bored, however. The music is not that great either, but that is my personal taste.6/10			"

												Lethal League is a mixture of tag, baseball, and deadly power. The game is fun and fast paced but after a while the limited features make it repetitive. For those who wish to have a quick escape and test of reaction time then this is for you, I am split between recommending and not because of how bare it is. If there are more features and characters added then I will back this game 100%.			"

And then you see your friend from the school ping-pong club, You invite him to play, He comes over. Then your ""war hardened"" grandma gets up off the bench and joins in as well. eventually you all start to walk home, and then out of the blue Deadmou5 comes walking down the street!!! Everybody starts asking for autographs but then everyone starts arguing over who gets the first autograph now everybody is trying to kill eachother (with the ball of course.) And deadmou5 has no choice but to retaliate. And then after the dust settles A WINNER IS YOU! but deadmou5 is now dead along with everybody else, so basicly all of that was pointless. 10/10 would m̶u̶r̶d̶e̶r̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶f̶a̶m̶i̶l̶y̶ play again.

												Lethal League feels like something from the 90s, like one of those arcade games at a laser tag place you would spend all your money at with a friend. It has that same feeling of nostalgia and fun, and if you get some friends to play it with it's a hella good time. Plus the soundtrack is wonderful!			"

												Game is pretty neat. I like the odd characters they are all different with looks and their specials. The main focus of the game is death match, I wish there were more modes. However when you get into some crazy match ups with the ball going at insane speeds. I like it I can't beat the challenge mode to save my life. However it's still pretty fun.			"

												This game is the most fun I have had in 1 sitting for a long whileBefore going into detail notes: - I played this with a only a PS2 style controller so far- The Mac and Linux versions of this game are in beta and currently available to everyone who opts into it from the game properties menuNow assuming you understand the basic mechanics of hit the other player with the ball but don’t get hitHere are some keypoints of the gameBall tagging-You cannot be hit by the ball if you hit it last (It will be highlighted in your team/player color) ^ this also might cause confusion if you switch around player slots allot or just use to the defaultRed color given to Player 1(This mechanic can be turn off but it might lead all sorts of weirdness since you now have to watch out for your own ball)You have 3 basic attacks, 1 character specific special attack and 1 hidden protection mechanism when hitting a ballBasics:-Basic hit: you hit the ball (duh). You increase the ball speed by one and most importantly while its being hit you can control the direction you want the ball to travel inCharge attacksNote: Hold down the button to charge your attack to increase the ball speed when hit (can only be double its speed + you are a sitting duck while doing this)-Power attack/Smash attack: same key as basic attack but with a catch, to achieve this you need to be midair and hold down a directional button of left, right and down Note: you cannot hit the ball going through you unless its taged as your ball (don’t be do something silly)]Note: This and charge attack doubles the ball current speed-Blunt: Rips the ball of most of all its momentum and makes it travel upwards at the speed of anybody who tosses a ball moderately into the air to catch it again. Notes: Tags the balls as your ownKey component to mess up the pacing for your own benefitYOU CAN CONTROL THE DIRECTION THE BALL FLIES TOWARDSThe ball will resume full speed when it hits the ground but will only travel in a up and down motionONLY use this when you have an opening due to the other players can take the ball for themselves while its midair-HIDDEN PROTECTION THINGParrying: When you are hit lag (when time freezes while hitting the ball) you can press the blunt button to create a parry which can stun your enemy players who attempt to hit the ball while you use a parry. More on it here (Its not in the tutorial)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YasRoOFQuYPlaylist for the OST https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeuvN1IQa_qei1GZQ-tPvaPmAN5Z-R3rOnline play : I haven’t touch it yet due to not having much interest with playing with random sub its there and fully functional (Not sure if online supports bots)Offline play: To set the point crystal clear, the AI in this game is very competent (even on low levels)2 Types of modes to play in Verses and ChallengeVerses: This is where you and your peers duke it out in the battle arena, very quick loading between matches and 3 game modes availableFree for all – Set stocks or time limited, last one on or the biggest MVP winsTeams – Same as before but you can have a buddy of human/machine or you can have a 3v1, it’s up to youStrikers – You’re playing soccer with a baseball, you cannot accidentally score for the enemy team and the targets on each side takes up a decent part of the wallChallenge mode: I would call this alternative training or the game’s “story mode”, in layman terms, you pick your characters and go up against a certain number of progressionaly harder foes with a limited amount of continuesConclusionI would recommended this game to casual as well as veterans mostly due to its “easy to pick up but hard to master” natureAlso this game IMO will be great for parties or if you have friends over and you want to create scene where people are cheering on how intense the game is becomingSorry but I haven’t proof read this review. I’ll maybe do it latter but atm I just want to get it out of the way and off my list of things to do			"

												Super Smash Bros, avec 4 gus maximum par combat, s'envoyant une balle de base-ball à grande vitesse. Le dernier en vie gagne.Demande des réflexes, du skill, jouable en local comme en ligne. Avec une DA et une bande son qui fait penser à Jet Set Radio.Toutefois, a l'heure de cette review, le roster est un peu faiblard (6 joueurs), et il manque un vrai mode aventure/solo. On a un mode arcade où l'on affronte l'I.A à la suite, mais ce point n'est pas très grave en soi.Egalement, étant donné ce point, le tarif de 12€ (ou plus, je ne me souviens plus) paraît un peu excessif. A prendre en promo, autour des 8€ ou moins.Mais il vaut réellement le coup, si vous aimez Smash Bros et les jeux de bagarre très fun. "

												Lethal League is unique, as far as I’m aware. It is, at heart, a fighting game that got confused somewhere along the line and wondered what it would be like if it was Pong. There are a set of characters, each with a unique move set, and their sole method of attack is manipulating a ball so that it hits their opponent. Every hit of the ball makes it faster and, thus, harder to avoid or hit back. Each player has a set of lives, one of which is lost each time they are knocked out by the ball. Once your life counter hits zero, you’re out, until only one player (or team) remains.You can read the full review here![spiritoftherobot.wordpress.com] "

												This is a strange mix of dodgeball with baseball and it is a very fun, competitive, game.Games may be played 1-on-1, 3 or 4 free for all, and 2-on-2.It is actually harder to master than one would expect, raising the competitive bar. Balance is akin to fightning games, with swings having a certain number of hit frames and recover frames. All characters have a special and parrying is possible (very few frames). Due to these mechanics, if you like fightning games you may like this one just for the balance itself. Each character has a different speed, hitting angle and style of jump.Can't say much more since the gameplay videos are pretty much explanatory. If it looks cool to you then you will probably like it.			"

And I'm not that good with games anyways, so don't count on that bit too much.)Singleplayer has a challenge mode where you go through a line of opponents. It's really great, too.I don't think I have anything bad to say about this game, but who knows what's wrong with it. I'm just writing this to say, that yes, this game is good in every aspect from my point of view. Try not to just count on one review, and go through videos, more reviews etc. to know if you really want it.			"

												One of the most original fighting games I've ever played.Simple to pick up yet deep in it's mechanics to be a contender with any other game in this genre.Immediately found its way into my regular rotation of fighting games when friends are over for fight nights.Plus, with steam library sharing as liberal as it is AND this games tiny install size and low system requirements you can pretty much get a match going anywhere you have access to a computer.Highly recommend this for anyone looking for another game that lets you relive the glory days of sitting on a couch next to your competitor smack talking and laughing the night away.I know how pretentious that sounds, but this game is so genuinely enjoyable that I'm 100% sincere in saying it.

You start bad, but much like smash brothers and the like, you get better and better with your reflexes allowing you to know exactly where the attack willhit/where the projectile will land/where the ball will be for you to hit. Fantastic game to say the least, very sad to not see a huge competetive community behind such an amazing game			"

												Very fun to play, but even more fun to master. This game requires a lot of skill, (and patience) to get good. There are times when I've been off by a split second, and I know it's my fault alone. The characters are balanced, and the art style is appealing. 8.5/10			"

												Super fun, whacky take on a blend of pong and 2D fighting. Great competition online and indescribably hype playing playing 4 players local too!I didn't have much issue with lag or anything like that online.The controls are simple, but, in a similar way to Smash Bros, the mastery of those controls can go on and on. You can really become an expert at your movement and positioning to set yourself apart from the other players. It's not all just goofy, non-sensical mayhem.The music is great; coherent with the cel-shaded art style.All-around, a very cleanly polished game in terms of art and mechanics, that ultimately provides a thrilling experience.

												I still cannot believe how quickly this game became such a competitive sport between me and my group of friends. While this game may appear simplistic at first, there's actually a ridiculous amount of depth and strategy to the gameplay. Timing, ball speed, bunting, faking, clashing, differences between upswings and downswings, each character's speed, jump height, hit box, swing box, special move, hit angle, and wall manuevering. If you wanna have a good time with your friends, then play this game. However, I highly recommend controllers			"

												I aboslutely love Indie games. This one is definitely one I recommend others to play.Unique 2D combat.Fly EDM Tunes for BGM.Fluid Controls.Local Co-Op.Though it lacks content, developers are adding more over time for free.Giving this indie title an 8/10 due to originality and replayability.
