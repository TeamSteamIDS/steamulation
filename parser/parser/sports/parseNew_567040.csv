												It's basic and simple but the edge I'd give it over golf with friends it has ball customization and having a level editor. However if your looking for a colorful polished game golf with friends is your game(i have both) but if can get over that factor and compare both side to side you'd see my point in which I have AffordaGolf taking it. The level editor is great letting you have free control over a map with the ability to publish it online for other to download. The maps to be made by the community are exciting to think about, especially the creative individuals who plan on making a map. Conclusion: Basic and simple 4/5 (Not enough polish)Also for multiplayer the ports must be set in manually to your router.  If you don't know how to port forward don't buy it.  "

												For $1.39 as a sale price, it's really hard to give AffordaGolf a thumbs down based on that alone.  Despite that price point, with Golf With Your Friends only being a few dollars more, I can't in good conscience recommend this.  I don't think the lack of being in Early Access should be a selling point when the game seriously lacks any level of polish or charm whatsoever, though I do understand and agree with the community's general frustration of the concept.  Props to the ball customization and having a level editor though, that was a nice touch, but an hour in and I've already made a simple map and got all the achieves.I mean, it's $1.39 right now.  If you're a mini golf fan, try it out.  Let's be real, we're splitting hairs over a super cheap game.  Just expect AffordaGolf to live up to its name.(and mad props to the dev for taking this in stride in a world full of games like No Man's Sky)			"

												It is a simple Mini Golf game that delivers what it promises and plays by the Mini Golf rules. You can play both alone or with more players, gives you the awesome option to customize your golf ball with colours or an uploaded image and let's you create and share your own maps. Also, great price. Recommended.			"

												AffordaGolf is a really fun, cheap-budget golf game. It's originality in the way you hit the ball just makes it better although the way you want to ball to go isnt the usual way but that is alright. I love how people can make custom courses so it makes it more challenging.			"

												This game is great! About the same as golf with your friends. Better features too. Only differnces, No Jumping and No Shapes. Port fowarding is needed to be done properly. look it up and it shows. Also People when they create maps just hit random map and publish it. It's a annoying thing really. You will love this game trust me, if you know how to play it.			"

												Seems decent for a game that just game out like 2 days ago. Got it on sale... Sure wish the matchmaking worked properly. My friends and I cannot even play locally. Just says ""failed to connect to server"". ports are open and everything. Inviting to game doesn't work, direct connect doesn't work. I really see the potential in this game, but right now, no, I cannot reccomend it. Also needs some sort of single player offline mode, in cases where i don't have internet access on my laptop.			"

												I could not be happier with this game. It is a lot of fun to play even by yourself. It has some missing features that are being added rather quickly since the game release on Fi, Desember 22. Overall, this game is really good! It has nice, scenic maps and simple gameplay. Nothing complex about it! Aim with your mouse, hit with the spacebar, and watch it go!I can also say that the developer is an amazing person that helps when he can. I am friends with him and accidentally drug him down a long ways with an error.Knowing that this is a new game, it has to get a little more popularized before you will see results in Multiplayer. You will mostly find Password Protected rooms. If there are no open rooms for anyone to go in, simply make one! And if no one joins, so be it. At least you can play with the hopes that someone might just have their golfball slam into yours, sending you off-course. :)			"
