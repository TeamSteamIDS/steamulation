Early Access Review
								At this time the game is mostly unplayable.  I seemed unable to pick up objects, had difficulty navigating, could never get my arms to orient correctly, etc, etc.  What is there though, I like.  The graphics are nice.  The atmosphere is creepy.  Seems to have potential.  Therefore, I suggest following the game and watching for updates.  Once the game is more playble in general, perhaps buy it then.  I bought this in early access so I can watch it improve over time.  Looking forward to that!If you have money to burn.  Buy it.Developer:  Please keep improving the product!!			"
