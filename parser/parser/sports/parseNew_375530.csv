								Turn-based football. You have time to think about your every move and feel the full control over your players. I am not FIFA fan, I don't even like football. But the way developers made the game totally won me over - it is a lot like chess (my favorite board game) but with elements of RPG like gaining levels of footballers and gaining skills and tallents for them. Moreover the developers are constantly improving the game to suit player's tastes (players can pick match duration in turns, will players playing on different position get a penalty for it, will there be injuries, how fast footballer's stamina will recover and more) and provide new options and additional content. And if there happens to be a bug from what I've seen they are fast to release a fix for it - usually within hours.I don't know if all the FIFA fans would like this a bit slower and more tactical version but I recommend it to all who like turn-based strategies and RPG-type of games, at least for me it was a fun new experience that may not have as many resource types like in other strategies (fame, money in this case) but is just as fun.

								The game puts you in the shoes of the general manager and coach of an amateur football team. Can you lead them all the way to the premier league? The team managing is interesting; upgrade your staff and stadium, develop your players or sell them you hire better ones. But the main focus of the game is the turn base matches which is surprinsingly addictive and tactical.Football tactics has a lot of depth, it rewards the player for doing their ""homeworks"" before each game. Adapting your formation to your opponent's and using your most relevant players really helps the achieve sucess. That makes for a great stategy game. Still in early access, the game is very stable. I mostly used the beta version and it crashed only once in almost 200 hours of gameplay. Had a few minors bugs that I'm sure will be fixed (some of them already are), but nothing serious or gamebreaking.Recommended for anyone who likes strategy and team management games. Thumbs up Creoteam! "

								I've been in love with football management sims since the days of One-Nil[www.myabandonware.com]. That's 1992, my friends.I've never enjoyed one as much as this one.This game is simple enough to play that you can jump right in and start playing. And if you want a casual experience, you can play this game like that. Don't think too much about your decisions, just pick what feels right. You can do that and have fun.Or, if you want a more analytical experience, you can take your time over each decision. You can put your roster into a spreadsheet, plan out which players you will develop and which ones you will sell, and when.You can crunch the numbers over the tactical decisions in the match. Do I take a shot from long range with my ACC 52 midfielder against his DEF 67 keeper, or is it better if I try a layoff pass through his center back to my forward, who can then try to score with a rainbow feint? You can do the math and figure out which one has a better chance at a goal--and also think about what position you leave the opponent with if you do not get a goal.In other words, you can play this game hardcore, and try to make the best decisions all the time (even though many of the decisions will defy exhaustive analysis), or you can play by the seat of your pants, and try to win by instincts. It is a remarkable acheivement to have created a game that can satisfy both types of play styles.You will like this game if you like:Turn-based tactics and strategy. (Even if you aren't a football fan, you will like this aspect, if you like turn-based squad tactics at all.)Roster management--balancing the need to win matches now with the need to develop your next generation of players.Elegant game design--something simple to learn, but deceptively complex beneath the surface. Every decision that confronts you offers enough options to be interesting, but not so many to be overwhelming.The challenge of taking the worst club in the lowest league and slowly building it into a continental champion.Replayability--start over with a new club and try a different strategy.Real club names and logos. It takes only a couple minutes to download the user mods with real names and logos for all of the clubs in all of the leagues. After all, isn't it more fun to take over West Bromwich Albion, with the throstle-on-a-hawthorn-branch logo, than some club named West Bromwich FC represented by a generic green eagle silhoutted atop a soccer ball?Things this game does not do:Pretty graphics. If you want eye candy, look elsewhere.""Realistic"" simulation. Players have four attributes, there are 10 different special abilities they can learn, and the pitch is a 10x7 grid. It certainly ""feels"" like football, but it is not a ""realistic"" simulation.Complex player relations. Players do their best, all the time, no matter what. You don't have to figure out how to motivate them, whom they like to play with, etc.Player contract negotiations. When you acquire a player he has a 1-year contract. When a contract is due to expire you can sign a new contract (1-3 years), let the player go, or sell him. The cost of the new contract depends on the footballer's level at the time of signing and the length of the contract. There's no negotiation.Media interactions. No press conferences, interviews, etc.The threat of getting sacked. It's your team. You make all the decisions, and you never lose your job.As of the date of this writing (April 29 2016), the game still has the Early Access tag, but it is really a complete game.The developers are adding additional features, but there isn't anything missing.

								Football Tactics:~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Always wanted to find out how the top coaches made it all the way to the Premier League? Well, don‚Äôt look further, they are all playing Football Tactics!!Football Tactics is a football manager game using a turn-based system during match day which gives this game its originality.First you will have to choose which team and in which country you will be playing. Then, the Amateur League will start. This league is realistically a tutorial and will help you to understand how to play the game and you will probably find it quite easy. As soon as you move up to the next league, the difficulty will increase straight away and you will be facing tougher opponents. In total, you have 5 leagues and 2 cups to play in and the aim is to reach and win the Premier League and the Cups, of course.The management aspect of the game has good depth but it is easy to use and understand. I really like it that way. You can . . . upgrade your stadium to get more attendance and revenue, upgrade your youth academy so you can find better young talents, purchase new players during the transfer window, get specific coaches and assistants so your players improve their skills (but you will need prestige points). How do you get prestige points, you may ask? Really simple, if the goal difference is  1 in your favour then you will get 1 prestige point. If you manage to finish the season in the top 3 teams, you will be rewarded with additional prestige points. Match day ‚Äì Each half will consist of 24 action moves to be used between each team, with a total of 48 moves per match. Remember, you and your opponent will use 3 action moves per turn. They are plenty of moves to make your mark and score goals. At the end of each match, your player will get experience points which in turn will help them to reach a higher level. If you win, you‚Äôll get higher experience points. The graphics are smooth and polished and the game runs well. This game is an early access and it is very impressive so far. Please bring on the full version, I can‚Äôt wait!Positives:~~~~~~~   -	Good and easy Football Management -	Turn-based match day-	Really fun to play-	Addictive and challenging-	Plenty of achievementsNegative:~~~~~~~ -	No trading cards9/10 Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE FOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

The mods made by the fans must now cover every league from all nations. The developer's update it regularly and if you find a problem, just post it in the discussion page or contact the developrs and it'll be sorted post haste. If this doesn't convince you to try it I'm out of ideas, suffice to say, buy the game and you won't be dissapointed			"

								Football Tactics is a turn based football game where you manage your own team from the start, from the lowest legugue and your target is to trainyour team to be best.In a game you can found 5 leagues and 2 cups. When you manage your own team you can build your station, develop a coach squad, buy players, train players, etc. For transfers and stadion you use your money, for developing your squad you need your prestige points.Matches look very simple - you have two half times, with 24 possible actions in each. In every turn you can do 3 moves. What you can do depends from the situation, for example you can pass, control the ball, power shot, etc. Also your players get TP points after matches and level up when earned enough amount of this. Also some your players can have special skills.The graphics in a game enough simple but looks nice. Sound also good.So my verdict +challenging and interesting+good manager system+Steam Workshop+steam achievements and trading cards- only single player mode - playing against other players would be interesting I think if you like a football you should try this game, as it looks very interesting and developers approached football in a different view. And I should say they done it well. This game now in EA, in a future there may be improvements -  multiplayer would be a good addition to the game, it could be really fun with friends.			"

Unfortunately the teams and players have non-official names, but modders on the Steam Workshop have already fixed that for most nations!			"

								THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS - EARLY ACCESS REVIEW, done Anno Domini 11/06/16Gents, you are aware that I bring justice with every review I make. If game sucks, I will bring the word that it sucks...This game I played half an hour and I can tell you already this is absolute gold nugget. I never buy things on Early Access, but this one made me change my mind. If you like turn based strategy and football this will be something to go for. So, it is not Fifa or other action minded games. This is for the smart part of the population, who can still play Fifa but can play something serious as well. Players have abilities, there is a statistics behind evey move, you have to think and plan your movement tactically. Plus, there is a steam workshop and people are bringing optimizations for free. Plus, this is being developed. The potential of the game is huge. I cannot believe I am actually praising game on Steam...Graphics is not top notch, it is hard to expect top notch graphics, however the game has decent graphics.Guys and girls, ladies and gents, the game is currently sold for 12 CHF (so 10 $ more or less). You should purchase it. It is worth more than 70% of all Steam games which are sold for that price.I do not know how deep the devs will take the game, but this has a huge potential. The time will tell.---------For Christ and glory! "

								Early Access on Steam has a notorious reputation for being a haven for dodgy developers and half-finished alpha prototypes that never make it into a Beta stage of play. Let me assure you: Football Tactics does not fall into this category. This is a game and development team that are doing EA right. But why listen to me? Take a look at the up-to-date demo provided here on the store page; visit the discussion forum to see how often the devs visit, respond and take in feedback; and look at the highly active workshop community - which the devs enjoy highlighting in announcements.This is a game community to rival any AAA title community.The game itself (as of Dec 30, 2016) is a highly polished turn-based strategy game. The demo lets you play a full season with all the bells and whistles, and if you do purchase the game, you can continue your saved game. As of writing I have started season 2 of my NCAA-mod game and I couldn't be happier with the state of play. The mod is brilliant in of itself, and the developers are looking at ways to incorporate even more community ideas based.It may seem like a turn-based strategy and a usually fast-paced sport like football shouldn't go hand-in-hand, but something just works. Somehow it blends well together and provides a challenging and unique take on not one but two genres. Players have unique stats for their positions which can be improved on through training and game-play, there are plenty of leagues incorporated into the game itself, and the newly implemented league editor encourages you to include leagues that may otherwise not be in the base game (like the NCAA). The UI is easy to navigate and lends itself to a simple to read yet still detailed enough management side of the game where you can build your strategy for match day via a formations menu. You can either be hands-on during match day, simulate or watch (and then intervene at your leisure). The AI, in my opinion, is well adjusted for each level of team and league I've played so far. Teams with good defense won't suddenly let you score goals, and you have to change up your tactics to suit your opponent. Gameplay is rewarding in its challenge.Football Tactics, as it stands, is a complete game that offers a refreshing take on the hundreds of other football titles out there. Fancy on building a team that resembles your favourite players, well you can, with the current build featuring a face editor. New features are promised as they come to light, and I think even when this game has left Early Access, we can look forward to many more features and content from the developers and the active community.This is a title that could change the landscape of a rather stagnant sports genre. RTS NFL? Yes please.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a very fun game. It is simple and elegant yet there is enough depth in the mechanics to provide good satisfication. I've only played the beta demo, just bought the full thing but I played a few seasons in that and the fundamental game mechanics were fun and I can only imagine it being better once I have access to greater amount of skills and management options that the full version allows. There is a real sense of progression and you find yourself invested in your team.EDITOkay I now have 10+ hours under my belt. So I just want to update this. I can confirm that the greater variety of skills as your team progresses increases the depth of the game and I'm still only in Division 2  so I imagine as I unlock some more or get better players that this will continue to increase.And I stand by my impressions from the beta demo. This is a very clever game design. It's easy to understand mechanics and interface but there is still a good deal of strategy involved.Now it's still not perfect. At the moment, the lowest two divisions are a push over but they have said they are going to update the game with a choice of weaker teams to start with for greater difficulty. It's good in a way because it gives you time to learn the game and it's far from overwhelming. You get hints and concise information game after game in your first season just so you learn the mechanics as you play. It's also not such a problem because the amauter league(lowest league) season is shorter than the higher divisions. That and you get more fame points (which you use to upgrade some aspects of your club) the more you win by so you are still interested in doing well even if the amaetur league doesn't really threaten to win the games.The AI does the occassional silly thing but it's no where near enough to ruin the experience.Finally I had my first crash just recently but it was after 10+ hours of play and 3 seasons in so it seems very stable for early access.I could have talked in more details about why I think the game is so cleverly designed and why this is a gem but this is already going on to long and I just want to be upfront. It's definetely worth the price, even in early access.			"

								I‚Äôm such a big fan of Sports Interactive‚Äòs Football Manager that when Creoteam approached me to cover their Football Tactics game rather than another game that I was hoping to feature developed by them that I was more than a little skeptical. Nothing is as in depth, serious and addictive in regards to football management games as good old FM. I‚Äôve played many hours in a number of other management games that attempt to push FM off of its porch but nothing has ever come close. I feared that Creoteam‚Äôs game was just going to end up being just another game that tried its best but fell woefully short. Thankfully I was quickly alleviated of my fears when I realized that that wasn‚Äôt what they were attempting to do at all. What their intention to create was a football management game that was much more accessible to all gamers ‚Äì not just football super fans ‚Äì as well as a game that was much more casual and nature and just an overall fun gaming experience.In many ways Football Tactics reminded me of a few of the older shareware football management games that I played in my teenage years. These were games that were nowhere close to the uber tight management games that FM and Out of the Park Baseball are producing today but they were games that I vividly remember sinking tens or even hundreds of hours into.  For a gamer and a sports nut this game has the potential, and already is for its stage of early access, to be a lot of fun. You don‚Äôt need everything to uber serious all of the time so the game is going to fit a very nice niche.The game plays out similarly to turn based combat games do on a grid with the obvious difference being that its football rather than an action-strategy game. Players have various different skills that are what you would expect from a football player with special skills such as shot cannon, lob passes, etc. giving the game some spice and flavor. Games are relatively quick affairs with some players feeling that they‚Äôre a little too short so perhaps an option to extend the game‚Äôs length ‚Äì which many sports titles currently allow ‚Äì perhaps being a nice option to appease them. I‚Äôd also like to see some more options within the game ‚Äì a few more moves added. However, I‚Äôve just been promoted out of the first league so more advanced techniques and skill may start becoming available as I progress during the game.I like the amount of options that have been developed outside of matches themselves. The full gamut of options for a football fan are present. You can play the transfer market ‚Äì buying better players and selling those that have been made redundant. You can also upgrade your club in a number of different ways. You can increase your seating capacity which will in turn increase the amount of money that you take at the gate. Improving your youth academy allows you to get better young footballers into the club. The first scout assistant decreases the age of players on the transfer list while the second scout assistant increases the number of players on the transfer list. Improving your major assistant enables substitutes to get experience after a match and finally positional coaches increase the amount of experience players get following matches.The game is already heavily Steamified with 51 achievements giving hunters something to aim for and there are eleven trading cards to get to collect a full set. Steam Workshop integration has already been added to the game so that players can create mods, leagues and other things to improve the game. Finally, leagues can be played by both a single player or multi player to add a more competitive spirit to the game. In all, I‚Äôm very impressed with the amount of work that has already been completed on the game. The game is feature complete as Creoteam promise but they want to add even more features and tools to the game to make it the best game that it can possibly be and that makes me excited.Although it probably wont replace Football Manager as my go to football management game it is a game that I return to time and again to experience its casual, smart and very well designed and develop footballing experience. A great game.For our epic giveaways and similar reviews head to http://www.steamified.com/To join in our fantastic community join our Steam group "

								Do you like Football Manager for deep management simulation, but wish there was a (much) simpler option? Do you like playing soccer games, like FIFA, but wish you could focus more on strategy rather than execution? If so, you'll probably enjoy this game. I love it! I wish it had more stat-tracking and history (e.g., career stats, hall of fame), but I think some of that will come in the future. As-is, it's a ton of fun, as long as you like your sports games heavier on strategy and light on graphics, action. When playing it, I feel like I'm playing a game of chess with my opponent. Moving players without the ball, luring defenders out of position, holding the ball and running out time. Except for the first league you start it, you won't win much by simply poundng the ball forward and shooting. You have to use trickery and deception to get your opponent to make a mistake and allow you a clear opportunity at goal. I recommend this game even in its early access form. I can't wait to see what the developers add in the future!			"

Early Access Review
								I've been with steam for several years now, likely from the beginning, and i have never written a review for a game until now. The very beginning of this game , is very simplistic, and it appears to me that by design, it starts to open up the deeper into the game you go. I honestly think what we have here is a very fun football game that is super simple to pick up and play. The skills your players possess, are easily forgotten to use and will be forgotten if you dont look up top to see what options are available to that player during the moving/shooting stage. The game does get tough, and i think it would take a long time to unlock /build up a team to being a powerhouse. But that in itself is the beauty of the game in a sense. Your team , once built to that power house, will feel like YOUR team. I really like this game. I think its one of the better time passers available on steam for the price. If i could add anything, maybe some career stats for your team, all time records etc....But in the end, i think its a job well done. Its not like they were trying to market a $60 game, but it almost feels like you ripped them off at the price it goes for. Well done, thank you Football Tactics.			"

								So I usually despise iOS games being sold over steam since Im PC-Masterrace.I also despise the modern gaming industry for pandering to the lowest common denominator when it comes to game complexityThe last game I gave a passing grade in modern times was Mount and Blade:Warband(I was tempted to say Jagged Alliance 1.13...)I've played Championship Manager since the 93/94 version on glorious MS-Dos, and I've despised that series since 2003, mostly due to the fact that it gives no proper feedback anymore to whether you won or lost due to player intervention or just hidden RNG mechanics. (that is actually hardwired to f*** you over to no fault of your own if you get a winning streak)I friggin' LOVE THIS GAME. Sure, its iOS, sure its modern gaming developers, but it actually got working complexity hidden beneath its shell.Oh, and ofcourse its actually more rewarding to play than any of the modern Football Manager iterations, which has lost all its gaming appeal. Why this is? Because the game will actually reward and show you that YOUR changes actually made a difference in the game.Turn based mechanics is the way to go for football managers, since Eidos/EA or whoever shitcompany is making that crap series doesn't realize that they are making a football manager GAME, not a football match simulator where every aspect of the gaming mechanics is hidden under the hood for nobody to ever see.Pros:-Game expands its mechanics as you play, so it will never feel overwhelming for a new player-Rewarding skill progression on players-Surprisingly decent animations and overall aestethics-Has that ""just one more turn"" feeling which all good turn-based games need.Cons:-Lack PC-gaming masterrace depth. (the 20+ years of headstart from the CM/Football Manager series when it comes to Transfer Market, Player Database, Stats, News, Random events, etc... Basically this game has all that CM/Football Manager does wrong right, and vice versa. Often to no fault of their own.)-Matches feel a bit ""short"" or like your managing a little league game.-Tactics might feel gimmicky if you are looking for realism.			"

								Well I always really liked the idea of a Football game (soccer in America) and I actually own quite a few of those games.But the problem I always had is the management was more of a headache and a bit too complex, and the actual football game (where you watch/play the game) was a bit too boring and drawn out.This game seems to have found a perfect 'level' of things, at least for me.The management is just the right amount of complexity where you feel like you are managing your team, but not so much complexity that you're too overwhelmed.And the games are engaging as you have to manage your 'tactics' ;) to move the ball around and get a goal, and controlling each player in a turn-based fashion and stuff like this is just satisfying all around.I really look forward to seeing the game grow and develop just a little bit more.(in particular the multiplayer as well as a few little tweaks to the game that are being mentioned on the forums already)For those curious how the actual matches work, there are a number of features and things that make it quite nicely complex, without being overwhelming.Every 'turn' in game is 2 minutes of time that goes by, out of the 45 minutes x2 halves.Each team gets 3 turns in a row, before passing control to the opposing team, you can end your 3-turn segment earlyif you wish.Each player has different skills, accuracy, control, defense, etc.. and these skills come into play, for example, when 'crossing' an opposing player in a match.So for example the opponent player has control of the ball.. and you want to take it from him.So you move your player up adjacent to the opposing player with the ball, using one of your three actions.Then you attempt to 'wrestle' the ball from him.Depending on each of your skill in Control, a dice will be rolled for each player, with a maximum possible roll depending on skill.So for example say the opponent with the ball has a maximum 'potential' roll of 30.Your 'attacking' player has a maximum potential roll of 25.You attempt to wrestle the ball, the dice is rolled (in the background, doesn't actually show the dice) then you roll a 25 (lucky) bu the opponent only rolls a 20.. you are successful at wrestling the ball from him, despite having lower skill.But it was still risky.With your third and last action you kick the ball towards the goal.There are several defense men and the goalie in the way.Each one has a maximum potential to block, and you have your potential to successfully kick.You roll a 20.. then the first defense player rolls a 15, then the second a 7, then the goalie a 17.Then that's it, the ball goes through and YOU SCORE!!!The matches are  engaging, the management is deep but not overly so.The game is just fun, and I can't wait for MP to be added, cause if done right, will make this game just great.Dev's are listening to minor issues, and improvements suggestions on the forums, and are very active.I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a good Football/Soccer experience that's fun and easy to get into,and possibly have been burned by other Football/Soccer games that were just too boring and un-engaging.

								Damn this game! I can't stop playing. I thought it was going to be just a simple turn-based football romp. As I continued to play, I realized how much depth there was to this game. There is so much to think about trying to match up players, picking offenses and defenses, hiring coaches, and those agonizing decisions like whether or not to sell off that star vet for the money and trust that new 19 year-old kid you just contracted. Then, should I use the money for better players or that new stadium? Decisions, decisions...			"

								It's a interesting idea, but it just doesn't really come together as a tactical game. The team building elements are solid, and if that type of game (manager game) is your thing, you might really like this. But, if you're looking for Blood Bowl Soccer without the blood, you're going to be disappointed. This just doesn't have that level of complexity, at least not yet. Maybe with some tweaking and fixing, this could be solid. As is, you only have three moves to make per turn, and you're supposed to be able to get more by executing skills, but rarely does this work, and there's really no explanation why. It basically ends being a matter of which team has better stats. The team with the better players can score easily with no real tactics, and the weaker team has few tools availble to stop them, or even slow them down.I'd like to recommend this game, and spent a fair amount of time playing it, but it's just not real good, yet....

								Turn based football sounds like a strange concept, but it's good fun. At first I played all of the games, taking my beloved Liverpool FC out of the Amateur leagues and into the first division. But then I realised that I didn't need to grind all of those games, I could simulate my way into the Premier League and beyond. I've found that the positioning isn't greatly important, but the skills definitely are. I just completed yet another season (2041/42!) where I finally won the treble: Premier League, Domestic Cup and Champions League. The only games I actually played were the two finals, and it isn't hard when you have Level 100 Attackers with 170+ Attack skill. This is a great little game that I've gotten a lot of enjoyment out of (23 hours and counting). One thing that is ridiculously imbalanced though is the way that you can pay 200 fame to buy your footballer until age 40 or 41. That could be 20 years away...and you'll soon max out your guys by their early to mid thirties, meaning that you've got a team full of David Beckhams, except that they're all actually as good as Luis Suarez. I think this needs a nerf!			"

								Great for an early access game!This game is really good fun. Obviously because it is early access, it has limits, and I've experienced two crashes so far. But other than this, I love the game. From the goofy animations, to the generic team names, it somewhat reminds me of the ""Sensible Soccer"" football game. If you are in to football, and like strategy based games, this is one for you. Unlike other early access games I have played, I find this to be very immersive and a good bit of fun. Even in the game they mention the new features we can expect soon!I only have a few improvements in mind, but in all honesty, this is one of my favourite games right now.			"

								Fun little game.Didn't realize it's still in early access, already feels like a finished game.Games themselfs are fun and there is quite a bit of ""tactics"" you can come up with to trick the opponent into moving his players in bad positions, pull fouls etc...Adapting to the opponents tactical positions before each match is worth it, and putting players with the right attributes/skills into the right positions on the pitch is essential.The game has also a managing part (transfers, training, sponsors, youth academy etc.) that fits in well.if you like soccer management / turn based games, this one's for you.

								Enjoys the pace and tactical gameplay of the game.Simple yet complex 'Board of Soccer'.Dedicted Dev always around to answer to queries and provide to the community.The actions and motions of those little men on the field, looks incredibly lifelike.Their postures, movement with the ball and jumping with joy, hype and breakdowns when they scores or gets denied are a joy to watch.Having a great time with playing Hard mode, one or two matches each day.Had more fun playing in the lower leagues, dominating it, slowly building up the club status, accumulating young talents before moving up the league ladders.Technical analysis and some luck are needed in most crucial club changing decision.Always think twice before using the hard earned fames and capital.Building a good foundation for the club status is key, acquiring and cultivating young talents periodically over the seasons to build up a youthful team, can lower the cost and a better foundation.Unless you like to just run thru the game quickly finishing it, can simply simulate decades of seasons in a less than a day, acquire the achievements and forget the game.*Newly added character customizations is very detail and precised My slow Hard mode playthrough of XAS youth team in the English Leagues.http://steamcommunity.com/app/375530/discussions/0/350544272221967526/Looking forward to more improvements and updates in the future,and thanks to those modder players putting up the mod logos for teams in workshop.Money well spent.Highly Recommended  to try the game.

								What a good game this is! I am in my third season, and have been promoted from League 4 to 3 to now to league 2.I fully expect to get creamed..as I have been taking most of the money I am making and upgrading my stadium. This will allow me, over time, to make even more money, and to be competitive at the higher leagues. The tactics feel just about right. There are 24 ""turns"" per half, and you get three turns to either score, or be forced to give the ball up to the other team. There are times when aggressive play and getting shots on goal are more preferred to try to hold onto the ball, or to dribble into the teeth of the defense. It all depends on your opposition, the score, the situation, or how bad you need to win! If you are ahead on aggregate 2-1, in the second leg of the FA Cup (or this games' equivalent), it may be better to play keepaway from the other team.All things considered..I have a TON of new games, including some excellent AAA titles...and I am playing this one instead! Buy this game. Now. If you're reading this, then this means you are a football fan. If you're a football fan, then simply pull the trigger and buy this game. It looks cheesy and arcadey, but the developers really have a nice vision for this game, and the gameplay is excellent. Buy it. Now.			"

								First of all it's in beta so you know it's not finished and all ... ButIt's a really nice game to play also in beta. The matches are short and really addictive.  Like others mentioned it's not that deep so once you understand how the game works you tend to do the same thing over and over again. But thats not too much of a problem I think. Also I miss random events it would be great if you could get mail where you have to deciede on what to do . I played with an all new Team and in the beginning it was pretty easy to win but after 3-4 seasons it got harder and harder because of new divions and stronger opponents. You can't just play 4 seasons and expect to get promoted every time, The Transfer system is also quite good, you really have to choose if you should sell your best player for 2 good players or stick with your best player. What I don't like about the game is the prestige : You can't just buy new Managers for Money  but with prestige. And you only get prestige if you win a game and the more goals you score the more prestige you get. But thats hard especially when you just got promoted then you play your games tie most of the time and for a win with 1 goal difference you only get 1 prestige (Every Upgrade costs 30 Prestige and when you win the cup there is no gain in prestige) . It would be nice to have an option where you can buy Managers with money or prestige . All in all a nice game for those of you who like tactical roundbased games			"

								EDIT:Some time has passed, and with the changes done - I think this game requires an updated review - so here it is :).It's a long review, so if you are discouraged by it - let me start with a SHORT STATEMENT ON WHY IT'S WORTH TO BUY THIS GAME:It's fun, it's engaging, it pulls you in from the first moment, not to mention the fact that the community and devs are really great. If you like football games, if you like tactical games, if you like games that take a cool new approach to stuff we know and love: buy it! You won't regret it! :)Oh, and kids - don't forget to sometimes turn off the computer and play some real football outside ;).ACTUAL REVIEW:This game is really impressive. For the last two hours I experience a heavy case of ""just... one... more... game..."". Brilliant.Football Tactics is fun. In a way that's the only review anyone needs. It's already pretty polished, and quite recently the devs added the options to not only edit names of your players, but also edit and create new Leagues, and publish them with the use of Steam Workshop. Which basically means I will soon publish my own version of Polish clubs :).The idea of Football Tactics is super simple: manage your club, and play games in a turn-based mode. It's done in a way that is easy to understand and get a grasp on, but at the same time it is complex enough to engage the player.For me - a football fan, and also a fan of football games - this one is a true gem. I can easily say that there are three football games I play: Football Manager, FIFA (on console) and Football Tactics. And yes - I feel safe mentioning Football Tactics together with those two huge titles. Because it gives me the same pleasure, although in a completely different, new way.Finally - I am VERY impressed by the developer. Amazingly responsive, very much engaged in the communication with the community (which you can also see below in the comments to my review :) ). My comment on strange names for Polish teams was instantly taken into account, and in following update the names were changed (with just some slight help from me, as I posted the changes in names, that I think should be done).I love gaming, and I do try many different games, and honestly - I rarely see so much dedication from the dev. It's simply great.For me this game comes back to the times when the idea and playability were the most important factors. And even though it's ""simple"" - it's very entertaining, and looks really nice.I can really recommend it.			"

								WOW !If you are old enough to fondly remember the original Football Manager by Kevin Toms then this will take you right back there.Naturally, it's a bit more elaborate but the basic idea is still there. The beauty of this game is it's simplicity. Enabling new players to quickly get to grips with the mechanics. Slowly progressing up through the ranks you will be enthralled & at times downright annoyed by those 'shock' results. Nonetheless you will progress each season & eventually lift those trophies.Althoigh i said 'slowly progressing' , you can finish an entire season on an hour or two. For me, that means many seasons can be completed in a day.I love this game.........10 / 10.			"

								Love this game!   It has many features that keep you interested in returning to it constantly, and I am not really a big soccer fan in the first place!  There are always things to do such as buying players, renewing contracts, training staff purchases, improving home stadiums.  Also the player face customization feature is outstanding in its depth of detail.  It really helps you bond with your playing staff at a whole different level - You almost don't want to sell them after you have been accostomed to them.  The match play is fairly quick (and exciting too) so you are not dwelling too much on the individual games as in the overall seasons standings which is nice.  I keep it at 48 moves which is the default setting for most realistic results and it seems to satisfy just fine.  A match is done in about 10 minutes or so.   A lot of depth can be had in setting up the right matchups against the different teams.  If you enjoy details and stats this is a great game - there is always something to do in between matches and the program leads and prompts you as to what is needed to be addressed in a timely manner.  2 thumbs up for this one!!

Mechanics include just enough chance to keep up the suspense but never feel unfair or random.You can customize your team, the experience progression makes you care for them and then you sell your best players for outrageously high amounts of money ;)The old football manager just-one-more-match-itch is very much there...It's still in Early Access though, so expect some (minor) issues: The most annoying thing I found was that the indicators for the outcome of a turn would show before the players actually moved on the pitch, thus killing the suspense of watching them. Though once you've gotten the hang of the mechanics and attributes you can toggle the indicators off in the options.			"

								*UPDATED* *11/9/2015*Football + Chess = Football Tactics. Played for few hours and I really enjoyed it. The depth in the game is quite good. Really makes you think twice before making a move and still can go wrong. Easy to get a grip of the game mechanices. Deploying the right players in the right position before starting the match is crucial. Can't change tactics during the match. Also have 3 type of training; attributes, skills and talent. During the match, skills will come handy and gives bonus when the skill performed perfectly. At the same time, players need to have good attributes to pull it off perfectly and even good players make mistakes in late game since their stamina gets low and it affects their attributes. And also after the match, they only recover a bit of their stamina lost each day till the next match and at the same training uses stamina. So its up to you whether you gonna rest the player or play for the next match. Tired player = poor performance. Players also gain experience after a match and level up. Levelling up unlocks skills and talents to be trained. Also have upgrade section; stadium capacity, coaches, assistant, scouts. Like I said, the depth in the game is quite good. The developers provided a lot features and in-depth game mechanics for an early access game. Will update my review after few more hours of gameplay. Just wanna see how the game progress.Verdict: Highly recommended UPDATE - 9/6/2015-------------After playing about 9 hours, I feel the game has a lot of potential. You can make changes to your tactics in the match but the changes will happen only after an event. Ex: after goal scored. It resets to your new tactic. As the game progress, it gets tough and feels more challenging. I like how the developers let lowest league to be easy. It give players some time to understand how things work and manage things. There are few things need tweaking. Like the chances of getting injured player (went a full season without injury), distribution of ""Fame"" points after match, expensive players and contract renewals. Developers has been helpful in the community, engaging with the players. Just few bugs here and there, developers promised to fix it in the next update release. Verdict: Highly recommendedUPDATE - 11/9/2015-------------Playing the game back after the update v0.3. So much improvements to the game mechanics. Addition of weather effects which increases probability of fouls and decreases passing ability, is a an excellent update. Make players to choose proper players for different matches. Injury mechanism is been improved. Players get injured and slowly recovers full stamina. Reward (money and fame points) has been improved. Youth Academy is been added which gives a youth player depending on the current club Youth Academy level, every half season. Better Youth Academy level = Better youth player levels. Now players are cheap to buy and cheap to renew contracts. Stadiums been updated too. Game feels more balanced now. Tiny bits of bugs and errors here and there, nothing major, still an excellent game.Verdict: Highly rcommended			"

								Nice little gem, when you like football, a bit of management and RPG elements and turn based tactical games.The game isn't perfect (yet), but it is so addictive and fun to play, that I'm very enjoying playing this game. It has multiple leagues (so promotion and relegation), and cup games. You can invest in your club and in your players, and buy or sell players on the market. It's also nice that this game has kinda realistic results. You can win or lose from teams that are bigger or smaller then you. Besides player stats and special skills, luck is also a factor in this game. Also, you don't have to manage your team in the game, you can let the AI play for you, which does most of the time well (but definitely has it flaws), or when you already ''owned'' the league (by promotion or winning the title) you can also simulate the match. Did it 1 time. Lost with 0-3 from a team 4 places below me and 1 star lower quality than my team. Didn't used that option after that again.Would I recommend this game? Hell yeah!			"

Level up your players by gaining experience in matches and teach your footballers skills to help change the tide of the game! Train your players and raise their attributes (stats), dependent on what position you are using them. The game uses hidden dice rolls to determine what happens, Would definitely recommend to any TBS fan.			"

								This game was originally an iOS title, normally when you see that on a Steam review it's synonymous with a bad port and terrible gameplay, not this time. I'm not sure under what circumstances the first iteration of this game folded but I'm glad it's back and that the developers seem to be really trying to make it work this time around. GAMEPLAY: Take chess, take football, take a little from strategy games like Blood Bowl and that's what this game is. I've been trying to get into Blood Bowl for quite some time but I find it too obscure and complicated. This has potentially a very rich tactical depth but is at the same time super easy to understand and after a couple matches you'll realize what the best strategies are (once PvP is introduce that depth will turn into a black hole of infinite posibilities). Also, it's nice because it feels like a full fledged turn based experience but every match can be played in a very short amount of time.INTERFACE: It's super obvious this is a port from a tablet game, but the developer has said they'll eventually introduce widescreen support. Other than that, I'm not bothered at all by the app feel of the interface, it would be awesome if they launched on iOS again and you could continue your league play on the go.OTHER: In its previous model, this game had a pay mechanic to grant you access to the best players, I never entered the PvP scene because the app crashed all the time and it was super annoying so I didn't inverst into it but that mechanic has been removed (at least until version 0.2). Oh and apparently they are working on Workshop support to personalize the content even further.To improve until final release:-Widescreen support-PvP as soon as possible-Certain minor bugs here and there (the developers seem active in correcting them though)My wishlist:-Local hotseat support-The ability to play with selected teams already at the top-Multiple save slotsTL;DR: If you like strategy games and you like football this game is the real deal. Best case scenario, you invest 13 bucks for a game that will eventually become a monster in strategy and sports gaming (the core gameplay certainly has the potential for that). Worst case scenario, the developers give up tomorrow and you invest 13 bucks in an amazing single player experience that even right now is very polished and very addicting.			"

								It is fun, rewarding, and challenging. Getting promoted, fighting to avoid relegation, coming back in yr 2 with a new strategy, selling big players to make the new strategy work, winning matches you would have lost last season.It's relatively simple on the surface, but rewards creative play and purposeful strategy. They're really doing this game right and I highly recommend if you like sport management games or even just sports games in general. The match play mechanis are really really fun.			"

								I was very surprised at how fun this game is. While it's still in Beta and there are a few things that I would like to have changed, it's current state is still fantastic. I have found myself with one-more-turn-itis too many times for me to feel comfortable telling you. Matches last about 20 minutes, which is well timed as it's short enough that you can squeeze in a match before going to work, or you can follow my example and spend all of your Saturday playing.			"

								Watch out highly addictive!When i first saw the game i had my doubts, it looked to simple. Comming from CM and FM i wanted something else, less complex in the sense of info. I found my game, Football tactics is a very very rewarding game. You start as low as you can and crawl your way up, slowly. The way you have control over the players both in game and how they develop gives a very personal touch. I love the way how you have to prioritise your clubs growth. Do you invest in youth, coaches, transfers, players, stadium etc etc. The flow of the game goes relatively fast, i am in my 3th season after 7.5 hours. I notice that there is alot more depth to it then meets the eye at first glance. Ones your players get a few skills all sort of tactical options open up and the good thing is they seem to work.Since you want to improve your club, a fast promotion to the highest league isn't the way to succes. This is the first football game where not promoting or even relagation doesn't make me go berserk :-)A lovely and very addictive game :-)			"

								A very addicting ""just one more turn"" kindofa game.  The games move by quickly though, so maybe a setting to add a few more rounds to the half would be nice.  The transfer market is good, and the weight between ""should I keep my highly skilled vet"" or ""sell him to land a young wonder-kid"" is spot-on.  I've played long enough to get my Amatuer side to the PL, and every season I find myself struggling with these choices.  It is a very simple system, but I have yet to crack the code on building a solid roster of wiley vets and up-and-comers.  My only knock would be some better documentation on pulling off the numerous skill moves.  It took me many seasons to get to where I could routinely pull-off 4 moves per round, but on the offensive side, the moves rarely pay off.  I made a lot of mistakes in building my roster though, so maybe I will start a new save.  One other added feature might be to be able to drop below 11 players on the roster to be able to sell off 2 players to get one higher quality one.  Overall though, a great time-killing game that could be perfect with just a few tweaks.  It's like a stream-lined cross between Civ V and Football Mgr.  This ia highly enjoyable alternate to those time consuming games.			"

								Early Access Version 0.2 review:Let me start by saying I am not much of a football fan at all. I mean I'll follow the world cup highlights, but that's about as far as I go. As far as gaming goes, I last seriously played Footbal Manager on Commodore 64, as later PC versions turned out just too tedious for me.But then I came across this. And *boom*, I love football again. Well done Creoteam, really well done. Why is it so good? Because it is simple, yet deep. Easy to grasp, but will take cunning and skill to master. First I spent an hour deciding on my club's name, fiddling with the colours and jerseys, then it plunges you straight into the competition. Only a few tabs, like the team roster with the basic pitch layout and who you want to play where, the training menu with just a couple options for each player, the buying/selling transfers one, the upgrade one and the league table and calendar. Nothing to get lost in, easy to keep all your players in mind and how to best use them in a game.And the game? A brilliantly simple concept.  3 actions per turn when you can try to take the ball from the other team, pass it, dribble or shoot. The skill of your player vs. the skill of the opposing player will determine if you will be successful. But whenever you score a goal, you're genuinely happy, because you executed a tactic perfectly.Even at version 0.2 the game is perfectly playable, the looks and animations are excellent for a simple-graphics game, you'll probably want to turn off the repetitive music after a half an hour, but otherwise it's great fun.

								Wow, as simple as it can look like from the beginning, this game is exceptionally well crafted alchemy of skills, perks and other RPG elements in well balanced cocktail of fun.I have real respect for developers which can develop game so simple to understand, with so simply and still pretty looking UI which is getting deeper and more complex while you dont feel they would be hanging you by hand.This game is like good play off chess.To simply describe it: You start with bunch of amateur players on some public park, getting new young members from watcher - pals, choosing what to train and getting skills.Every match means exp for your playing players, some money and ""fame"" while nothing of it is in the game just for effect.You'll find yourself thinking how could someone balance the game so simply and exactly together. Why cant i stop playing this?Every player is basically characterized only by 4 attributes: accuracy (shot), control, defense, passingEvery turn on field is counted on opposite attributes which are relevant to current action.For instance tackle is counted as defense of tackling player versus control of player with the ball. Then dice are rolled and result is counted by probability (difference of opposite attributes)Then you have passing, shooting, dribbling turn actions, or just control the ball to prepare your possession for opponent's turn.Then you can train certain skills (like perks) which you can use as extra (like special move, or special shot), you can specify players by this skill for certain things in the game, build whole team tactics.You can even use weather to alter your match tactic!I have to admit i didn't expect so addictive gameplay, i simply cannot stop playing it.Would recommend game like this again..

								As so many have said, fun and addictive.  I have played Football Manager for years, but starting a new team in that game always felt like such a chore: setting up all your scouts, poring over numbers on your youth team players, scouring the transfer market. In Football Tactics, these options are there to a certain extent, but you get into game and into your season so much more quickly. The integration with Steam Workshop is huge to allow for real logos and players to be in game and updated.I'm very excited to see how the developers take these great reviews during EA and add new features in the future. UPDATE: Since my initial review, the devs have continued to make outstanding improvements to the game, with improved animations, an incredible face design engine, and more to come. Nothing but good things to say about this game and its very-involved creators. Highly recommended!			"

								Some games are down to fast choices and split second moves. This is not Football Tactics. The level of skill to do well in this game in normal mode is pretty low. Why? Since your team improves by time more than the other NPC teams due to skill boosters... and then... ""everbody"" eventually will win it all... but thats part of the fun for most manager games?? Watching your own team win everything feels really good!Also the attacking and defending part is a bit ""strange"". Don't expect any offside calls in this game...But still!! This game was really entertaining for me. The hours I used on the game was a nice experience! I recommend this game to other users.Personally I would enjoy the game even more if I had the feeling my gaming skills would be the major impact to win... This is why I would give this game a score 4 of 6.			"

								I gave up on Football Manager because of complexity and it seemed too much like work.So I tried this game and it is FUN!First it does a simplified job of putting you in the Manager's seat using mainly two currencies, cash and fame.  Using these wisely goes a long way to having a successful team.Besides the enjoyment of managing your players, the tactical game for each match is easy to learn and yet seems to do a great job of duplicating what actually happens in real soccer games.   Plus turn based.And don't let your first game limit you.  When you decide to start a second game with a new team there are options to increase difficulty and make the actual games have more actions.  When I do take control of an actual game, it is very enjoyable.  Skills and talents become very important and result from good training and transfers.My first game, I have already completed nine seasons, and have grown attached to my players and feel the need to take charge in key games and tournaments.Summing up, FUN, easy to learn with good replayability, and time flys by.  Cannot stop playing!			"

								Warning: This Review of mine will be really long, but i suggest you read it completely. You will be informed and entertained!First of all:Wow! Definetly worth the Price for this Early Access (!) Game, if you¬¥re into Soccer Management and tactical Gameplay and want to see a well rounded Game for the asked Price!The Game:This Games Base is solid and working, both performance and mechanic-wise. I fell in love with what this Game is already and even more so with what this Game can definetly be in the Future.Football Tactics has, as i mentioned before, a good working and fun to play mechanic for the Games and the right Options on what to extend your Club on the management Side. There are real Choices to make, depending on your Play-Style, that make a Difference:Need stronger Defense to hold the stronger League you got promoted to? You can do that!Want even more dangerous Strikers to aim for the Title? You can do that!This Game is so solid Gameplay and Fun-wise, that i have to admit i feel flattered to see a Game that doesn¬¥t claim to be or tries to be more than it is.It¬¥s fun. It¬¥s engaging to see your Club develop. And you feel the Difference of stronger enemy Teams and Teams that you are supposed to win against.There is always a Chance to get behind when playing a supposedly weaker Enemy and always a minimal Chance to get a good Result against the overwhelming odds of a higher Class Opposition, if you have the right Idea and a bit of Luck. It¬¥s Soccer after all.All this without losing the importance of your Team Tactic and your Formation. In my first Season i made it to the second Round of the League Cup against all Odds, because i played with a 6-Man Defense and just tried to have as much Ball Posession as possbile. It was a boring 0-0 and i won in the Penalty Shootout. I¬¥m not a big Fan of this Tactic, but i won and got a big Load of Prestige, Experience and Money to invest into my Infrastrcture and my personal favorite: My Youth Team.So what are the Cons and what needs to be implemented to reach the maximal Potantial of this Game?Cons:As i mentioned: The game works perfectly and has a very solid and working Base + Fun-Experience, so it doesn¬¥t need any Fixes. Which bring me to the ""real"" Cons of this Game, which is Content and Multiplayer.Implementations (Cons 2):This Game needs Multiplayer! It just does! It¬¥s a shame to keep this Experience from the Multiplaying-Community! We Football/Soccer-Fanatics NEED to be able to measure our Skill against other non AI Opponents. Make it happen! It¬¥ll eventually make this Game way bigger than it is atm! Seriously!My Second Complaint is, that there isn¬¥t more of this Game. With this solid and well developed Gameplay-Base there just needs to be more Content.Examples:More active Skills for the Players than the few we have, even when this few are very nicely done. Also make the Skill a little deeper and not just dependend on Player Skill or his Stamina. Make (mainly for Multiplayer Reasons) Rock-Paper-Scissors like Skills, like a certain Striker Dribble-Skill is weak to certain defensive Skill, which will result in +50% Bonus on the Defenders Throw. That would make it a real mind Game on what to choose in a Situation for the Players and it would even influence tactical Choices, like in reality where a certain Player who normally isn¬¥t in the Starting Team gets thrown in, because he¬¥s good against a certain Player from the Enemy Team. Also, implement more Passive Skills, maybe to make certain Players able to move even 3 Fields in 1-Turn. That way you would get so much more tactical Variations and each Team would really have a unique Face and Style.In Short:- Make Multiplayer happen- More Content: More Active Skills, More Passive Skills, Deeper mechanics for SOME (!) of themIf you make this happen, this Game could really achieve more than anyone would think. At the Moment it¬¥s a good Game for a fair Price.It can be more though.Have a nice Day to everyone who managed to read this to the End :D			"

								This game is immense fun. Being a fan of strategy and of football, this game is perfect. So perfect in fact, that I've been playing it for 3 days and I still feel the same joy and drive to continue playing. For the Developers: The gameplay is great and i have no qualms about it. I just wish there were a bit more features in terms of the franchise details. I think adding some more in depth statistics would be pretty cool. I'd like to see my club's all time scorers or best goalkeepers. Stuff like that would be very welcome. Also, possibly naming the stadium would be cool. Nicknames for the players might be fun, too. And while i'm thinking about it, if there was an offseason bonus training thing where the player could manually add points to players, it would make specializing players easier.  The quarter and semifinal system is a little awkward. Having to play two games against the same team is a bit confusing. Making it a one game knockout would make winning vital rather than being able to lose a game. It would also be interesting if there was a world cup and national teams. Obviously, its not so much of a franchise type thing in that case. But, it's something to think about.All in all, I love the game. I wouldn't think of the above suggestions if i didn't. I look forward to new features, and to many more days of battling for position in the various leagues. Great job. Keep up the good work.			"

								This game is great - A simple football management game without the endless tedious micromanagement of the usual football games.I love the tactics side.  It seems overly basic at first, but the longer the game goes on, the more the possibilities open up. At first I would just punt the ball up to my best striker and hope for the best.  But now I'm finding myself running the ball down to the corners to cling on to a 1-0 lead - or pinballing the ball around in midfield to get the other team out of position.Although it is early access, it has no issues that i've come across (although a bit more depth & detail would improve things a bit).   Games are balanced - no stupid 10-0 games - and once you get the hang of using the special skills you can produce some magic on the pitch every now and then (yes i've punched the air on occasion).

								At first glance a fairly throwaway and simple game, Football Tactics slowly offers more than meets the eye, with the fundamental gameplay system being much more complex and deep than I first thought. This is all enhanced by a very good surrounding set of systems in the form of a nice career system, player development, transfer market and player/team editing features.Several minor negative points are that the game gets extremely easy once you have a good goalkeeper and at least one good striker, and also some minor graphical bugs and a solitary game crash in around 10 hours of play (Game autosaves every game so no lost progress).Overall a great little strategy football game, and looking forward to seeing how it evolves throughout Early Access.

Although I don't play a lot of sport game, I do enjoy RPG Turn Based games. I like to make choices, but knowing that your choices could be good or bad it's all based on you the player. And this is what this game does well. You have to make a team work well for you for each match, but at the same you have to plan ahead because have a team all in thier 30's isn't going to help you for long. Plus I also found that game doesn't reward too easily, which I think is a good thing becuase you have to your money, as well as your fame points carefully.However I will add, this isn't a realisic football game. Players will have positions but it's not like they have favoured spots (like to the right or left of the field). Another thing is that this game is more of a turn based game with elements of a football manager game, which does make it good, but it could be seen differently to players who play football manager games.Overall, it's a good game and knowing it's a early access game too means they are still improving on it. Either way, if this interests you, you may want to look into it. It's very different, but in a good way.			"

It takes time to build a winning team,but when you do, you feel like you have taken the world :)My tip,spend time and money/coins to upgrade the level of your youth players that comes a couple a times a season. saves a lot of money:)I bougt this game on a whim,when on sale. Knowing what I know now,i would have bought it retail and a lot sooner.			"

								At first glance a fairly throwaway and simple game, Football Tactics slowly offers more than meets the eye, with the fundamental gameplay system being much more complex and deep than I first thought. This is all enhanced by a very good surrounding set of systems in the form of a nice career system, player development, transfer market and player/team editing features.Several minor negative points are that the game gets extremely easy once you have a good goalkeeper and at least one good striker, and also some minor graphical bugs and a solitary game crash in around 10 hours of play (Game autosaves every game so no lost progress).Overall a great little strategy football game, and looking forward to seeing how it evolves throughout Early Access.

								ADD A MINIMUM NUMBER TO STATS! I'll have a player holding the ball gaining a boost of 20 to his control bringing the total to 45 and an opposing will player try to tackle to ball from me, and I'll roll a 1 or a 2 or some kind of bogus like that and that drastically less skilled player takes the ball. They should impliment some sort of minimum number either to training or uprades or even just have it initially so a forward with an accuracy of 53 can't roll a 1. Otherwise, fun game, neat idea, could see myself getting lost in a complete version for weeks.			"

								What a fun little game! It seems extremely simple at first (and you will breeze through the first league) but this hides a great tactical depth. You can trade players, develop special abilities (Slide tackle, Nutmeg, Lay-off pass), hire coaches to develop stats and upgrade your stadium. Each choice is consequential and you can play the style of football that you want.There are of course a few bugs and a few things feel slightly unbalanced, but this is already a fully functioning game. I am naturally leery of anything in Early Access (I am reviewing v0.2), but you can load this up and play right now, they even have a demo. I feel like I have already gotten my money's worth, so I am excited to see what improvements they put in place.			"

								Give this game a chance. I had Football Tactics on my wishlist for a year as I was very unsure about this game. Something about the screenshots and videos kept me away, the game looks so simple and childish (coming from a hard-boiled office excel, sorry, Football Manager veteran) my first thought was actually that this is just some poor tablet/mobile game ported to PC. How wrong was I.When I finally did buy this masterpiece (under heavy influence of alcohol and pressure from mates 1ft taller than me) I fell in love during the tutorial. After the first pass I made, I knew that this game was something extraordinary and it's safe to say that I'm indeed addicted. Even Football Manager doesn't give me as strong ""one more match"" feelings as this game.It may not really be a FOOTBALL game, how I see it football is just a way to justify the story (who would be interested in a game about rising through ranks of Chess League) as the game mechanics don't have too much in common with real-life football. Thus, when considering your next moves you shouldn't be listening your inner Guardiola telling you how each situation would round up in football.And that's exactly why playing Football Tactics is so refreshing, so rewarding and so addicting.

								What a fun little game!  It kind of reminds me of Blood Bowl where you have this rpg element of your players that learn skills.  My only gripe would be the that the halfs are a little short but I haven't played enough to really know if this is just right or or needs improvement.  It is pretty easy to learn but I imagine with the depth of the skills and some of the luck factor invovled ...this game appears to have some deeper elements.			"

Football tactics is a sort of chess game with football players except for the fact that a lot relies on luck when the dice are rolled. The game starts you off at the bottom league in the chosen country, you have to put up a formation, perhaps buy a few new players and learn the controls.While luck is definately a huge factor dont forget that each player has individual skills which can be trained as the player levels up, this adds to depth in terms of which options you have on the pitch. A match takes about 3-4 minutes to complete and time just flies away as you need to play just one more game.Its easy to play and far less complicated than chess, in fact its the light aspect of it which perhaps is the games biggest advantage, everyone can pick it up and have a go. As for the price, given the hours I have use I cant complain.The devs seem responsive and the beta has many new implementations which improve the game, youth academy, other ways of gaining fame (game currency for certain upgrades). Up to you to give the current release a go or try the beta.With much room for improvements and balance I still think this is a little gem, if you are a football fan you might love it.			"

								The problem with Football Tactics, simply put, is that it lacks depth. At its core this is supposed to be a turn based strategy game, yet it also tries to be as casual as possible. The movement is limited by the small pitch size and the relatively small choice of actions means that you'll be doing the same things over and over again. Since the game is heavily reliant on RNG you will usually have to play the numbers to have a shot at a consistently succesful season, which further limits your influence on the proceedings. Your players will, for large parts of the game, have only one skill and most situations are dictated by a singular attribute, so your decisions usually get simplified even further.Progress mostly comes from player stats, which give the game an RPG~ish touch, yet also seem to be mostly random. You can buy and sell players, but due to the way finances are set up you'll want to grow your own, which mostly means getting decent young players and leveling them up. Upon level up the player gets a semi random set of stat upgrades. Level ups come quite regularly but are usually pretty meager on their own (+1 to your primary stat seems to be the average), which means building up a team to take on the best opposition is a lengthy undertaking.On the plus side these may be things some players look for. There's minimal input on your end and yet, through unnecessarily grindy upgrades, there's some sense of progress (which you will attribute to your skill, even though you know better). I've put quite a few hours into the game while watching Netflix on my primary screen and I have to admit it's a great fit for that. The UI/graphics are simple yet pleasant and while the audio is laughable it's fortunately entirely irrelevant. It isn't punishing at all, there is no fail state and it will reward you just for being there, which I personally fail to appreciate but can still potentially see other people enjoying. Maybe I went in expecting the wrong thing. I read the name as if there was an emphasis on tactics, I thought of great games like Frozen Cortex or even Blood Bowl and while I never expected the game to have that kind of quality, this was stilll a huge let-down. I spent more than ten hours with it hoping for the game to improve towards the late game, but its inherently simple design stops it from ever becoming more than a casual side activity. I'd expect this kind of game to be on a mobile platform for around five bucks and I'd recommend it to the crowd that goes for those. For people looking for anything more than a time-killer I'd suggest staying away.			"

								To be clear, this game is fun. And it is possible to beat stronger teams with good tactics. I like the fact that if you study your opposition, look at their players and abilities, you can formulate a strategy to neutralize and even win, even against good teams. If you like strategy games, and football, you will probably enjoy this. Real life concepts, like using players to pull the defensive shape apart and then following on with players moving into the vacated space, work well. But I also feel that the RNG in terms of special abilities favors the AI. My players special skills fail routinely, even at full energy and against weak opposition, while the AI players seem to somehow manage to beat my rolls consistently, even when they have no business doing so. I'm not opposed to challenge, and I understand that it's not supposed to be a walk in the park in the higher divisions. But I do feel like even with perfect tactics, the AI sometimes decides their abilities are going to work, and mine will fail. Matches take between 10 and 20 minutes, which is great for just popping in and out. The tactics setup can be tedious, with lots of clicking through menus to line up your squad properly, but it's not a crippling feature. After a couple seasons, the difficulty ramps up considerably, and you will probably need to grind a couple campaigns just to bring the overall quality of your squad up to par. If you are enjoying the game, this probably won't bother you. But it can be frustrating to consistently run up against teams you simply cannot match up with, no matter your tactical brilliance. Like most games, the more time you put into it, the better you (and your squad) will get. All in all, I definitely recommend this game to football fans, or anyone who likes a simple (yet deeply challenging) strategy game. It's easy to learn, but there is a decent amount of depth in terms of lining up your squad to match up and defeat the oppostion. The devs seem to still be engaged, so perhaps the true 1.0 will be even better. Considering the price (I got it on sale for 11.99 US), this is a good investment.			"

								As a decade and a half long Football Manager player, this game does requires some adjustments in terms of how you understand football.Forget what you know about the classic formations, this will require something else. This is to the FM series what Blood Bowl would be to a NFL Manager game. Gameplay is pretty simple, but there's a bit of depth to the strategies, which is nice. Like anything that contains dice rolls, it can be frustrating at times when you have a great striker in the perfect position, which huge advantage, and he rolls a one out of 56, squandering the chance away. Still, early access, the devs are hard at working improving the game, and I can see this becoming a great title.Recommended. "

								Considering nowadays gaming industry where barely a day passes without another early access or AAA scandal Football Tactics suddenly comes along to reminding us of better days where developers created games out of passion and excitement for video games! The asking price of 15$ for this indie title is in my eyes almost too low, especially when I look at their crazy character creation editor which easily trumps many modern AAA games! In fact, there are so many options that I stopped bothering with getting through them all at some point to finally start playing the freaking game :). Steam Workshop has also alrdy many mods to get around license restrictions or in other words mods which override fantasy names in favor of RL football clubs and players! Like in XCOM have your protagonists the chance to learn many different special abilities to achieve your goals as a football club.. Your players have besides special abilties attributes like accuracy, defence, passing or ball control and it's up to you to use the right ability & right attribute at the right time, basically like XCOM in soccer jerseys.. There are minor issues here and there like the occasional line of second language type of english or insecure AI but it's, however still an EA indie title which tries to do an honest job and I applaud them for that! The only thing I should warn you about is that Football Tactics isn't a hardcore sport managament simulation nor a hardcore tactics game! The mix makes this game a decent casual experience!I'll let you know when I stumble over anything that might interfere with my recommendation in the future, cause I've got the feeling that the game might be too easy for turn-based veterans!

								Very cool game where you incorporate and then manage a soccer team from a grass-roots amateur club to a world class Premier League team. The management aspects of the game are simplified in contrast to simulation games that focus on that aspect alone, yet the experience is engaging and addictive. Games play out over the course of just a few minutes. These involve manipulating players in a turn based strategic mini-game where decision making, player stats and good old fashioned RNG dictate outcomes in equal part.Just one more turn/game/season. Minutes turn into hours. Very clever game.9/10			"

								This is cool. I prefer it to Football Manager. Take an amateur Sunday League team, name it, design your logo & strip, rename your players, and go play football! Sounds & animations are great. And the game actually simulates football tactics very well.			"

								Highly addictive, definitely feels like a ""easy to learn, hard to master"" title. Matches can be as quick or long as you decide, interesting mechanical depth regarding skills, offense vs defense contests and all the different options you have in terms of positioning, formation and mitigating bad luck on the dice rolls.Team management is done pretty well, with training, transfers, player age, match exposure, contracts, sponsors, and more. For an Early Access title, it feels like a complete game and the devs are proving that they have confidence in the future direction.If you like Club Football, tactical games and management sims, pick it up.

								This game has a lot of potential.  It seems to be quite hard to succeed early on, which could put some people off, but I like the fact that it has lots of features and depth while, at the same time, you can start playing right away without feeling that you need to read a 10 page manual or guide first.  I also like the fact that it is easy to edit things like player names, team names and leagues so that you can create your own fantasy teams and leagues.  This isn't Football Manager, nor does it claim to be - but even after playing for only a few hours (and getting thrashed by the AI on occasions) I feel that I am starting to learn the game, that there are many more things to discover and that I am going to have a lot of fun with this.For an early access game this seems pretty polished and  the devs clearly take an interest in feedback from players so if you like the sound of it after reading the game description and some of the other reviews here I think you'll find bit well worth the investment.

								I was expecting another cheap football game, but no! I was treated to something greater than my expectations. Football tactics is a well-crafted and fun game. The gameplay in this game is fantastic, I can just be lazy and simulate the match or I can go on the field and make the soccer players move around, experiencing the stadium and the crowd cheering upon a goal. There‚Äôs even an option to watch the AI make decisions for you. I can also make my own teams and use others made by the lovely people on workshop. I can also train my squad members to have new skills such as the tactical slide tackle or the powerful cannon shot. This game is the Wow Butter of steam, ""Wow! I can't believe it's not a flash game!"" I mean, Steam doesn't sell flash games... Right? Anyways back on track. I love being able to create my own club and form it in my decisions, the best part about football is when the Acorn Boy's representing Denmark murder London FC in a death match in my backyard. I mean, the checkered flag with a blue chicken on it raised from a deflated soccer ball made news headlines! I also love the fact that this game has weather. Weather in this game can affect your play through a lot. Rain decreases some stats for your players but gives a tactical advantage to you, as it affects the opposing team as well. Something that I don't like about the game is it's really hard to get money, ESPECIALLY in the beginning. This just frustrated me a bit and wasn't much of a problem. There was also some bugs that needed to be ironed out. For example whenever I open the club news or coach notes it goes on a spasm and keeps on flashing. Anyways this game is a definite 9/10, a solid game with amazing gameplay. Buy it now! (Sorry for bad English)			"

								This game feels almost like a halfway house between the Football Manager series and games like FIFA and PES. You get to create your own team (or mod in famous teams and players) and fight your way up your country's ladder in a turn-based football combat game.Sometimes, the lack of control from the turn-based nature of the game is frustrating, as it leaves you powerless when RNG-based intercept plays fail and you concede a goal, but on the whole the idea works and is well executed.Outside of matches there's also a fairly light team management sim going on, where you use ""fame"", ""fans"" and ""money"", basically 3 forms of currency, to expand your team and stadium and get better players. You also have the option to sign sponsorship agreements each season, which will dictate certain conditions to fulfill in order to get extra money. I feel this part of the game still needs more work, but it fits in fairly well overallThis review is from Early Access, so of course your mileage may vary, and the game is still subject to change.

								I like this game its FUN!!!  Definately a really nice change from the seriousness of THAT OTHER FOOTIE GAME?  Only thing is after getting promoted into the Football League I am suddenly totally out of my depth.  While I appreciate the divide at each level in the League I suddenly have players whizzing past my team including the goalie??  Sad Days!!!  All I can do is pass and shoot my team is old and I can't develop it quickly enough?  The only thing I would add is that while I can understand the increased cost of a coach at each level, I couldn't work out why all of the levels changed for all categories?  Surely the increased cost should only be added to each level?  Also the cost for ground improvements jump massively even at at Level 2!!!?  A trickly little game that seems well thought out I am intrigued.  The team play looks solid but the aunxillary elements of the game need to be tweaked in order to increase (albeit slim) of surviving even from the amateurs to the Football League, Burton, Fleetwood or early Cheltenam for example.  Keep up the good work - I think that you are on to a cheeky little winner!!!			"

								Let's start by comparing this game to a ""lightweight Bloodbowl with better AI"" and say I don't usually play heavy simulation games like Football Manager. So far, the gameplay is fun but lacks in depth for a strategy title. I would normally give a positive review for this game in early access, but I want to counter balance the very positive reviews it has so far, since I believe this game to be worth 80% positive votes instead of 94% (at time of this writing) with its current ""depth"". It does the job well as a soccer team simulation, my review focuses more on the ""strategy"" aspect of its categorization. If you like simulating games and managing a team, then I would bet this game is perfect for you. If you like levelling up your goons and playing deeply strategic games, especially turn based ones then keep reading.I enjoy playing it casually so far and after 7 hours I can say the difficulty curve increases with advancement. But not in a ""strategies become more important"" kind of way. It's all about my forward's accuracy vs the defenders defense. Wish me luck ! To be honest, I still have to fully realize the depth of strategical option, since I did about 4 seasons (with 3 different teams), so I haven't tried all the skills yet ... but right now I can only say, strategy in this game is very streamlined and the one best option is easy to identify with no reason I would stop spamming it in hopes of getting more goals. Basically, there's no real ""setting up for the goal"" since it comes down to getting the ball to the forward, get him as close as possible to the goal and shoot: from there, it's a skill throw for the shot and it's always boiled down to probabilities. I can score through 3 defenders on the other team if they are amateurs ... or it is impossible to score in season 2 against 3rd league teams until I have taken enough losses that my players have leveled up (which isn't the problem for me but a reality in this game).By changing a few mecanics, this title could become a very, very good turn based strategy title with light RPGs elements. But then it would become a lot more time consuming I guess, since they would have to give more actions, make actions harder, passes shorter, having other adjacent allies provide support automatically while having adjacent opposing players provide pressure automatically making actions harder, provide appropirate skills for all new concepts, etc. which would make games longer through the system AND mking you think about each move, to set the best probabilities for your actions.Conclusion: a negative review due to lack of depth in actual match gameplay. A good simulation title. Will play it casually and adjust review to a positive one if more depth is added to playing the game vs simulating it and making it more about team development.			"

								Football Tactics is a simple game of football team management and coaching. The goal, pun intended, is to move your club into the premier league of your nation to compete for the top championship. It will appeal to players who are fans of football and players whose time is limited to 30 minute play sessions. That‚Äôs about all the time you need to set your line, make a few improvements to your club, and play a match or two in Football Tactics. Compared to other football management sims, this game is simpler. For example, the footballers who populate your club‚Äôs lines have only four rated skills:  accuracy for shooting goals, passing to other teammates, defense for taking the ball from your opponents, and control for mainlining possession during an opponent‚Äôs defensive action. However, these four skills, tactics cards, tactics formations, and your players‚Äô age and energy level create on field challenges that are deeper than expected.  The matches are turn-based with each team alternating through 3 actions per side for a set number of actions per half. During one cycle you might have a mid-fielder pass to a forward, the forward dribble to get  a better shot angle, and then the forward make a precision shot on goal. Of course, the opposing team will try to counter your moves each step of the way. Off the field, club mangers can shop the transfer market, direct player training and development, and oversee expansion of the team‚Äôs fan base, coaching staff, and facility upgrades. The business model is easy to understand. The better players perform on the field the higher their price and trade value rises.  Put together a string of victories and your club‚Äôs fan base will grow helping you earn more from ticket sales for home games. In addition to money, your team will also earn prestige points that you can spend on team management decisions.Football Tactics includes stock leagues from around the world in addition to a growing number of national and international leagues that users are adding on Steam Workshop. If you don‚Äôt like your club‚Äôs name, kit, or logo, then you‚Äôre free to modify them in the in-game editor. Also, you can edit the names of team members, too. "

The Boy Done WellOf sedentary football technicians there are many, sitting amidst the plush comforts of their immovable habits, while boomingly piping up to the gaffer for that long awaited change. Yet, for ludophiles and enthusiasts, little remains other than to play ""Football manager,"" the lacklustre manager-mode in any reflex-based title, or simply have a go at some 2-bit ""Fantasy Football"" league somewhere in the dusty corners of the net.But lo-and-behold, when choices seem as meagre as empty mist-wrapped stands, when a hot soup-flask is not enough to warm your cockles, Creoteam come to the rescue with a more than interesting, even palatable, offer. ""Football Tactics"" is born, underrated hidden gem like Matthew Le Tissier, seemingly casual, at times unexpectedly difficult, always overwhelmingly addictive. ""Football Tactics"" is worthy of attention, and not only for fans of the game. The game plays out with familiar turn-based mechanics, a system encompassing rules seen in well known titles like Civilisation, X-Com or the recent Wastelands 2, but also adding some specials seen in systems employing the ""Active Time Battle"" combat. Yes, those are JRPGs more often than not, and this game makes use of abilities and talents in a similar manner.The all-too-familiar compulsion mechanics are there; win games, gain XP, level your footballers. Train one of four stats (Accuracy, Passing, Defense, Control) and mould the style of play which suits you. Play the Guardiola game by controlling the football with high ""Control"" and ""Passing"" stats. Or simply hoof the ball upfront with the ""Long Pass"" skill, and hope your lanky centre forward latches onto it. Want to keep possession? You can ""fortify"" your striker in the same way you fortify units in Civ, getting a ""Control"" bonus. Want to dribble past the whole back-four, like Diego did against Belgium? Use ""Raibow feint,"" one of the talents gained by levelling up your footballers.Granted there is still room for improvement here, like additional modes and a beefier, more-complex ruleset. As it stands, the game is breakable simply by upgrading your youth coach, waiting out promotion, farming XP, and building an all-star team which will waltz through the first two or three leagues, like a vintage Omar Sivori. But improvements are being made, and it really does look promising.Overall, amply recommended; among the big rubbish pile that is Early Access, there is a sparkle which gives us hope.			"

								Hi guys,Pressing needs to be fixed IMO - at the moment it doesn't really do anything. Perhaps when used it could cut off a greater angle of passing, to the point where the defence stat actually comes into play (maybe with a stat boost). Just simply too easy to bypass at the moment. Also Olympic Kick should NOT be able to go out for a corner, it's far too overpowered. I was playing a team who had 3 in a row and at some point one is going to go in. Corners are far too common for continual 80-90% chances.It should also be a little easier to sign good players. You start with most of a team which retires within a couple years, and all the decent replacements are like $200,000 each. That's far too much for a player in the first few seasons. Perhaps there should be more players from the get go in the transfer list.The fan accumulation needs tweaking too I think. I am in 2nd division im at 400 fans and falling. In 3rd division I was killing it and came into Div 2 and had nearly 800 fans. I'm now playing my 3rd season in Div 2 and my fans are halved from where I started. Surely by being in a better league you should gain followers rather than haemorrhage them. It makes it very difficult to progress when your cash stagnates.Other than that I love the game. Much more than I expected. However, maybe expand the youth system? Like you could have upgrades for more players per year coming in, and perhaps a pool of 3 or 5 etc players of which to choose one to promote. That could be fun and more control for the player. Maybe even the ability to do a training drill with them to boost stats???Anyway, just my thoughts.Cheers,A fan. "

								This game is GREAT!... It's turn Based Football and it's fantastic. The game machinates are very simple to learn and pic up, so you'll be playing and stargazing with in minutes. You can play with any of the pre-made teams, or make your own custom teams, player names, give them what ever logo you like, it's so cool. This is a very well made game, it's a gem for any game library.Now, 2 things the game doesn't have that I feel it should. It should have play by e-mail and connection by IP, that would make it even more awesome.The game is early access, but it feels like a completed game. You owe it to yourself to get this if you love turn based stratagy games and football.I wanted to update this review. I still like the game, I think it's great, but I warn any future buyers. If you like a challenge in your games and you don;t like when dev's nerf (making there game easy to please a few entitled gamers) there games you may want to skip this one. The devs made a change to the game because 2 players complained about a game mechanic. That's not a good way to developed imo.			"

								Pretty solid base game with a great potential. I enjoyed playing this. Only needs some work outside the pitch to get more variety and some tweaking. Winning a game in a simulation is too easy. I ended up simulating more and more because it gave me often better results a lot faster than actually playing the games myself. This killed the game in the end.			"

								What if Blood Bowl was about soccer? And what if it didn't have any dwarves or elves or whatever, but instead had Belgians and Costa Ricans, and instead of fighting maybe they could do special kicks or whatever, you know? And what if the systems weren't explained very well, and if the stats were not explained anywhere at all? It would be a lot like this game, I guess. And I'd be headed back to Blood Bowl for my games about made-up sports.			"

								Kk, I deleted my old review, since I felt it might have been harsh, so here I go again. The verdict is still the same (not recommended, at least at the moment), but I feel I now understand the game well enough to explain my reasons better.All in all, this game shows a lot of potential, and is fun to play, even now. The graphics and music are pretty much ""meh!"", as in pretty bad, but don't matter anyway, and don't really influence my opinion of the game. What does influence it, is the gameplay mechanics.Basically, this is a stripped-down / casual football manager. It really tries to be and look simple, but here is where I was starting to have problems. The first problem, and perhaps the major one, is that it doesn't really succeed in being simple, at least when it comes being intuitive and understandable. I've clocked countless hours of gameplay on plenty of versions of both football manager games and action soccer games, such as FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer in the past, so I dare claim to be able to learn such games quick and easy. Not with Football Tactics, though. For a game that presumes to be simple, there sure are quite a lot of reading materials. While some of the skills and moves are easy enough to figure out while playing, others aren't, so don't plan on just jumping in and figuring out as you go.The second problem regarding the game's presumed simple design, is that in some aspects, it is too simple. Soon enough, many things become tedious and tiresome, as the game becomes repetetive and dull. Some would choose the word 'boring'.My last issue with the game is its core gameplay component - how it deals with every action within the soccer games. While I can't provide any proof of any of this, as I don't have access to the game code, I feel very strongly that sometimes, in specific situations, the results don't make sense. I took quite a few games as test cases and explained this in much detail in the forums. I got some answers from the developers, but I still feel that while there's no bias to either side (I'm pretty sure the AI doesn't ""cheat""), some results don't make sense. As this game is still on ""Early Acess"" at the time of writing this review, I dare say that at least in my humble opinion, the AI needs work just as much as any other aspect of the game, if not more.Also, some interactive tutorials would be helpful as well. TL;DR - A promising game, but I suggest waiting for improvements, especially with the AI.			"

Early Access Review
								First things first: I gotta hand it to the devs for including American teams that are either close or spot on in terms of names of the MLS teams.  With a mod you can even get the real names and logos. The game is fun in a sort of ""mindless"" way and the games go by quickly so it can be addicting to just keep playing one more over and over. Now I have to list the negetives. THIS IS STILL WHEN IT'S IN EARLY ACCESS:1. MY overall experience so far is that the RNG is missing the ""random"" part. There have been way too many times where I'll have a range of 1-50 and the CPU will have a range of 1-9 and I end up with 8 and CPU gets 9. The RNG is tipped so much in favor of the CPU that I rarely ever try to cause these. Whenever I'm on offense I play it safe and do short passes through open space. This can easily be fixed throughout the Early Access so this might change. 2. As great as it is to see the team I follow in MLS in this game, I wish the players that were on the team in real life were in this game. I completely understand that this game doesn't have the license from MLS but they could still put similar names and similar attributes to the players. Small issue in the end but it'd be a nice addition.3. The game gives you three turns to move but I rarely find that it's enough. Occasionally you'll get lucky and the stars will allign or the CPU does something dumb and turns the ball over at midfield but most of the time they'll bring the ball to your box, miss and then youll spend three turns passing it up tp your forward when your turn ends. I understand that this could be to emulate how soccer games can be: two teams running the ball back and forth but the way it is now makes the game feel choppy instead of realistic. I think the best way to handle this since soccer is a game that's very much about movement is to borrow the turn based mode from XCOM: EU and have two actions per ""turn"" for the three players you choose. For example, using a through ball isn't possible unless your player has a certain trait learned which can take up to a full season to learn and it can only be used once a game. If the XCOM turn based mode was introduced you could have one guy run ad midfield and pass while  a striker ran to meet the ball and one time it at goal. The RNG really kills it for me bcause I haven't experience some of the one on one combat due to the high chance that my team will lose and concede a goal. As it stands, I can't reccommend the game right now. It feels like the goal was to make a simpler Football Manager 16 while also being more nuanced than the FIFA 16 Manager mode but IMO the game is an acrade game that relies too much on chance. I hope some of my issues are fixed because this has the potential to suck days of my life if I feel like my preperation of my team has an effect on the one on one duals.			"

								It's a really interesting game at first. As soon as you understand the rules, you can start to come up with several great tactics, but all of those allways come crumbling down because the cpu gets lucky shots all. the. time. Seriously, this is a tactics game that is lucky based and the dice seems to be loaded. If you ever play it, choose the option that restricts randomness. You'll lose to every team that's stronger than yours, but at least you'll have a shot agains the weaker ones.			"

The unlocked moves and upgrading coaches and facilities is very shallow. The interface is clearly meant for mobile devices. This would be a great game if it was free to play, but there wouldn't be enough unlockables to even warrant microtransactions. Without an almost ground up overhaul of the interface, I don't see myself enjoying the game.Edit: Apparently the first bit is meant as a tutorial.

								It's a decent simulation of short turn based soccer games.What makes it suck (to me at least, a big fan of 'boring' simulation/strategy games) is that you can't chose to stay in a league and farm your guys up. The jump in competition between Amateur league and the next one up is a little rediculous. I'm not sure if I'm missing something with training my players or earning money to get better players, but after amateurs Ijust lose every game. The opposing players have double of the main position stats. It's just not fun.The game would be a whole lot funner if you could chose what league you're in year to year. Instead it's just ""You did good in this league, here's the next one, go lose a lot"". It's a casual game. Let it be casual.If you like games with a really depressing grind, give it a go I guess. I'll honestly probably play it more...but only because it took me over 2 hours to find out the progression system.			"

								Ok game but not without its annoyances. For example progression through the leagues has a disproportionate increase in difficulty. Gameplay is fun for a while but some of the player stats are so random if feels as though they may as well not be there at all and 1st level skills are almost pointless at times. For example 1st level slide tackle almost always fails and players able to fend off multiple tackles with very low control stats. It feels as though one very good opposition player is enough to kill your team whilst your best players are easliy stopped. A defender can play in goal to the same level as he can in defence with no penalty. Plenty of room for improvement.			"

								I like the idea of it, soccer/football as a turn based strategy game. It just got old for me, really quickly.  Hard to recommend even for under $15 USD.Might be better as a mobile game to play when you're stuck somewhere with nothing else to do.Inazuma Eleven on the 3DS is more interesting as an alternative to games like FIFA and PES, and of course Football Manager is the place to go for more hardcore football management simulation.  This might fill a niche for casual gamers on the PC. It's not a bad game, it just won't keep me interested long.  It might help if it had an editor for customizing players, leagues, cities etc.			"

								The Skinny: Good polish to an interesting concept tagged and labeled as a genre bending tactical/strategy/rpg/sports simulation game. Confusing design decisions caused this title to suffer an identiy crisis deciding if it was going to be a casual or hardcore. Worse still the developers failed to circumvent some of the pitfalls that come with combining so many concepts together.Even More Skinny: This game feels alot like a very polished mobile phone freemium game without the microtransactions.I do of course approve of the developers excluding the microtransactions and the care they have taken in refining their product to be presented in a a concise and easy-to-use package.The Longer View:Tough game to pin down and fit into a Box but I will give it a shot...I would say this game is a Sports Simulation first and then a Strategy game consisting of some Turn-based RPG elements with a strong Tactical component. Conceptually it seems like an excellent foundation from which you could start building a very unique and deep game but I did not find there to be much complexity to any of the mechanics that were built on top of that great foundation. To me the concept of the game suggests and hints that this is going to be a hardcore crowd pleaser. However, from a presentation standpoint the UI, graphic design, and simplistic text descriptions of events/outcomes/etc. are all much more in line with a casual gaming experience usually found on a mobile phone or facebook game.  I can honestly say that I enjoy both casual phone games (the higher quality ones at least) and hardcore pc games. I will also say that all of the genre's I mentioned earlier are favorites of mine. but I feel that this game comes up short in the areas that usually make each of those genres fun and appealing.I Liked:Unique ConceptPlayer agency in chosing between a few different methods to build your squadTactics (I personally am going to buy your game if this is in the title and the screenshots/playthroughs/video is anything short of atrocious)RPG Elements blended with the Sports SimulatorUI and controls are streamlined perfectly (really well done)No MicrotransactionsAC/DC:Predomintly a Casual GameMedium-to-High RNG elementsGrindySound Effects/Music - I would say this aspect was OK but also somewhat sparse and repetitive (I play most sim games listening to a soundtrack of my own choosing anyway)But awwwwww C'mon:4 attributes are just not enough.....unless you have an excellent system of Special Abilites to compliment them...Special Abilities are a bit vanilla and many of the defensive ones pointlessNo real storyline feel and very limited options for customizations to ""create your own""Small size of the playing field grid limits optionsVery Limited Defensive OptionsFeels like a Hardcore Gaming Input is required b/c....Progression is slow and incrimentalDifficutly/Balancing Staggered Resulting in Long Periods of cruising followed by getting your face crushed once you've hit a (non-pay) wallJuxtaposition of the two points immediately above this oneThat last point was the real fun killer for me. Football Tactics fails in this regard by setting itself up with a freemium game structure in that you are either struggling to progress because you have not inserted enough currency (in this case time spent grinding) or blowing the competition out of the water because you have. The tactical aspects of games will occasionally allow for you to beat a superior opponent and it is at the moment Football Tactics shines brightest. This too comes with a pitfall unfortunately because of the limited amount of diversity offered in your player builds and to a lesser degree limited number of spaces and therefore movement on the field. The result is that there are a limited number of choices to your strategies and many of them will come down to attempting a similiar set of actions that rely more on maximizing your best chance at a good roll (RNG haters beware) than careful planning. I really felt like I was being punished by the game for succeeding with these tactics early on as it caused my squad to advance up the divisions twice in concurent seasons and left my underfunded squad facing more difficult odds (literally rng odds not tactical difficulties) than any tactical approach would be able to sufficiently overcome. Two comparision points I would like to bring up are the statistical heavy Football Manager Series and Tactical Aspects of Blood Bowl.  In a way I feel like Football Tactics is alot like playing a toned down version of the Football Manager series when your simulating games managing your squad, improving through the transfer windows, or youth player discoveries or in-squad development. The depth of the systems for Football Manager is really what makes it a game worth playing in the first place and again the lack of options present in Football Tactics prevents it from succeeding in the same way. As a Tactical Game Blood Bowl succeeds in the importance of placing your units in the correct spot is crucial because you are making a choice of influencing some control over a large amount of space (by spreading your characters out) or influencing a greater amount of control over a smaller area (keeping your units closer together). Football Tactics gives your units VERY limited influence over space and gives you a very limited field with which to work. When your opponent has the ball most of your units can only influence the space they occupy by being giving a chance to steal the ball if your opponent chooses to challenge that space by dribbling through it or passing almost directly through it. Most of the time this will not factor in as your opponent will choose to forgoe any chance of an interception by making a very safe pass (when a more direct approach is necessary in terms of scoreline/time managment) or simply dribbling past your player. Defenders have the ability to influence shots that cross the spot next to them which is a good start but why do they allow the ball carrier to dribble into that same space without interference? It just does not work for me to have a game labeled as TACTICS and have such a limited number of tactical options.Casual FM with a Turn-based Tactics similiar to Blood Bowl sounded like a sure-fire winning column title in my book but the pace of progression/balancing aspects and strange design choices really drag this one down in the mud. This is still early access stage so things could improve but baring some momnumental shift in the game design and direction I can not see my opinion changing at this point. Would love to be proved wrong here btw. I am really hoping to see a sequel/reboot/clone that adds depth pop up and deliver on the substantial amount of promise I see unfufilled here. Points for UI streamlining and original concept though....3.5/10			"

								Might be ok when finished, but right now far from it.Close to zero variation in gameplay, the ""RPG""-system feels shallow and it's not the prettiest thing I've ever played.I have no idea how good it will be when (and if) it comes out of early access, however I know I won't play it until such a time.Instant turn off.

								There is little to no tactics in this game, the field is way too small for that.Basicly it's just a dice roll game with some ""cute"" visuals with a football backgroundIt will probably make a decent mobile game once it hits release. I would not recommend buying this if you're looking for any kind of turn by turn tactic game. Your end up simulating all your games and all you do is spamming buttons to spend the money and fame you get by winning matches.			"

								Nice idea with a lot of potential, sadly the game at the current state is really one-dimensional and gets boring within an hour. There's no real tactics/strategy, it's all based on luck, and the 3-turn-per-round-rule doesn't allow for anything fancy at all. Plus, as every action takes up minutes, you arithmetically can't win higher than like 3-0, maybe 4-0 if you are really lucky. No real surprises in the game, and nothing that would make you log back in again. - While I gladly gave my $15 for the nice idea and maybe something better in the future, I really can't recommend this game at all to anybody else.[Edit:] I appreciate the developers answering negative feedbacks/recommendations. While I played the game a tiny bit longer now, I still feel that (a) match times are not long enough, and (b) actions always seem to consume the same amount if game time - I think the game would benefit highly from making actions using up time in certain ranges, aka 1-5 minutes, this would also give some games the feeling of lasting ""forever"" and others to be rather short - just like in real ilfe. :) - Anyways, for the polite and professional answer I change my recommendation, although I personally do not think this will be my next ""big love"". Good luck to you guys though!			"

								The ammount of problems with this game is ridiculous. We can start with how extremely unbalanced this game is while the developers are worrying about new haircuts and things unimportant the quality of the game is boredering unplayable. I find myself losing 8 out of 10 50/50's to the A.I whilst winning just as bad against them. 60+ defenders losing out to a 29 accuracy forward using power shot and everytime is a corner so that the A.I can randomly inject a +50 control mid to my box. Extremly unbalanced. the first 20 hours of gameplay I have come to the conclusion that this game is bordering a scam, Selling ppl on the idea they can customize their footballers even though u cant even see it in the game hardly when you should be focusing on making this game feel like football. Not just a board game with a football skin. Thank you and please be more passionate with your productions. I am positive you would end up making more money than continuing to scam ppl on a game that might be worth 4.99 instead of a real game price. this is just a huuuuuuge mini game.. You can only buy like 10 transfers to start things off and 9 of them are pay to win players you can't afford for another 5 seasons. GTFO			"

								Needs more Tactics and less Football!This game plays far too much like an ordinary sports game, just turn-based.  The skills your players can learn are pathetically bland.  The player customization is lackluster.  The management level is very shallow.  All you can do is buy a few upgrades that are very expensive and only marginally help you.  There are ""classes"" in this game.  Guess what they are.  Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper.  That's it.  I wasn't expecting wizards and robots and zombies, but come on.  This is just turn-based soccer.  Sure, it's fun for a bit, but after a few hours you will have experienced everything the game has to offer.			"

								I agree 'Football Tactics' is turn-based, but I don't think the word strategy really describes this game.  It is very difficult to build a coherent strategy when you only have 3 available actions every time it becomes your turn. (Moving a player one square counts as an action.) because of this every game plays out in the same way.- Get the ball- Pass to striker- Shoot from outside boxThe AI also plays with this same strategy. If it fails, try it again next turn. The game introduced  a few special skills that your players can learn. But often it feels very limited in terms of which skills which player can learn.Player improvements are incredibly simplistic and within about 30 minutes I'd noticed a flaw in tthe club improvements.This game may improve, but it would require a radical redesign of the basic gameplay in order to do so.

								This game is wonderful. It is a remider to the older editions of EA Sports' manageer series while at the  same time exploring a Blood Bowl-style tactical scheme. The idea is simply brilliant. Yes, it's still in development, but contrary to many, many games on steam, the developers don't throw a half-finished product at us just trying to reap money - the game in its present state is highly enjoyable, which of course leaves the playerr hanging on, hoping more features will be added. This has the potential to be a great game and maybe even one day filling the slot that EA Sports left when they discontinued their manager line.			"

								Combining RPG elements with tactical grid-based football is something I'd never have thought of as being good, but after playing 6 hours just since last night, It definitely works well. Alot of clubs seem to have a variation of the Arsenal logo, which I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, just something I noticed. The one major downside comes with the aforementioned RPG elements. There doesn't seem to be any set rules in regards to the statistics, and how they determine the success of a particular action. The dice rolls are WAY too random, which I imagine is to simulate the randomness of real life football, but when your striker with almost 100 accuracy gets his shot blocked by a defender with 20 defense becasue his stat randomly plummets to 5 there's something inherently wrong. To summarize, great idea, but the dice rolls are frustratingly random which makes it feel more like a luck simulator than a football game. Still can't stop playing so the devs must have done something right.Also, no Bohemians for Irish league, whats up with that?Edit: I should have known to check the options before posting. And the community change to Irish league adds to the awesomeness. Now I can fully recommend this game. Thanks for the addictive football, developers. Hope there's more to come =D			"

The only thing i think is missing is the option to vary the length of the match itself, so that you get a chance to try more  moves & tactics on the pitch against a tough opponent. I really  recommened this game to any football fan who loves fun football games.			"

								This game is great.  Strategy in game is good.  Team building strategy off the field is also key.  If i could offer one suggestion as a stats junky I'd love to have all the stats for all my players.  It'd be cool to track the tackles of my midfielders and forwards.  Assists from defenders is a rarity for me though.  Considering thats about the extent of my criticism....this game is great. thats really all there is to it.			"

								Have only played about 3 hours into the game, but it is a great tactical sport sim.  When I had played FIFA in the past I had always wanted for a game to be released where you can slow things down and really give a tactical look at the progression of the game.  Sometimes you are going to want to spread the defense out and attack out wide and sometimes you might just want to overload players into the attack, it all depends on how the other taem is lined up.  It is great being able to upgrade a club in all aspects from training staff to stadium upgrades.   Multiplayer would be a great addition to an already fun game.			"

								So simple, and yet so addictive.Sound and graphics are.......well......very basic - but the gameplay more than makes up for it.The price seems a little high for such a small game, but the devs are still adding features.I'm hoping for more advanced starting line-ups to come, as you're kind of limited to the basic Defence/Midfielf/Attack formations. I wanted to use a 4-1-2-1-2, but the starting grid wouldn't allow it.Nevertheless.....I can't put the game down.It has a 'just one more game' feel.EDIT: So, I maxed my team out, with every player at level 100 - both skills maxed on every player.I hardlly ever draw or lose a game now.....only challenge is to start over.And there's no Champions League!Once you get to the top of Premier League, that's it. Nothing more to play for, except the next championship and National Cup.Needs more endgame challenges!			"

								*EARLY ACCESS REVIEW*I really like the idea of turn-based football - it brings back the tactical part to the game, instead of rewarding skilled players as other football games do. I really enjoy the aesthetics, the system and the advancement rate.The game could definitely do better with a bit more depth: maybe recording all statistics for players regardless of their position, or allowing to change their roles (DF into MF, for example). I would really love to be able to review my club's historical players and data.What I think could really improve the game, is reducing the RNG's weight, especially for the use of skills/special techniques, which completely ignore the relative level of the players involved.Overall, I liked the game but it needs a lot more work, and I think it's headed in the right direction. At list in my personal experience, the Devs have promptly replied and guided me, and I feel my feedback may help improve the final product :)			"

								Well as the game asks us to write a review, then here we go. Football tactics won't blow the socks off the genre... FM 2090 will probably do that if everyone keeps giving them the same money every year for the same game. Football Tactics is different, not as intense or xl orientated. However, this is where it hangs....I don't know how long the interest level will be there. It looks and plays like a tablet orientated game....it could be deeper...it is in early access, I haven't read the road map tbh. So what does it give.... 1. The price - Well worth the money in the current state...think of it as a couple of bottles of wine...this certainly competes with the interest level...and I don't think I will have a headache tomorrow. 2. Concept - It is a different view on sports management. 3. Fun - Yes I am actually cheering on my eric cantona when he passes to keegan...who then rainbow feints for his hat trick.... 4. Progression - Yes your stars can gain match winning talents with training. However...........tactics are slim...and it becomes a game of draughts rather than football, rainbow feinting a goal keeper is good ONCE....twice or thrice is a bit of 'win button'. The graphics are not amazing, but then again I didn't expect or want them to be...but maybe a strategic decision has to be made by the Devs...Do you wanna have the pro ev character builder or go the evil genius fun cartoon style..I personally would advise you to go for the latter. I have only just begun the path of glory and yes, I can imagine that the games can get harder in the top leagues...but the number of turns is sometimes frustrating for armchair tacticians....wider pitch(i.e more squares) or more turns per half..(maybe ther eis a setting I havent looked yet...). Summary is it's fun, it's early access, and it's WaB....However, genre creator is not there yet...still some immersion and customisation perks are needed. Little 7/10...which is not bad for a start.			"

								Here's a question: did you like Blitzball in Final Fantasy X? No? Would you have liked it if it were... better?If so, Football Tactics may just be the game for you. It's a super addictive management sim that's leagues simpler than Football Manager. Grain of salt warning: At the time of this review, Football Tactics is an early access game, so stuff's still being balanced.Pros:-The unique player abilities definitely add a bit of spice to the RNG.-The interface is super clean and easy to read-Actual matches are fun. I also enjoy the AI mode for when I get burned out and want to play while I'm doing something else. It's nice that you can take control if you think your AI are being stupid, too.-I like the versatility of being able to use players in non-native positions, like using a Defender as a Midfielder. It really allows you to mix up your team and tactics.-Hot Seat multiplayer?! I don't think I'll ever get a chance to use it, but I'm pretty excited about it anyway.-Like a billion real countires and teams to pick from. You can also customize your club's logo and uniforms.Cons:-The difficulty curve is a little wacky. You start out in the noobie league, so it's understandably easy. If you do some smart team management, the next league is ok too. Once you hit Second League, you're likely to have a 1.5-star team regularly going up against 2-3 star teams, both in the tournament and the cup. When you tie or lose, your players get fewer XP. Fewer XP means you don't level as quickly. Not leveling means you're grinding in autopilot way longer than you need to be. To my knowledge, there's no way to move backward to lower leagues to train your players. As it is, It kind of feels like an intentinal time sink.-Addendum: As you move to higher leagues, you get more XP for losing, but your players have time limits on their careers. You can get starting players as young as 16 or 17, but they retire at 35-40.-CORNER KICKS. I don't know if it's the load time as players get into position, or having to manually move each defender for coverage, or the fact that high-powered teams have a habit of getting 3-5 of them in a row, even with my roided out goalie. Corner kicks are my #1 motivator to spectate matches.-Also, it'd be cool to swap BACK to spectator mode after taking control. Sometimes I only want to play Offense, or to avoid a Corner Kick or whatever.But really, this game is super fun. Also, it's cheap, and worth sinking a good 5-10 hours into, at least.			"

								It's a bit of turn based strategy, RPG and of course, football management/builder all mixed into one. As a fan of all three genres I gave it a try. After about 5 hours of non-stop playing, I'm gonna go ahead and call this a spectacular game! From designing the club's crest and kits to naming all the players after friends of mine to moving up the ranks from the amatuer league to the pro leagues, upgrading the stadium to fit the growing supporters, selling/buying talent (incuding coaching staff), upgrading player abilities... this game has been a complete blast(!!) without ever feeling like a micro managing bore.

								Awesome game! It is simple yet well done Football Manager that lets you be in charge of tactical solutions on the field. It fills the gap in football simulators for the lovers of tactics like me. PES and FIFA offer just simple tactical solutions since they let you control merely one player properly. Football Managers focus just on strategy and let the tactics entirely on AI. In Football Tactics (FT) YOU perform ALL the tactics in turn based manner.So just because this game focuses on actual tactics I love it :D now for the cons. FT is not too realistic and the tactics are often gimmicky. Next thing is that FT rather simple in design - both in the manager options and in the gameplay options. It could be better in the variety department but it is surely complex enough to enjoy the game.8/10 Possibly the best simulator of football tactics.			"

								**Revised review March 5, 2016**The latest version of Football Tactics, as of this review, has converted my original vote of no to a yes. However, the part that swayed me is an optional setting, so please note that the default game still seems too random. So long as you go into it with reasonable expectations, Football Tactics can be quite charming.For one thing, it features slick design and UI. Information is easily accessible with a few clicks, and managing positions and rosters is straightforward.  This ties into the streamlined managerial experience. People who want a lot of number crunching and projections can play Football Manager.  This game is more arcade-like, with a simplified simulation.  You still get the whole experience (signing, training, budgeting, seasons, tournaments, etc.), but it's bite-sized.The matches play in a similar fashion to blitzball in Final Fantasy X: players have four stats that determine their passing, shooting, defensive, and positional abilities.  There are also ""skills"" that allow them to make harder shots, longer passes, etc. It is turn based, and each game consists of 48 actions taken in threes.  Success is determined by rolling one's players stat versus the opposition's stat.  For example, a player with a Pass rating of 24 is attempting to pass through an opponent with a Defense stat of 12.  Both players generate a random number from 1 to x, where x is their stat; the higher number prevails (ties go to the active team).In the default settings, the RNG has too much variability for my taste, and they can significantly reduce the effectiveness of your tactics.  Some games devolve into a matter of who rolls better, you or the computer.  Training players takes a lot of time, and acquiring better players is expensive.  Tournaments happen each year, and if you get to enter, you will likely be facing teams from much higher leagues.  Their stats will be significantly higher than yours, and you will only be able to hope for a tie.There is a new, optional setting when creating a new game that gives players a skill floor of 30% of their rating.  This means that high-skilled players can more consistently outclass weaker opponents, although they can still be beaten.  Although I would prefer that this setting be integrated into the core game, its presence makes it easier to execute tactics consistently rather than gambling on a lucky roll.			"

								This game is wonderful. It is a remider to the older editions of EA Sports' manageer series while at the  same time exploring a Blood Bowl-style tactical scheme. The idea is simply brilliant. Yes, it's still in development, but contrary to many, many games on steam, the developers don't throw a half-finished product at us just trying to reap money - the game in its present state is highly enjoyable, which of course leaves the playerr hanging on, hoping more features will be added. This has the potential to be a great game and maybe even one day filling the slot that EA Sports left when they discontinued their manager line.			"

								Combining RPG elements with tactical grid-based football is something I'd never have thought of as being good, but after playing 6 hours just since last night, It definitely works well. Alot of clubs seem to have a variation of the Arsenal logo, which I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, just something I noticed. The one major downside comes with the aforementioned RPG elements. There doesn't seem to be any set rules in regards to the statistics, and how they determine the success of a particular action. The dice rolls are WAY too random, which I imagine is to simulate the randomness of real life football, but when your striker with almost 100 accuracy gets his shot blocked by a defender with 20 defense becasue his stat randomly plummets to 5 there's something inherently wrong. To summarize, great idea, but the dice rolls are frustratingly random which makes it feel more like a luck simulator than a football game. Still can't stop playing so the devs must have done something right.Also, no Bohemians for Irish league, whats up with that?Edit: I should have known to check the options before posting. And the community change to Irish league adds to the awesomeness. Now I can fully recommend this game. Thanks for the addictive football, developers. Hope there's more to come =D			"

								Football Tactics is quite a decent casual game that you can pick up anytime and/or get addicted to. The game mechanics work on a simple duelling premise between two players across 4 player stats (Accuracy, Passing, Defence, Control), with the addition of several skills/abilities which can turn the game in your favour. Being an indie title, obviously there is no licencing for official team/player names, which isn't an issue for me or likely anybody that spent their childhood playing Pro Evolution Soccer. There are a number of things you can upgrade for your club (stadium, scouts, coaches, etc.) to help improve the players you have and club finances. However, it becomes a bit of a grind and there is a lack of variety to the gameplay beyond this. Overall, it's likely to keep you entertained for a little while, or a bit longer if you multi-task like me and play the game sporadically in addition to doing other things. There's a lot of potential with this title and I would expect ""Football Tactics 2"" at some point, with development of the current gameplay and a load of additional features.Score: 3/5			"

								A relatively simple sports strategy game in line with Bloodbowl. Im not a huge fan of games that partially rely on ""random number generator"" based luck, but this game manages to make it work by not overloading every move with several different chances to fail, and even if you do fail the game isnt too punishing. You can adjust the length of games, but for the most part the games are ideal length, long enough to have competitive games without being monotonus. A great game to drop in and play for a couple minutes yet addictive enough to occassionaly binge for a few hours. Its not a game that does things differently, its just a solid fun game made by a small studio that ive sunk a lot of time into.			"

I'm not a soccer fan, yet I've sinked 20 hours in a few days - I got simply kidnapped by the simple dynamics of the game and its nice, cartoonish style.Take a low level team, improve player stats, buy and sell, play the game. And during the match, you have full control of the players' actions, in a very simple and intuitive way! Matches are shorts and you can simulate a full championship in an afternoon or an evening.On top of this, the Devs are available on the forum, listen to requests, and the musics are fantastic!!I really reccommend it.

								The game is very fun!If you do single player and not change anything in the options , you might find it extremely easybut if you do select ""hard start"" then it has a nice level of difficulty and will be a slow growing teamI tried in in hotseat quite some times too and thats a total blast , despite you still got no options for that mode (as in how many turns game lasts etc)8/10 can easilly achieve a 10 with some polishing, and can achieve that 10 for being a one of a kind.

								Turn-based tactical and light manager game.  Feels like chess in a way.  Gets much more difficult in the second season, but I guess it depends on your team's skill and your own knowledge of the AI.  Definitely a fun game if you like management games but feel they go a bit too in depth.The actual gameplay feels complete, but the menus could use a bit of work.  I find myself clicking all over the place when making decisions about contracts.  Maybe a sort by feature for many of the player sheets, a ""hide"" or grey out for players on the transfer market that you KNOW you have no interest in.  There's also a lot more room for stats.  A percentage of successes on passes, tackles, shots, shots against etc would probably be beneficial.As is, learning the basics and first season takes a couple hours, second season gets a bit more advanced and interesting takes 2-3 hours.  I'm about 7 hours in (counting season i did not continue from the demo) and the game is still great, my team still sucks, and I have at least another 10 hours in this game before I say ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it and start over or make a breakthrough.I've heard a lot of people lately saying $1/hr having fun is a good game.  I could see myself playing this game off and on to make that logic more than worth it.  It's easy enough to pick up for 15-20 minutes and play one match, or get embedded and knock out a few seasons in one day.			"

								This appears to be a simple game, yet is full of depth that makes playing very enjoyable.Chose your team, or if you don't like the teams on offer, visit the workshop area to download teams from a comeptition you like.The game mixed management and actual matches, but not in a way that is too indepth.  Great for filling in short periods of time by playing one game, or for realising you just spent hours playing instead of doing things you should have been doing.			"

								This game is wonderful. It is a remider to the older editions of EA Sports' manageer series while at the  same time exploring a Blood Bowl-style tactical scheme. The idea is simply brilliant. Yes, it's still in development, but contrary to many, many games on steam, the developers don't throw a half-finished product at us just trying to reap money - the game in its present state is highly enjoyable, which of course leaves the playerr hanging on, hoping more features will be added. This has the potential to be a great game and maybe even one day filling the slot that EA Sports left when they discontinued their manager line.			"

								Football Tactics is quite a decent casual game that you can pick up anytime and/or get addicted to. The game mechanics work on a simple duelling premise between two players across 4 player stats (Accuracy, Passing, Defence, Control), with the addition of several skills/abilities which can turn the game in your favour. Being an indie title, obviously there is no licencing for official team/player names, which isn't an issue for me or likely anybody that spent their childhood playing Pro Evolution Soccer. There are a number of things you can upgrade for your club (stadium, scouts, coaches, etc.) to help improve the players you have and club finances. However, it becomes a bit of a grind and there is a lack of variety to the gameplay beyond this. Overall, it's likely to keep you entertained for a little while, or a bit longer if you multi-task like me and play the game sporadically in addition to doing other things. There's a lot of potential with this title and I would expect ""Football Tactics 2"" at some point, with development of the current gameplay and a load of additional features.Score: 3/5			"

								Combining RPG elements with tactical grid-based football is something I'd never have thought of as being good, but after playing 6 hours just since last night, It definitely works well. Alot of clubs seem to have a variation of the Arsenal logo, which I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, just something I noticed. The one major downside comes with the aforementioned RPG elements. There doesn't seem to be any set rules in regards to the statistics, and how they determine the success of a particular action. The dice rolls are WAY too random, which I imagine is to simulate the randomness of real life football, but when your striker with almost 100 accuracy gets his shot blocked by a defender with 20 defense becasue his stat randomly plummets to 5 there's something inherently wrong. To summarize, great idea, but the dice rolls are frustratingly random which makes it feel more like a luck simulator than a football game. Still can't stop playing so the devs must have done something right.Also, no Bohemians for Irish league, whats up with that?Edit: I should have known to check the options before posting. And the community change to Irish league adds to the awesomeness. Now I can fully recommend this game. Thanks for the addictive football, developers. Hope there's more to come =D			"

								Great game, like a hidden gem among all the other games.What you get is a super-fun sized game, where you get to ""play"" football as a tactical game, with turns, moves, specials etc. You might not like the simple graphis at first, but for me, it's exactly wht's it's suppoed to be, no extra fireworks just so you see what's the sutiation on the filed. Also, be wary it may be a bit random, so you may use the ""less random"" option for your games.The game is activly developed and the developers check the discussions here all the time implemnting ideas from the comunity and really leasting the feedback. Really, try the demo at least.			"

								If you like football, you must have this game. It combines a bit of strategy, choices and dice rolls with all things football related, like transfers, skills and training (all streamlined, don't expect Football Manager here) into one addictive game. It is easy to learn how to play (the game explains the basics to you very clearly), but not so easy to fully master this, that only comes with (a lot of) practice. Very user-frendly, and while it isn't that great to look at, graphics here aren't exactly anywhere near the top of this game's priorities list, nor should it. But this is just so beautifully put together, even the weather is a game-changer, literally, as playing in the rain afects your players (and opponents too) in a diferent way that playing in a very hot day. Get this game, it's only going to get better, since the devs are really nice and community-frendly. I repeat, get this game.			"

The only negative is the RNG can sometimes be frustrating when you roll a low number with your star player against a scrub.  Still, that allows like real football, to have the occasional (but not often) huge upset even using good tactics.			"

								A relatively simple sports strategy game in line with Bloodbowl. Im not a huge fan of games that partially rely on ""random number generator"" based luck, but this game manages to make it work by not overloading every move with several different chances to fail, and even if you do fail the game isnt too punishing. You can adjust the length of games, but for the most part the games are ideal length, long enough to have competitive games without being monotonus. A great game to drop in and play for a couple minutes yet addictive enough to occassionaly binge for a few hours. Its not a game that does things differently, its just a solid fun game made by a small studio that ive sunk a lot of time into.			"

								I agree 'Football Tactics' is turn-based, but I don't think the word strategy really describes this game.  It is very difficult to build a coherent strategy when you only have 3 available actions every time it becomes your turn. (Moving a player one square counts as an action.) because of this every game plays out in the same way.- Get the ball- Pass to striker- Shoot from outside boxThe AI also plays with this same strategy. If it fails, try it again next turn. The game introduced  a few special skills that your players can learn. But often it feels very limited in terms of which skills which player can learn.Player improvements are incredibly simplistic and within about 30 minutes I'd noticed a flaw in tthe club improvements.This game may improve, but it would require a radical redesign of the basic gameplay in order to do so.

								Wow. This game seems simple on the surface but its not. I agree it has that one more game feeling. I'm glad I got the demo then bought it. Awesome!!!!			"

								Good game. Can be great but it is still in early stages. Needs development and more stuff! :)It gets boring after season3. You just repeat everything.. then simulate... Then turn off.But you have my support :)			"

								An excellent 'one more turn' type of game. I bought this on a whim and spent two hours on it the first night. Can't get enough of it. Seeing a sports game that is turn based is refreshing and fun.			"

								I played this game a while ago and enjoyed it. Since then they've added more stuff, and I'm currently waiting on some other new tweaks before jumping back in. Not because it's a bad game right now, just don't want to burn out on it too early.			"
