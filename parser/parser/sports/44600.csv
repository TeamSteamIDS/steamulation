												Still one of the best racing sims around: impressive driving physics, detailed car set-up options, awesome sound and plenty of difficulty customizations. Plus it still looks good, you can adjust the graphics in the settings (car details etc). There are settings for a wheel set-up (force feedback etc), however you can play it with a Xbox 360 controller as well. You have four driving perspectives to choose from: cockpit, over the hood, bumper and third person. There are weather effects in the game.It has all sorts of assists: AI difficulty, damage realism, automatic gear shifts, brake and steering help, tire and brake wear, as well as indicative arrows for corners and gears. So in theory anyone can play this game. You can adjust everything of importance: gears, tires, brakes, differential etc. The AI can be adjusted with impressive range: timid, clean, realistic, aggressive etc. To sum it up: great driving physics, awesome sound, nice selection of tracks and cars. GTR gives you an immersive GT experience.			"

												Hi to all of my freinds on ""Facebook"", ""Steam"",  or any other  ""games related to the ""steam"" related network. I have just purchased ""GTR"" via my ""Steam"" account, and I have to say to anybody who used to own this game, back in the days of ""M/Soft"" XP, that this game has now been upgraded to ""WINDOWS 7"" COMPATIBILITY. The graphics are a lot better and clearer than the games predessor on the XP version. If anybody still owns the XP version, it will not play on ""WINDOWS 7"". I have had the origional of this game on XP, which has been collecting dust for the last 2yrs due to non compatibility with ""WINDOWS 7"". The GTR car racing series is a pretty good range of games to buy. On the market at the moment, there is GTR 1, GTR 2, GTR EVOLUTION, GTR LEGENDS or RACE ON,  which I believe is now also part of the GTR series of games. I now have the complete range of this series apart from GTR LEGENDS.I can recommend all of these simulation games to the ultimate motor racing fan or anybody who fancies their chances of having a great adrenlin rush and testing their racing skills against the best drivers of these games.  Good luck to you all and enjoy yourselves. All the best everybody.  (COLIN.D.) ABERDEEN,  SCOTLAND,  UNITED KINGDOM			"

												I have to say, this is a good game.But if you are going to buy this game, buy GTR 2 too.More cars, better tracks, more game modes- and also easy to mod.(P. S. - get a racing wheel. Wheels win races.)			"

												Don't let the GUI scare you away and you may have to look for the right video mode code (36 and 75 seem to work for NVIDIA 1920x1080) for higher resolutions, but once you're there it is a good solid racing sim. FFB works well (I'm using a GTDF), graphics is functional for a sim racer and not something that will distract you while racing.Nice tracks, nice cars.Old, but gold.Get it while it's on sale!			"

												Long in the tooth and superseded by GTR2 but still a very good sim. Really only a necessary purchase for competitionists as GTR2 has basically all the content found in this game plus a whole lot more.The force feedback settings need to be tweaked, (search for feels real to me for GT legends and use those values.) but once you've done that there's still fun to be had here.

												I got this game for 1.50 definately well worth it. The game doesnt offer much in terms of things to do though the racing is quite fun and intuitive so the is a minor learning curve but with practice anyone can be good. Anyways great game if you get it cheap.			"

												I just bought this game and downloaded it and tried to load it to play and it would not play. Got a message saying that my computer did not have enough video memory said it needed 32 MB to work I've had this game before with older video card than I have on my windows 10. In  the message that comes up it calls it GTR 3D why?.			"

												Broken on Most Windows 8.1 Systems due to errors related to misreading total available Vram. No fix as of yet. Will update if one is found. Seeing as I have yet to actually play it, I can't say it's a bad game, just that it isn't in working order. yet.			"

												For now, the game just won't launch. I tried copying the Config.ini from GT legends but it just wont start. I tried compatibility mode, run as administrator. Running the shortcut, the .exe... it is just a pain. It just won't let me run the video setup and says I don't have enough memory....PS: I am using windows 8.1			"

												I brought this accidently instead of gtr 2, back in the day this was a state of the art game however the times have changing and physics engines have gotten better and graphics have gotten better and sadly this has been left in the dust. I want to recommend this game but sadly it doesnt have that fun factor that it did so many years ago, there are just so many improvements with games like gtr 2 and race 07 that this needs but didnt exist when this was made. Even further games like Assetto corsa or Rfactor give this a run for its money.Lastly it may say i have little time in this game but ive clocked in many hours into it and sadly its not aged well.
