												It's cleary a game intended for children or very first time users (in VR). It's fun and averagely polished, not something than an adult would play more than five minutes anyway. Do well what is expected for a such kind of game, so for me it's a thumb up.IMPORTANT: you need some space for this, or you'll risk to punch something crushing moles around you.			"

												I played it briefly to see if my 6-year old daughter would like it and I think this game is very nice! Perfect for kids! Beautiful world, game mechanics work very good, nice sound effects,...  she's gonna love it!  If you're looking for a VR game for your little kids, this is definitely a game you should buy.			"
