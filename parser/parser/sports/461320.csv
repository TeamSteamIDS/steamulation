								You stand in a room with a tennis racket. That's the game			"

								The start button that you have to smack is outside of the play area, where my TV is. 0/10. Would not buy a new TV again.			"

								Fun gameplay and intuitive flow of the game.  Has this sort of tron vibe that I can dig.			"

								Smacking balls, what more can you want? In all seriousness though, pretty sweet game especially when free. Can't wait for the full release!			"

								Can only reach rally due to it putting the start options on the other side of my wall, even when i get into the game its laggy and when i manage to get the ball, as soon as i hit it, the ball disappears. Good thing its free			"

								Alright I am going to give my thoughts about this game. Obviously I work with + and - .+The level design is very cool to look at. There seems to be a lot of detail outside the playing box.+The animation of the ball is quite cool and the particles of your racket are well done.Howere besides the designs, the game is very poorly made and it still needs a lot of work.-The ball bounces are random. Sometimes you expect after the ball falling down at a high speed it would bounce up again, making you able to hit it. However the ball sometimes does not bounce well and instantly disappears.-The reaction between the racket and the ball doesn't always work. As you play, you'll notice the ball sometimes goes through your racket, making it almost unplayable.-There are 2 levels you can play. However they both work the same besides the size of your playing box. This game will require a lot of variety.-No scores? Anything? I hope they will add that after they fix numerous bugs!Overall I had a lot of trouble playing it as it's quite unresponsive. I do have to say it looks gorgeous!My rating would be a 3/10 + 0.1 for being a free game.I will update this review should there be any updates!			"

								I can't downvote this simply because.. well, it's free! And the ball looks really cool. Hitting it is very satisfying.But.. the problem is hitting the damn thing more than once.It's hard as hell!! Ball dissapears after two bounces on the floor. Hit it too soft and it's gone. Hit it too hard and you can't follow where the hell it's going.. room is too big for me. My playspace is too small and i can't hit it on the sides..It was fun, but only for 5 minutes. For me it's too hard.If you have a huge playspace, give it a go. It's basically squash.			"

								Not only does this game look great, but it feels really natural too. The physics are really nice and the interactions between racquet and ball are smooth.I'm loving the Tron vibe i get from this game, everything looks like a lot of time went into it.Cannot wait til they release this for multiplayer!Will update as i play more			"
