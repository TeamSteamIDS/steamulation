												a somewhat enjoyable though ultimately repetitive game. noit a good sim and not as good as CABELAS AFRICAN ADVENTURES, which uses the same engine but is more varied and interesting so buy that one			"

												No DO NOT BUY. Not a fun open map like the game makers made it sound like. It also is not fun like dangerous hunts (COD style hunts).This game is not for the person looking for an open map hunting expierience and is also not for the perosn wanting to play a dangerous hunts style game.0/10 starts.

												An ok game, I miss the good old days of hunting games like the Deer Hunter series. The grafics are nice but there is no real hunting aspect to it. No calls, no stands and the gun selection could have more. If you’re looking to just go kill then this is the game, they will point you to the trophy. With games like Skyrim and GTA out there I wish they could make us a well-rounded hunting sim.			"

												dont buy this game it's horrible imo. Deers were bugged out running into trees and getting stuck. The vehicles you only drive for a short period of time collecting flags/game cameras you don't actually use them to hunt. I only seen what 6 rifles able to purchase? not many at all plus you can't even add anything to them other then like one attatchment. I say overall this game is pretty bad compared to cabela's big game hunter			"

												Had to jump through WAAAY too many hoops just to get this thing to load. It's a terrible port, but once you get it loaded it is....mediocre at best. I don't know if the hit detection is too precise or too inaccurate, but either way you need to plan shots out. Also, don't just pick the gun you like the range of, you have to get a SPECIFIC gun in order to kill a SPECFIC creature set at a SPECIFIC distance so that you get a good trophy. WHAAAA???			"

												This game is awful, I really tried to like it but no. Cons: Can not go prone unless is a predesigated spot. The closer you get to your kill the more points you earn, so integrity has little to do with actual shot placement. Ride the rails Quadding on a map to collect trail cameras.You find game in 10 seconds because the game drops you in, you walk forward, and there are the deer, moose, elk ect. ""Hunter vision"" just incase you're extra awful.Sneak up on a deer by crab walking within 10 feet of it. Pros: Guns are well modelled, probably because Cabela's wants you to buy them.			"

The third Cabela's installment, and so far the best one.

The graphics are very impressive, the gameplay is decent although the sounds are all f*cked up...
There's static on the main screen, you can't even hear your character talk. Every sound in-game is just messed up and unsynchronized.

Couldn't bare to go deaf while playing.

												Terrible. Game crashes for seemingly no reason. Feels clunky and not user friendly. If you do get it to work then good on you. But DO NOT Pay full price. I bought two copies at full price for me and a friend. It's NOT WORTH IT. DO NOT BUY.			"

												Watch out Last of Us, Cabela's Hunting Expeditions just may kncok you off the throne with it's engaging, heartfealt story of love and loss. Never would I have thought that a man could go through so much pain when faced with no other alternitive for food, he must savagely murder his favorite pet to survive. It's all the more heart breaking because at the start of the story his pet gets upset at him and runs away, forcing our protagonist to go searching for his dear friend.Bravo. 11/10			"
