												""It's like Trackmania in a cartoon world with a redbull as fuel.""Just like I said it has a ""BIG"" Touch off trackmania feeling in it. But for the fun part you have more air controle and a bigger challange then just staying on the ground.There are a few down notes in this game and first off all are the controles... They are pretty wierd and also you can't use them all at once normally. So I changed them to the normal race game setup:W - ForwardS - ReverseA - LeftD - RightSpacebar - ""Hand""BrakeShift - Boost / JetThat way you can use only the left hand for that part.For the other keys I left them the same due you need to stabelise your car with the Up"" and ""Down""""keys, and basic ""R"" for restart offcourse.Also, It would be awesome if you had a trackbuilding mode. So players can create and share there tracks on the steam workshop page. Maby an update for the future.For the rest the game looks good enough for it's goals, so far.So simple said: 8/10 Not the best ""Race"" game but still fun to do for a couples tracks each day.			"

												This may be my first review, and to be honest I know that probably no one will read this. HOWEVER! My thoughts on this game after playing it for about an hour. Holy. ♥♥♥♥. Balls. My first thought was ""This game is going to be the exact reason why Trackmania doesn't have rockets"" but after playing through the tutorial and being amazed at the easy and intuitive controls my thoughts were ""Holy ♥♥♥♥!? Why dopesnt Trackmania have rockets?!""So yes, that is what this game essentially is. It is Trackmania with rockets. This is not in any way negative as Trackmania is arguably one of the most visually pleasing and intuitive racing games out there.The only negatives that come to mind, or simply things I feel the game is missing are:- The graphics leave a bit to be desired. I understand this is an indi game, and for an indi game they are amazing. But I think if they were a bit better this game would be insane.- Get the community involved more than just ghosts! Let us race each other, crash into each other in lap races, race against each other in real time in time attack. Add in a track editor that we can build tracks and share with other players.- I feel like I should be able to control each air brake individually, at least each side, purely for more control in mid air. That's it. If these things were implemented I think this game could easily be as big as Trackmania at it's peak. I am THOROUGHLY enjoying this game.8.5/10			"

												This is a very fun and entertaining game that really addicts me! This game is so short though and seeing that its the official game makes me upset! Oh well, at least an update that adds multiplayer racing and more levels would be nice. A really cool feature to add would be designing your own tracks and submitting them for people to try. That would mean you can download other peoples tracks and try them. Overall, its a really great game and it was worth my money.			"

												I played the iOS version of this game for countless hours. It's a lot like Trackmania so if you like that you'll like this. Overall it's just a really fun game and well worth the $10.I highly recommend you take advantage of the controller support for this game. Playing this with a keyboard is kinda weird and it's much easier with a controller.8/10			"

												Jet Car Stunts is really addicting and fun. The challenge is what makes it great. You have to be precise, fast and know the tracks. But the penalty for failure is never too high.I also like the art style. Taken from the original, but made to look good on a monitor.Perhaps a few more tracks or cars would be also good, but there's a lot of fun to be had even with what's available. I really recommend this game.8/10			"

												Are you up for a race against the clock where it's more about using your thrust and gliding through the air than it is about racing? That's Jet Car Stunts in a nutshell, a game that's about the challenge and precision as you fly your stunt car from platform to platform hovering high in the sky. Its clean aesthetic makes it appealing to play and the game does ease you into challenges before it becomes too difficult. There's a sense of joy to make it through a course on your last try, but be certain this is a game for a select few that enjoy the genre.Even if your car looks like a red tank on four wheels, its light, which lets the thrust take you flying through the air. When you're gliding through the air, you can tilt your spoiler to control your movement in the slightest way. Other than those two things, it plays similar to a lot of other arcade games that put you behind the wheel and it is easy to control with the keyboard or a 360 controller. You have buttons for forward, reverse, thrust and air brake. When I say air brake I mean the sides of your stunt car go out and you can slow yourself down in the air. Its an interesting mechanic and it does work well to counteract the thrust. There are optional and brief tutorial courses that get you skilled to the game's tricks.The boost feels good to use and it gives your car a sense of speed more than almost any other game with nitrous. Maybe you need that speed to lift off into the air. You can also adjust the options to turn off the sense of speed. Even on the ground it feels much faster. Well I say on the ground, even though everything is in the air.There are three modes and the main mode is platforming. You have ten tries to make it through each course and there are five difficulties each with five courses. These courses are open circuits, so anything can happen from course to course. One course can be like an upward hill that's floating thousands of meters off the ground. Another course can have you going in a loop, then jump down through rings. Having the courses suspended in mid air does open up a lot of opportunity for imaginative, creative courses. It also allows for a budget, minimal design of colored blocks rather than trees.Your objective is to make it to the gate at the end. Even if there's a minuet amount of space after the goal, you can still plow through and drive off and its still a victory. If you fall into the abyss below or slam into something at top speed, you will respawn at the last checkpoint. You only get a checkpoint if you drive through its triangular gate, so if you fly over it, then you missed your opportunity. Crossing through a checkpoint refills your boost completely.You need to time your boosts and spare your thrust for later sections. Even if you recharge your boost at checkpoints, you can still run out and be forced to respawn at the cost of time. This makes some courses feel like trial and error that you need to get accustom to before you make it through. Other times, there are blind jumps guided by an arrow block that keeps you from over jumping, because you're aiming for rings that you'll never see until you jump. The earlier courses show you the rings before you jump, but its the later courses you need to be wary of.Time Trial mode lets you race the same courses, but more like a closed circuit where you do laps. So imagine the same tough course that you have to do five times. It does get easier as you do it more often. At the end of each lap, there's a fog bank that puts you back at the start so seamless that you maintain your speed. Its a nice touch. Time Trial more for endurance and it gets dull. A challenge is one thing, racing a ghost or yourself is another.There are optional ghosts in the game and I enjoy them being here, because it makes the game feel more alive. Otherwise it feels vacant. I realize that its just white tiles that I'm driving on and without competition, I feel less motivation to exceed and keep playing. These ghosts make mistakes and I have a feeling they are human recordings for the most part. After each successful drive, you get a gold, silver or bronze medal and you get a rank based on an unseen online leader board. My best runs earned around #500 while my worst runs ranked me at #700 - #1,500. I have a feeling there's a player drop off as the game gets more difficult.The final mode is the toughest of them all and that's the Collector. This mode has you collecting five stars on only eight of the same twenty-five tracks. You need to search high and low for these stars in places that its questionable how you can get to them, but its mostly extreme precision. After trying a few times on the first level, I assume that you need all five stars, before the goal lets you in. I gave up and ran away. It seemed too overwhelming from the start to even get into it, but that's why this is the third mode rather than the first.As for unlockables, I never encountered any hint of any other than completing all five courses on one difficulty level unlocks the courses of the next difficulty level. I would like to play as other vehicles to see a difference in their weight and how they perform, but with this being a challenge and precision based game, that may throw things off.In terms of sound and music, its minimal. There is no music during the game itself, just air and light engine sounds. I suppose music would get in the way of anything that takes focus to accomplish. The menus are where the music is and its nothing special.I'm on the fence about this game really. I had fun for a brief while. The challenges are engaging before they get too difficult for me. The clean look certainly helps it stand out from other games and a lot of times a game boils down to its graphics to sell you. I want to like it and maybe I do, its just tough to recommend to others. It was more challenging and a bit tedious than it was fun. It feels one dimensional, even if it makes good use of that one dimension across twenty-five courses. It should add or have more facets to keep it interesting and engaging. Even having more to unlock would have kept me interested longer.As always, the choice is yours, but I feel like even the price is a bit too high, but well there are always sales.			"

												Do you like platformers? Do you like to go fast? That's right, the next best thing to a Sonic is here!Unlike some of the other reviews, I very much like the way the cars control in the time attack and platforming modes. On the ground, the controls are quick and snappy. In the air, their turning/angling is delayed and slower as you would expect them to be (due to less friction). You can even adjust your position in midair slightly by coordinating between boosting and using your air brake. Some of the stunt jumps you will be making later in the game are insane but can be achieved with enough practice and strategy. On the downside, there are a few tracks in the game where you will have to jump through several ""hoops."" These hoops are kind of hard to fit through and the hitboxes between your car and the hoops seem pretty big and hard to avoid. However, with enough practice, it is more than possible to make it. Also, the third game mode, ""Collector,"" seems like a waste of time and is poorly designed. The placement of the stars/collectables you have to drive into to collect is pretty terrible and incredibly difficult. The way the car controls in this mode is a mess - slippery and just all over the place. The camera is stuck in a fixated spot behind the car at all times, so if the car moves on the ground or in the air at all, then the camera moves along with it. Think of it as racing on the SNES with mode 7 all over again (...but in an actual 3D game). This gameplay mode seems to be the least important of the three though since it has fewer tracks.The other two modes are great. The time trials allow you to just go all out crazy with boosting and pushing your speed to the limits. Gotta go fast! The platforming levels are really creative and challenging. Towards the end of the game, I couldn't believe some of the stuff I was pulling off and the crazy stunts I had to perform. Simple, yet effective design! If you've ever played ATV Quad Power Racing 2, the platforming levels (and time trials) in this game remind me a lot of the ones in ATV 2... but faster. So if that's something you enjoyed, this game is for you. All in all, great game. I am very happy with my purchase since I got it on sale. I love the controls, the game engine, and everything BUT the Collector Mode. In fact, this game has so much potential to be even more than it already is. It would be amazing to see a REAL multiplayer mode, battle mode, bigger/wider tracks with more gimmicks besides just conering and jumping, a whole other mode, a better designed Collector Mode made easier, or even something along the lines of what ATV 2 had to offer with the tournament races or freestyle modes.Still needs:* In-game music?* Time Trial Leaderboards			"

												I write this review from the perspective of someone with a couple world records and generally rank 5-50 on everything else. The game is overall fine and worth your time if it intrigues you, but it's not without potentially game-ruining problems depending on what you want from it. This game offers an interesting platform for arcade-style-racing speedrunning, although you can play 2 of the 3 modes without being forced to be fast. The closest comparison I can draw would be time trials from Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed and Trackmania. The mechanics present other than steering are, 1) A turbo boost, of which you get a fixed allotment per checkpoint, and 2) Mid-air aerodynamic manipulation, for lack of better words. Properly managing your boost, when and how long for, are key to being fast. Proper manipulation of your flight path and alignment are key to taking the shortest flight from point-to-point while avoiding obstacles and landing without losing speed. This is all fun and makes for a pretty decent game, however the developers have left out some of the most basic things. You can't see any leaderboards and there is no way to see your current rank after it's shown on the results screen. You'll never see it again unless you beat your current time record, and then you'll only see your new rank. The only way I can confirm my world records are still #1 is by playing the map and making sure my ghost still beats the other ghost of the #2 player. This prevented any form of competitive community before it even had a chance to exist. All you're ever going to find is the ghost of the person 1 rank above you, or below if you're #1, unless you starting searching names and friending players.I have to recommend Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed much more than this game to anyone seeking time trial competition, or even just a better skill-based Mario Kart. It's surprisingly deep. Trackmania is also another fine choice.I also want to point out that the trailer shows a bunch of ""cool jumps"" that miss checkpoints and basically mean game over, and ""cool techniques"" that actually slow you down. Makes it look more compelling than it really is.			"

												I played this game back when it was an app and I loved it. The tilt controls worked great, easy to play, good graphics, and awesome levels. However, the PC version sucks. You can't change the camera which looks in the direction of travel rather then the orientation of the car. Its angle makes it  incredibly difficult to tell if you are going to make that jump or not. Plus, the controls stop working on a regular basis and no, my keyboard is not broken. You also can't change the resolution for some reason.Despite all that, the biggest dissapointment is that the only thing that they added to the PC version is a ghost system. It's not even like trackmania, it's just one guy. Your not even racing this ghost either, you are just racing for time. It's really pointless. Do not recommend. Buy trackmania.			"

Vroom! I couldn't be any worse at this game. I think I've explored more of the sky around the tracks than the tracks themselves. The 'stunts' part drives me absolutely berserk, but the racing is fun. Yelling 'JET CAR!!!' when using the space bar is mandatory to achieve full enjoyment.			"

												Great, accessible racing game with a nice graphics style. At first it can be a little frustrating, especially handling the flying, but it is motivating aswell. If concentrating, retrying a track and improving your time is your thing, then this will be fun! It certainly is fun for me.negative points: - once you are spinning or upside down, the camera is pretty useless, but mostly you will want to restart from the last checkpoint then anyway.- uneven difficulty curve (or is it just me? I found some later tracks easier than earlier ones). "

												The main levels of this game offer a different kind of racing experience with mediocre controls and short but fun gameplay elements. The game and levels can get kind of boring or frustrating because there is some trial & error involved in completing the stages. The jumps just have to be too accurate sometimes and the last level is impossible (getting in the hole and not enough boost for last jump around rings).I wouldn't say the collector levels add any gameplay value; to complete them you need to go through the  same stages, looking for stars on top of cubes in the air and jumping at them. This means a lot of crashing and retrying and I don't think that's any fun.Here is a gameplay video of mine:

												It's not a bad game, but there's not that much to do. Theres like 15 platforming levels, and sometimes the mechanics seem wonky. In parts they want you to flip sideways to turn and land but your control of the car isn't as sharp and good as it should be, you just end up flipping upside down. It is fun to boost and then brake in the air. It is stupid how you only get 10 retrys on each level, even with all the checkpoints. That was a poor design decision, because if a level is hard making me replay the whole thing because I am having trouble with one poorly constructed part makes no sense. You can't unlock play every platforming level till you've beaten the one before, but with the 10 retry limit which makes no sense and has never been used in a racing game, and with some of the poorly designed parts based on control, you may not even be able to beat all the platforming areas. If (big if) you beat platforming you can beat levels where you collect things and beat time trials, but theyre like the same levels and get pretty repeitive. Multiplayer, more levels, races, and other features would greatly improve upon the game.  6/10			"

												At the moment I saw this game I knew I am going to like it. So far I have spent 17hour of playing this game I have completed 3 of 4modes game offers and get 11 of 12archivemenents. Now I feel competent to write few lines about it.Game is remake of games released few years ago for iOS and Android. Despite developers call it remake game is simplistic lacking any advanced feature, setting and unfortunatelly being short even in comparison with other budget titles. On other other site game is very adictive and fun to play which is what matters.Players take control of rocket power formula which resembles that one from Trackmania Nation. Rocket engine is powered by nitro which is restored when next checkpoint is passed in modes Platform and Time Attack. In Puzzle/Collector mode turbo is refilled automatically when not used. With rocket engine equiped car can reach crazy speed, fly and maneuver(brake, steer, rotate) in the air.First of game mod is tutorial with 5 track where players have chance to familiarise yourself with control.Second mode is Platform with 25tracks. Tracks are arranged from simple where rocket engine is used just to speed up cars, to track where rocket engine is used to overcome huge distances between distant part of track. Harder track in this mode require lot of practising to reach finish line. Thirt mode is Time Attack (11tracks). Rocket engine here serves just like turbo to speed up cars. All track are easy to drive with few jump. Surplus of nitro make it mode feel totaly different from platform. Instead of precise aircontroled flight player control formula in tight corners whith even remind me Wipeout/F-Zero games.In both previous game modes players have change to compare your results with other BUT only when track is finished with personal best. This is promist to be fixed. Game would certainly benefit from possibility to see records of other players anytime. Also developers implemented so called ""asynchronous multiplayers"" into these two modes. Game download ghosts of players with similar time and let them compete with it. Again unfortunately game lack here becouse new ghost are downloaded only when track is reload which result in playing with much slower and therfore uselles ghost all the time.Last mode is Puzzle/Collecter (8 maps). Objective is to colect 5stars on every maps. Starts aren't placed directly on track but on objects around tracks. This mode require lot of air maneuvers and restarts. Players face with challange to not just overcome huge distances but also significant changes in direction in comparsion with other mode where just slight corrections in the air are needed. Unfortunatelly camera doesn't work so well in JCS and any controled stunts are literally impossible. Fast camera rotation really doesn't help.. Therefore this mode utilise fixed camera which make game feel like beta but helps in crazy maneuvers. Personally this is the only mode I haven't finished. It's not really fun to play FOR ME. This mode also face it premiere in PC version and was created by developers of PC version. Hopefully other feature and content we might see for this game will push game further..It's very disapointing that game doesn't include multiplayer and level editor. Personally think that editor would be much usefull. What would we play in that multiplayers without new tracks? For example game Trials Evolution:Gold Edition has functional editor and ingame sharing system which push game to endless of hours of gameplay for those who want and multiplayer which non of PC players ever make to work present NO problem in long term.With multiplayer and editor this game might threaten possition of Trackmania which took direction to LOT of feature, realism, graphic and addictive gameplay was lost in the way..Hope I will see more ""PC wotrhy"" sequel in few years.7/10 and must have for those who loved Trackmania before TM2 release.

												From http://gamesfiends.com/pc/jet-car-stunts-pc-review/What it lacks in graphics, it makes up for in “just one more go” gameplay.My initial reaction upon loading up Jet Car Stunts was pretty much “this is going to be a quick review to write”. Three game modes, no online gameplay, and barely any graphics or artwork in existence. The game looks like someone has made a basic blockout of the car and levels and gone “Job Done!”. What took me longer than expected was the fact that I kept playing it.I know that you don’t go to smaller independent developed games for state of the art graphics, but Jet Car Stunts really does take the ♥♥♥♥ with how little effort has gone into the visuals. They’re virtually non-existent. No texturing has been applied at all, the only real detail lies in the low rez skybox and the distant floor which is represented by, again, a low rez map of the world. I could really go on about this, in terms of visuals, JCS is clearly in pre-alpha. Sound is barely worth mentioning either, with some stock noises that could have easily been lifted from a Mega Drive racing game. The fact that this was originally an iPhone/iPad racer goes someway to explaining the very sparse nature of the game, but I’d have hoped that a full release on Steam at £7.99 would have justified a bit more effort.Gameplay wise? There’s three game modes on offer which isn’t much… time trial, collector and platforming. Time Trial is as you’d expect, Collector is a fiendish exercise in collecting stars that are scattered around the level, usually in awkward places to get to. Platforming takes up the bulk of the game, where a number of tracks (divided into difficulty) must be traversed using your jet powered car. That is to say, a car with a massive jet engine that makes it capable of short bursts of flight.This is where JCS really begins to shine. The car’s jet engine is vital for making giants leaps across the sky platforms, performing huge arial jumps with the car is a tricky affair that requires a lot of finesse and practice. Air brakes help to control the car mid-flight, but also risk slowing the car down too much that you’ll plummet out of the sky. Added to the mix is the limited amount of fuel that powers your jet. While this is replenished at a handful of checkpoints, careful monitoring and use of the jet is required in some cases, otherwise you’re simply never going to make that big leap to the next platform.Jet Car Stunts has managed to nail two things that are seriously lacking in many of today’s games. Replayability and difficulty. The game’s “Very Easy” early courses are actually anything but, and patience is required in order to beat every leap, jump and corner. The tracks themselves aren’t overly long, but feature some really challenging segments that’ll keep you re-visiting the previous checkpoint plenty of times. In this respect the game is well balanced, and checkpoints are placed at the optimum distance to avoid any overly grating segments where you’re chewing over long portions of track that you’ve nailed long ago. You’re given a maximum of ten tries before the game demands that you start back at the beginning of the course and, again, this never feels like a chore to do.Collector mode does get somewhat frustrating. Controlling the car in air is actually extremely tricky and some of the locations of the stars make this mode one that will tear your hair out, while time trial obviously requires you to hone your control of the car to absolutely perfection in order to make your way across the course within the time limit. Multiplayer generally takes the form of racing against a ghost car, which feels isolated and a real shame given the Micro Machines style fun that could be had with four other players duking it out and trying to ram each other off the track.Jet Car Stunts is a game that, before you know it, that “one more try” was actually half an hour ago and you’re already stuck on a different course. It becomes difficult to really criticise a title that gets gameplay so right, but it’s just a shame that more attention was put into the overall package. That said JCS delivers an entertaining and challenging racer with the right amount of balance that will keep people gaming without wanting to put their fist through the screen.6.5/10			"

												I'll admit, I find this game a challenge. The controls are great, I'm just having a harder-than-usual time getting used to it. It's pretty, it's fun. The rocket really takes this racing/stunt game nearly it's own category. I was expecting something a la ""Stunts"" from the 90s, what we get is so much better. And being so unique, I'm still adapting to it.My kids laugh almost as hard as I do at how much I crash and burn.			"

												This game is a lot of fun.  I really wish there was an option to be able to see through your car.  Often you are aiming for a platform that is far away, and you can't see it because your car's graphics are blocking your view.  I wish the car would go transparent or wireframe in these situations.  After playing for a while, it just kept coming up, I'm trying to hit a target far away, and because it's far away it's small and my car blocks it and I can't see it.  So I end up replaying parts of it but then I feel like I'm only getting it because I've memorized what to do.   Enough times of hitting stuff I would have missed if I could see better and I'd had enough for today.  It's a shame because this one tiny change would take this game from 'might play again later' to 'will play all the stages and 100% this game.'			"

												Wow, Jet Car Stunts is a fantastic game for what it does. This racing game brings a fun and unique idea into its genre, by adding air brakes on a car. This makes the game just that much harder, since you must now jump off a rampon the map, and then use the air brakes to steer yourself onto what are sometimes narrow paths(without rails so you must be really careful), in order to land and continue on the path. I played only 4-6 hours of this game, but i really enjoyed the game, for what it is. +new airbraking system+fine steering controls+graphics are basic, but very likable+plenty of challenges, and ghosts so you can race yourself-other controlls such as gas and brakes are too close to each other(customizable though)-no mod supportOverall this game deserves a  8/10, it's a great game. I recommend you get this on sale, since the price of $8 Canadian feels a bit high, if the game is under $5, i highly recommend it, it's a challenging, and fun game. This game feels casual at the same time, and you can jump on and off of the game, since it really is a minigame. This is a keeper on my laptop for when i get bored in school or at the airport.			"

The control of the vehicles was much more like flying a jet with more precise controls, there were different vehicles, and different modes, my favorite being the high score challenge of freestyle stunting. I'm glad to see this game available on the computer but there should be the same amount, if not more content as ios app.			"

												A fun concept that's let down by lack of content. The car handles quite well, there's a lot of fun in just air braking around corners then powering out of it with your jet, it'd make a nice drift game. The levels feel unpolished, and basic, not just because of the low poly design (most of the levels are just an arangement of cuboids). The ramps are particularly jarring, 90% of the time they're just two hard angles. The game modes aren't particularly interesting, time tirals where you just try and beat your shadow, a race mode that's also just beating a shadow. I'd like to see a game mode that's just getting from point A to B with unlimited fuel, even a hill climb. Maybe some upgrades, campaign mode etc.5/10 - Buy it if it's under 50c			"

												This game is an absolute blast! A mix of Trackmania and Trials. There's 3 type of races; -Platformer, where the goal is to reach the end saving boost but while using enough to get to the next platform.-Time Trials, fast-paced races where you must maintain boost even in curves while drifting and do crazy jumps.-Collector, where you must do crazy tricks to reach the location of the stars you have to collect.The graphics are basic but the gameplay is really cool. Difficulty progression is well balanced. I seriously enjoy this game, bought it on Steam, Xbox One and Android! Yeah! It's that fun !!! "

It's harder with a controller but easier on a big screen compared to mobile, I guess unless you have a 6+ inch (I played on a 4th-gen iPod touch years ago).

												This game is nice, it just really doesn't didtinguish itself from its mobile counterpart. The main differences are:Graphics:The Car model is more detailed, and the lighting is better on PC. It also has some pretty offensive motion blur, but thankfully you can disable that.Ghosting: This is only available on PC. You can race your ghost, as well as that of a (seemingly random) other player.Controls: This should definitely be played with a gamepad, or something besides a keyboard. And even then, the controls on the mobile versions still feel tighter, especially when you're in the air.Extra levels:PC: 25 levels, $7Android: 25 levels, $1.75iOS: 25 Levels, $2, as well as 25 more levels for an additional $2Additionally, on mobile you can buy Jet Car Stunts 2 (120 levels) for just $5, which also includes a level editor and the ability to play others' levels.Seriously, it's just obvious what their main target is and anyone who has a smartphone should really take a good look at their options.
