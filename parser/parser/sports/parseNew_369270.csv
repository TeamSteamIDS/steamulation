Megatect is a very good looking sandbox building game with the 'fast-paced arena scene' in mind. Looking at its current state it's easy to say Minecraft + Quake. But being a creative game like this it's really up to you to decide what you make out of it.+ A few weapons to test out and possibly have your friend join to have a little frag fest in a custom made map+ The different themes for each map allows the creator to have a decent range of customizability (for now, very early in its current state, great potential)+ Art style is unique especially the 'grid' system+ Graphics are pretty solid+ You can use buttons & wires to make trap doors in a custom arena map that you can also make (I smell a Deathrun game type/map)I'm very happy to help support this game and its developer. I see a lot of potential for a game like this. Being made by only 1 person it may take a bit of time, but regardless of how long development takes, at this games current state it's definitely playable & enjoyable. Also the price tag is great as well. :)			"

								I just recently bought this game and I need to be honest, I don't regret it.First of all, this game is a simple sandbox game, including weapons, pick-ups of all variations aswell as the ability to build up traps with wires.What you do with this game is actually in your decision.I started out building my own grid straight away (You can decide wether you want to have a plain, flat grid or given islands) on a flat world. The possibilites this game brings with it makes it even more fun to build up houses unlike in, for e.g., Minecraft, the graphics|textures of blocks, corners, glasses etc. seem pretty solid and have a nice reflecting touch to it.You can also just build like a DM arena, place weapons and fight against you friends.All in all, this game has a lot of potential when finished.I can only recommend you to try it out by yourself, the money will be totally worth it if you enjoy sandbox themed games.

New ReviewThank you devs for sending me this game. I had made a previous review without realising that I had forgotten to set my NVidia Graphics Card as my preferred graphics processor. The old review applies to those using Intel. Overall this game is actually pretty beautiful, when I changed my preferred graphics processor I got around 50 fps, which is a lot better than before, it isn't amazing but a lot better than originally. It is easy and fun to build and there are multiple maps to build on.  I still would recommend ""open servers"" so that people can just join a multiplayer server and have fun without having to have an ip or friends to play with, plus people can meet more people who play this game which would build the community! Saying this, I was not able to test multiplayer as I have no one who owns/plays this game. 7/10 in current state of when review was made. Needs better multiplayer system.

			In this video I review ""Megatect."" This game was given to me by the devs, so thank you devs! This video is in 1080p 60 fps.		

PartSpecsOperating SystemWindows 10 64-Bit RAM 32 GB RAM Graphics Card Nvidia GeForce GTX 780M Hard Drive 384GB Super RAID 2 + 750GB HDD 7200rpm CPU Intel Core i7-4700MQ CPU Note to DevelopersThanks again for the opportunity by giving me the free key. I really appreciate it!Old ReviewFirst off I would like to say thank you to the devs for sending me a key for this game to review.  I am sad to say I am not recommending this game just due to the poor optimization... Most games I would usually get atleast 150 fps, but at the minimum value for each graphics option (1 above off) with my base resolution of 1920x1080 I got a steady 10 fps...  The graphics seemed to look great, and the game also seemed to have a great concept, but in reality it is just unplayable without an extremely good computer and other people to play with as you need to input an ip to play multiplayer.  From the bit that I have played with building and shooting the tools/guns, with and at no one lol, seemed pretty good. This game needs to be more optimized for the lesser PC folk, and I wouldn't even consider my PC to be apart of those folk, and this game needs to be open servers so that people can just join and play rather along side needing the ip so people can either play with their friends or just play with anyone.  According to other reviews, people seem to like the game, and I feel I would to if I could actually play it steadily... Again it may be my fault but these are my specs, which ARE above the recommended specs.			"

								At first I wasn't able to play the game due to some NVIDIA issues, but those were promptly resolved by the developer. He is very dedicated to making this game both in his vision and in the collective vision of the players. Now onto the game!At first glance, this game seems very polished already. The theme of a futuristic, ""build your dream"" platform works very well with the mechanics that have been established. Do you want to make a puzzle grid and challenge other players? Megatect can do that. Do you like sports or racing and want to invite your friends to play in your custom-built stadium? Megatect endorses that. Do you want to make an unforgiving deathmatch arena to stomp other players? MEGATECT ENCOURAGES IT!The pros and cons of this game are really in favor of pros.+ Graphics+ Aesthetics+ Environment+ Music+ Creativity+ Infinite possibilities- Underdeveloped (but it's Alpha)- No mode selection preset for grids yet (i.e. ""Deathmatch"", ""Race"", etc.)Other than that, I highly recommend dropping the money for this game as its potential is as limitless as your own creativity. Workshop grids will also be available in the near future, and the fact that the Dev plans on allowing you to host your own server with your friends and build your worlds together is amazing in of itself. I wholeheartedly endorse this game!			"

Early Access Review
								With like 25h played, I think it's time for a little review.First of all, I want to remind people this game is still in Early Access, and yes, it is still a bit ""quiet"" so to speak. But, this game is pretty friggin' awesome! You play a robot that can jump, run and shoot. That's it :)See this game as a Quake vs. MinecraftYou get the Quake (team) deathmatches and the building blocks from Minecraft, neatly packed into a futuristic look.There are some small islands available to choose from before starting to build, or you can build completely from scratch out at sea. Place and rotate blocks, give them different colours (like a red base for the red team and blue for the blue team) and several other colours in between. Hopefully added is a simple ""colour pad"" where you can choose your desired colour as for now it is a bit limited.There's foliage that you can plant, also on the metal-looking blocks, you can adjust the lighting for different themes and change the day/night cycle. You can make traps with fire, hidden doors, teleports, jump-pads, lava basins, dripping acid, you can add timers to normally invisible ""light paths"", or have them constantly on, or with pauses, and it all works pretty straight-forward!You can do the tutorial, but you don't have to be a genious to figure out basic building, not even with (timed) traps/constructions!I'm impressed with how well things work so far, the looks (Unity) a pretty good and the lighting effects are nice. The textures are really quite well (not so pixely as Minecraft) and the movements, also in build-mode very well working.For those who love that everything connects, this game, too, is awesome as round objects such as arches merge prefectly with square blocks placed on top and on the sides! Here's hoping that more options will be added to the game during the course of development (I'm not sure but I think it's just 1 guy doing this! That's impressive!!) and that the game will catch on so we can all look forward to old-school Quake-like Death Matches!Before I forget: It says ""Create your own sports"", but as there are no really movable objects most ideas don't work out. You can, for example, make a sort of ""dodgeball"" with guns instead of balls, but I think it'd be cool if there are movable objects, such as a ball, so (obviously with guns) you have to try and shoot the ball (literally) into a goal. Conclusion: If you still have a soft-spot for old-school shooters such as Quake, and you love designing your own levels that you can share (either editable or non-editable) with the community, it's worth buying the game! It's really not that expensive and you will have a lot of fun designing, running through your levels, expand, change, adjust, run around again, place guns, shoot at your placed targets to open secret doors to rooms with better guns, and when you're satisfied that it all works: share :)			"

								Fantastic. The look and feel are great. Building stuff is fun. And the price is more than reasonable. Keep in mind this is Early Access. There are bugs. They are mostly UI related, and not game-breaking. There is currently no server browser. You connect to other players via IP address.  "

I love the lightinh and everything.The only thing i did so far was building but even just building was already a lot of fun.As long as the developer keeps the close contact with the community this game could become really good.

								Megatect is an awesome polished, similiar to quake and with a level editor.  you can currently play with friends but you have to host a server (proper multiplayer servers are being worked on). Megatect is being worked on by one dev but the game is updated regularly. Megatect is definitely worth the buying for its current price.			"

								Now, I've played this game for nearly 2 hours when writing this review and it was the first time I have played, so let's get started with my first impressions and then follow through to a pros and cons section.First Impressions:So I first launched the game and found myself a launcher for it. I was a bit confused as I thought that the game would throw me right in. I hit the play button and nothing happened. ""What?"" I thought to myself as I quickly googled the problem and found no solution. I continued to attempt to ""repair"" and ""redownload"" the game from the launcher to no success. I then decided to check to see if the game was downloaded correctly from steam though the ""Verify Game Cache"" function in the games properties. I did this and found out that 7 files had not been downloaded. Withing 2-3 seconds I had those files and went back into the launcher of the game. It worked! I could download the game with no issues and finally got in. Once the menu loaded I was blown away. The game, although in an early access stage, still had a very nice and sleek looking menu. The game looked and navigated quite professionally and is substantually better than some other early access games I have tried. After a bit of fiddling I managed to get the graphics to what my computer could run them at (max basically) and then decided to load up a world! I was feeling a tab bit lazy so I decided to load up somebody else's creation. Very easy and simple to use navigation allowed me to load up somebody else's map that they had created. I could edit it, play on it, and even interact with it. From what I can see, nothing was missing from the user created map and everything was working just fine. From here on I got very excited. I wanted to make my own map. A map I could call home.I loaded up a new map and got to work. After about an hour of learning the controls I had finally gotten a hang of it! I flew around adding blocks, destroying blocks, placing enemies, placing guns, and of course, placing jump pads. I finished a bit of my map with many jumping parkour areas and some more difficult jump pad areas to reach. Overall I got a fun map that I played on by myself for some time. I then decided that this wasn't enough. I needed a bit more of something ""cool"". I went into the menu to see what I could grab for myself and found hidden doors. Well, I used them as floors. Once my map was finished I decided to see what else I could do with the game. The maps options were quite in depth with details such as: Gravity, Time of Day, Theme, and also Day/Night rotation being possible within the options. With my map done I decided to hop off the game and write a review, because overall the game amazed me. The graphics (although not spoken about much in this review, or even at all) are quite amazing and look very sleek. The character customization is fun and all of the weapons (although only a few so far) are perfect for an arena style shooter. Now for the pros and cons:Pros:Great graphicsFun gameplayGood progress in the games developmentEasy sharing of your gamesHas mutliplayer functionality (although I haven't explored it yet)Has good plans for the future of it's developmentDeveloper shows good knowledge of creating gamesCan be played alone/Co-Op/Multiplayer/ in PvE or PvPMany fun user created maps for the gameRelatively cheap to buy and well worth it!Cons:It is only a 1 man developer team which worries me if he loses interest in developing the game.The use of an independant launcher is cool, however steam updates would be a lot easier to keep track of from the users perspective.No publically hosted games on official servers.

YouTube™ Video: Worth it Early? - Megatect 

			Views: 96		

			Megatect, a game that you build whatever you want, and i mean whatever you want. (did get a review copy from the dev for this game) CLICK FOR MORE INFORMATION! Like my content?		

i have spent over 10 hours making stuff in this game, the actual building part of the game is spot on and very solid, however some aspects of building stuff is lacking. at the moment, no moving block and no super complex stuff you can make with the Wires (think of floating redstone from Java Minecraft), so you are unable to make overly demanding buildings. at the moment, i have three buildings finished, the first you can scroll down to see a video of, the other two are on my channel if you want to check them out.some bad stuff is in the game however, at the moment the hitboxes of the laser block (or fire block, whatever you wanna call it), the foldable floor and jumping is pretty broken. with jumping, if you are moving and jumping at the same time it is delayed, making climbing maps VERY hard to pull off.if jumping and some hitboxes are fixed, it would be FREAKING AMAZING. would i say you should get it? ♥♥♥♥ YES, but it is still in early access, and so much more should be added. well worth it for what it is right now. Also, field of view maxes out at 120, for a third person shooter / first person builder.(this is what was here before)so far, been working on one map, loving it so far, will add more in later when i try out multiplayer and actually finish the map i have been working on :D!Edit 1:

								Still early in development but is being added to in a consistent way.The editor while being basic in function has a wide variety of block types,equipment and specials. You can make some very nice maps(grids)as it is right now and connect direct with port forwarding.  Dev isworking on getting public Multiplayer in place and it should arrivein not a lot of time from now. Keep an eye on this or go ahead and pickit up.  i don't think you could go wrong.			"

								Ok people.. 2 questions that MIGHT make you a better man/woman!Question 1.... do you like building games where you can build whatever your heart decided? .... or do you prefer shooters like Quake? .. Or maybe you prefer the more technical way and like building technical highlights through wiring, traps and complicated logical mechanics to stun your friends as well as your opponents with your wit? ok.. remember what you answered here.Question 2.Do you have the patience to put up with an Early Acces game, regardless of how polished it already is and how much updating goes on?If at question 1 you either picked 1 of the choice, 2 of the choices or all of them at the same time and at question 2 you said you would have the patience. The go to the tagged game because ♥♥♥♥ its amazing :DAtm its even 50% off for the coming days (at time of review) to making it the cheapest non-thinker purchase ever!Imagine Minecraft, except it was polished 3D whereby you had the choice to either make beautifull projects with realistic looks..... You could make a large quake-like map, set deathmatch settings and place weapon and armor spawners to turn your map into an amazing third/firstperson shooter .. or make an adventuremap using complicated technical logic that trows the Minecraft version of Tekkit out of the window for being to easy. OOORRRR.. you can do all of that at the same time! Your choice!So far the blocks and features added can keep you busy for quite a while but regardless of the development only having 1 developer, updates are very solid and steady while the developer is very active in listening to feedback and bugreports. The roadmap also looks sweet as hell.As can be seen in the community hub of the game, so far there have been amazing creations. Be sure to walk past the GRID forumsection as some people prefer to upload screenshots etc. there (even though today the developer added an amazing map upload system whereby you can see and play all public maps from a big maplist)			"
