												It's hard to say if I like this game a lot.  I designed an actual turn based soccer game so when  I saw this I was interested.  I have played a few matches on various accounts and machines.  Here is what I do like:turn based.  ive always liked turn based.graphics arent too badits pretty simple to playheres what i dont like:- in spite of having options like headers, etc.  I still havent found a use for them.  this is basically a run dribble run shoot kinda game - and shooting is if you get lucky.-takes a long time to play.  If i was playing a season, id be dead before i ever finished.- player models are wonky and out dated- after a bit, the game play is kind of limited...you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again...what i might change (and perhaps this exists and i just havent found em yet):- maybe allow for two passes in some instances- designate movement zones for run and jog (which affects fatigue)- update the graphics some- update the mechanics a bit.  i just feel like they represent a game from 1991.anyway - i applaud the idea and the effort of the dev or devs.  i think its a brilliant idea and would love to see an updated version of something like this.thanks.  if this game continues to get updates, then i can recommend it.

												A very boring, lackluster, and slow-paced turn-based strategy sports game.On the surface, this game seems like it could be an interesting idea, how cool would a turn-based sports game be? How great would it be for gamers who were more strategic-thinkers than coordinated players? Well, even with the idea's promise, the game itself just didn't deliver.The pace of the game is horribly slow, and very tedious. Even with the sped-up ""autoplay"" the game is too slow for my tastes, and I've played plenty of turn-based strategy games over the years. I don't think this is the developer's fault, after playing this game I just realize that sports are just difficult to translate into this genre's realm. Passing can be wonky, tackles are RNG and difficulty-based, rather than dependent on each player's skill, and the simulated 90 minutes takes a while.Apart from gameplay, there are several blemishes that make this game annoying. Your characters are constantly in their walk animation, even when they're idle. Breaks between turns are way too long, either the developer purposefully set them this long, or the AI is taking too much time figuring out what to do next - it's just unacceptable for a game that has hundreds of turns in each game.Overall, an interesting turn-based strategy concept turns out to be just a boring, tedious chore, one that isn't helped by several hiccups on the developer's side. The game has gone about a year without updates, I don't see much changing.			"

												This is not a good game. Its UI is not very intuitive and need to refine a lot of in game mechanics (for example you can make goals every time you take the ball at half-court)			"
