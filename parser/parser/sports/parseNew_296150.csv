												Let's start at the beginning. When the buggy menu FINALLY lets you join a game (that is, if there are any available), you are dropped into what seems to be a waiting area where you can run around randomly. Then you click the join arena button, where it sends you into the g-ball arena, which is a giant sphere full of random things on the ground and floating rings in the air. That's it. No explanation, no tutorial, nothing. It seems they just expect you to automatically know what to do.Now, the controls. First, you can't change them in game. Second, the standard setup isn't too bad, but it's unresponsive and hard to figure out. For example, why the hell is the button to throw a ball the right click? To move the camera, you have to hold either mouse button and drag, however it too is unresponsive.Overall, I think this game really does have potential. The graphics and environments are nice, but everything else needs work. Also, it REALLY needs an instruction guide.			"

												I got this in a bundle with 6 other games for $2.  As such, it was 33c for this game.I like the concept.  I like the idea of a sport in zero gravity.  Where this falls down is in the execution.  It is glitchy, the physics sometimes defy logic, and of course the result is a multiplayer game with NO player base.  It's dead.  I begged my gf and she played with me to get the achievements, but in hindsight the only fun was not the game but in making fun of it.  Like watching a really bad movie.  It's so bad it is funny.  If I played this with random players (if there were any) then maybe it would be less fun.Avoid this game like the plague.  Shame on the authors for tarnishing NASA and shame on NASA for not suing them over it.0.1/10 at 33c-100/10 at $3.99			"

												This game was developed in conjunction with NASA. In the year 2035 you are playing in 6 different glass arenas next to the planet Mars. The gameplay reminds me strongly on basketball, of course it's in a zero gravity environment.What it doesn't make it easier is that if you land on a wall everytime your view begins to roll. Altogether the controls of this game are very inconvenient. You have permanently to  push left mouse button to hold your focus on red ball. You can also use smash balls to disturb your opponent in scoring. But after a while you may get dizzy of these weird camera movements. And then there are these countdowns everywhere. If you score it countdowns, if a new round begins it countdowns, if the game starts it countdowns  and much more of that.I know: on NASA rocket launches I always liked the countdowns most...			"

												Where do I even begin to explain this game.Okay, it starts like this. You spawn, you jump and try to get the red ball. Only thing is, you cant, because you miss it by an inch EVERY TIME. Then when omeone has the ball there is no way to get it from them unless you go back to one of the goals and get a thunderball. You miss, then you miss again, and finally after countless tries you score.Now the controls are amazingly crappy. I can barely control my guy. Its hard af to turn around, and if i get on one of the jump pads below the goals it always knocks me right into them. After knocking into it, I slowly at about .2m/s facing it like im stupid. The game would make a really good lets play, because just about everything that happens makes you want to knock the screen in. The only enjoyable part about it is the taunts, because you can dance thriller and gangam style. Also why is this called astronaut academy if your playing a space sport? Really glad I got this free from astronaut rescue. 1/10. Only because I got it for free and the taunts are funny. Can be good with work.			"

												This game is literally unplayable. Aside from the fact that it's a glitchy mess, obvious from the moment you launch it, there doesn't seem to be another human soul online to play it with. And you can't play against the computer. So if you love running around in an empty and glitch ridden futuristic sporting arena, go for it.			"

												This game turned up in my list yesterday, I've never heard of it and I certenly didn't pay for it, the only thing I can reason I can come up with is that because I own Astronaut rescue, it gave me this as well.Well about the game, First of all. I didnt play it much. The concept is not bad, your part of a team of zeroG footballers the idea seeming to be to pick up one of a couple of ball types and either score or attack a player with. As simple as the game is, it's controles are what REALLY let it down. your mouse only controles looking about as far as i can tell, while w and s control forward and backwards, a and d are turn left and right, but there is a turning circle meaning you turn more like your driving a forklift truck rather than a person, there is strafe but its unresponsive and slow.This game needs some serious changes to be any good imo, the main one being the movement, its all just too slow, you cant quick dodge or side step and once airborn you never now whats gunna happen, you could go all the way to the other side of the sphere you play in, or you could just shoot off on  random axis for no given reason.The graphics of the game are aso a little odd, the terrain looks decent though dated but the characters are glossy as hell, like they are wearing super shine spandex and the ""audience"" is a VERY bad bitmap.All in all, I dont think this game is a bust, NASA need to really think about what ppl want in a game rather than trying to be inavitive, they just dont have the experiance for it. Do a co-op space survival game, DayZ on the moon kind of thing. Its not unique, but it would sell.Gameplay 3/10Audio 5/10Graphics 4/10Overall Rating 3/10This Game wasn't even worth the money at free, what little time I didn spend on it was just not enjoyable at all.

												Please do not play this game.  It is worse than the other Starlite Astronaut game, which I actually didn't think was possible.  The online multiplayer is dead, the controls are terrible, the game is not fun at all.  This game is everything you never wanted in a multiplayer game.  Buying an 8-ball would be a better life choice than buying g-ball.			"

												Besides the fact that you will wait over 2 hours for someone to join/create a game, once you finally start playing (if you can call it that...) you run into so many awkward glitches and problems with the controls that you'll be hard pressed to not quit immediately and delete all local content. I think it's funny one of the achievements is to play 10 games. Ordinarily I figured that wouldn't be a problem. In this game, you'll be lucky to finish half of one.			"

												I think this game had a lot of potential. It feels more like an alpha than a final release. Some feedback on this game would include an easier-to-understand system for newer players who do not research much about the game--After about 10 minutes of trying to figure out how to play, I had to download a PDF from google to understand the rules. There is a tutorial map, but for whatever reason I was not able to create a game with a tutorial.			"

												Bad controls of movement and camera are enough to cause nausea.Character moves like a giraffe in zero-g which isn't exactly sporty.Then there are bunch of nonsensical rules which seem to be to make sports fans feel at home or something..My suggestion: remove all distracting floating things, don't try to make it like ""quidditch in space"".Seems like original idea was about zero-g basketball so make it that: just two goals, a ball and two teams. That's it.Now it is just a waste of time as a game, as an experiment and as a simulation since it is entirely hypothetical in nature.If people are going to be playing games in space for excercise it should be kept simple.

												A fun little game, I am enjoying G-Ball and while it may be a bit buggy I think at least a few people will have a few hours of fun playing. At the price of $3.00 USD (at release) the game really is a good deal even if you only play it a few hours, its fun and relatively easy to learn. I don't have much faith in the games life span though and doubt there will be any players after the initial wave of launch purchases. Overall though I really like the style these Devs have, and hope someday they get around to making a bigger and better game.			"

I told him that i accepted it and he said that we should play it. I started up the game and saw that it said i was the only person online in the whole world playing, until he logged on.
