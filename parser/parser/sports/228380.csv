Early Access Review
								Bugbear means Flatout series, Flatout series means lots of fun, both alone and with your friends.Even in alpha stage this game is really challenging: after the first few laps the track gets filled with debris and wreckages, and holding the 1st position when the other 10 remaining cars try to ram you into oblivion is a pretty tough job.Not mentioning the demolition derby. That's just mental.In the actual state, you can drive and tune 3 different cars and take part in both races (on gravel and tarmac tracks, straight and reverse route) and mosh pits (in 3 different arenas) in different weather and time of the day. There is also a figure-8 jump race. You can race against up to 23 opponents.This is the new generation Flatout.EDIT: as of 2/12/14, the game is still poorly optimized.I know it's still in an alpha state, and good thing the introduction of multiplayer, new cars and a WiP track, but please, if a dev will ever read this, focus on optimizing the game: I have a FX-9370 and 2x ASUS R9 270X in Crossfire and with medium settings, 20 cars, 1920x1080, the framerate sits between 30 and 50 FPS.

								Please stop defending bugbear like they are actually working on this game in good faith. They are not. At best, they've kept an intern on it releasing a new car or track once a quarter. It is unethical to sell an early access game to tons of people, then to almost completely abandon it to work on yet another early access game - http://www.wreckfestgame.com/stuntfest/. That's right. Instead of working on finishing this game, they've been working on creating yet another Early Access game, one which they will probably never finish either. Please do not support unethical developers.			"

								One word : AMAZING !!BugBear come back at the top !!A kind of Flatout but more realistic, closer to Destruction Derby 2 but... more realistic !Vehicle behavior is just fantastic, impacts are accuracy, the laws of physics are outstanding, no object passes through another !A subtle driving, you can disable some assistances and drive in manual transmission !24 cars on the track and everything works with astonishing fluidity !AI is smart and unpredictible !Engine sounds are very good (love this damn american V8 !)A real inside view allowing you to see in 360 degrees !We feel that the game is made by passionnates to the slightest details !Definitely, if you love to drive powerful rusty cars, don't wait and support these awesome devs !!...

								Made by the flatout devs. Technology Sneak Peek is worth it just for the money itself. The sheer amount of stuff you can do in it, test the physics, is just pure fun. The destruction on the cars I the best I've seen. There's not many tracks at the moment, but right now its only pre-alpha and they're adding more onto based on their development roadmap.Highly recommended if you're looking for a racing game with lots of destruction.

								Let me start of by stating this is actually pre-alpha. However, it is extremely badass and very promising despite the complete lack of content it shows a lot of promise. Next-car game offers much for a game so early in its development, the physics engine is second to none and the handling on the cars feels like it's getting there. The pre-alpha even boasts a photo mode to capture all the carnage, and looks like it will support lots of lens effects and photo editing tools too. Neat! Verdict: One to watch. Don't hesitate to buy if you support development. Very promising.7.5/10 "

								Great potential, just like any other games that's still in pre-alpha. It's fun for a very short while and then the outstandingly low amount of content quickly makes you wonder how a game that needed 350.000$ to get done with a kickstarter, that ended up earning over 1.000.000$ in sales in only ONE week (In January 2014 when it was released as early access) can still be in in such a poor state. Considering development started in 2012 for this game, how much more money or time do you need to get out of pre-alpha?Another good example of how buying unfinished products is bad for the industry.

								New info first:They have finally released the major update. Lot of things have changed. More cars and tuning possibilities. New graphics ect. (read update reports). -The game doesnt feel the same now. (No... It's even better after new updates)-Graphics are nice and smooth now. Better than it was.-Car physics still needs bit of a work to do but the feel of chaos is intense again.-Online gaming is lot smoother and less laggy than it wasBUT.... Devs had a lot of work to get that new stuff to work and now they can focus on polishing it and releasing a new content. Oh and I almost forgot! New team racing mode feels really refreshing and fun. Im sorry that I crashed in to my teammates couple of time and they ended into drive in bonfires, but I lost the control of my car... :PThis really is a really good game at this stage, but need a lot of work to do before finished! I will highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to drive!My older review below:Great physichs! Beautiful graphics! Extremely fun to play! Lots.... and I mean LOTS of car parts and trash flying! (<-In a nutshell) This game is an experience that reminds me a bit of first Flatout, but is so much more. Control of the car feels good and theres lots of potential to be a game of the year. In a 24 player race after two laps theres so much trash and car wrecks on the road that makes it hard to get to the goal or avoid crashing. And when you crash and stop others behind you can hit you hard and it might be the end of the race for you. AI is really good and it makes mistakes as well and its fun to watch them crashing when you gain better position. They drive pretty good too and its not so simple thing to be #1. Derby is fun but I prefer racing more. In a derby the cars will be totally rasins after the round. Even too much if you are too serious but at the end it really doesent matter. Its so much fun anyway. In the early access theres now 2 race tracks, 2 cars and a derby arena. It isnt much but I still keep playing. This feels so fresh and welcoming after all crappy car games and NFS games what cant give you anything new. Cant wait when this pearl is ready!			"

Early Access Review
								About 2 years ago i bought a ""Promise"".... I saw the Sneak Peek 2.0 and i loved it! Remembering the good old times with Flatout i thought to my self ""This is what i want and i will support it."", so i bought the ""Early Access Game. And for a while it was good. But since we are in a ""Early Access Game"" things can change completley. Im sitting here and watching this Slideshow from screenshots out of the game today and i ask my self ""Where is all that stuff from the screenshots that BUGBEAR is showing and advertising?!?"".Since the grand ""Overhaul"" of the whole game engine and concept, this game turned in to a racing simulator. There are no more chrashes like on the screenshots. No flying physics particles and parts or wheels. There is no flying ragdolls or cardeformations like on these Screenshots you are looking at. The whole game is stripped of this. It is a bad unfinished racing simulator where you get penalties when you touch the gras on the side of the road.  It is hard as hell and BORING as ♥♥♥♥! It turned from a fun carnage wreckfest in to a boring Simulator. The new engine has a problem with NVIDIA cards of the 700 series. The whole screen flickers and makes the game almost unplayable. This issue is reported more than 7 months ago from many people, NO change in this direction til today. There are Forumposts from people who have older cards of the 600 generation, they cant even play this garbage with playable framerates. I dont understand (well actualy i do) why Bugbear still shows these Screenshots here. There is nothing like this in the game at all. Exept the screenshots from the Sneak Peek 2.0 but the Sneek Peak is nothing like the real game today. This is also something that puzzles me, why dont they say that the Sneak Peek 2.0 is nothing like the real game. Why dont they correct this missunderstanding and make a Sneak Peek 3.0. The 2.0 Version is not even the same engine as the new one. I is a straight out LIE! I understand that it still is unfinished and that things will change in the future and all the bugs i mentioned will disapear but the game like they are showing on these Screenshots and in the Sneak Peek 2.0 does not exist.My final verdict: Don't buy this game if you wanted a fun racer with tonns of chrashes and carnage. Don't buy this until they finish their work.			"

Early Access Review
								Players need to understand about the fun of this game is that it is more challenging but also more rewarding to try to actually overtake someone by using more clever racing lines. I mean, just ramming into someone is easy but what is the motivation behind it? You don't actually become better driver by doing it. It's more likely you just ruin your own race when the cars get stuck due to the 'glue effect'. If you want to wreck the cars, there are derby races for it.In addition, I'd like to point out that the fun in racing isn't only about the results. Racing against someone who drives approximately as fast as you is more rewarding than dominating a race. I once got to race wheel-to-wheel with someone on the Tarmac track for almost two whole laps, and despite finishing second, that was one of the highlights of my online racing career. No stupid ramming, just cars overtaking each other with only minor banging of wheels, with both drivers leaving enough space to keep the racing neat and tidy  :)That is what this game should be about. Wreckfest offers a good framework for clean racing with its driving physics, but also with its damage model: the cars can undergo a few collisions with essentially no loss of speed or drivability. This is what many racing games such as iRacing lack. They can have better physics but the cars may become undrivable after a small contact. In addition, racing is not bound to tarmac circuits, but takes place on several terrain types, such as mud and sand.			"

								This game is propably never going to be finished. Bugbear is currently on the brink of going bankrupt and they're trying grab money from people any way they can.They recently announced another game like this called Stuntfest. Think about it. They run out of money to finish this, so they made up another game to grab money for it, but a struggling small studio can't possibly handle two games at the same time. Then they also announced console versions for Wreckfest to try to grab money from the console players. They are just trying to get as much money as they can before their ship sinks. Bugbear is not the same studio it was years ago. Don't let their history fool you. Don't let them cheat your money. It's time to let go.And this is coming from someone who used to love Wreckfest and was a Bugbear fan.Who knows, maybe I'm just dead wrong and they actually pull this off and release the game in a year or two, but right now, that seems very unlikely.

								Full rant: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheZeronShow/discussions/7/341537388320933636/This is a placeholder recommendation for now, I will eventually post a more detailed and precise review about the game itself.Needed to make this placeholder review just to inform everyone not to buy this game until Bugbear cleans up their act. It's unfortunate that I have to do this, but I can't just sit here without exposing Bugbear for their shady practices that have been haunting the game's development.After many years, the game is still an unfinished mess, Digital Deluxe backers still don't have their perks and now... they made a new game and they are already developing consoles versions of Wreckfest without finishing the PC version first. It's clear that they are squeezing as much money as they can right now, so they blatantly screw their customers without giving a rat's butt about their reputation.The new game they made, is free for people who backed Wreckfest on their site. YET, people like me who bought the game on Steam for the same price, don't get the new game for free. There's no way, anyone in this planet can think this is fair. They don't care about their Steam customers, otherwise we would get the same perks. I've had enough with Bugbear and I certainly won't buy anything else from them unless they clean up their act.If you're reading this and you still don't own the game, wait until the moment they say the game is complete. I really want to know if they have the guts to call this complete in early 2017 (which is the date that's being rumoured right now) despite having at least one more year of work for this game to be truthfully complete.Do NOT defend Bugbear's evil practices, this is what's ruining gaming nowadays.

								Next Car Game: Wreckfest is one of those games that you don't see often now-a-days.Next Car Game: Wreckfest is the spiritual successor to Destruction Derby 2 for the PlayStation 1 (In my opinion of course)I've had tons of fun with this game, not only do I feel like the cars have great handling (Even though sometimes they can feel a bit floaty) but the sensation of smashing into other cars in the arenas is amazing. SLAM! POW! BANG!There's some good challenges in the game as well, winning the tarmac race can be quite difficult and being the last one in the arenas is quite hard to do as well however I do really love the game no matter how bad I am at it.But, the game is not perfect, long from being it. I mentioned before that the cars might feel floaty at times and the game really hogs all the power from your computer. It's not a game for all computers. (I run it at 55 fps on almost ultra with my GTX 750ti and 45-50 on ultra)With that said, lets just get to the pros and cons.Pros: Tons of fun (smashing into cars and half-drifting around corners) Great physics Great damage on cars Sound effects are amazing One of the best car wrecking games out thereIn between: Graphics compared to how much power it needs Cars can be floaty from time to time The variety of tracksCons: Uses way too much power for what it really is. A game like ""The Crew"" uses less right now. (The beta version) Computer AI can be a bit douchy from time to time. The variety of cars Not a great racing game (But a god damn good wrecking game)Notes: This game is in my opinion the spirital successor to Destruction Derby 2 and Test Drive: Eve of Destruction.I would recommend you using a controller or a steering wheel. Playing with a keyboard is no fun.Always have manly liquor near you when you play this game. Minimum requirement is beer.			"

Early Access Review
								November 2016 Update! The classic Flatout stunt mode is now a seperate early access game! Still being packaged with the original Sneak Peak 2.0 and video! We're now never going to get only half the game we were promised. Bugbear's entire team should be blacklisted from the industry for this absurd fraud. I wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ on them if they were on fire. The game still runs like trash. Game continues to look worse. Damage models based on highly accurate plasticine cars. BeamNG is already lightyears ahead of this festering sewer of a game and being updated at a significantly faster rate. Wreckfest is so ♥♥♥♥, it's retroactively ruined the good Bugbear games for me. Another half a year gone, and Wreckfest is still an unfinished mess. Soon it's failed development will surpass the development time of every Flatout game combined. This May 2016 update contains little new, because the game contains litte new. First, let me totally clear. This game is now nothing like the Flatout Racing games that they sold it as back in 2014. As it stands today, it's a playable mess. The only thing worthwhile I've gotten out of was the Sneak Peek 2.0. Graphics are solid, but dated despite the new engine and performance is dreadful across the board. The confusion of an arcade destruction racer drunkenly switching to a clean racing sim style game in late development has left the game playing like crap. Gone is the delightful destruction, but the physics are sub-par for a clean racing sim, and the change in collision physics mean you can be t-boned and then pushed around the track for entire laps incapable of escape except by reseting.And about those big engine changes and the updates to clean racing sim. They're weak excuses at best, and damned lies most likely. It's the latest in a very long stream of weak rationales offered up by the developers for why they've done little and released less. Around the time of my first major review, the excuse was major overhauling because people wanted the final game to keep the 24 person races featured in the earliest releases. (Apparently only there for stress testing and not originally intended for release). They've released more excuses for not making cars than they have cars.This developers have adopted a 'take the money and wander off drunkly' approach. They haven't utterly abandoned the game, they were prepared with a shameless cash grab upate announcement for the Steam Summer Sale. Don't hold out hope and don't make excuses. The game has been in development for four years. In early access for two years. It only took two years to make Flatout 2. This isn't some first time indie dev, Bugbear's previous titles have easily grossed over 100 million dollars in sales. They don't deserve your money, or mine. I can't get mine back, so I'll keep coming back and updating my review. I'll have to add a video special in another two years, once this game has taken as long as all of the Flatout games Bugbear made, COMBINED.Bugbear used to make good games, but their last full release (Ridge Racer Unbounded) was a disaster that took six years development. Hop over and look at how it turned out. The reviews are strangely prophetic as Wreckfest tries to be a strange mix of racing sim and destruction, the same poorly handling blend described in Ridge Racer Unbounded's numerous reviews.			"

Early Access Review
								My probelm with this game is that in every way it is not worth $30. I put in about $5 when it was in kickstarter and it's totally worth that but anyone who paid $30 got ripped. They will never finish this game, it was their toy, and now that they have made some money on what is now an outdated game, they will do what they have done with other games and move on. It's a shame, but it's true.HOWEVER, this game could be a ton of fun with very little work involved. make the game as-is right now but add the ability to download from a third party, cars and tracks and for gods sake fix the damn MP to function. Every time i join a race I'm all psyched thinking ""i have a ping of 50 this race should be incredible"" only to be disappointed when the screen constantly flutters and my car jumps around on the track and i have momentary loss of all control over the car for a half second at a time.Even more idiotic is the control scheme. they have (what i can only imagine) is gear selections for someone with an H shifter (6 gears+ reverse) however, there is no clutch binding, rendering that useless, and if you go with some sort of sequential, you might as well just select automatic, because the shifts are so slow I could complete a lap around one of the Oval tracks before someone could shift from reverse to 5th gear and back... just kinda sad. it's like grandma is sitting in the passenger seat trying to shift the gears for you. There is no real support for axis controls. The throttle only really gets recognized at about 50% anything before that makes the engine do funny stuff like not work or sputter or just go full throttle, the steering axis seems to be the only one that works, and I'm pretty sure if you set an axis for handbrake it doesn't work at all. All of which the axis cannot be calibrated. This goes for any controller, xbox controller, wheel, doesn't matter, it just doesn't work well.Lastly, The soft body physics were supposed to be the spotlight of the game yet they are an embarassment to anyone in the animations world because it's so terrible and fake. The cars deform, but not realistically. Watch some video's of Beam.NG that is true car deformation. This game should have that, but instead it is as if your car is build from some kind of metal that after it gets hit with ""x"" amount of force it turns into putty and then back hard. It's laughable, and somwhat comical at times, but to be honest I would rather the frame break or a wheel fall off than to have some warped up car with two wheels still able to drive at full speed even though the engine is bent at a 45° angle and would not function any longer. Yes it's supposed to be a goofy game, but how goofy do we really want it to be?That brings up another point. The devs brag about a tire model to make it realistic yet show no concern to make the game realistic. I think the devs got lost somewhere and didn't know what to do, and to be honest I think it was when they started selling the game. I think they said ""heck with making what we started, let's just conform to our target market"" and that tarket market is somewhere between chimps on cocaine and Sim racers looking to goof off, which would actually be a great discription of how this game is made. Some parts are super awesome, other parts seem to have came out of a coloring book.I'm just not sure what this game is or isn't supposed to be and every time you go to mention an issue with the game on any forum, you will be blasted for questioning it. I don't see how so many people can drink the kool-aid thinking this game will be finished when it took nearly a year for a single update to drop on this game. Let's face it a year between updates means they don't care anymore, regardless of what they post on their website.			"

								Sadly I have to change my positive review to one that is now negative.  The game used to be real fun, you could load it up get straight into an online race and race and smash your way around the track!!  So great!!Now the devs seem to have implemented some type of rpg career type mode in the MP!!!  This means that you start off with a slower less powerful car and race against others with better faster cars.  Your car will become damaged now and you have to finance the replacement of new parts.  It seem you get most money from playing singe-player.  So back to that mode to get some money to be able to go back in multiplayer.Why would devs make it like this?A lot of people just want to online race, not screw about replacing body parts and having the other people on the start line having faster cars!!!If the devs realise the error of their way I will rewrite this review, but this mechanic in the game completly breaks the game.

								ATTENTION: Bugbear will start doing monthly updates for this game, starting this month, February. They found a full-time funder, so they can really start cranking this thing. More info here: http://www.wreckfestgame.com/wreckfest-december-update/Anyways, I have always enjoyed this game. I have had it for a while, and I have enjoyed most of it. Yes, it has been in ""early access"" for longer than any of us wanted. However, I think the future will be brighter for this game than it has the last few years. At least I hope so.If you are looking for an all-contact racing game, this is your game, as long as you can run it. My GTX 970 on the highest settings on 1080p, I get 40-60 fps. The driving in this game is very heavy, unlike its predecessors. You can really feel it when you hit another car head on. There isn't a whole lot of content in it- about 5 tracks and about 10 cars. The AI are brutal drivers, so you have to fend them off (or go on the offensive) while staying on the track. There is a multiplayer, but I don't think it is too populated. If this game interests you, or your rig might not be able to run it, you should also look into Flatout 1, Flatout 2, and Flatout Ultimate Carnage. They are more arcade-y and lead to more intense racing.Edit: Here's a link to Bugbear's twitter so you can see what they are working on: https://twitter.com/bugbeargamesHere's my part list for reference: http://pcpartpicker.com/b/Xthqqs "

								Just tested the 2016 December update. The game is becoming more bland, dull and nothing like FlatOut series.I know one shouldn't be expected to keep producing the same thing, but FlatOut was fun. This is creeping into ""serious"" destruction derby business, trying to be somewhat a simulation. And not being very good or engaging at it. Even the recent update to Gravel 1 track just removed a ton of fun and interesting feautres - less objects on the side of the track to crash into, the track edges are less dangerous. The AI seems to be way more passive and ""serious"", causing less accidents. At this point I'm not even sure, why I'm not playing GRID.And to top it all off, they decided to make a separate game for ragdoll events. So the game I bought hoping for FlatOut like experience is getting further away from FlatOut, and now they're making another game that is just a tiny fraction of FlatOut, and no real FlatOut successor on the horizon. Why on earth would you call this mess the ""next car game?""And after completing the december survey, it seems, that the developers are more interested whether they should add new rim mods, or new paint jobs for the cars, instead of worrying about the gameplay (track) design.Please, make the game fun! Focus on track design. Then career. Leave modifications for the last part. Now they've added forced progression which locks out a ton of cars, so you have to play the game to even test out things that are in this pre-aplha(!) build. Poor gameplay design, and yet, a progression system in a test build! It's ludicrous.TLDR: It's not fun.			"

								What an absolute disappointment of a game. What happened to you Bugbear? I bought this game under the promise of getting the next Flatout game, from the original devs. The original alpha build was fantastic fun, with an emphasis of destruction of vehicles and unpredicatable car mayham. It was an absolute blast. What happened afterwards baffles me. I have no idea what happened to the devs and what happened to this game. The physics have completely changed, now making destruction minimal and not very fun. The arcadey fun racer has turned into a pseudo racing sim. Its been 2 years and next to nothing has been added. Even Flatout 3 was better than this mess. At least it had content.			"

								Avoid right now. Devs don't handle early access business well. My worst early access experience to this date. Average time between content updates is something like half a year?Maybe someday it will leave early access and fully release. I hope so, as Flatout was my favourite racing series. But a this rate and pace this will not happen this year and I'm not sure about next year either. I'm not even sure they're going in right direction...So better wait.This is still my biggest early access disappointment. If I could I would refund it, even for only a fraction of what I paid for it. I would take that money and spent it on Assetto Corsa.			"

								I´m a big fan of the Flatout series and i want to be honest. This game really makes a lot of fun but I think Bugbear Entertainment has some problems with this game. The update frequency is the worst i´ve ever seen in a Early-Access game and i think the devs just ignore all the great ideas that the community has. They sad the game will be finished early 2017 but when the game only gets 2 updates in 1 year i don´t think they´re gonna make it. I really hope they´re going to finish this game next year and i would be glad when it gives me a smile on the face like Flatout do. I´m going to change the review when the game is finally out of Early Access.			"

								What happened, BugBear? You gave us Flatout, probably the greatest, most fun racing game series of all times that conquered hearts of many, including mine. For me Flatout 2 will always be the one and only out there. When GameSpy support was shut down and multiplayer became nomore, people almost forgot about you, yet kept playing your games. The fans found a way to play online even after the official online support was cut off. You know what it's called? Devotion. And also approval, it reflects the quality of your product, of your hard work that's been put into it to deliver. A silent thankful tribute to what you once did. You actually managed to do something incredible back then. Then after several years you came out of nowhere with NCG and made such a hype with this new project of yours, which was understandable, people remembered who gave them Flatout and supported you with EA. I heard you raised what, a couple millions at least?.. NCG was supposed to become a spiritual continuation, was supposed to become the new Flatout. But from the very first look at it, it was clear that something was wrong, at least for me. Something was terribly wrong. The far the worse, for the reasons unknown you've made that weird decision to overhaul the engine. Why, who asked for it? Did you do it in order to be able to have 24 players, i heard? Why, why such a need for such a mess on a track, whose idea was it? I think i know. That's a step towards the quantity over quality, which is never good. People on forums talk from your name. You know who i'm talking about, yes. Same people. All the time, everytime.  Why couldn't you just stick to the good old Flatout concept of yours? NCG doesn't have to be EXACTLY like your old games, but it's become clear enough that you don't know yourselves where you're going with it, you're completely lost. Your game is neither a hardcore sim nor a fun arcade. And let's be honest, your fans just wanted the new Flatout. Including myself. Why couldn't you just stick to what you knew how to do like nobody else and decided to re-invent a wheel, will always remain mystery. Your community tore itself apart due to your highly controversial decisions. And now look at it. All that's left from the communty now is a tiny group of people. One and a half person play your game, servers are empty and deserted, i heard. The very same people who write on the forums under EVERY SINGLE POST that  rightfully criticize your unfinished, ugly mess, because there are no other words for your... creation, if it may be called so.  And they behave aggressively. And it's noone's fault but yours. You've had it all, all you had to do is follow your own instructions, but no! You've failed your own concept! The key to success was right under your nose but you turned away.I loved you, but will refrain from buying your products in future, if there will be any, and for what you did i give you another negative review. You used to be awesome. What happened, BugBear?			"

								This game has been wasting space on my hard drive for two years. Sure, this game has brought me some fun moments, and I think it has potential to become a great game. But for now, please spend your money on something else. Between when I bought it in April of 2014 and now, there have not been very many major updates. There was a physics ""re-working"" (although it feels about the same) and a few new tracks, even ragdoll physics. But at this moment in time, I can't say what I spent on this game was worth it. If this game becomes a finished product, then you can consider purchasing it, but please don't buy it now. This is the way of Early Access titles these days. You buy it hoping for something great and fun, and for a little bit it is. But after you realize that the development team has taken your money and ran, you feel forgotton, and you surely are.			"

I understand you want the physics engine to be ""just right"" before you release it, but maybe devoting all of your assets to it and not giving your stakeholders ANYTHING to play with for 6 months? Not a good idea. Maybe have part of the team work on the physics engine while the other part can give us something new? Maybe now isn't the best time to do the hardest part of the game when we only have a few tracks and a few things to do?Your decisions are ruining this community, there is barely anyone playing multiplayer anymore!

Early Access Review
I wanted to like this game, knowing Bugbear's calibre in the banger racing game scene...Wreckfest is a racing and smashing game inspired by the Demolition Derby series and Street Rod, aiming to provide a comprehensive banger racing experience. This being an Early Access title, it is subject to more bugs than released games.Menus aren't interesting enough. I feel like the buttons are too small. Keyboard and mouse navigation is ok, but gamepad users need to use the left stick to navigate sluggishly. You can open your car's boot, bonnet and doors for no reason other than to look at the things inside - if they allowed access to certain tuning categories and especially showed the engine change from upgrades, I'd like this feature more.Graphically, it lacks artistic flair but the technology is good. Something about the mildly muted colours puts me off from enjoying the rather spectacular impacts and particle effects. Engine sounds have an annoying, though admittedly somewhat realistic, tendency to be really quiet until you hit the high RPM band, then they're really loud. More diverse crash sound effects would be welcome. The same two songs we've heard for years are still the only actual music in this game.If you've played Flatout 1, 2 or Ultimate Carnage, the gameplay will feel pretty similar. It's either full contact racing or demolition derby arenas, with an added strategic layer as locational damage to your car's segments means you'll want to reverse into people to protect your vulnerable front end. The hybrid of locational damage and overall health strikes me odd, however, and cars can become wrecked if they lose both front wheels despite overall hit points being above half. The handling feels like too much of a simulation, with respect to banger cars not exactly being easy to drive. Shifting into reverse with a manual transmission is torture. This game initially had a Kickstarter campaign in, I believe, 2012 or 2013, but it was cancelled because it wasn't successful enough. In 2014, it hit Steam Early Access. The actual progress made on the game, to be honest, feels way too incremental. Major additions since the initial Steam version are: a rudimentary crew system, where you assign crew to each vehicle and allow maintenance on worn parts; multiplayer; several new cars and tracks; dozens of reworks for the handling and physics systems; and a Workshop page for mods and conversions. Bugbear insisted, initially, on avoiding the over-the-top ragdoll elements of Flatout so as to keep the age rating down... then we got lawnmower derbies, and wrecking or flipping tossed your driver around the field. What especially disappoints me about the €25 purchase I've made, is that now rumours are surfacing about Bugbear being in financial trouble and in danger of bankruptcy. What is most concerning is that they've also announced development on: two console versions of Wreckfest for the PS4 and XB1, AND a spin-off title, Stuntfest, which brings back Flatout's ragdoll tossing minigames as its selling point... and using the environment and many assets from the Wreckfest Sneak Peak Demo that you received if you purchased it from Early Access or Pre-ordered from their website. It's become clear to me that they're trying to cash in now while they still can. It's very unlikely that even a talented studio such as Bugbear could provide four games before running out of money. Oh and you need to buy Stuntfest separately, because pre-orders and EA purchases aren't getting Stuntfest. And to hammer the nail into the coffin, it increasingly feels like the addition of the Workshop to Wreckfest is so that the community picks up the game from where development will eventually cease, and make it into a ""complete game"", which I'm upset about. EDIT: Bugbear has announced that it is backed by a partner and it is now on track towards finalizing the game, in addition to openly acknowledging Wreckfest as its top priority. There might be hope for the game still, but until then, please refrain from buying it in its Early Access form.			"

								People need to know, the reason they have not updated is because they have been currently re doing the entire physics engine for the game. They are redoing the entire core of the game itself. Also if you browse their forums, and browse their blog there is many upon many updates. Don't you think they find their own lack of updates disturbing? Thats why they have been teasing new tracks, new cars, and many other things. They havey an entire hallway dedicated to tracks. People just need to give them time because with this new Early access it throws many things in the Game making process off. Instead of making just 1 final build that people will play and update off of that final build. They have to make several final builds, and give those to the early access. They are trying to release a ""final game"" as their next update. Also if you check their forums, you'd find out why there has been lack of updates. They have cars falling from the sky, they also have things that would make a car halfway through a wall. Guys be Patient, i've seen what is coming (via the forums) and this wait will be worth it. This physics are already amazing, the cars and the tracks they have can make you playing for hours. Yes, you can only play so much with 5 cars, and i believe 7 tracks. Just think of it this way, they know the update is taking long. Don't you think they will put more and more things in this next build to make up for it? Also, once they re-do the engine, updates WILL be much more frequent. Just realize people. The base of the game is what takes the longest in game making. This is a recommended buy!As for those who obviously doesn't know how game development works, and how changing things especially the main physics of the game works, or how that can affect things, look at thishttp://nextcargame.com/week-16-report/Does this game still look fun to play? Maybe for the first 10 mins, within the first 50 meters, car disengration, let them do what they have been doing.			"

								Please understand that this review is based on my perspective. As much as I'd love to give this game a thumbs up, I can't. Months ago, I would have gave it a thumbs up. Why? Because there use to be updates. Instead, they just stopped updating the game, took their cash, and said ""Screw you, fans!"" This game has great potential. The sad thing is that they threw that potential away and made this game a cash-grab.Pros: It has amazing physics and beautiful crashing damage.         A lot of customization options (Type of suspension, engine, etc)Cons: Very few vehicles          No updates in months          Keeps you entertained for only a few hours          No reward for winning a match These are what I could think of off the top of my head. I'm sure there are more. Stay away from this game for as long as possible. They don't deserve the money they have. You shouldn't give them any more money until they prove that they will be updating this game (at the most) every month. No developer should ever do this to their fans. This is complete selfishness.

								If you want to know where the game is at now days.. Look for Santa Clause.. You'll have better luck.So the game was awesome and they were going in a superb direction.. but BugBear have decided to stop all development and open the game out to modders.. A game that modders don't play as they are already in places like Race Department, Touring Pro series, Race2Play and the million of other PVT leagues / Communities places and on games like rFactor / Assetto..So you may get 100 mods but 99 of them will be crap and fan made and you MIGHT find a proper gem now and then.. when an actual modder picks the game up and works with it..So to sum it up.. ALL gaming development is on stop and they are adding things for the modders to use..Ohhh and the 30 to 40 players (on a good day) that are logged in playing the MP side.. Yeah. The modding is going to split up the small player base to Modded servers and non modded servers..YEY.. Let us download content that only 2 others are on.. Oh wait, they have changed the server.. download new mod..No thanks.REALLY Angry about this because this could of been the very best game of it's type.. now it's going to be rocking in the corner of the room because of the abuse it's sustained by BugBear.*Slow clap*			"

								This is... or was what seemed to be a promising game... Loved all the Flatout games. I bought this game in hopes it was going to be put onto the same path... Excellence. The physics demo was cool. showed us all what they could do. but every so often i jump on to check out the updates... oh but wait... what updates? I bought this game 6/2/2015. and the only DECENT update was the multiplayer... but even than it was laggy and spikey all over the tracks. I understand this is an early access game. but lets get real... Bugbear needs to step up to there reputation and complete this game. The slack is real.I do not recomend this game until it has been finished. OR atleast closer to being finished			"

								I bought the game on sale about a year ago and it was a fun game, but there wasn't a lot of variations with the races. Since then, there's been a major patch, plus a lot of little ones, that have improves the difficulty of the game and added more variation. You can no longer simply hold the gas down the entire time and braking in tight curves is needed to avoid crashed. Speaking of crashes, the crashing and damage has been upgraded as well and now you can really feel the imact of the crashes. You no longer flip as easily as before the big patch, but it is still possible to roll in the right circumstance. It is still early access, but I think it is worth the money. I've certainly put in enough hours to enjoy the game.One last note: If you see any review from June 30th to July 7th or so, ignore it. The physics engine has changed a lot since the June 30th update. Cars are easier to control, crashes have more weight to them, cars are damaged in more extreme ways. In the two weeks since the June 30th major patch, there have been numerous improvements that make the early reviews out of date already.			"

								NCG Wreckfest is one of the most fun arcade racing games i have played since probably Burnout Paradise back in 2009. this game captures the inner maniac in all of us and is a brilliant successor to the ""Flatout"" Series. not only is it fun to play with a keyboard, but it is also a challenging-yet-fun game once you plug your G27 or your Gamepad of choice into the USB Slot. overall, i would say that this game is well worth all the $30 that i spent on it, Keep up the good work BUGBEAR!

								This game launched in early access on January 14th, 2014. It hasn't really progressed much since then. It seems like these guys are very mismanaged, or they ran out of money or something. I wouldn't spend $10 on this game, and especially not $40, which is what it's priced at in USD as of 11/3/2016. Its past has been bleak, and its future looks bleak. Don't buy it.			"

								My mate bought it for me 3 years ago as an Xmas present and now I feel like I owe him the money he spent. 'Early Access' for 3 ♥♥♥♥ing years is beyond a joke and is a clear reason why you should never buy something from 'Early Access' no matter how good it looks at the time.Seriously just pick up a Burnout, Flatout, DIRT, FUEL or any other offroad crash filled car game instead.

Early Access Review
								I really hoped that this game would push out some content, but after a year only a few minor changes have been implemented. It litterally feels as if one person takes a weekend a month to type in a few lines of code to keep this game updated to a bare minimum. Steam should really REALLY force to implement a system to get your money back and bankrupt studio's who pull off stunts like this. If you want to have an early access game, you are basically asking for a kickstart. Not finishing the product is basically stealing money from people who trust the studio. And when you steal my money, I want it back. Period. That or give me what I paid for, investing money in a great concept and finish a functional game. This trend where people try out game design and quit half way through is getting out of hand. Same with Cube World. One guy earns millions. Wife comlpains he should focus more on his family and he stops updating the game. Litterally nothing new has come out there as well. Paying money for tech demo's? Has the market really changed where the gamers themselves are the investors? Are we supposed to take the risk with our money to pay for, not only an unfinished product, but the chance they abandon the project as well?If you want to pay for a really nice and original tech demo 27,99 is 27,99 too much for this title. No updates. Half a demo with barely any content or game design. Abandoning your game is a gamers crime and should not be accepted. Steam should really work on a envirionment where the gamer is put on the first place and this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ behaviour stays unrewarded. Early acces should have a function that if too many people downvote the progress of this game, they should be able to get their money back. They are stealing from us while we trust them with our money. This is legal, but really should be made impossible. I know it's our choice to pay for it, but if the developer abandons the game the buyer should have the right to abandon the developer and get their money back.Do not buy this game anymore... Just don't.			"

								The latest update directly from their blog on their official site states they are currently working on a re-polished physics engine and once released they will begin to focus on pushing for more frequent updates. that was posted 2/10/2015 so it IS possible its not abandoned! took only a couple seconds to find this information. Dont only rely on steam comments and news feeds to get you by! As for the game its a really neat game, really shows a lot of promise and I cant wait for future updates to be able to really wreck some havoc. Physics are nice currently, but are lacking. car models are pretty, destruction physics are pretty good too but DAMN, you can really ruin a car. Somewhat odd that it still rolls in that condition. Good game, from a tech demo standpoint. Get it if you are curious to see what the future MIGHT hold for the game, otherwise, wait for a couple more updates. If you have the cash, do it!			"

The developer barely lets you know what is going to change in Early Access or even a plan of what would happen. Sure, you get an update maybe every couple of months, or years, but the game is still in PRE-ALPHA!!! It isn't even in alpha yet after TWO YEARS?!Seriously, what are they doing? Oh yeah, developing for consoles and making a completely different game based on this game's engine!			"

			*This is an early access game. What you see here does not reflect the initial release of the game. Quick review for Next Car Game available on Steam Early Access -...		

So, what do we really have here. From a distance it looks like just another derstrcution derby type game that we all have seen times before that is amazing, yet get bored with after just a few hours of gameplay, but being that it was from the makers of Flatout 1 and 2. I had to do some research on it and as I dug into the game a little more I found out what the plans are for the future of the game and my perspective started to change a little.Now with this game being in an early state. There is a limit to whats available right now. You get 2 cars to choose from right now. One being your typical American Classic Muscle car and the other being a a small European Classic. Along with that you also recieve 3 tracks to play on. One Demolition Derby style track and 2 race tracks each with 3 modes of play including a 24 player race, a 12 player race, and a practice mode. There is also something included with Early Access that is called ""Next Car Game Sneak Peak 2.0"" Which Is pretty much a playground for enviroment and body damage testing.  Its actually really fun to just play around in. As for the physics and controls on the cars.  I was quite impressed as the destrction and just the overall feel for the cars felt quite unique and really smooth. The game features soft body damage and even environment damage that looks and acts far more realistic than any other game of this type has before. Right now the AI is a little aggressive and there is no difficulty option available at the moment so you will have to learn how to defend yourself against them. I reccommend practicing the tracks atleast once before starting a 24 player race. Multiplayer will be made available and players hosting will have options to customize the server by changing various options like private or public and allowing upgrades on vehicles or not. I can imagine a 24 player online race would be really intense in a game like this and definitley something I would want to experience.Along side all that there is vehicle upgrading and modifiying as well. You are limited on what you can change right now, but there are a few options. Alot of stuff is to be added later so expect to be spending alot of time in your garage customizing and tuning the 24 vehicles that are supposed to be released with the full game. Customization will include engine upgrades, body parts, and custom paintjobs altho the main focus it on the internal workings of the car itself. You will also have to change parts between races too as the parts will take damage and become worn out.  I have also read there will be an ingame classifieds section where you will be able to buy and sell cars and their parts, but not much was said about it. Lets hope this does get included.Overall I'm really looking forward to the initial release of this game as I have become quite bored with the very few tracks and cars available right now. Im hoping for a patch really soon. I highly reccommend this game to any racing game finatics and especially anyone that is a fan of the Flatout series. I have high hopes and expectations for the game so lets hope Bug Bear really puts their all into this.  "

								Absolutely love this game, have done since the very first sneak peek and public version, every update added something diferent, some made a certain track worse, the rest have only added to how the game is, other reviews from people that haven't played the game too much really are missing the point, once you get to know players the game only becomes more enjoyable as you become part of a community, the modding updates bringing the whole community closer together. whilst also making the game ready for a multitude of different mods ranging from tracks from older games, to fictional ones, to improvements and a large variety of new cars, I, for one, added an old VW van into it and soon a Mini, others have made Lancias and Dodge Chargers and track ports from Destruction Derby 2! Take it as you will, but this game isn't dead in any way			"

								I don't normally go around bashing games but I feel I've been ripped off with this one. Been hoping this game would start looking like a polished product by now. It looks like someone got in over their head with this project. Don't be fooled by the pic's on the store page, the gameplay is poor for the amount of time the dev's have had. I want to love this game... Just can't wrap my arms around it. I'm even sad that I can't recomend it. They should just re-release Flatout Ultimate Carnage - Remove GFWL and add a Multiplayer LAN option. It's a lot better than this tird. You can't polish a tird. But what do I know... I'm just a gamer. I hope the dev's prove me wrong someday... At this point (October 1 2015) , still a waste of money. I'm very disappointed with this game.Just deceided to re-visit this game tonight (January 18 2016) currently selling for $39.99 CDN. What's changed??? Oh ya... "" Ride-On Lawnmowers"". December update??? Conviently near Christmas, just as someone here predicted. Just a ploy for more sales.I think the developers are getting a laugh out of all us suckers.Don't be a sucker.			"

Recent updates have made the graphics ugly and like a cartoon.  Also I can't shake the feeling that I've been had.  They never planned to finish this game.

								I think it's about time for me to write a review on my most-played game, in time for the Summer Sale! Even with my hours, I will try to remain as unbiased as possible within my review.So, let's start with the basics: Next Car Game: Wreckfest is developed by BugBear, creators of the infamous FlatOut series. This game is all about smashing cars in Destruction Derbies and Banger Races.Development rate on the game has, recently, been extremely good, with valuable content appearing once a month, give or take a week. Several updates have occured just before summer/winter sales, and I can't be entirely sure if this is a business practice or convenience. The pricetag on the game, as far as Early Access games go, is expensive for the content that it contains, I think.The content in the game, at the time of me writing this, is pretty good: 8 cars and a Lawnmower, 27 Variations of 12 Racetracks, and 5 Demolition Derby arenas. However, one car is obviously the best car in both speed and durability. The parts market is okay, but there is only a small variety of parts, and only one really fast combination. Fine tuning is very limited. Derby arenas are rather boring, and don't have many interesting props.AI in the game has become rather competetive over the last few updates, and is also more likely to hit other cars. They can be very fun to race against. Online has a steady playerbase during peak times of around 1-2 full servers (10-30 players), but during non-peak times, it is hard to find players.Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. I wouldn't have my hours if I didn't. Remember though, it is still an EARLY ACCESS game, there are bugs, unfinished things, and other wonky stuff. The game is a bit expensive when it's not on sale, but you can still go to nextcargame.com and buy a Steam Key for $25. I'm up for answering questions if needed.			"

								I've always loved the FlatOut series, so i'm sure i will love this too when they release the full version of NCG.I'm just gonna write a short review here for now.At first, the damage models are good, but i think you get wrecked too easily in a race, when there's 24 cars pushing you around.Then there is that damage indicator, when you take impact, well, i don't really like it, i felt it was like FPS game or something.Anyways, seems pretty neat game, can't wait to tune a car from engine to seats.

But if this is the final product, mark it down to $5 and call it a complete game. This is a never ending demo we've all paid for it seems.			"

								Honestly i regret buying this game and i would tell people to stay away. It just feels like the developers dont know what they want to make and have absolutly no development time frame. This is a completely different game then when i bought it, and it seems like everytime i come back its like 2 steps back from where i left. There is a demotition derby game in here somewhere but the developers are driving a car that needs a wheel allignment on a oval track. It really shouldnt be this hard or take this long to make a demolition derby game.Also i just wanted to add that this game conviently gets a update every time steam has a sale. Dont be fooled.			"

								Just...don't. It's been two years and the game has barely changed. Any changes that have been made are for the worse! The sneak peek was awesome, and sold me on the early access. Now all the physics are rubbish, the driving feels slow, and the performance is GARBAGE. The game doesn't even look good to justify the bad framerate (which appears to be random as some people report no issues, and others with better specs have an unplayable 10fps.)Maybe the game will have a full release in the next few years, if you're lucky. Oh, wait. There's talk of bankruptcy - have a look at the forums.Spend your money on something else. For the £25 they are (laughably) charging, there are so many other games you could buy!			"

Early Access Review
								Ok so lets start out with what I like about this game:-Impacts feel satisfying and weighty-The sounds, oh the soundsYeah that was a short list wasn't it? let's get onto what I dislike:-The AI is just, the worst in a race, they use you to corner if you are there, otherwise they corner well and stay out of each    others way-Your car gets spun out very easily, especially compared to the AI cars which appear to be on rails and this is with every stability assist on!-If you have traction control on (Which is very needed otheriwse your car just doesn't grip up at the speeds of the AI cars) your car is slower in the corners, oh, and the back wheels are weird, sometimes traction control affects them, sometimes it doesn't-For some reason cars have a total health, even though each part of the car has it's own individual health, neither go down at an equal rate/ratio ( My engine can be dead, so my car is dead, but the total health still has half of the bar left or the fenders can be very dented, your car performing fine and yet it dies because total health reached zero)There is one final point I am reluctant to make and that is the lack of new content, they seem to be relying on modders to make new content as even after 4 months no new content has been added.There is one final, very last point I would like to make, there appears to be a deluxe edition available, no idea what it adds, but apparently it adds stuff that I won't be able to get I think, I don't know, they really haven't informed anyone about what it adds, I haven't been able to find anything on the forums about it, they haven't even sent me an automated email. I doubt I do have it however and the fact I bought it when it just exited greenlight on steam or around when it first came to steam and paid full price, never the less since it is still in EARLY ACCESS I refuse to allow them to try pull this BS.Oh yeah, now they are working on a new game without finishing this one, great, just what I wanted, an unfinished game because the devs found something shiny and decided it needed their attention other than this unfinished game which is comparable to a 3 year old currently on life support in need of life saving surgey, although this 3 year old may not get it, theres another 3 year old across the room that sneezed a couple times.

Early Access Review
								I've long been a fan of racing games, and I have to say Burnout Paradise was one of my favourites, I played it to the point of obsession, up until i got that damn platinum trophy on PS3. I loved the driving, I loved the vehicle smashing, i loved the game and picking it up on PC I expected once again to have fun. However having already completed the game in full, I unfortunately no longer had the desire to do it all again. This game has filled my Burnout Paradise void. Whether it be in the crazy races which I never seem to win (but never get frustrated with), or whether it is in those Car derbies which turn into an orgy of metal blocks running on their own fumes in the middle. The chaos in this game just fills me with the same joy Paradise did all those years ago. Whilst there's not a lot available now in the game, I expect myself to get on and race to pass the time every now and again until more and more content becomes available. The smashing of the cars is the game's greatest strength and it never, gets old. This means there is tonnes of replayability if watching wrecks fly through the air is your thing (it is most certainly mine). There is nothing more satisfying than sending an opponent into stacked tires then watching them fly through the air with those same tires following behind him before showering down on his bonnet. The handling takes some getting used to, the extreme physicality that the other vehicles have sends your already hard to drive vehicle dancing and spinning from side to side as you try to gain control and move in a straight line. However once you do learn how to drive, you can take advantage of the sliding and turn into opponents during derbies or let them push you before you slide around at a corner in those races. Hard to master, but very rewarding. If racing or derbies get old for you, you will definitely want to check out the 2.0 demo. The smashing vehicles into crumbling textureless buildings and blue tires is oh so satisfying. A very fun way to pass the time. It makes we wonder if challenge maps will be availabe in the future in which users must navigate their way through traps to an end point. A lot of the 2.0 demo reminds me of the flatout games, were users would need to launch their car drivers out their windows towards a target. A similiar thing will hopefully be introduced in which users must get their vehicles the longest distance with the least damage or perhaps even most damage! 2.0 has welcomed a world of possibilities to this excitingly fun game. I'm looking forward to the future Bugbear, I hope you deliver and exceed everyone's expectations with what is already a solid racer. If car orgies and intensely chaotic races are your thing, I would most definitely pick up this title, and along with me, look forward to what's to come!			"

								I loved this game when they released it on early access. There wasn't a lot to do and it only had 3 tracks but it was awesome. Cars were fast, the AI absolutely garbage but unbelievably fun. The game was the definition of chaos, very entertaining chaos.Over the course of the last few months we got almost no updates. I heard they had some problems with their engine but frankly I don't care. The last update was a big one, added the so called ""market"". Don't worry, it is not for microtransactions. But instead for parts and cars. You now start with the worst and slowest car on the planet and you earn ingame money after every race with which you can upgrade your car or buy a new one.So far so good, it is fun to have that in singleplayer although I would love to have a ""♥♥♥♥ it, let's jump into a race with the fastest cars""-mode. The problem is, that the career translates into multiplayer. That means as someone who hasn't played much I am now forced to either grind a few hours with my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car to get enough money to upgrade, or I can accept it and have NO chance of winning in multiplayer.The game itself is great but some design choices are crap. And updates take too long. And they raised the price right before the sale. Wait until it is finished and then take a look again.			"

								Firstly my impressions were that the game was a fun good car game. But i also had seen that bugbear was developing it which i was happy with. i bought the game well over a year or two ago and am not happy with the content and lack of fun in the game. It is missing a spark that makes derby games fun and has died down allot. Comparing the amount of people that did play it to the amount who play it now is massive. i am sad to say this but this game has died allot and i feel without something very new and pushing updates out faster no one will really continue playing it. Pros: Cars deform okay Some contentRacing is okayCons:You can take a blow to the back and catch fireLack of updatesLack of gamemodesLack on allot of stuff. I do really hope this game picks up as if someone does a derby game correctly it can be very fun but this one is currently failing. I hope bugbear picks up Do i recommend currently? No			"

Early Access Review
								Ok so this review is aimed more towards the Tech Demo (played over 6 hours of it) than the Early Access main game so far, mainly because the Tech Demo contains a lot more fun to be had (at this present time)It is refreshing to be able to purchase an Early Access game and have it not crash and burn on me within 5mins of playing. Infact, this game is already so stable that I have actually tried really hard to make it crash without success... Either my computer is better than it appears or the game's physics coding is so damn solid it's very hard to fault.Play the tech demo under the assumption that restrictions to the physics will be added in the future, because for now, as hilarious as it is, having your car STILL drivable with 1 wheel, no engine, and crushed into the size of a beach ball is a little far fetched, and while it is extremely satisfying to watch it get smashed and mangled into 1000 peices over and over and over in 1000 different ways, the realism is broken after a certain point because it has no killswitch as such. I am excited to see more from Next Car Game, especially different game modes, tracks, cars etc.If you enjoy FlatOut, Crashday, GRID or Destruction Derby (the original), then I highly recommend this game, especially the Tech Demo.Graphics are solid, the destruction physics are some of the most impressive I have ever seen (and I've seeked out games like this for over 15 years). It also has full controller support even for the very freshly added features (The cannon, added within the last couple of weeks). NOTE: You need a pretty beasty computer to enjoy this lag free. I suspect the graphics aren't nearly as taxing as the physics, so bare in mind that CPU power is a big player in this game.Very keen to see more from Bugbear.Early Access game: 6/10 (so far, with its current content)Tech Demo Bonus: 9/10If Bugbear added the physics playground to the Early Access game this would be hard not to give a 10/10 to.... But alas, they have kept them seperate for unknown reasons (they seem like different build versions)I've also attempted to take the game apart and see if I could port cars from the Early Access game to the tech demo, no such luck, this game in it's current form is NOT very moddable, not in any conventional way that I'm aware of.As for the cons of the game, well, it is Early Access so I'll try and be fair;- The title is a bit bland & generic, and doesn't accurately portrey the amount of effort these guys have put into coding such a detailed soft body dynamics engine.- Only 3 camera modes, which is ok, but it really needs more. Especially in a driving game. (And especially in it's current state)- There is no driver model as such, there is a driver inside the vehicle, but it is part of the soft body of the car, and thus bends and mangles with the car, funny, but realism breaking.- The sound design of the car engine is pretty awesome, however, there is only really 1 or 2 variants so far. Gets annoying after a couple of hours- In the Tech Demo, the edge of the map contains a yellow boundary that repairs and resets your car after driving on it, however, if you miss it (fly over it and off the edge into the void) your car just resets, sometimes nowhere near where you flew off the map. I think this is minor but it too gets annoying having to pause and press Repair All (and lose all the destruction around the map) just to be able to continue driving- The Early Access game doesn't really have much in the way of instructions or helpers. You and 23 (max) other AI players in a small demo derby arena, obviously trying to be the last surviving, but the problem is no mini map, no hint of WHO is remaining, apart from the # of players left top right of the screen. Few times I've not been able to get to the 1 person left, because their car is still 'alive' but not drivable, ergo they are stuck in the middle of 22 other cars that I also can't get to. There shouldn't be an option for stalemate in demo derby but that's the outcome i've had many times.			"

Early Access Review
								This is just an initial impressions review. I played it offline for a few hours in addition to the current time so roughly 5-6 hours. I have stayed away from this game for a year due to bad reviews but gave it a gamble because of recent updates and the Steam summer sale.My expectations and evaluations of this game are based on relational experiences from a library of racing sims that include most major releases in the past 5 years.  My system is high-performance and I get well over 60 fps at 3440x1440. No stutters. Smooth. The FFB could use some improvement, but is much better than some other racing games. FFB is nowhere near as good as R3E or Dirt Rally, but probably close to Project Cars and better than GRID Autosport. Cars physically behave similar but better than in DIRT3; however, they lack the detailed fidelity and distinctive handling qualities found in Dirt Rally. Wheel, pedal, and shifter support is well done and you won’t run into problems with individual usb controllers working in conjunction. For example, I use a TM wheel, Fanatec Pedals, and Fanatec Shifter – all work great. Although, I have yet to find a clutch option for use with manual transmission.I am pleasantly surprised at the range of tracks and their function (crash up derby / race). They look stellar and each that I have tried is enjoyable. There are stacks of tires along the tracks that get bombarded by crashes. These tires along with debris from cars wind up on the track as obstacles. Regrettably, these tires and objects have virtually no impact on driving when struck. These objects would be wonderful if upon impact they created driving instability. Yet, they're merely visual veneer. Dirt and mud tracks could use more static ruts and rough areas that create a varied terrain texture and driving challenge. Similarly, these track characteristics need their inherent properties and impact on driving amplified (more sliding, bumping, slip in steering, instabilities). One thing I would like to see in Wreckfest and other sims with varied surfaces (dirt/gravel/mud/snow) is a dynamic track that changes throughout the race. All of the physical contact from vehicles on the surfaces both from wheels and crashes make absolutely no change to the track's physical surface—no new ruts, gashes, bumps, or rocks; tracks simply become predictable and their nuisances are memorized. If the track were pliable like the car, taking damage and having its surface warped, then the dynamically changing tracks would gain depth in challenge while adding an extension in longevity with players.The AI is demanding in races and it’s easy to find yourself at the rear; a wonderful surprise as I would hate for there to be no challenge. At the tail end of my inital 6 hours I was leading often so I would like a feature adjustment for the difficulty range. The aggressive nature of the AI, however, does create a genuine challenge in holding and maintaining a lead. After playing so many racing sims it is a real blast to have crashing into other cars be such a fun and a useful tactic to winning. The crash-up / last-man standing matches have AI problems and it's too easy to win. However, their behavior is very predatory when it comes to stealing the last blow for takedowns during these matches! The physical damage displayed to cars is bar none the best I have seen in any game to date. I gave BeamNG a recent try and for just physically banging up cars, Wreckfest is far more fun. There are cars you can buy and upgrades you can purchase as you win money in game. The upgrade shop for engines, suspension, and other parts is bare-bones and upgrade paths are virtually nonexistent; at least, for the European 3 car I purchased.I believe this game was easily worth $19.99 (summer sale). While you have a huge array of choices in the racing sim arena, Wreckfest builds upon existing themes by adding completely unique gameplay, physics, and strategies. I hope that Bugbear continues to augment the existing game with additional content for the parts shop, as well as FFB improvements, car variety, track enhancements, and car handling disposition. Ideally I would welcome some of the handling elements from Dirt Rally as they would inject an enormous dynamic into the game's varied races and crash courses. The splash screen still says “Pre-Alpha” and due to the duration of this status I can understand the frustration for seasoned owners. However, as a newcomer it provides ample content to enjoy for many hours. While some of the negative reviews are understandable due to development stagnation, the nice range of content and cars will make a great game phenomenal if development continues.			"

								If you enjoy a healthy dose of motor racing with a generous helping of carnage and more than a little flavouring of mayhem this could well be the game for you. Wreckfest is one of the most visceral racing game experiences I've enjoyed in a long time. It bears not a small resemblance to it's preceding series Flatout, which isn't surprising considering it's made by the same development team. That said I can see this shaping up to be the pinacle of their work so far, and it's still Pre-Alpha! It features some of the best destruction available in motor racing games today. Most games that feature ""real"" cars are restricted by contracts with the manufactures as to exactly how much they can be damaged. Wreckfest, by contrast, gives you jaw-drapping impacts and the resulting destruction cripples everyone visually and functionally. Granted the cars are not specific to a real world counterpart, but you wouldn't know that to look at them. They are authentic-looking amalgamations of classic car styles and seem familiar by design if not by make and model. Finally a Destruction Derby style racing game with modern physics and infinite replayability for those of us who love the genre. The game is beautiful, technically challenging, and most importantly, fun. Hilarious laugh-out-loud fun. I can't wait to try the multiplayer with Teamspeak and a large group of friends. Because I can't think of anyone I'd rather crush into little tiny pieces.			"

Money in the game means nothing, car upgrades are reset all the time and half of the menu is disabled.  Not worth $30, wait for a sale or move on.Seems to me like they added multiplayer to get a boost in sales and then abandoned the game...			"

								I have been playing Wreckfest on and off for many years now and can safely say that I like what is there, but for the money, there is just not enough content. Full respect to the developers who have made some great fun work over the years in this game. The sad fact though is that the game really hasn't changed enough within the timeframe to warrant the massive £25 asking price.I find the racing and tractor durbies relaxing and enjoyable, but it feels like the kind of game you pop on and off for 15 mins as appossed to a game you can really get invested in. In time, I am sure the devs will complete this and it will be great, but at it's current state, it's worth like £7 and no more.			"

								Sadly this has extremely slow development.Dont get me wrong it's fun....  but only for upto an hour at a time. This has been an early access for far to long!! so many people have supported this game from its release and still we are yet to see new and interesting features. The only updates apart from a new car or track was just them messing about with the cars handling and messed the way the cars were controlled by a wheel. i was gifted a copy of this game and i'm still annoyed with the very little progress made with it's development. There's so much more can be said about the bad points but i really CBA!!!Purchase by all means but Just be warned!!			"

								If you can remember Demolition Derby, and enjoyed it's (back then) state of the art graphics, and race-o-smash gameplay, you'll love this. For a game in alpha, it's certainly quite impressive. We used to pay around £30 for PS1 games in the old days of fat square tellys. We had those real pounds they used to have, made of real paper money, not those invisible electronic pounds they have now. Kids today, with their fancy eye-pads and interweb don't know the hard times we had back then. We had to tend to our sheeps, make soup from hedgehogs and cowpats, served in wellington boots, then rent the latest betamax tape, or go to the posh kid's house to beg for  a go on his Intellivision and Atari consoles, made of real wood. Not like that electronic wood they have now. We had to dance for a game of Outlaw, or the worst game in the world - E.T. - The Extremely Terrible from Activision. A game made in about 2 weeks by a man now filled with remorse and bitter disappointment at what could have been. It's unknown how many holes E.T. fell down, but ironically the unsold E.T. cartridges wer dumped into a large hole in the New Mexico desert. Watch out for Harrison Ford's return as Indiana Jones in 'Raiders of the Lost Cartridges'. Only fitting, as it was partly Spielberg's fault			"

								Next Car Game is in a very Early Alpha stage, but the game is still incredibly good looking, has amazing physics, and the crashes are spectacular. It its current form, there are 2 derbys, one with 12 cars and one with 24, though i assume more are coming. There are also a few races which are fairly entertaining. However, this game truely shines in derby. The fantasic crashes, and the massive piles of wrecked vehicles make it a fun experience. The game also includes a ""sneak peek"" at how things work. This is my favorite thing about Next Car Game. This Physics park includes a giant spider, explosive barrel towers, large ramps, and even car cannons. There is also an area where giant hammers will completely wreck you until you respawn somewhere else. I believe Next Car Game will turn into something fantastic, however 25 dollars is a tad high for the amount of content currently available, but 25 will look like a lot less when more is added. 8/10			"

								If you have played any of the Flatout games, this is basically like Flatout, but better. This is still an early build, but already impressive. The car damage model is probably the best I've seen in a game. The graphics also look outstanding, though the game requires a powerfull PC to max things out. Car handling is somewhere between realism and arcade though driving aids are avaialble and even with these on, the cars act in a plausible manner. That said, this is not something you would play with a wheel. It's supported alright, but what good is a cockpit view, when yur can hardly see anything with the dust and bent bonnet after the first corner. PLaying on a wheel in 3rd person... Not really that fun.That said, this racing game has huge potential.So should you buy it? If  you are expecting a lot of content and hours of fun out of the box, think again. This is an alpha build, and while a lot of elements are in place, the content is limited to a few cars and tracks, no career mode, just single races / destruction derbys. At this point, buying is sort of an early investment and supporting the devs. I am sure though, that once the game is complete, it will be a gread racer for anyone, who is tired of your typical clean racing sims and street racing games.

								I had a lot of fun in this game back when I bought it. Multiplayer wasn't easy to set up but it was a blast when it worked and the game looked and felt great! Fast forward a year or so and with the updates inbetween the game has gotten slower, uglier and somehow less fun. That great physics update feels like it took the fun driving physics and replaced it with something .. well something that I found frustrating to drive. I tried it with the keyboard like I used to play the game before, I tried it with a controller, but I just couldn't find that fun back that I had before.I don't know where this game is heading but as it is right now, I cannot recommend it.

								This game is not even close to being a viable product at the moment.  The amount they are charging for it is outrageous... it's not even worth the price at %50 off.  They have an almost non existant online community, regardless of what the few people in the forums tell you.  They won't even show you how many are online because it's so low.  The community is toxic and can't take critisism at all.  You say anything negative about this game and you're branded a troll...  It could have been a fun game, but they took it in a direction opposite of what they advertised.  The racing is not even close to real, physics wise and it's player run servers so you can get banned out of a room for nothing.  And with no one else playing leaves you to sit there and twiddle your thumbs.  It's become a warning for anyone wanting to try ""Early Access""...... Early Access, that should have a time limit on it... The game has been early access for years now, it should have at least made it into Beta.... But with Devs that don't communicate with the forums, except for the elite of fanboys, you can't expect to get a very well done game....... Try it if you like, but you'd be better off just setting your money on fire....Update... it's now May 2016... yup, still terrible and the same handful of white knights pushing more players away...

								So after a year of having this game in my library, I can tell that this game has not even had a major update since I bought it. The game has been in early access for over two years now. Do not buy this game it will get boring after an hour of playing it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update:This game did not have a change since the last time I played it. Its been 3 years and its still in early access. Just make yourself a favour by not buying this game.			"

								Even in alpha stage, this game is fun to play and pretty good to look at. I backed the game prior to it coming to Steam and glad to say, very happy with that. Although there's only a couple of tracks and cars each to play right now, it has good ol' ""Flatout"" written all over it. One of those few games which deserve the full amount. I can see myself spending hours in this game in the coming days, months... years!!!			"

								Play this game!  It's awesome and fun!Remember Destrucion Derby that first came out on DOS & the Playstation 1?  It was created by Psygnosis.  God it's been years since I've played that game.  The game stopped with Destruction Derby 2 on the PS1, and I had always wondered when there was going to be a Destruction Derby 3?  My wait is finally over.  Destruction Derby 3 is what ""Next Car Game: Wreckfest"" should be called.  It's like literally picking up from where you left off.  Only it's in early stage and there are no points to gain for spinning an opponent 90 degrees or 180, etc... I'm running with Radeon 6670HD and a couple of the settings on high and the game runs smoothly.  On a good race you can reach speeds of +90mph!  Looks good as well.  The debries from cars, like bumpers n fenders, tires and other broken stuff stay on and litter the track the entire race!  Walls break apart when the cars crash into them!  The damage your car can take is awesome lol.  I love it.  I'd like to see more wheels flopping as they turn and maybe some more sparks while grinding and barrels full of fire to run over.			"

								This is the game for all the wreckers in Nascar 14. All wrecks all the time. Good graphics and hilarious damage modeling. Mutliplayer that works really well. Still Early access so only more goodness can come hopefully.After many more hrs into this game I can still say this is fun as hell. Still waiting on lastest patch but if you follow the Bugbear forums you can see they are making significant progress. Don't listen to anyone saying this game is dead. The devs are posting once a week and seem to be very responsive to community needs. Paid 3X as much for Nascar 14 and having so much more fun with this even in its' unfinished state.			"

								I had actually forgotton all about this game until a friend mentioned it, but for the record, this is just another 'game' that has jumped onto the Early Access train to sodoffsville. It is nothing more than a boring massively overpriced tech demo. I seriously urge everybody to think hard about buying into the EA platform until steam has some standards.Just like many other companies they are talking about a new game (Stuntfest), when the one for sale is nowhere near finished.If you enjoy the feeling of being mugged in broad daylight then by all means buy it. If you are a sane person, simply AVOID.			"

								1st off Yes its a Pre Alpha Game and is not perfect but do not let that fool you on what a Blast it is to play and how hard you can LOL with friends..I have been playing this game over a year and is the Best $25-30 I have spent on a racing game that I have had Including Full finished racing games.  Reminds me of old Demo  derby game back in the day but Way more destruction and fun. There are  servers where we try and play clean games and others where we just smash the crap out of each other so I hope you have a sence of humor or maybe you should go play Rad Racer.I will say that you should have the RECOMMENDED specs to run it if you want the full enjoyment from the game with all the carparts flying everywhere when damaged... even more so If you want to HOST a server And if you want to Host one you better have some Upload for bigger servers.I think too many peeps are using lower end PC's and lower uploads trying to host it seemsYes There are people playing on min specs but I would not myself.We allready have some teams in place for events and we just do FFA rounds. Would recommend anyone that likes racing games to check in to it..See you on the Track...			"

								Only a couple of hours into the game so far, but I'm having a blast!Most fun I've had in a game this year so far.Can´t wait for more tracks and cars.No matter if you mess around with other drivers at the end of the field or if you chase the leader, the pure joy of wrestling in the bulk or in a duel is so fulfilling already in this game. And then there is this moment, when you are chasing first and second at the 8 track and they disappear in an explosion of metalshards, smoke, dust, fire and the third car that took them at full speed. When you pass that intersection, holding your breath while two other cars miss you by only a few centimeters and suddenly you finally win after trying countless times. Priceless epic pure awesomeness and one of the best examples what makes games great.After all, this is truly a GAME.If you ever in your life found a single racing game at least mildly amusing, try this!

								Ive played couple hours on this game,if you like just being a mainiac on the race track and smashing in to other cars in the hope to survive to finish a race theres a good chance you wont,if your not at the front of the grid you will probaly never get a win on a race,so dont bother trying just smash all the other cars around you.Its near damn impossible to stay in one piece and survive quite honestly if you love car games and for once just love smashing the hell out of your oponent until there engine burns before yours.This game is just good fun again and again for any age and does not matter about skill its survival and having a laugh.

								Multiplayer is out, time for rereview.I absolutely love everything about this game except for name, name is even worse than worst name people suggested which leaves me no choice but regard to my new favourite ""racing"" game as ""this game"". This game despite being alpha is the best derby game since FlatOut, morevoer it surpasses FlatOut, even if it did not save soft body damage physics (there is nothing soft about it right now to be honest) it would still be my favourite racing game.It's way more comlpex than FlatOut, it's even more complex than GRID with all those car customization options which are real car parameters and not some 4/5 top speed.Multiplayer is crude but surprisingly lagless even if ping is around 300 ms, this is of course if server is not hosted on some craptop which renders game unplayble. Damn you, craptop owners! Stop hosting!This is pretty much what I expected from FlatOut 2 in 2006 and did not get.			"

								Very Fun Game!  A Must Have!   Feels like a true PC game not some console import!  Get a Wheel!- In fact it's the only racing game I have liked since Publisher ""Sierra"" had NASCAR Racing 2002-2004. - Hardware wise I need lots of power to run games across my 5760 x 1080 span.   WreckFest seems to be doing well for Beta on Triple BenQ 24""Monitors @ 144Hz with SLI GTX 780's!   -  Car setups pretty standard not overly complex (so far)- Camera views inside car and outside are well done- Destruction Physics are most times comical yet it's all vary enjoyable somehow, you can still race with 3 wheels!- Tracks are all great plenty of side stuff to plow into beside the other racers- Multi-player is the real gem here just love, love it!- Hosting is done in Steam no Offical Servers as of yet.  So you'll want to go after the Host they being the LPB aka Low Ping Bast@rd target that guy!			"

								This title has seen very little progress from the time it was released as an early access title. The original tech demo and what followed were promising.As time has passed, we've seen plenty of lengthy periods with no updates from Bugbear. At some point it was decided that the game would turn away from a demolition derby style racing game - and instead, shape it around the finnish racing scene. Not sure what the term 'Wreckfest' has to do with this title anymore.I'm not sure what Bugbear expected here, the overall direction of the game has changed, and they've taken several steps backwards over the past 2 years - as it stands my AMD 8350//390//16GB rig can barely run this ♥♥♥♥ on low settings.Seeing the company bump the price up days before the Winter Steam Sale just adds insult to injury.

								This game is getting better and more fun for me with the latest updates.Only thing not so positive is the career mode only for now, with quick races coming back at a later stage, as per the developer. But this doesn't stop from having fun as it is.The game's handling and damage model keeps getting better and more realistic with the lastest updates, which I think is a good thing. As it is now, it's demolition derby / banger racing with a large dose of realism both in handling and crashes.If you want big explosions and loads of huge crashes, this isn't the game for you. I guess that is left for the Flatout series.This is a more realistic banger racing / demolition derby game and that's what I was missing for a long time, in my gaming collection!			"

								This game is in Alpha so bugs are to be expected and not all the features implemented yet but it's already the best demolition derby/racing game I've played in a very long time.I enjoy the fact that looking after the car is not a high factor and it does not matter if you go off the track or cut a corner etc Controls are good for an arcade based game but i hope they move away from the AWD and AWS feeling when going around corners but this could be because of my long sim history the soft physics are great but still need a bit of tweaking i think a car thats crushed should be classed as wrecked etc The game has good controler compatibility for an alpha but i really hope the developers factor in people who use combo set for example like me i have G27 wheel and shifter but i run Fanatec pedals because of this i can only use my wheel but i have no pedals because i cant assign them i have to assign the throttle and brake to a button on the wheel and it is to time consuming dismantling my rig to change pedals.Overall its hard to judge this game as i feel its still very early alpha and limited content but time will tell and i will revist this to apply my final thoughts and rating.

How will the future of Wreckfest look like?This time I won't write a short positive or negative, because the text below is important if you're interested on this game. Wreckfest is a good and solid game that deserves more attention. Do I regret the buy? No, because I had my money worth of fun.Would I recommend the game at this point? Depends on you. On a Sale, for driving around a bit, this game definitely deserves a buy. If I'd be Bugbear I'd sell it for 20€ because that's the minimum you get out of it's state right now. A few tracks a few cars and it drives and looks good. Nice soundtrack too.It's also fun to drive with friends. If the future of Wreckfest wouldn't be as critical I'd recommend it immediately because the last few patches really showed ""it's worked on!"".What do I mean? Well, Bugbear is starting to develop another game called Stuntfest. Therefore the many bad reviews. Now at first you'd think: ""Meh this will take away time they'd spend on developing Wreckfest."" This is true in a way. I'm not sure if Wreckfest is dead, but according to their website and also the recent updates it's far from dead. I'm not sure if they will use the car models from Stuntfest in Wreckfest. It would be great if they'd do that because it takes a lot of time modelling one. If not than we can at least be happy with what we got with Wreckfest. Yes at first I was disappointed on the fact that it probably won't finish to a game they promised us but we all should make sure to not forget that we bought: an early access title, meaning we bought ""what we have at this point"". And as many software projects fail, a game can fail too. I'm sure Bugbear did not want to drop Wreckfest. As I said above, it's not safe to say that they dropped it. Sometimes working on another game will give them the opportunity to generate money to stay afloat and refresh creativity. You remember that they are also people and that it's their job combined with a high risk of failing. Wreckfest didn't generate that tonne of revenue. They are probably struggling at this point because Wreckfest did not get as much traction, hype wise as estimated. The only logical decision to stay on the market is to create another game. Does it mean we can't trust Bugbear anymore? It's up to you. I say we can still trust them, I think they maybe will show their dedication of creating games in the next one. Conclusion: I'd never support an EA title with deluxe edition again, because that's the only content I didn't get. Also I think Bugbear would do better on selling the games cheaper to get more people to buy it. 20€ and at max 25€ is what many would pay for an early access title and not feel sad when their dropped 40€ are spend on a game that is no further developed.

								This game was very good for about a year or so, but they then completely changed the mechanics of the handling, which for me was a backwards step. What's worse is the fact that it hardly receives any updates, so you are better off looking elsewhere. Such a shame, becuase this game was extremely fun and had tons of potential. Oh well, hopefully someone else will come out with a similar title with a better end product.			"

								Next Car Game: Wreckfest is a racing game, that uses the same recipe as the very old Destruction Derby games.Instead of your standard race-to-win games, here is a racing game that focuses on damage, destruction and a very special sort of fun, that speaks to the inner chaotic being inside of you.There hasn't been a really good destruction derby game in a very long time, but finally one has arrived.The game is so entertaining on such a simple level, it's just good old fashioned fun!My personal favorite race in the game, is the 8-figure map with a lot of other online players, the result is utter chaos!The game itself feels very realistic with it's cars, handling, sounds and so fourth, the amount of damage done to the cars is a little over the top though, but that just adds to the entertainment value.This game's ability to pull focus from winning, and make you enjoy yourself no matter the outcome, is what makes this game so special.It is a really good way to unwind after a stressful day, and is otherwise always an enjoyable experienceI am not normally a fan of racing games as I find them quite repetitive and boring, but I can easily recommend Next Car Game: Wreckfest, even in it's current state of Early Access.

								Solid game considering it's in early access. Great graphics, amazing damage, and several tracks and modes serve the game well. 5 cars with 5 liveries each gives you some variety, personally I'd like to see more of both. I'd also like to see more AI and more than 10 laps. I'm excited to see where this game goes. All in all it's really fun.TL;DR If you like make cars smashy, buy.			"

It is an impressive engine I guess, but I'd still rather play a game with a less impressive physics engine and tons of tracks and cars, and an actual career mode, than a game with kewl car crashes yo but only like ♥♥♥♥ing FIVE TRACKS, SIX CARS AND NO CAREER MODE.""BUT IT'S STILL IN EARLY ACCESS!""♥♥♥♥ you, it's been in early access for ♥♥♥♥ knows how long now, and it seems like it'll stay that way.

								In it's current state, it is incomplete, yes. However, the dev team IS working on it. How do I know? Nextcargame.com. They have forums there that document their updates, written by the devs themselves. Currently, the big issue of the ""lost update"" is the physics, and it is taking quite some time for them to polish it, according to the forums.On the actual game itself, I enjoy it a lot. The derbies take some practice and skill to get good at in order to survive, the current physics look amazing, and the driving itself feels pretty good.			"

								This game is just awful. Nothing about it is fun, it's barely finished, and there's no consistency to anything you do. Think about all of the great racing games out there: Burnout, Need for Speed, even Bugbear's own Flatout. Now remove the speed, handling, and fun. You have NCG. There hasn't been a patch for the game in 2 months - not that it matters, the patches don't do anything anyway. They're charging $30 to play this garbage. They even have the audacity to release a ""Digital Deluxe Edition"" for this unreleased game. This game had so, so much potential, but every day it's seeming more likely that the dev's are just going to jump ship. DO NOT BUY.			"

								Release Date: 15 Jan, 2014 - Two and a half years to accomplish not a lot, which is a shame as the racing could be quite good fun at times; so much potential - but am afraid whatever happened here we all missed it. Instead i would recommend looking at titles such as the ""Flat Out"" series to emulate those Destruction Derby urges. (If Wreckfest ever appears on sale for £5 or that sort of price range then go for it, just do not pay £20 for a game that will perpetually be unfinished.)			"

								This game will most probably cause you to burst out laughing. I mean seriously. The things that happen on the track are just surreal and revolutionary for the driving genre - and I'm not just talking about ramping onto an opponent and acting as if you're car is mating with theirs (although that is completely possible). Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut it's not perfect yet, even for early access.

								 I would not advise buying this game, first of all, the last year or longer there has been very few updates, all these updates added next to nothing unless you count a lawnmower and santa as a good update. keep in mind it took months upon months for this.  The update that was before that one already added a lawnmower, the santa one had a paintjob and a santa. The most recent update which took place many many more months away once again from the last update added 1 SINGLE CAR and thats all I noticed. the handling changes every single update usually for the worse. wheel pedal/ H shifter inputs is hugely delayed.So in over a year maybe its been two I dont remember, very few updates that add nothing and even sometimes remove things from the game with no explanation and then act like there is some huge update but all it is some petty useless nonsense.Bottom line this is a horrible game. Wait till 2030 and you might get a couple new tracks and a car or two. This is no exaggeration			"

								This game is awesome!I liked FlatOut, FlatOut 2 and the last FlatOut i owned was Ultimate Carnage. I stopped playing FlatOut with the time.But this game brings me back in good old memories. What you should think about, before YOU buy it:-Its an early Alpha, so there can be bugs, performance issues and so on-Is it worth for YOU to spend money in a game which have the TOTAL destruction?For me it is. This game is worth every penny i payed. The Multiplayer is a lot of fun, it can be a challenge or it just can be a fun part with friends. Derby in online is just massive.There are bugs, sure, but; its worth to support this game. I wish myself for this game snow maps and weather. Like falling rain and falling snow. Which make races harder. If it is rainy, it will set dirt tracks to mud places. Snow will cause a lot of traction loss. This would be so awesome. "

								I can't express how much I love this game. Graphically, this game is beautiful and the Engine it runs on wants to run it that way too. Never once did I feel that this game even looked sub-par. The Tech-Demo that you get  when you pre-order it is alone worth $25. I could play, just that Tech-Demo, for years. But, ofcourse, you also get the PRE-Alpha. Keep in mind that it's PRE, and it's already better than most finished products i've played. The destruction mechanic blew my mind. It is definetly the best destruction Engine i've ever seen. Just the way the debris mesh together, or get blow sky high, made me feel powerful. For instance, instead of driving around in a car, you can press C twice (In the Tech-Demo) to leave the car and fly around, destroying things as some flying demon. It's THE best Pre-Alpha i've ever played, and it's ONE of the best GAMES i've ever played, and I can't wait to see what the finished version of this maginficent game will look like.			"

								Releasing your game too early to make money while its still developing...

								I don't know why I'm reading so many negative reviews on Wreckfest beacause of its new physics engine. Maybe I am the black sheep but I really enjoy the game with its tendency to simulation. I can agree with reviews saying the game is less spectacular and arcade-feeling, but steering is more accurate (with a gamepad and a Logitech Driving Force GT tested by myself) and races are more exciting in my point of view. I really wish developers will add more track really soon and with more time a career mode and a local split-screen mode (up to 4 players). For the ones who want a funny, good arcade experience, try Flatout Ultimate Carnage! Wreckfest is now going to a sim-looking racing game. Cheers!			"

								while i say i recommend it there are a few issues that need to be worked out, paticularly when joining servers with high ping, i havent found an australian one yet but i havent played too much.positives: great car damage, looks really good ! players seem pretty friendly so far..negatives: high ping really affects races, i was in figure 8 and other racers teleporting lots and i kept ending up under the track, for that reason i wouldn't recommend joining races with high ping. I havent found an Australian server yet but i havent played a great deal yet either, they may be out there. regular derby seemed to work ok though..As it's early days im sure more content will be added but im not sure if its worth the full price in its current state, i got it on special so im not disappointed. 6/10 ?

								This game is alot of fun. Not rediculously complex to the point of 'harder than driving a real car' But also not 'too' arcadey, even though your vehicle will survive more than total realism. Muscle car and 60-70's Euro racing, with demolition derby to boot? Sign me up! Both clean racing, and total bash-fest style totally supported by the game-types, and community.Additionally a 'real-car' parts system,  which hopefully gets expanded upon more. Which seems to be the intention.Please note however, that development is on-going, and a lot slower than a lot of people would like. The upside? The game has already been in a pretty good state for quite a while, and would be worth the price (atleast in my mind) if little more was done with it.IF you have the patience to deal with occasional bugs that sometimes hang around for a bit longer than perhaps hotfix's from a giant company might take, but, with solid eventual support, great existing content, and like a solid community, that however could use a few more members to really fill out the grids at some hours, well its a solid pick-up.Even moreso if you have wheel or controller.

								Wreckfest doesn't know what it's suppose to be. I really enjoyed the Flatout games and this was suppose to be the successor with better graphics, better soft body physics, more modes, etc. I thought this was going to be a destruction derby arcade style game (which their aren't many of). The problem is, the developers lost their way and kept changing the engine over and over. IMO, it's just not fun to play. Honestly, I think they ran out of money, so they started a new game before even getting this one out of early access. I'll change my review if they make it fun again. I was really looking forward to playing a new and improved Flatout. Very dissapointing.			"

								It was a great promise, but the updates to this game are minimal and extremely far in between. I mean, small changes from updates is all fine and dandy if like, say half a car (concept and demo use/no upgrading one update and finished product plus different paint jobs the next) or a half track (Like use during construction one update, and complete or close to it the next update) every month would be pretty damn good compared to almost half a year and... A few blades of grass? HA! Maybe they should make it so you can turn the blades on during the mower derby! Seems like they put more thought into that than the game itself. But nah, that would take forever anyways, I'd rather wait 5 years for a complete game minus mowing instead of 7 years with mowing. Maybe by then I'll have a computer that can handle such a poorly optomized game like this one. (My computer meets recomended, let alone exceeds minimum, and I get horribly lag on controls and like, 4fps with everything on none or minimal unless I have the resolution at the absolute minimum, then I get like, 12.

								At the moment, ""Next Car Game"" or ""Wreckfest"" is an insanley fun racer, although a bit lacking in content. As a package right now, it would be hard to recommend the price; however, the game will still undergo lots of updates before fully released so by the time it's finished I have no doubts it will be great.So far you get -a tech demo physics playground-5 cars with customizable parts-5 (i think) tracks (with a couple variants)-races vs. AI-multiplayerthe races against the AI can get boring fairly quick, as there is no campaign or ultimate objective for doing them, but the multiplayer races are a ton of fun.

								Of course it currently lacks content. As for a Pre-alpha state though, the game is perfectly playable and gives LOTS of fun. If you are not sure how good it can become, pick FlatOut or FlatOut 2 (avoid FO3 like fire, Bugbear had nothing to do with this title).  I'm sure Next Car Game will be even better.Besides, I may be the only one who actually likes this 'working title'.

								Great potential but I doubt its ever going to arrive.Update -A few updates have come out so I gave it another go.Seriously, this game is worse than watching paint dry. It truly is nothing like the flatout series. I don't expect I'll ever load it up again unless the next update is along the lines of ""Started development from scratch"".			"

								Firstly my impressions for this game were good!, so i bought it, big mistake!. don't buy this game in its current state its poor lack of communication with the developer and lack of updates is so BAD. no communication or anything over a twitter for almost 2 months +. bugbear are really doing bad with this game. Every update includes very small patches with things like uncomplete maps. Take the newest update for an example. after 2 months of nothing at all over twitter or any form of updates the bugbear team gave us another unfinished map with a repair system. i mean really bugbear? that is awful!. beamng drive is way harder to do and they released 3 to 4 updates with HUGE update logs within the time of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update. very sad and wish a refund but am unable to.PLEASE think before buying this			"

								Ah, Wreckfest.  Where do I start.I bought you back where you were just called ""Next Car Game"" - after I saw a NODE video with it.  I was instantly in love, albiet broke.  Bought it the next month when I had money for luxuries.  So happy I did.Don't get me wrong, I don't have near the hours that RaceClimb does, but it LOVE this game.  The most recent December update brought a bunch of life back into the cars.  THEY FEEL like the weighty beasts that they are.  Throw them into the corner - Driftfest is born!But seriously, if you enjoy sim / arcade racers, and think soft bodies are fun- grab it.  It's a blast to get into a race and see / feel the damage that you dish and take, respectivly.  Getting spun out or slamming into a car and losing a position or two has never felt more satisfying.See you on the track!			"

								If you want to play a modern W.I.P full contact racing game, that is a hybrid of rally cross,banger racing and destruction derby events look no further. Ive had hours of fun even with the limited classic cars and few event available mainly due to the style of racing and ever changing racing line (espiecially online on the short tracks).There are bugs here and there and a general lack of 'finished product content' but with each updates there are improvements and a bit more to play with.

								This has been in early access pre alpha for what feels like for ever. Sadly this doesn't mean there's been any real progress made. If anything the game seems to be going backwards and somehow is less of a game now than when I got it last year.

								Wreckfest has  been a game that is SO full of potential.  Its early-stage and there are some issues but you can see the framework for a fantastic title when finished.Pros:  + Great physics+ Fantastic damage (key to any destruction derby-style racing)+ Intelligent AI+ Continued customization (still work in progress but constantly proceedingCons:- Multiplayer is really rough (yes, its early but its not nearly as intuitive as we would like and  its challenging  to connect to race with friends/etc.)- Still glitchy game play (This is a WORK in progress so this  is me being nit-picky)- Conflicted  between arcade-style game versus simulationComments:This is a game that is in such an early-stage so take my comments with a grain of salt.  The updates are coming at least once a quarter and they are typically large in scope and there is great communication from the developer.  I expect it to change substantially but am a little nervous regarding what style of game it will end up being... arcade vs simulation or if it finds a way to be a balance between the two.Score as of 3.6.2016:   8/10Its fun... 'nuff said.			"

								the idea of the game is cool if you like things like dirt track racing in the old days which in my opinion was really fun. the only gripe I have is development time. however as previously pointed out, the game has been updated here and there and has been making general progress. price is a bit steap for the stage it was in when I purchased it, but if the game goes to 60 dollars it could be considered an early investment. in all I would wait untill it is completed to purchase it. keep in mind this note that I copy/pasted:""Note: This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development.""early access is a bad idea in my opinion and i'm only glad that the game has made some progress from my origional purchase.i'm only putting ""not recommended"" because theres not really a nuetral choice and I can't say I honestly would recommend it quite yet.

								PRE-ALPHA REVIEWAs a huge fan of FlatOut 2 I'm expecting a lot from this game. FO2 is the place where you can have pure unspoiled FUN, especially in multiplayer. Here you can have whole lotta good time even in pre-alpha version! If the game's this good in it's current state it has an enormous potential to be the finest racing game on the market on release. Controls are a bit loose and crashes occur but it doesn't take away from the experience. New vehicle destruction system is unbelieveable. You can see every scratch on the car. However you can loose your wheel or even half of your car very easily, and then it becomes nearly uncontrollable.			"

If they ever do (and I am very doubtful) it will be no longer a cutting egde game and would not have the impact it could have if they finished this now!!If you have played it imagine it with a flurry of cars all tracks done and huge bank of mods and parts???If not then you dont know what this game could of been and why it is such a shame.

								This is one of my favorite games despite it's long early access development. Development has been slow, and at times players have been unhappy with some of the changes, but the game has still managed to provide hundreds of hours of online multiplayer fun in the two years I've owned it and continues to do so. The only downside that comes with this game, aside from the typical early access stuff you'd expect, is it can be tough to find people playing at all times but there's definitely a decent amount of dedicated players so weekends and weeknights there's usually a few servers going. I don't play this offline so my 300+ hours have all been online. For you wheel users, this game feels great. This was one of the first games I bought for my g27 and the FFB feels better than a lot of other games I've tried. It's not as detailed as something like Assetto Corsa but it does feel really good and it does a great job of conveying what's happening with your car, which is all you can really ask for out of FFB beyond it feeling good. Reviews are mixed, which is why I decided to finally write a review for this game despite it still being in early access, because it really doesn't deserve it's bad rating. There are a lot of people like me who have gotten hundreds of hours of fun out of this game.			"

On The Shoulders of Giants You remember the old ""Flatout"" games with their high octane, win at any cost, smash, bash, trash 'em up style of racing? They were fun right? ""Flatout 3 wasn't!"" I here you cry, and yes, it was a disappointment, but I'm talking about the first two incarnations of the Flatout series.Best we forget about Flatout 3 which was a continuation of the franchise in name only, different developers, different values, etc. Time Marches On It's been 6 years now since the release of ultimate carnage (Flatout 2.5) and the world has moved on, but the demolition racing experience hasn't really kept pace. That is about to change. Putting the bang back into racing Next Car Game is an early access title developed by Bugbear which strives to recapture the thrill of the no holds barred, full contact experience of the past and drag it crunching and squealing into a new decade. With the promise of shiny new visuals, realistic physics, upgradable / customisable cars, a career mode and online play, NCG is saying all the right things, but what do you get if you take the plunge right now? Crunch Time Currently in pre-alpha, the content is, as you would expect, a little on the light side. When you load up the current build you will be presented with a choice of four cars, four race tracks and 3 Demolition Derby environments. It's also worth mentioning that each of the current tracks can be played in reverse to help keep things fresh. Whilst upgradable car parts, career mode and true online play are yet to be implemented you can still play with your friends locally over a LAN. There are also several skins available for each vehicle (red cars go faster right?) so you can scratch up the paint job of your choice when you take the car out for a spin! You Spin Me Right Round Baby, Right Round So you've picked your car, chosen your track and now you're sitting in your old patched up jalopy admiring the rust showing through your go faster stripes. The countdown hits zero, you hit the gas and away you go! The first thing you'll notice is how good everything already looks, as you're noticing this you'll inevitably be experiencing your first crash which gives you the opportunity to admire how good the damage looks too.Tearing around the track, you start to encounter an increasing number of debris strewn across your path, be it parts torn from your competition or unfortunate pieces of the scenery which failed to survive their encounter with whatever chunk of high speed rust and metal had smashed into them. Twisted MetalBy lap 2 or 3 the track will be littered with an impressive amount of twisted metal and if your driving skills are anything like mine, you'll now be racing a smoking, unrecognisably crushed shell of car desperately trying to gain one more place by taking out the equally damaged vehicle in front.This is a huge amount of fun, and whilst the handling still needs as much fine tuning as my own racing abilities, the experience itself is a blast. You can also try your hand at the pure carnage of a destruction derby. All pretence at racing is gone in this mode, just obliterate your opponents and be the last car standing. This option is great for blowing off steam, but for me, it's the track racing that's the jewel in NCG's crown. Baby StepsAt the moment playing NCG is like watching a child take its first steps, it might be a little wobbly, sometimes it falls down, but it still fills you with a sense of awe, there's so much potential here.Sure, where it's at now is fun, there's plenty of entertainment to be found, but you know it's going to grow into something so much more. Support the games development now or wait until release, it's up to you, but this is definitely a title to keep an eye on.

Early Access Review
								TL:DR - 8.5/10, the game has come a very long way, its a solid arcadey simulation with a lot of fun to be had on multiplayer, worth it for anyone to check out, especially when its on sale.Update: The updates keep coming in and slowly but surely the game is starting to shape up nicely, if it goes on sale definitely pick this game up. Do you remember Destruction Derby for the Playstation One? I do, and I freaking loved it. Sadly that game would be absolutely unbearable nowadays. Thats where Wreckfest comes in.The great thing about Wreckfest is that it isnt just Derby. There are circuit tracks on tarmac, and gravel. You have a small variety of cars to choose from and with recent updates there is a progression system so you can finally start from the bottom and work your way up.Now, Wreckfest wasn't always as good, and wasn't always recieving updates as frequently as it is now. The good folks developing this gem have spent some time ironing out their version of car physics so that racing can be exciting and enjoyable for all car classes. The damage modeling they have done is great and its extremely satisfying to see your car get wrecked up during semi-clean contact racing. This game has come a long way and the developers truly appear committed to completing this game and having it stand on its own in a sea of racing sims. A racing sim you will not find here. This is an arcade style simulation with the flavour of real physics behind it. You can enjoy it with wheel, a controller, or even a keyboard and you will not feel at a disadvantage which to me is extremely important. Although with a wheel you could probably have a great deal of fun drifting through corners in their new Asian Drifter style car(kind of looks like an old skyline).The absolutely best part of this game though has got to be its Multiplayer. This game is like the DayZ of racing games when you are online, its just awesome. Most of the players that stick with this game prefer a Semi-Clean racing style, so you will enjoy the bump and grind of a derby, but against the backdrop of a circuit race. Its incredible how much fun you can have when you get a server full of people to race so clean no one is intentionally hitting, but everyone is trying to get in front and you have cars going 3 wide through corners without wrecking, but instead shoving and pushing each other out of the way as they jostle for that lead position....And then. You might join a server with no rules at all, and you'll be wiping the tears from your eyes because for the first time ever you're in first place, and then crunch! Both your front wheels are gone, your engine is bent in half and there is a smoldering wreck of a car from a player going backwards on the track, probably giggling and laughing hysterically in front of their screens as they watch 4 or 5 more cars plow into you, turning your car into a smoldering wreck aswell.To each their own to be sure, but man the multiplayer can be wicked fun. I hope they make it so you can play the entire game progression wise on multiplayer. Right now you simply get all the cars for free but dont earn anything, and if you choose to race with a car you do own, you don't really earn enough for it to be worth while.Anyways, thanks for reading, this game is an easy 8/10 as it is, because it really is that fun. It will climb to a solid 9/10 by the time all the content is in and they leave early access.			"

Early Access Review
								Wreckfest has the potential to become one of the greatest racing games ever in my opinion. The game is made by the same guys that made the Flatout series (excluding Flatout 3) and it's more or less a spiritual successor of these games, so if you liked Flatout, chances are that you'll love Wreckfest.-Performance-The game looks really good on high graphics settings and runs smoothly most of the time (the only FPS drop I've had was when a car with a smoking engine drove right in front of the camera at some point). I've only had it crash once in the 7.5 hours I've played and it was just while trying to start a single player race.-Driving-The driving fits in somewhere in the middle between arcade and sim racing, maybe leaning a bit more towards sim. I've been using a 360 controller when I've been playing and it's been working really well for me. I've found that I often have to correct the steering a little while turning, something I would imagine is a lot harder to do successfully with a keyboard (although I haven't tried), so a controller of some kind is probably recommended.-Crashing-As the name suggests, one of the main elements in this game is crashing. I think all of the bodywork of the car can be destroyed and it probably will after you've rolled over five times after getting t-boned by a competitor that didn't bother trying to avoid your car while you were recovering from that spin. The visual destruction looks good, though maybe a bit over the top. You start wondering how you can still drive when your car is suddenly a metre shorter than it was when you started the race. Your car can take quite a lot of punishment before breaking down. In some cases you can actually keep racing (albeit not very well) even if you're missing a wheel.Some of the tracks also features some small, steep hills along the tracks, which works really well as ramps. It's always amusing to watch the AI drivers in front of you fail to take the turn properly and launch themselves into the air before suffering the consequences of a not very clean landing. Until you arrive at the same corner and understeers terribly or receives a shunt from the guy behind you and suffer the same fate.Cars that breaks down stays on the race track until the race is over, adding extra obstacles to the track. In longer races you'll often see piles of cars in some places.-Cars-Right now there's only five cars to choose from. Each of them comes with five liveries and some performance customisation. Hopefully there will be a lot more to choose from when the game is finished. On the bright side, the current cars feels quite different to each other, at least the ones I've tried do. The American muscle cars (there's two of them) are fast and heavy, but seems to be struggling a bit in sharp turns, while the little European coupe is both fast and handles really well, it gets pushed around easily.-Tracks-There's currently nine different tracks, something I also hope will be expanded in the future. Out of these three of them are demolition derby arenas, which I'm personally not really a fan of. The six others are more or less proper race circuits. There's three basic tracks in different environments with different surfaces, one tarmac, one gravel and one sandpit (my personal favourite. All of these three also come with a reverse layout, which actually feels quite different from the normal version. There's also an oval track, which has an alternate figure-8 version and a pure figure-8 track. The last one is a work-in-progress sandpit circuit that comes in two slightly different layouts (plus their reverse layout). These works perfectly well, if you don't mind the missing ground textures off the track.-Singleplayer-The only game mode at the moment is single races. All of the tracks works with up to 23 AIs with an upper limit of ten laps. The AI isn't very fast over one lap, so if you take an early lead you can expect a rather uneventful race, unless you do any major mistakes. However, if you get bogged down at the start and find yourself in the middle of the pack, you're in for a challenge. The AI likes to get in your way, so while you're fighting your way through the field, the leader will often be next to impossible to catch.Single races against the AI is only fun for so long, so some sort of career mode would probably dot he game good.-Multiplayer-I haven't played multiplayer a lot yet, but I've certainly enjoyed it. A multiplayer game has to be hosted by the players, ideally by someone who has a good internet connection (8 Mbps upload is recommended according to the Create Game window in game). Multiplayer supports up to 24 players and I have to say, the more the merrier. Having 24 cars on the oval track (which appears to be the most popular online by far) is guaranteed to be a mess. There seems to usually be at least one or two who just tries their best to crash into people to ruin their race, but they're nowhere near as annoying as they were on GRID, mostly because the cars in Wreckfest are a lot more durable. I've had some good racing online, including a battle with another guy that lasted for nearly three laps and at some point I also got two takedowns in a race, despite trying my best to avoid any collissions.-Conclusion-The game itself is great and I recommend trying it out if you like games like Flatout or the demolition derby races in GRID. Just keep in mind that the game isn't finished yet and because of that it feels a little light on content.			"

Early Access Review
								I am going to start with as of last update. They assured everyone that the game will be finished, maybe not at the predetermined date but we waited this long I am okay with it as long as it keeps getting better over time. TLDR, its fun, and a splash between simulation and arcade, but it clashes in certain places. Content is a little thin right now but the game is moving forward slowly but steadily. A very solid 3.5/5 as it sits in its demo state. Tech demo bonus is a blast.Now lets start with Pros. The game looks good. Cars have a nice destruction to them, the tracks are more realistic right now and they feel like real courses. (though the few mod tracks I have played with jumps and more arcade style play is more my personal speed) The interface of the games menus are set up like a Warthunder style, pick crew, check parts, chose paint and stuff like that all confined to neatly set drop downs. There is multiplayer, and it works pretty well for what I have played and it feels a lot better to drive with a bit more unpredicatbility since the AI just stick to the middle of the tracks and take turns very safely. The sound effects so far are good. Cars are loud and crashes have appropriate noises and smashes to acompany the shatter of lights, windows, and the car in general. The music as of right now is... forgettable? Its serves its purpose but it isn't anything that is gonna change your life. Now some cons. It still feels like a demo. Which at the time it is. Tracks are pretty, but certain assets are not set in stone and unfinished still. The cars all look very nice but there is only a handful to chose from (and one lawnmower, which is funny and welcome) There isn't a single player really, and there isn't anything to progress too right now. So you just race for the sake of racing which can do it for some people, but the controls are a mix between a simulation and an arcade and it feels off sometimes. And I can't imagine most people who like simulations taking it seriously as it is, and I can't see arcade style races enjoying the bit of simulation that you feel saps a lot of the wacky stuff you could otherwise do. But if you like both it serves it purpose as an inbetween. And for a game about cars, especially lately, I feel it a bit odd to have so few customisation options. To finish with some personal thoughts. I absolutely adored the flatout games. They changed my whole way of thinking when it came to racing games. As a kid I hadn't played anything like it. Where there wasn't wacky missle powers but you could still destroy another racers car. It was so rewarding to take a turn just right, ruining the storefront you drifted through to get your turbo meter up, and then hit the boost at just the right time to scream around the corner. The ability to play so aggresively and be rewarded, or play it safe and cool and be just as well off. The maps were tight, interesting, and fun to play again and again. The main single player wasn't much of a story but the feeling of progression came from upgrading and getting newer faster cars. Going throught the multiple teirs and different styles of racing. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I feel like this game is... trying very hard to appeal to both the simulation drivers like gran turismo and forza, while trying to keep its more arcady and fun feel and it clashes more than blends. They have a wonderful destruction engine and it seems to be used hardly at all in most races because the tracks are very realistic, with only the figure 8 right now feeling like the ""for fun"" map. I could just be hung up with it since i love it so much, but flatout seemed to really hit all the right spots of welcoming new people with controls that were forgiving enough to let them play correctly and eventually you could really press the controls and your skills to the limit, all while staying above a 50mph speed on sharp turns because you could always pocket a bit of boost. I would love to see this game lean a bit more toward jumps, and obstacles, and things that really show off what attracted me in the first place which was the wonderful sight of car being crunched by stuff in the tech demo. But the way it is crashing is so punishing because there is no way to reaccelerate, and one medium crash could set you out of first place instantly which seems to go so hard against all the work they put into the flying car parts and paint rubbing. But that doesn't mean completely lose the realism, I do like what is here. The tracks feel real, which is a neat experience in its own right. And i would love to see both some sick ♥♥♥ jumps in some maps and some tight turns and competetive driving in others. I would like to see the turbo boost come into this game. Just something that makes this game stand out from many other racing games where crashing is the end of a race. When you have car programmed to lose bumpers, don't punish people for seing that lovely piece of programming. Bugbear keep up the good work. Value good content over consistent releases.  I am excited to see where this game goes.			"

								Endless fun if you enjoy online multiplayer race/smash games, very indepth driving model that's easy to learn but hard to master. Can't say enough good things about ths game, very addictive and a lot of fun.Needs a lot more work before it's released, but what's in there at the moment is very playable and great fun.Edit: Single player is still incomplete, and multiplayer is now quite slow, so i'd only really recommend this on sale, or if the multiplayer picks back up again. I love the hell out of the game, but there aren't enough people playing at the moment.			"

								I've played Next Car Game for about two hours in total and It's just not very good in it's current state.  I like racing games, and I love destruction and physics, but as a total package this game is severely lacking. The fun factor is limited.  The tracks are boring.  The driving itself isn't very good. The crashing is excellent, but overall it leaves you unsatisfied. After owning this game since it launched on early access there have been VERY little improvements.  Just another game thrown up on early access for quick cash, while there's probably one developer who tinkers with it on the weekends when he's got nothing else to do. I would pass as there's really nothing here.  If it was say $1, then fine, but I paid $25 for this title and even when it is done, it will never be worth the price paid, as I'll never get $25 worth of fun out of it.			"

Early Access Review
A game to keep your eye on.Read on, or skip to the end for the thumbs down reason. I'll add a TL:DR down there. This review will most likely change to a thumbs up in the future.At this time, I cannot recommend this game. Pretty much just for one very obvious reason. At only half hour played, it isn't a fair time period to propely demo the game, but time isn't a factor for the reason I can't endorse this right now. Read on, or skip to the end. 
+ Graphics: Very pretty. The entire visual portion of this game is great. The cars, the effects, the debris flying off, the lighting... pretyy much all of it. Excellent job.+/- Sounds: For the most part the sounds are well done. The engines sound good, the collisions have goot impacts... On the down side, the engine sounds get monotonous. The constat revving, and the poor localization of sound makes it sound like someone is constantly right behind you.+ Gameplay Options: With the standard demolition derby and destruction races, there really isn't much else to want for. It's a great modern adaptaion of the Destruction Derby games for PSOne+/- Physics: Almost entirely positive here. It a game based upon the physics of objects colliding. It does this very well on almost every area. There was only one thing that struck me as out of place while I was playing >  I saw an AI car get some unrealistic height out of a jump(sand pile), and then proceed to change direction in the air. It was a small thing I guess, and I'm not holding it against the game.- Controls: This is the reason I can't sign off on this game right now. Only control option at the moment(incomplete game, this will most certianly be addressed) is keyboard. Meaning DIGITAL controls. It's a racing/driving game which requires an amount of finesse that can be frustrating with only digital controls as an option. Not everyone has access to a steering wheel set up for their PC, but everyone has some other analog devices at their disposal. Most people have a controler with thumbsticks for analog input and triggers for analog throttle. EVERYONE has a mouse, or some form of trackpad input. Euro Trucker 2 has made this work as an option for people who don't have a wheel.TL:DR - Keep your eye on this one. It's a good game, and fun in it's current state. The deciding reason for a thumbs down are the controls. I'm certain this will change, and my review will aslo change at that time. I'm stopping at under 2 hours of play time in the hope that it goes on a better sale before the event end. Either way, I may just return it and wait for more changes to take place. It is an 'early access', and it's nice that we finally have a risk free way of trying things. I DO like this game and will most likely just hold onto it until it becomes more complete.P.S. Seriously Valve, WTF?! This binary yay/nay, good/bad, black/white, review system has to go. Give some sort of rating system to more accurately reflect someone opinion of the game. This shouldn't be a thumbs down. It should be a 6/10, or something.			"

								What's here is a good foundation upon which to build a spirtual successor to Flatout... but that's all it is. £22 for a foundation, a demo, with updates getting more and more infrequent. Until Bugbear pulls their finger out and makes significant strides AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE, and buy Flatout if you haven't got it, you'll have much more fun with that (for now; this game still has great potential but it looks more and more like that promise will be unfulfilled).

								The game is pretty good. The graphics are nice and it runs quite well. The bad part about this game is fun. I can't seem to have fun in this game. Races against ai are far too easy, so no fun there. The online part is no fun for me either. I have had some pretty intense races against players where we were really close the entire race, all to have it ruined by some guy who can't drive and thinks it would be fun to drive the track backwards to take people out.For me the only way this game would be fun is at a lanparty with a large group of friends.

								I haven't been this depressed at the experience of watching all the fun and joy get sucked out of something that seemed so full of life and early promise since I last reflected on my own existence.The early, pre-Steam and early-Steam beta versions were a hectic mess of wrecking fun, but at some point someone inexplicably decided to take everything too seriously. As a result now we're presented with nothing more than a soulless, empty shell of a game which has completely forgot that it once knew what pure, unadulterated fun was, and which is certainly no fun now. There are plenty of serious racing games out there; something called Wreckfest was clearly never destined to join that group.That next-gen update to Flatout, Destruction Derby or Test Drive: Eve of Destruction that we all want is going to require some more waiting for, because it's not here. It seemed like it was heading that way at some point, but that is not this game anymore.I'm so sad at what this game has become that I can't even bring myself to use a ""took a wrong turn at some point"" pun.

								I love this game. The damage is unparralled by any other racing game Ive played thus far. Drive with four wheels, 3 wheels and yes, 2 wheels. Demolition is great with deathmatch modes for respawning carnage and more. The racing is good as well with ovals, figure 8's , as well as on and off road circuit courses. There is no way to not laugh while playing. Especially now that there is full 24 player online action. The carnage is epic. For now we have to  rely on the lobby chat and sometimes teamspeak to commuicate but we are hoping for in game voip for the ultimate experience as well as more host capabilities to change options without having to exit the lobby.  Its not perfect but its worth it. I always find myself wanting to come back for more car-carnage. The game just keeps getting better as it continues to develop.			"

								For all the people wanting a casual wrecking game with great physics and good mod support. Sure, development takes it's time, but as time passes the game becomes better with each update.I look forward to see where it all will end up, and I'm allready in love with the mod support. If you have 3ds max or blender there are tools too easily get your cars and tracks into the game (if you know what you are doing).So ultimately, this game is like Garrys Mod - a lot of possibilites based upon a great base fundation. Oh, and if you want to get nostalgic, check out my Destruction Derby mod dedicated to the old legend itself ;)			"

								Please note this is an early access game:I first saw 'Flatout' way way back as part of tech demo for the geforce 6 series.  I fell in love with it.  Ordered it from overseas before it was retailed here in the states.12 years later now, I still love so much about the series.  And NCG:Wreckfest was an obvious winner with its tremendous physics and collision engines.  It promised to be a monster of a fun game.  Yet 17 months after it was dropped here, its still barely a functioning game.  It works, but it feels like its been abandoned by Bugbear.  This is precisly what devolepers should NOT do when releasing a game into an Early Access enviroment.  Some of us here understand that we are paying to beta test a game for a discount on the final product.  But if we are being beta testers, it  has to have a lot of dialog and feedback from the dev team.  Not relasing a single update in 7 months is going to be a death sentence.  Will it be good if/when its done?  Hell yes, and I will probebly recommend you buy it.  But right now?  Nope.  Wait untill its done.7/27/15 Update!And now it wont run with my car on the ground!  As long as Im in the air, I get moderate frame rate.  If my car is on the ground... mabey 3 fps.  And its... twitchy.  So no, still not a buy.2/11/17: Another update!  So after a monsterous upgrade (i7 and 1080 and win 10) it runs.  And its pretty and it drives pretty good, but its still boring and feels REALLY unfinished.  Bugbear.

								Short version: If you have ever enjoyed a game in which you smash cars up, you /will/ enjoy this.Pros:- The handling is somewhere between an arcade game and a sim, but definitely leaning toward the realistic - I personally consider this to be good because it just makes it that much more satisfying to catch a slide and drift around a corner or whatever, but there are optional driving aids with three settings each (off, half and full),- It supports controllers and wheels, the force feedback is good (tested on a G27),- It supports triple monitor or other super wide aspect ratios as it should, i.e. adds to the sides, rather than cropping top and bottom,- Graphics are spectacular, especially when you consider how much is going on; up to 24 fully destructible cars on track, dust, fire, smoke, probably thousands of physics objects like tyres and debris...- Audio is great too.Cons:- I have to stop playing to eat, drink, work and sleep,- Not sure if it supports TrackIR yet, not a big deal though,- Doesn't support H-shifters or clutch pedals yet, also not a big deal,- No multiplayer but this is surely just a matter of time,- End of list.I seriously cannot wait to see where they take this, and even as it stands I reckon it's worth £20.

								Wow! Did I just say Wow! This game is so different and better than other car games before it . I don't count myself as a racing game enthusiast yet I was so impressed my jaw dropped. The physics sytem and damage systems are just so awesome that it blows my mind. I bought it on sale for 15.00 . If you can swing full price just get it.			"

								Already, this game is so much FUN. More than just a racing game, this is all about wanton vehicular destruction. If you loved the Flatout games, or fondly remember the car crushing mayhem in the Destruction Derby games, then this is for you. The game in its current (Feb 2014) early-alpha incarnation includes two awesome vehicles, races on gravel or dirt, a ridiculously fun demolition derby mode and access to the car-wrecking playground '2.0 technology demo' (see video below), and there's lots more promised for future updates.

Early Access Review
								Nov 2014: Good Game all round at the moment, stilll a lot lacking from it but what do you expect from Pre-Alpha? For me there are 2 racing games that are absolutely without rival, Gran Turismo3:A-spec and Flatout2, they are great because they give you a great race, a fear of crashes, huge enjoyment from hitting other cars and the damage done (to the car or just their position), and just a bag full of fun.Wreckfest is a lot of fun and has the potential to give everything you could want from a racing game so could be one of the great racing games once it has been finished.Aug 2016:Still a good game, it is still in alpha but has impoved a lot in terms of everything really. Thus-far Wreckfest has not had me addicted to it in the way I had hoped it would (as Flatout 2 did) but the game has kept me coming back to it, although sporadically. The addition of new tracks/vehicles as well as the announcing of a new HUD and Career mode etc has definately kept me watching the updates and jumping back on. The newer damage mechanic is much better than it was in my opinion, making the superbowl derbys amazing fun and carnage. Conclussion: Still a great game, heaps of fun, it is still being worked on in a big way so there are updates still coming.  I DO still recommend this game but I would grab it on sale and grab it at the same time as a few friends. The reviews that slate this game DO have ground to stand on, it can be frustrating and irritating, the actual races send me over the top, but the stadium derbys are amazing. hopefully the developers will sort it out though as the updates seem to have CRAZY gaps between them.... Pull your finger out BugBear. I would still recommend Wreckfest as the spiritual successor to Flatout 2 and that alone endears Wreckfest to me at a level only reached by these 2 games and Gran Turismo.			"

								This is even better than Flatout. These guys at Bugbear really know what they're doing.I'm 9.5 hours in, playing with an Xbox360 controller, and let me tell you: I haven't had this fun with a racer since Colin McRae 04!And it's still in alpha. For me it was totally worth the purchase in its current state. So much so that I decided to put down cash on a racing wheel, for the first time ever, just to play this game.There are no stupid achievements to get, no street-cred ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and no ♥♥♥♥ing dlcs yet. Next Car Game is pure racing as it should've always been. Just choose a car, select the engine, drivetrain, transmission, suspension and color; pick a track, and race. That's all a racing game really needs when IT IS GOOD enough to stand on it's own.Bonus: When you boot up the game, don't expect to wait for 1 unskippable minute while 12 different ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ logos show up before you can actually play what you actually paid for. It's just bugbear's logo, and it's quick.Let's hope Bugbear keeps it like that. They have a real winner in their hands.I'm playing with a GeForce GTX550TI on a 1080p screen. Everything on low, except for anisotropic filtering and texture quality, which are on max. 60fps bliss.			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly, let me say that I clearly understand why many people have a mixed opinion on this game at late. Yes, this game has been in development since 2013; since I started university. Yes, it is taking way too long to finish and people are losing patients with the long wait to a highly anticipated game, especially since the flatout license has been passed on to a developer that had dragged the Flatout name through the mud. In fact, I'm getting frustrated over the long wait for this game. Because from what there is at the moment, this game is fantastically fun and has huge potential, with a mix of Flatout & Destruction Derby. The visuals are beautiful and gorgeous to look at with huge amounts of detail, from paint scratches and shattering glass to the environment of the tracks and even the garage you are placed in at the start. The sound effects are blissful and wonders to the ears without being overpowering; everything from the crunching of cars into each other and other world objects are addictive to hear. The racing is fun with the mixture of destructable scenary from the Flatout games and rally style racing. Alongside everything else, the modding community is awesome to see, providing everything from racetracks from Destruction Derby 1 and 2, extra cars and other features!If I were to add any flaws to this game, there is honestly only two; the framerate when the screen is cluttered with many cars and effects going on in one place. And finally, and the most obvious among the many negative opinions among gamers; the game is taking to long to finish off fully and the updates to the game are usually far between each other.Other than that, the game is fantastic and has huge potential, and in fact it is one of my favourite recently made games! To everyone else, I completely understand you frustration over this game's overly long production cycle. But bear in mind that Bugbear is a small indie game producer now compared to its days when it produced the Flatout games. But hopefully, now that they have a permenant backer, the game could be close to completion. And with the amount of work they put into this game and the potential this game has, I'm looking forward to the final outcome! :)			"

								This game is Early Access. Not a finished product.This game is Pre-Alpha. Not beta. Not alpha. Pre-Alpha.What that means is that some updates will be a step forward in some areas and a step back in others.That means that this game is very sparse on content and polish.That means that, for now, updates are going to be infrequent because they're mostly working on the game engine and physics engine and things like that. Frequent updates at this point would just mean buggy, glitchy updates. Once Pre-Alpha is over and the game moves into Alpha, then content updates (new cars, tracks, etc) will become more frequent.This is Bugbear, who brought us some of my favorite racing games of all time. The game is already very fun with an already very functional multiplayer. It's still miles off of resembling its finished state, but I have faith that, in a year or so, this game is going to be spectacular, if given the proper time and funding. Which is why I purchased this game so early in development.The only reason to purchase this right now is to support the development of this game. Buying this game and then criticizing it or refunding it for being incomplete is completely against the idea of Early Access and just hurts this game's chances of ever becoming something amazing.

For example (just a free tip for Bugbear) devide the online carreer-mode to three classes, beginner (newbies and snale cars) novice (harder better faster) and expert (madmaxed upgraded nightriders).Till then, I will be playing with my dinky toys in the livingroom.

								This games looks like it is going into the right direction. However, the car controls, the multiplayer netcode and synchronousity, the lack of most planned features, low amount of race tracks and cars, lack of good single player (career mode / improved AI) make me not recommend it YET. I recommend to wait for way more patches before buying it. So far it is only really good fun for 1-2 hours, unless you are really in love with damage models and crash derbies. In multiplayer there are too many issues at the moment to make it really enjoyable (lag spikes, bad net code, sync, people driving in the opposite direction to troll, ...)What bothers me regarding the Early Access part is that the updates seem to be coming really slowly and rarely and that the developers do not communicate well enough about what they are doing despite this. The info comes sparsely (less than once per month) blog entries. From a community-funded game I would expect weekly updates on what they are doing, otherwise we have to assume they might be just taking extra holidays on our costs all the time, when there is no new information for months.So far: DO NOT BUYEDIT #1: There has been an update to the game after 9 (?) months of nothingness and awful communication. It seems to make the vehicles more heavy and rigid, feels like driving a tank, difficult to accelerate and oversteering when doing turns. Generally this update made the car handle more difficult and quite unintuitive. Another (mostly visual) complaint is that, unlike before, crashes now show almost 0 effect (wtf?) even though you might slam into the side of the other car at high speeds and your screen shakes. Overall I feel like the changes are mostly towards the negative, there is still a chance they will improve this, but I dont have the ""right direction"" feeling anymore on this game.EDIT #2: More updates came, handling still by far not as challenging and fun as in Flatout 2, atm I wouldnt buy. Lets await further developments...EDIT #3: There hasn't been a single update in months. We are back to nothingness. Also they seem to have dropped all the arcade elements and modes that made Flatout 2 so fun. There aren't even jumps or alternative routes and shortcuts in the maps anymore. I do not have a positive lookout on this anymore, and the physics trailer and EA demo promised an entirely different picture than the game we now get. I was never willing to support a serous game that requires a wheel in order to drive well enough to compete... This is what this game has become.EDIT #4: They jacked up the price just before the Black Friday sales to give a bigger discount. This is not just unethical but also illegal (somewhere, maybe).			"

								TL;DR: Was fun arcade game, now weird arcade and realism merge (not sure about the reallism per se, maybe it's boring and not realistic?)When I bought this game, I was such a fun experience, races were crazy expecience, crashes on every corner, pieces of cars laying everywhere, it was thruly a Wreckfest.But then, after months of waiting, the update came. Update that had only one feature. New physics engine! Sounds fun! FALSE. They just single handedly ruined the entire game. Racing was now slow, cars almost indestructable, crashes boring, since nothing really happened, just bending some steel plates. But, you know, it's early access, so it's to be expected, game is developing infront of us, so some mistakes can be made. So I waited again.Now, another update came out! Again taking months to release. Was the physics updated? Is it fun to race again? Nope. Almost nothing changed, race pace is slow, minimal number of crashes occur, you almost feel like driving on highway.Conclusion, developers probably thinks that current physics version is correct and the best solution, since it's in same state for months now. Some players probably enjoy it, maybe they bought the game for some realistic races, but not me, so I really can't recommend this game.(also, are they really going for the War Thunder interface in full release? I tought it was a joke)			"

								This game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥ please do not buy..... actually if it goes on sale for £2.00 then I would say its a fun buy. Anyway it has been months since the last update.... they continue to pos on multiple forms of social media that they are still working on the physics before moving on to larger features of the game. NOW... if you unfortunatly bought the game and have played a bit of it you can see that the physics are pretty good as they are yet 6 months later still pretending they are working on the physics of the game. If you  go on the game now you will probably be subjected to playing single player against bots due to the lack of online games hosted by other players. You will then proceed to get pretty bored of repeating the same courses multiuple times and decide to uninstal and wait fot the next update...... Again sorry thats not coming dont bother waiting. Please remember this developer as they are now with a completely unfinished game indentical to what came out on the day of realease and not worked on any further.			"

No hands on steering wheel 1st person          3. Limited vehicle options (Would love to see baha's)          4. Some vehicle damages are WAY overly exaggerated (engines that are smushed and a 4ft wide vehicle becoming 2ft wide)          5. Game has been an unfinished product for several YEARS!

								Hm, I cannot really understand the negative reviews. I understand that by ""investing"" into a game in early access you may never ever get the actual game you were promised at all. Considering this, I am impressed with what I got here. The actual racing now feels very similar to Flatour 1&2 and that is all I hoped for. Graphics are nice, tracks look good and are fun to play, what more could I want?To me this is a real successor to the old flatout games. Give the current build a try, it might surprise you. Yes, it is still unpolished (in my opinion) interface-wise, but the actual racing is very neat, and that is what matters to me.			"

								This is without a shadow of a doubt the best early access game I have played, and by quite a long shot. Whilst content is a tiny bit thin on the ground, with the amount of cars and parts available at present, there is so much promise to this game already.Graphics are really rather good, a solid physics engine (sans a couple of bugs and glitches every now and then) and great sound.But what really sets it apart, is the gameplay, which is so much fun it is crazy. Multiplayer on this game is one of the best experiences you can have online at the moment. That is something quite major, what with the amount of sim racers, it is refreshing to have something which is good, slightly silly fun.Extremely excited for the full release, this game is promising to be really quite special.

Early Access Review
								This is a game that cannot make up its mind what it wants to be.  It manages to have the worst combination of elements from a sim racer and an arcade racer, resulting in a game that does neither element well.  All of the vehicles handle as though none of the developers have driven a car in real life; cars seems to always exhibit copious amounts of understeer or spin wildly out of control the instant you have the audacity to touch the brake.  My pickup truck handles better than these “things” that the game lets you control – I hesitate to call them cars.  	Technically, the game is a pure fright.  My aging, but still by no means humble, gaming laptop was largely unable to run this game with the graphical configurations above the lowest possible setting, resulting in a game that actually manages to look and run worse than the original FlatOut.  Let that sink in for a minute – a ten year old game manages to look prettier and run better than a game made in 2015!  After cutting the in-game resolution in half and disabling as many graphical options as possible, I finally had what looked like a worthy contender for Best N64 Game of 1998.	The damage modeling is a joke.  Parts fly off cars and the frames bend up to a certain degree, but at the end of the day, the cars handle like rigid bodies and have a damage model to match.  If you want spectacular crashes, go play BeamNG.Drive.  The cars handle like actual cars – and that’s considering BeamNG’s fairly simcadey car handling to begin with – the game isn’t utterly impossible to run, and the damage modeling makes an utter mockery of Next Car Game.  Avoid this game.	As a final insult, it turns out purchasing this game through the developer’s website was the worst idea I’ve had in a long time.  It turns out that Valve will not refund games purchased outside their store, even though the game can only be run using Steam.  There’s no DRM free version, no alternate digital portal that the game could have been purchased through; even though the game is a Steam exclusive, I’ve essentially been soaked for fifty dollars.  Needless to say, it’ll be a while before I throw extra money at a developer – especially Bugbear.			"

								And here I am, editing my review again.So, Bugbear promised regular updates but that only somewhat happened.The game is very unfinished and development is very, very slow.I will however continue to recommend this game, because despite everything being very unfinished I'm still having plenty of fun.If you can deal with the fact that this game is still, for some reason, in a very early stage and you want a somewhat realistic racing game with a pretty neat damage model, this is for you.

								This game is still early in development and it currently only contains 2 cars and 2 tracks (3 if you count destruction derby). With that said, the first time you drift around the corner while watching 1 car cartwheel into pieces across the front while another spins through the air overhead is just bloody marvelous. That's before you enter the destruction derby rink. ;) Tested with both gamepad and g25 wheel and had no issues at all, each of the 2 cars handling well and felt the part. Game contains a range of views from bumper through to cockpit (wheel animation and some extra detailing is currently missing).While you may want to wait out a sale or a little more content. This is bugbear well on their way back to the top where they belong. Easily recommended. A+			"

								I had a very fun times in Mixed 1 and Tarmac 2 -track with American Muscle 4!. I enjoyed new graphics. Cool to watch replays too.  MP has been always fun with previous builds (have not tried with this one yet). This is promising close contact driving game, especially with latest Update 2015-11-30.Early Access is sometimes meaning lot of waiting though, so prepare for that :/  Or.. just buy a finished game instead.If you jump in to Early Access wagon and are playing this game for the first time, i recommend to start with these two tracks (Tarmac 1 and Gravel are ok too)! And drive first just solo (with no AI or MP) few times to get feel of the RWD-car and for getting a good control. Then bring on all 23 AI opponents or MP! I turn all assists off, but leave Stability Control helper to Med setting. Keyboard ok to play. Practise good throttle control.  Btw, AI is currently a bit hard for the novice for this particular game, don't frustate if you don't win first, take it a challenge to finnish into top 10 instead (like in real life)!My old GTX 560 with 1080p + turning shadows off and grass only one notch visible in closest range made frame rate very ok.Now updates seem to come a bit more often. Maybe heavy platform revamp and tech challenges followed because it are now history (it was very frustrating to see no updates for the very long time... added to not-so-good PR comms from Bugbear side. Maybe future updates and final game will speak for themselves then!). But there is definately new spark and promise for the game with very latest update that came yesterday!			"

								The fun and enjoyment I previously had from this game is the only reason I am going to say 'Yes' for my review. After the update today 2015-06-30, I was pretty disappointed in what has changed. First run the game crashed, physics have been nerfed and textures have taken a backwards step.However!!! before this tragedy I had 75 blissful hours of enjoyment out of this game, I got my money's worth. I hope BugBear can bring this game back to what it was in the Next Car Preview and the previous versions. I still have faith that this game will give me plenty more enjoyment, I just hope we dont have to wait too long for a more polished update.Yours Faithfully,Slippery Sausage			"

								A fun game if you like singleplayer racing and racing against bots, it's lacking a lot of content though and unfortunately movement is slow on the dev's end, but that's understandable with such a small team working on this game, don't get me wrong i love the destruction and the physics and such, just these wait times is putting me off quite a lot. And so's the multiplayer hosting, it's a gargled mess which takes hours upon hours to attempt to make a server and half the time you make a server it's not visible to others, mod servers are pretty much the same, playing a server with mods is pretty much just, you're dreaming.

								If you're a fan of any type of racing game, you should find a decent amount of fun from this. It is early access at the moment, but there is still enough content to keep you happy for several hours, especially the multiplayer. The updates are fairly frequent, and quite substantial.The racing is very much in the vein of previous Flatout games, with cars having a very satisfying heavy, solid handling. There is also quite a unique (and sometimes hilarious) damage system, with high levels of deformation meaning by the end of a tough race, you may just be driving a twisted lump of metal with two wheels.Even if you aren't a racing game fan, and just like to smash stuff up, Next Car Game is sure to put at least one big smile on your face.

								Development process is at a steady rate, Blogs are fairly constant very long and detailed once released stating absolutely everything they have worked on e.g maps, vehicles, bugs future ideas etc. As of 3rd of October there are currently 5 vehicles all with various customizable parts and skins.6 tracks but the tracks have multiple variants to give the track a diffrent route.

I first want to point out that everything I say could change in the near future when the game is fully released, so please keep that in mind. This review will not be about every bad detail in this game, it's in beta. I mean, seriously, those people who write those reviews are idiots. Anyway, here ya go:GraphicsI play this on my laptop with 2GB GT 650m and with eyecandy effects turned off and texture quality all the way up + cube map quality all the way up, the game runs with 60fps and a few rare frame drops (from large car crashes with dirt anim + objects flying, perfectly good reason for it to act like that) makes this game looking really good and extremely playable on somewhat decent machines. I expect the graphics to get even better as this game develops, just as any other game would.GameplayThere are some faults to the gameplay, but overall the game is amazing for a beta stage. In the demolition derby (which currently at the time of writing this review there is only one map for demo derbies) there is wall ramps (around the edge of the map you can drive up and go down it, if you played the game, you'd get what I mean) and one plateau-type ramp. Then there's your typical cement bariers around, and tires. But what strikes me is how the AI choose to make it a demolition derby. At first when there's quite a few cars in you'll see lots of crashes, which is expected, but they ram with the front of the vehichle, regardless of whether the engine is in the front or the back.. Then as the number of cars left decreases, the AI begin to use the back of their vehichle, again regardless of engine location. This I see as unfair because not only is there no camera panning feature present but there is not even a rear vew camera. Despite this, demolition derbies are pretty good.In races, I actually find them quite hilarious/comedic in the beginning (and really any other time that cars do the crazy stuff I'm about to explain) when cars try to drive into each other instead of taking the lead, causing cars to go flying up into the air when you go around corners (In a realistic way, not like a glitch sending it so far it looks like a little dot on your screen) and then them landing and hitting the car that it to begin with and sending that one flying. One main issue I find is that the infamous drifting in this game is a failure (at least for me, I could be just a huge retard and not know how to drift properly) Whenever I try to drift around a corner, I end up flying in to the wall or barrier at the corner, OR if I slow down a bit before the corner and then try to drift I end up completely stopping OR if I try to continue to hold down the gas while drifting I end up getting stopped completely as well. There's no possible way to drift like the AI from what I can tell. Also, you can't really seem to turn your steering wheel too far. So you can't corner that well... Despite the things I said, the races are pretty fun and look like they give the game some great opportunities.ConceptThe idea of this game is nice, having demolition derbies as its main spotlight as well as the races. Being able to customize your car already with paint jobs, different tires (standard, tarmac, gravel, etc), engine, etc there is so much to do. Not to mention that it looks like there is planned shops in the game where you can buy/repair your vehichle after races. I personally have not played any of the FlatOut games, but this game looks to have a great start and many opportunities. I suggest you buy it, and join in on the fun.			"

								Next Car Game might not be polished up yet, but for a pre-alpha game, it is really fun!  So far the game seems to put more emphasis on the destruction and chaos than the racing.  Most of the physics are well done, and the damage to the cars can be hilarious.The car and collision physics in the game are superb; however, the cars like to land on their ""feet"" a little too much.  The game truly shines in the demolition derbies.  The racing is fun, but better racing sims are already on the market.  This game deliver break-neck crashes in large scale form when playing in the demolition modes.  Dropping twenty four cars into a small mud arena is madness!  Watching the bits and pieces flying off the cars as they smash into each-other and the player is too fun.The game seems to work well with a mouse and key board, but I'm sure that a game-pad would be a better option.There really isn't all that much to say.  If you have ever wanted to play bumper cars with real cars, this game is perfect!  Unfortunately, there is no multiplayer yet, but the game is still loads of fun against the bots.  If this looks like something that you could  sink your teeth into, I recommend picking it up before it reaches it's full price.  I look forward to see what is next for this game.

								>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>PRE-ALFA REVIEW<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Ok, Here is MY PERSONAL review of NCG: Wreckfest- Long history shot : Is it worth the money?! And, greater yet, is it worth your time playing? R: AbsolutlySo, Demolition Racing games haven't been a great bet since the 90s; they have tried with Test Drivre: Eve of destruction and Dirty: showdown, but then wreckfest made me witness things within the game that I haven't seen so far in any car derby game I have ever played. The graphics are amusing, trying to be as realistic as possible and the physics of the game is something new, revolutionary I would say since the game is not being made by no great company, FlatOut is good... but you know...You can put up to 23 cars racing simultaneously, what takes the carnage to the next level. The UI is good, nothing bad that I have noticed or disturbed my games so far.Also I think Steam should learn something here with this game; Since the ""Early access"" thing I have seen some really Shi* games being released, I think All games and game developers should do an Early access with the quality and well polished job that Wreckfest Already has. I have nothing to say against this game, BUT the dirty trick, low blow so-called ""Digital deluxe version"" that gives you an exclusive car or something; Do I recommend you to buy this game?! the answer is yes, BUT!!! ONLY the normal version, I believe the developers have forgotten what is the meaning of EARLY ACCESS selling; This is not a Sale this is a BET on something you have no Idia of the final product or even if the final product will be delivered, early access buyers are the ultimate supporters, we should be treated as kings with all the best.Hope this was useful ^^ Thanks.-Rony			"

Early Access Review
								This is the Flatout game I've been waiting for since the first Flatout, my favourite racing game of all time. This game is all about semi-realistic driving physics and down and dirty racing/demolition. This is by no means an easy racing game. From what I read of the negative reviews, most people were expecting a successor to the arcade style Flatout games (Flatout 2 and Flatout: Ultimate Carnage). Do not buy this game if you want to win every race by default, take corners at 300 km/h, or even finish the race. Each car (so far and I expect in the full release, as in the first Flatout) has it's own driving characteristics that takes time to master and I recommend a gamepad or wheel for proper gas control. To quote the top negative review ""Why even have races in this game when you have no control over the car what so ever?"" This person has obviously never driven a 300/500 horsepower muscle car and is using a keyboard. If all you hit is full gas you're just gonna do circles. This difficulty leads to a deep appreciation for how much work has already gone into the destruction of both the cars and environments. The 24 car starts are beautiful as everyone jockies for position, often leading to spectacular end over end crashes that require quick reactions to avoid, lest you be caught up in it. When you mess up a corner or are shoved off track by a rival racer and smash into the cement barriers for the first time you're amazed at how the wall realisticly crumbles. And that's just one of the many items to crash into and destroy on your way to learning how to survive and then eventually win. I can't wait to see where this game goes and would already recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the first Flatout or enjoys a satisfying, beautiful and challenging racing game.TL;DR: BUY if you like Flatout 1, destruction, challenge and semi-realistic physics. DO NOT BUY if you want a fast, arcade style, easy racer or a successor to Flatout 2 or Flatout Ultimate Carnage.			"

								I thought the fun was dying in this game. I've been with it since the beginning- bought it from the website before it was on steam. However, I recently discovered some wonderful people in the workshop have fixed it. Crashfest + Angry drivers = the old more fun version of wreckfest. Theres some really great car mods and tracks too.This may not go exactly down as chaotic of a route as flatout, but with the workshop support and a fanbase, they can go ahead and make it semi-serious, the fans are building what they want. Aside from all this, it's a competent racing game with great damage physics. The handling has finally come back around to where its more fun again and not so simmy.Be aware this game has been in development a very long time. It may not be done any time soon, but we are all hoping they see it through to the end. Recent promises to be more expedient with updates and grow their team to pick up the pace have me interested again.Thanks to the workshop and improved driving physics, this game has finally reached the point where I can recommend it again. I'm having a blast.			"

								I love the game idea but its badly optimised which would not matter but the research I have done tells me it might never be finished.The fact that they now make you sign a 3rd party agreement before being allowed to buy it saying bugbear can terminate development at any time and the fact that after 3 years it has not even entered the alpha stage and the lack of a roadmap just shows the developers have not decided if they are going to complete this game yet which is a real shame.Another thing that worries me is I just found out Bugbear filed for bankruptcy earler this year.I love derby games but not had allot of luck with them,I had grid and codemaster shut down the servers ,had grid 2 and codemaster broke the derby track and never fixed it ,had autosport but noone seems to play it any more.So I really want this game to be finished I am just worried it wont be.If Bugbear make this alpha and release a roadmap I will change my review to positive even if I am still having problems.Edit: Months later still lagfest and the community is full cheaters that cut track everywhere shame but this game is a pile of.............

								You can see that it has the makings of an awesome game but it has a long way to go lol. There is only three tracks, two cars, no results at the end of the race (only an option to retry or go back to the garage) which is pretty damn minimilistic and It has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ framerate like you're playing on an Xbox One. I also didn't like how your car just resets in the destruction derby if you roll over! That has to go! You should have to stay like that until someone rolls you back over or you get obliterated! I know that it will most likley include it so I should'nt really have to say it but multiplayer is a MUST!Looking forward to experiencing it evolving as I know it is going to be awesome eventually!

								This game is a perfect example of the risks of buying an Early Access title. As the developer continues to raise the price for new purchasers, new content arrives at a trickle, performance is increasingly erratic to the point of being unplayable (at least on my computer), and the game offers little justification for its existence. The developer's lack of work on this over the past few years is lackadaisical at best, fraudulent at worst. It wasn't worth paying the $14.99 I paid for it in October of 2014, and it certainly is not worth paying $39.99 for at the time of this writing. Avoid.			"

And a bit more than a month to go until it's third anniversary holy christ. I can't even joke about it. I have games that get more content in one update than this did in all of 2016. It looked great and there is some fun to be had in it, but the menus are hot garbage. It killed any hope I held for another era of Flatout games. Honestly at this point just forget this game exists (like the developers did) and go pick up BeamNG.drive. It's cheaper and overall just more fun.			"

Next Car Game: Wreckfest is an Early Access racing simulator with advanced crashing simulating and exciting races.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:There multiple game modes, multiple cars and customizations. You can race, or crash other people to death. It's up to you, what to do.Pros: Many Game Modes | You have plenty of game modes to enjoy, including Last Man Standing, Deathmatch, Elimination Race and others. More will come, in case you will get bored of them somehow. Online Multiplayer | There are online servers you can find and play with your friends, if you so desire. Different Vehicles | At the moment, there are seven cars in this game. They are not too different from one another, but it's gonna get a lot more diverse. Multiple Maps | Maps are already great in my opinion, you get to race in small laps, in an arena, on a dusty road and many more. Engine Capabilities | Collisions and their results look astonishingly good. Also, you don't just look crashed, driving the car is also influenced by that. Feels great, until you destroy your car so much that you can't even move! Driving Experience | Driving is smooth and very enjoyable, it feels pretty real. I can say that this is one of the most optimised parts of the game.Cons: Updating the Game | If you take a quick glance at the Discussions section of NCG:W's Community, you will soon notice that this game is updated way too slowly. I mean, although the content is good and plenty, this game lacks of some crucial things. Cars have upgrade menus, but few or nothing in them for choosing. It makes the game feel hollow more than it actually is. It's kinda sad, actually. Some Options | For event weather, you get to choose between ""Random"" and ""Clear weather"". And this is not the only example. I know this is EA, but they could at least remove Random until they add more weather conditions. Steam and OS Support | This is another thing that this game fails at. There are no achievements or trading cards and you can only play it on Windows.The final verdict:Although the negative sides are pretty bad, I had a lot of fun playing this and, if the rumours are correct, there will be a big update out pretty soon. The crashing is super fun and it is interesting to observe all of the effects on your car. Play it with your friends and you will have some good laughs!Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

								Yesterday, this was such an awesome game to playNow it seems as if it's patched away...Oh I believe in yesterday...No, but seriously... I regret not having made a backup of the old version, before Oct 2015... Gosh, I was an addict for the game and for me it was already like ""released""... only hoped for content, but I got a patch I didn't asked for, so that another game replaced my good old favorite game :( Apparently it has been silent yet again about Wreckfest... It would be nice to get some more information, about what to come... has there been any? I haven't been in here for a while... But I feel the urge to play that OLD game again, but now there is no chance anymore... Having an awesome game which is gone, because of early access, is harsh! I respect the decisions bugbear makes, but my personal dissappointment stays... QQ, whine, first world problems etc. Yes, I know, but that is my situation. I already feel as if I'm preparing a feeding trough for trolls ... All I wanted to say (way shorter than I did) is:I miss yesterday... I miss Next Car GameI wrote all this about a year ago in a discussion... I gave'em time for getting it right... they failed...They patched away the fun and added weird levelsystems, buying and repairing systems etc. trying to motivate players to play... You know, you could have had me playing this game all the time, if you would have just stick to the fun version of it... It's done and I know, this review (like the other mostly negative reviews) will hurt this game... but I loved another game called ""Next car game"" which got killed (by patch) by a new version...

								This game used to be a blast until about 2 updates ago (early access). Now the crash damage has been tamed down so much I feel like I'm playing just another bland racing game. I purchased this in early access because it was different and so much fun crashing into other cars that I didn't even care if I won the race.  Right now it's unplayable for me...The car controllability, which was great and fun as heck, is now crap....all I seem to do is spin around 180 degrees with no chance of correcting and catching up to the AI cars (even with all the best upgrades purchased/installed).  If you're going to abandon this game, at least go back to when it was fun, remove all the unnecessary details of upgrading the cars, just make the basic cars fun to drive and wreck (Like they were) and give your early supporters at least something playable. Do at least this and I will change my review to positive. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT THIS TIME.			"

								Unfortunately, Wreckfest has become yet another Early Access cautionary tale.  It was a great idea that started out quite well with plenty of potential.  But, it's coming up on three years in Early Access, and the game remains just as undercooked and directionless as it was on day one.  To add insult to injury, they're now taking pre-orders on a second Early Access project.If you're considering getting involved with this game, or the developers for that matter, I would very strongly suggest reconsidering.  If I could take my money and back out now, I absolutely would.			"

								The idea of the game is great and has lots of potential, but isn't really worth $30. The game has been in pre-alpha for a year and a half, and no new content has been added. The obstacle course is great, for about 5 minutes but after that it is just boring. The actual game is ok, but doesn't really differ from map to map. I also had no clue how to speed up faster than the other racers. and my final problem is the hardcore lag. For this game, even offline, you need a computer that has a great graphics processor for the game to run smoothly. My computer isn't directly made for gaming, but does have ok specs. Overall, I would say only buy this game if it is on sale, or when it is out of pre-alpha.			"

								I originally backed this on Kickstarter, but it didn't make the required  amount, so the developers took  pledges  directly via their web site.  I'm glad  they did.  It's not yet  quite  Flatout  or Flatout 2 or Ultimate Carnage (I love all three games); though  I was really disappointed with Flatout 3, then discovered it was a different team who created that game.  Thankfully the original team have been developing this game for a few years now.I've seen it develop from a basic game with only a couple race tracks andvehicles and a Demolition Derby arena to  almost a fully fledged game.  Of course it's still a long way from being finished, but the dev's have been working on the game  constantly and updating fairly regularily.I do hope we see the wacky  games that were included in the  first three games as they  were one of the reasons I love those games so much.  The other was the destruction physics.  In this the dev's have excelled.  What we get now are some of the best damage physics I've ever seen in a game.  All we need now are   loads more   tracks  to race around.  The graphics are also an improvement on the originals.To the dev's I do hope you are going to add more  rally like  racing routes?  The ones  in Flatout 2/Ultimate Carnage were brilliant.   I highly recommend  this game to anyone who likes vehicle based games.  It's definitely not your standard racing game.  Instead you get something that's  a lot more fun to play.			"

								This game doesn't really know what it wants to be. The title says Wreckfest, the cars are bangers, there are demolition derby's and figure 8 tracks, so, you would think this is a game where hitting other cars isn't optional. And the title sounds kinda like an arcade game, not an simulator, so the handling will be pretty easy and forgiving too. Well, none of that is really true. Ofcourse you can hit other cars, but the damage you get is pretty high, so in no-time you are a burning wreck. A good strategy on a Figure 8 track is braking hard if you think you gonna hit a car. The best tactic in demolition derby is: don't hit any cars, And if you got to hit them, do it slow. Hitting a car at full speed feels like more damaging to your car then to the opponent. Clean driving is the way to go, that just doesn't feel right in a game called WreckfestThe fact that the opponents are pretty are pretty agressive doesn't help either, they don't really know that it's better to drive clean. The handling isn't much better too, it feels just pretty bad, not really diffucult or simulator like, but it isnt arcade either. It's a strange middle of the road way of handling, Throw in the agressive AI and your car sometimes spins completly out of control, but sometimes it does not, and just keeps going. The damage models are pretty bad, cars crumple in really wierd ways, and damage hardly affects handling, even if 3 cars ploughed in your side, making your car a bit U shaped, it still drives wonderfully. Engine damage? Well, the panel says my engine is red and that's problaby not a good thing, but there is no decrease in power, problems shifting gears, strange clunking noises. But, one hit and it's in flames. Sound is pretty good, but nothing special. Graphics were pretty good, but time doesn't stand still, and now it's just meh. Not bad, but nothing too good either. But, all those things aren't the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that updates are slow. The last update was in July IIRC, and that was a small bugfix. New tracks, new cars? Well, there were a few, but they got added 6 months ago, nothing new since then. ""Get instant access and start playing; get involved with this game as it develops"", well, in this case, it's more like ""...if it develops"". Yeah, there will be a real track, but, honestly, who cares? It is, or was, a game where you crash cars, i don't care if i do that on some real Finnish circuit, or on one that doesn't exist. I bought this game for some fun racing, racing that includes ramming, smashing, crashing, T-bone'ing, and some more smashing. If i wanted to race clean, i'd play Dirt Rally or PCars. For now it is a bit of a frankenstein game, a part of it really wants you to smash right in that car because it is Wreckfest, and another part will punish you for that, because it is a clean racing semi-simulator.Really can't recommend this game for this price.

								At the moment not much single player,true.But multiplayer its worth it even at full price.pretty stable(depending how good the host is).the only kinda minus point is a relative small playerbase.but big enough to have every day atleast 1 full server (24 players)lets face it,greate handling.i can kinda compare it with grid 1.it feels kinda realistic but at same time not overly realistic that u feel like in a simulation game.trough tuning of suspention you can change the way your car completly for example.going with soft suspention over a jump will cause your car to bounce as crazy for example.ofcourse the game isnt finnished.the tuning system isnt done yet etc.but you got a stable multuplayer,full server(s) fun handling cars and in my opinion a fun dammage system with alot of objects ending up on the road.in my humble opinion one of the best racing games of past 5 years.But by far the most fun one!

								Next Car Game is the game YOU want to play!For a pre-alpha it already offers an engaging and thrilling experience. Just like Destruction Derby on the Playstation but BETTER, Next Car Game revives the child in me that just wants to see cars DESTROY eachother! Car parts, tires, bumpers go FLYING along with destructible enviroments like concrete and tire walls. First person view included! You can see the window smash before your very eyes as you ram your vehicle head first into an oncoming opponent. Two gamemodes, Classic derby and Race track (two race tracks to try) for alpha. Derby is like an Arena but the gladiators are CARS. You can choose if you want to compete against 12 or 24 opponents, free for all, always. When you drive straight into the middle at full SPEED you don't know where you'll end up and all you see is smoke and fire until everyone clears and your lying upside down in a graveyard of metal and glass. The ANTICIPATION is amazing when you're tailing an opponent and you yell ""Boom!"" as you drive into them causing mayhem as you do.The race tracks are even better. Choose 12 or 24 opponents, race on gravel or tarmac. Drive fast and never look back because everything happens in front of you. Cars flip, roll and burst into flames. You need to dodge your way to first place and when you're there you need to watch out for opponents that will try to take you out with force, be prepared for anything. I was rolling in tears as I witnessed an opponent drive off a ramp and out the stadium, next, two vehicles persued me and tried to elimate me from the Derby so I slowed down, spun left and watched them collide into me. All I saw was blue sky and then I hit the road and landed safely on my wheels but half of my vehicle was missing. Collision is everything, your car will literally dissapear as pieces of it get lost in every collision, so make sure each one counts.I was driving fast down a long road then I came to a left turn and slowed down. What I saw at the bend was pure chaos, some vehicles had driven into the barrier and blocked the road so everyone had to drive through them. I made my attempt and piled into the mass, I couldn't see what was in front of me from all the smoke but I finally made it out and realised I had two vehicles in front of me driving the opposite way! At the finish line I was making it into my second lap of the race but my driving skills were put to the test as wrecked vehicles littered the entire course from the first lap, I went left then right then left again and thought I was through until two drivers came hurdling from my right, one of them flipped and rolled across the track and suddenly I had to dodge a moving vehicle! My heart was racing. I came 13th in that race. I am yet to come first in any race.Just like Destruction Derby only better. You'll laugh out loud and be amazed at all the insane driving action that takes place in NEXT CAR GAME.			"

								First off, I would like to say that the idiot that gave this a negative review for this game because The ""main layout"" of the game is a ""ripoff"" of World of Tanks, just because it has simmilar features it isn't the same thing as a complete ""ripoff"" With that, he also called it a beta, which is horribly wrong, and he obviously has no idea what he is talking about.Now to the actual review...This game, just in the physics playground was worth the money. It has the feel of something between DiRT and FlatOut, (more leaning towards FlatOut) but also has the car handling of Forza, those are also my favorite car games. Alot of people are saying oh, it doesn't feel like FlatOut, but they are not trying to make a FlatOut remake, they are making a new game. The handling is fantastic if you know how to use it, do not keep on the accelerator the whole time, let off around turns. You can do this easier with a controller, but I can manage it fine on a mouse and keyboard. Negative right now is preformance, but as it is in early alpha, I see no problem with it, especially considering how many things are on screen at once. The demolition derby is pretty fun, but I really love the races. Racing with 3 tires, a broken engine, and no doors is pretty insane, and it really isn't comparable to anything else, the destruction is something like Beam NG Drive, but it has better car handling, because Beam NG is a damage simulator, not a racing game. Overall, as an alpha, I would give this 9.1/10			"

The two hours I spent so far were mostly spent on only one racetrack, just racing again and again! The variation in each race is awesome and you never know what crashes occur the next time you race. At the time of writing, there are not a lot of tracks and cars, but in my opinion it already is worth more than the price they're asking!			"

								Truly early access. While it's fun, there's not much here so don't expect to play for hours on end. You're given what is basically a place to test game physics as well as the very early basics of the game. The latter is where the fun really is. You're given 3 car types, that can be modified. There's a demo derby, a figure eight track, etc. Not much, but enough to get a good solid glimpse of what's to come. You'll be racing around with a few dozen other cars, and expect the track to quickly get littered with debris. Everything on the cars seems to be deformable and destroyable. The walls, bails, tire piles, etc all seem to be too. Don't expect to bounce off a wall and keep driving, this is much more realistic and you're going to get wrecked. That said, it's not SO realistic that you're out of the race after you've crushed your car into a cube. Of course that's part of it's charm.I'm looking forward to this being fleshed out more, and when this goes multiplayer it's going to be a huge hit!			"

								YES, YES, YES, YES There's nothing more to say to the question if you should get this game. This was written when the game came onto steam at the time of the first patch, and I must say, the game is so very polished, oozes such passion from the developers and is so much fun it's worth it's money even now when it only has 3 tracks, 2 cars and 3 race types. It's already got the beginnings of a great-looking upgrade mechanic for the cars and an amazinh damage model. It works without crashing on my machine and I haven't seen any complaints about stability - in an EARLY ALPHA for hell's sake. Bugbear are the creators of Flatout 1, 2 and Ultimate carnage (but not Flatout 3) so you know they know what they're doing with a destruction racer such as this (yes I think I just made that genre up myself, who cares it's that amazing).The game also has native controller support already so any controller you use doesn't even need any setting up (and at moments it does seem like a controller is the better way to play the game - although the KB works aswell.)In conclusion the game is definetly worth your money right now and I would recommend it to anyone that has played FO1 or 2 and was left with a sour taste after FO3. I literally have nothing bad to say about the game. GET IT!			"

								I'm in love with this game, due to the fact that it is just mental fun with the current level of content in it. It also features a brilliant engine, which can handel 23 AI controlled cars tearing each other, and the world surrounding them, up without the slightest bit of lag. The looks are utterly beautiful and the cars are well designed so far aswell. The only downside yet with this marvellous example of a good racing game is that there is not that much content yet, but its easy to forgive since it comes with an extremly addictive tech demo and its still Pre-Alpha 0.1whatever, so theres a lot more to come.11/10 BUY IT MORTAL!

								8/10 - EARLY ACCESS GAMEPros - Outstanding visuals, insane damage model, smart AI, great sound, few bugsCons - At this point: few vehicles (4) and few tracks (7), no multiplayer, only one mode -----------------Full ReviewReviewing an early access game is never easy and even though the final product may be something entirely different I feel it is my job to inform people exactly what they are missing and more importantly why they should support this game and support it now. Next Car Game is a truly amazing game when you think about how far into its development cycle it is. I am writing this in July 2014 and it's not even in alpha; yet, the game still manages to look, feel, and react like you would expect a final product. Cars handle exactly like you would want them to handle, damage modeling is outstanding and overall the sound and graphics are impressive. To me I am not seeing a $30 half made game. I am seeing an opportunity to fund something that could become something truly amazing and with the reputation that Bugbear has, I am sure we will see exactly that. Some complain there is not enough content and that updates are slow. I don't really see that. Content comes once every few weeks and when it comes it is impressive enough for me to launch up the game for another fuel-filled run.At this point the pre-alpha has 4 cars, 7 tracks, full customization, LAN support, and full 23-vehicle races. The damage model in itself is outstanding and more than enough for nuts like me to keep playing. Stupidly fun, amazing looking and more than a little chaotic I can easily recommend this game to people who like racing games and/or breaking stuff. "

								I've never left a review for anything on here but I feel I need to for this...This game has had me for less than an hour and I have never been more happy with an 'impulse' purchase...

Not since playing Flatout at my friends as a child have I been able to drive off a ramp just to fly into something intending to harm me... But this takes that to a whole new level, the physics the graphics and everything else inbetween, just makes this stand out as potentially the best car game I'm fully yet to play.

								This is currently pre-alpha, so it's very small, but it's awesome. I recommend deluxe edition because test zones are great and it's full of things to show you mechanics that might come in later (hammers smashing you up, stacks of destructible stuff). The physics are impressive, and the AI drivers are fairly challenging and have a tendency to smash into each other around a corner. It's common to see one or two of them get knocked sideways and flip over, and sometimes one will smash into a barrier and cause a pileup.If you've ever played a Flatout game, it's like that but with better physics, prettier graphics, and less screaming.

								I genuinely adore this game. I'm not a huge fan of racers, but there's just something about Bugbear's games that make me love them. The damage you can cause and take, how your cars get beat up as the race progresses and just how gorgeous the games they make are. As it stands the only thing I can count against it is that the multiplayer lobby is skeletal at best in features and that it could do with a bit more optimization, but that's it. The game feels good, racing is fun, derbies are violent and funny, and multiplayer really is where the game truly shines at the moment.Do remember that this is an early access review though, and the game is missing a lot of features still (like the entire singleplayer campaign), so take that with a grain of salt. :)			"

								I get that it has been in early access for awhile but with the new update, they announced that they will be working on this game full time now! This is by far the most fun I have ever had in a racing game with my friends and it is only going to get better. I highly recommend you give it a shot especially if you already have it and havent played in a long time			"

Early Access Review
								I absolutly love this game. Yes it is lacking content, but the developers have acknowledged the slow development and say they are working on it. Now wether or not this is true remains to be seen, because it could very well be a PR Stunt. But I have faith in the developers and hope to see this game evolve to what it truely should be. The workshop fills in some of the holes, as great mods, such as the 57 chevy mod and destruction derby mod add content that only adds to the fun. Pros: This game overall has great graphics, along with realistic damage. Some modded tracks can have texture issues, but this is not suprising. The AI are crazy, but can be too easy to beat at times.  Overall though the AI is good. I also enjoy the Cars that the game does have. The vanilla tracks are fun overall, but sometimes lacking in terms of difficulty or creativity. Cons: If you strip away the workshop options, this game is lacking content big time. Only a handful of vanilla cars and tracks exist. If there were no mods allowed or if they did not exist, I would have never gotten this game. The game as it is without mods is not even a $10 dollar game, let alone a $40 dollar game. The mods are the only thinbg that make this game worth playing, which is a shame. The only reason I even recomend this game is because of the mods, and even then its better to wait until it goes on sale. I also dont like how it forces you to earn money and buy cars and parts right off the bat. That should be saved for a career mode. And the fact thast parts go bad can quickly turn an A class car into a C-class car. Very annoying(But should exist in a career mode).Things that need to improve/be added:Add a paint booth: Please!!!!! this would massively draw appeal and add a creative element to the gameAdd a Career mode: This needs to be added, using some of the curren features. Along with this have a separate arcade mode where you can choose any car, at any class, on any track.Add more tracks and cars: Another must happen. The current vanilla options are only a small handful.Add sandbox options to arcade mode: Options such as choosing what the AI drives as far as who drives what and how skilled they are, choosing your starting position along with choosing the ai starting positions. Add a track ceator/editor that is easy to use: Even if its a separate application!Allow replays to be saved: For those of us who forget to run Fraps while playing the game.In conclusion, this is a very fun game to play. However, it lacks content. But the developers are looking to fix this starting in February of this year, and Hopefully this will turn into a great game. Again, if it wasnt for the mods, I would not buy this game. But this game has mods, and they are a blast to play! So yeah. Buy this game... when its on sale of course! "

								alright let me start off by saying that im writing this review based on the fact that i got this game for half off during the winter sale. that being said i personally find this to be a fun game and worth the price. i would also like to add that ive seen all the reviews on this game and we all know most are negative. i personally am content with how the game is. ever since this game came out ive wanted to get it because of the awesome crash physics and now that i have a gaming computer ive finally gotten it. i understand that bugbear is abandoning the game but honestly, if you want a good, pure demolition derby game this is the one. Though if i had bought this for 40 dollars instead of 20 id say the price is a bit steep. 20 is more reasonable which is why i think the game was worth it. id recommend waiting until another sale comes around and buy it then.

								So I bought this game while it was on sale, and I am satisfied so far. To all of those people expecting an upgraded version of Flatout, don't buy it yet. It needs A LOT of work to come close to that. But if you are look for a game that has a clear potential of being so, then this is the one to buy.One of the best parts of the game is clearly the realistic soft body system. The metal bends according to where you hit the car and how hard you hit the car, something which you often don't see in racing games. There is a problem to this though... it is too realistic. During these few minutes I have been playing I saw 2 cars with their roof literally flattened to the point the driver should have been killed... and to the point where the steering wheel popped out of the roof so yeah, the car's soft body physics are taken seriously too far.The game modes that are offered are vast for a game in pre-alpha. Figure of 8, plain old destruction derby, mudbowls, you name it. Although this game is meant to be a destrction derby type of game, I would really like to see tracks where you can plainly race since it would give you a relaxing breath after all the mayhem.The car choice so far looks promising, although I hope that more are added tp the list... much more. I mean 10 cars is hardly a selection right? But the models are awesome, nothing too flashy but don't all look like rust buckets. Another interesting feature regarding cars is the ability to change its parts. For example, you can change your stock exhaust manifold to a racing exhaust manifold provided that your car is compatible with the upgrade.Something that really sucks though is the career... because there is actually NO career mode yet. For f***'s sake why the hell didn't you include a friggin' career mode?? People, this game has been in early access for whole months and it doesn't have a simple career mode yet? So yeah, no career mode yet...Another thing that I really didn't like is the fact that they put in the feature to repair your car's parts as they can be bought in a used condition thus not being totally efficient... but you can't use it for some reason. So the button is there, the concept is on the plate in front of you but you can't touch it cause your hands are tied behind the chair. That's exactly how it is.Finally, I would like to talk about the game's damage system. It is total bull****. I seriously wouldn't recommend hitting the other cars, in fact avoid them. This is because you will get huge damage all the same. In destruction derby I ended up finishing 22nd but I was (according to the statistics at the end of the game) the hardest hitter... so shouldn't I have the honour of being 1st?? Especially if I wasn't hit during any part of the race but only hit other cars?? Yeah, it needs some work.In conclusion, although I like the game so far it still isn't worth getting at full price. But if you manage to find it on sale grab it. I did have fun playing this game but some crucial details are missing, and they must be implemented fast. The developers are getting lazy as a lot of games that were in early access after it were completed before it. And honestly I don't want to feel that I wasted my money on this, it has the potential to be a GREAT game.			"

								I'll start this review off with pros and cons-Pros:-soft body physics-gorgeous cars and world-good driving physics-online multiplayer (privately hosted servers)-good optimizationCons:-unfinished-slow development-no local multiplayer-only partial controller support-few cars/maps-little in game progressionNow onto the actual review. Wreckfest is a bit of a interesting one. I bought this game originally months ago but it felt more like just a little tech demo because there was no progression or point to actually play it. You could play as any car (of which there were few) and on any track (again, there wasn't very many tracks) so I got bored of playing pretty quickly. With the recent update, there's almost a point to play it because you have to buy the cars and there is upgrades to do to your cars. That being said, you can buy whatever car you want and max out it’s upgrades pretty quick, so again with the lack of depth. The “market” makes it feel like you’re actually a mechanic/driver and you have to surf the local classifieds to find parts and trying to get the best value, but since there's only a couple of options for each part, you can't really customize your cars as much as I'd like. Speaking of cars, they look amazing and are incredibly detailed but the in-game world still needs some graphical improvements. The maps looked great a few updates ago, but were somewhat recently decreased for the sake of new suspension and traction simulation. According to Bugbear, it takes about three months to create a new car, start to finish, which is understandable considering how much work needs to go into each one. But it’s still a bit ridiculous. I wish they had a bigger budget and team so it could be finished sooner but I'll keep waiting for this game to be legitimately completed. Until that  day comes, I still can't recommend this game. Bugbear has set the bar for themselves pretty damn high for themselves and I see this game being one of my favorites once it's finished. People tend to give this game pretty negative reviews because they say it's been abandoned by it's developers and it's a waste of money which isn't true in the slightest. Building this game is a huge undertaking and for it to be done by just a handful of people is going to take a while. If it had the budget and team of a triple-a game I'm sure it would be a completed full release by now. Tl;dr- Fun game, but unfinished. Looks fabulous, cars are incredibly detailed and have soft body physics, but I wouldn't recommend buying it-yet. The day it's finished, buy the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.			"

								Well when I first bought the game a long time ago, I found the physics to be interesting but the cars were far too sensitive to damage, the game didn't look it's best and after about 10 minutes I shelved it and let it gather dust. In the last few days I picked it up again and wow. Even though theres barely any content right now, this is by far the best racing/banger game I've ever played. If you enjoyed Demolition Derby, you'll love this. Multiplayer is incredibly fun and I have yet to figure out why. I can't stop playing it! Can't wait until it's finished.			"

								Please stop defending bugbear like they are actually working on this game in good faith. They are not. At best, they've kept an intern on it releasing a new car or track once a quarter. It is unethical to sell an early access game to tons of people, then to almost completely abandon it to work on yet another early access game - http://www.wreckfestgame.com/stuntfest/. That's right. Instead of working on finishing this game, they've been working on creating yet another Early Access game, one which they will probably never finish either. Please do not support unethical developers.This ""next car game"" could have really become the new ""destructon derby"" series but they just take our money and start developing other game, maybe they finish this new game, maybe not... who knows.Just do not buy this game.

You also need to portforward to create a game which is pretty standard if the game was made 20 years ago.It is great fun, I had a good laugh most of the time playing it.I recommend people to buy it with hopes they finish it really soon.

								The is coming along.. slowly... Development seemed to be improving, but they wasted time with the micro-managing of ""crews"" and parts and their ""career mode"". Give us a mini-points system and a forward-progress based career, and add more tracks/content and people will come back. Hopefully it gets completed and the multiplayer repopulates, because it's a blast when full!			"

								Next Car Game: Wreckfest is one of the best and funniest racing games ever. Especially the multiplayer can give you a great time. As a racing sim driver my self I had to figure out that this game is not about winning in the first place, it is about surviving.The game comes with a lot of great stuff like tuning options, very detailed cars and various tracks. The Early Access phase is not yet completed and the game has still a lot of bugs, no ""storry mode"" and the tuning sytem is also not quite finished. BUT the absolute respectless AI in Quickrace mode and the other players in multiplayer mode making game a serious challenge.The updates are quite rare, but the Team behind the game is every time doing a good job, because if they release a new patch they are making big changes to the game. I own no Early Acces game wich provides so much new kontent and so little bugs. By every update they reduced the bugs and made it stable to play. In total my game chrashed just 4 or 5 times, every AAA title released by the big Companies in the last few years had more chrashes on my computer.To conclude my Rewiew:+Multiplayer+Fancy cars+Tuning system+Challenging Tracks+DAMAGE!-slow development progress-rare updates-A little bit complicated to drive (Controller Recomended)All in all the game is fun but it has it's weaknesses (F***ing Bots! They crashed me!) I definitly recommend this game but buy it when it is in sale 20$ or 20€ or whatever you ar using, is a god price. If you buy it don't be mad about others in multiplayer (F***ing player! He crashed me!) it is nothing personal.			"

Early Access Review
								The game is just going nowhere, 3+ years and what do they have to show for it, like 6 to 8 tracks, most of them visually pretty dull, about 12 cars, most of which are just slightly different versions of another car. im looking at you american muscle 1, 2, 3, and 4. They also have a few absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicles that you'll use once and then never use again like the tractor for instance. And they did add some refined handling from what they had at the start.they also added a crew management and upgrading car mechanic to the game but it honestly feels tacked on and is more a nuisance then anything. Plus they way they have it there are only one or 2 cars everyone will use in multiplayer because all the other cars are to slow and cant compete, it generally pretty cut and dry you win if you have the better car.Multiplayer is pretty much dead, no dedicated servers at all, of the few player servers most have 100+ ping for me, or rather its more like 2 have 100+ ping and then the other 15 servers are 150 - 250 ping. All games multiplayer games are ruined by floating or teleporting cars even when you do get a lucky 74 ping game. And i live near but not in chicago and i have great internet speeds up to 175 mbps, and this ping/lag issue only  happens with this game. Finally this game started on Kickstarter, and it was from a reputable developer, they're goal was $350,000 and they only funded $81,772. however it soon after got noticed by many people and to date it has sold 306,109 + or - about 16,000So in other words if they sold every game for $2 they would be nearly double they're funding goal. but of course its base price isnt $2 its $40. but lets give them the benifit of the doubt and say that every single copy was sold at the lowest known sale price of $15. we'll also round down the copies sold to a even 300,000.So 300,000 * 15 = $4,500,000yea ill just leave it at that.

								The development process goes slowly and the updates are hit and miss.  Build 6 (end of 2014) was magical, build 7 (mid 2015) sucked the fun out of the game and it stayed that way for a year. However, the updates this year pushed it back in the right direction and it is (nearly) as fun as it ever was. A lot of things are still missing, but racing is already very enjoyable both against AI and in multiplayer. There are 24/7 servers and a good community so there is a good chance of finding online games nearly all the time (in EU at least).This is the best driving game I played in a decade. I really hope the devs will manag to finish it up (but I got my money's worth tenfold already).			"

Early Access Review
								Since I was a kid I have always loved reckless demolition games: ""Destruction Derby 1 & 2"" have a soft spot in my heart but my personal favorite is ""Test Drive: Eve of Destruction"" (aka ""Driven to Destruction"" in Europe). The thrill and realism of TD:EoD was unparalleled back then and I pleasantly remember countless Christmases playing split screen with my brother smashing each other's virtual cars. What a blast. And don't even get me started on the excellently fitting soundtrack!I consider ""Wreckfest"" to be a spiritual successor of the above mentioned game: its realism and attention to details put it closer to that title rather than the more arcade FlatOut series.Which is why I love Wreckfest so much.Yes, it might be lacking an outstanding soundtrack and yes after YEARS of development it still cannot be considered a finished and well polished product.But boy oh boy I simply cannot describe the joy I feel when I watch a replay of a demolition derby in slow motion and free camera mode! ...or when I place the camera at an intersection in a figure 8 track and watch the cars T-bone each other at full speed!There is also a nice selection of Mods in the Steam Workshop. Plus the title is constantly evolving and the devs are still putting a lot of effort on this one.Destruction, realism and lots of fun. I couldn't ask for more.			"

								If you played the ♥♥♥♥ out of the FlatOut series like me, go buy this now. Enough said, really. So far there is only 5 cars and a handful of tracks, including a tarmac, dirt, the 8-track and 2 sand tracks. There is also a few demolition derbies, where you fight to be the last survivor. That's the tracks I remember at the top of my head. The handling is well rounded, the suspension is awesome and the engine is realisitic enough to be fun. If it is too realistic, the cars will feel like paper and one blow will take you out (See BeamNG).Remember that it is still in alpha, and everything is a subject to change. There is still quite a few bugs, mainly video related. I've seen people with higher resolutions (higher than 1920x1080) having a problem at the moment, not sure if it's solved. Bugbear has stated that they will continue to work on this until it is a complete game, no matter how many pre-orders they get. So your money is in safe hands. They are very welcoming on the forums, so is the entire community. There is practically no flaming or anything negative going on what so ever.So buy this game, fool around and be active on the forums. I highly recommend it!			"

								WAY too early to even guess what the final product will be like, but based on my short (30mins) of play in both the engine and the game, I find the car physics to be ... well, Dirt (the game), sliding, screeching tire noise, lack of control... I don't know- just feels Pre-Alpha.  ;)The potential is huge, reminds me of Destruction Derby from back in the day crossed with Driv3r (if you can believe it).The physics playground is fun, but wears quickly with the above mentioned vehicle control.As it stands right now (Jan 16, Pre-Alpha) I would not recommend this game to friends.  We'll see what future updates bring though.There should be an in-between whether or not to recommend since nothing is so black-and-white.			"

								First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/next-car-game-first-impressions/I feel like Next Car Game is more of a tech demo than a game, in its current state. The game loves to show off its astonishing attention to detail. When playing derby, cars could go so far as to be squished up entirely into a small box, but still remaining functional. It was awesome.There are very few gameplay options currently (the game is still in early access, after all), including: derby, race, and tech demo (which is only available for those who purchase the game early). I had a lot of fun with the tech demo mode, which is packaged as a completely separate game. In the tech demo, you’re able to just drive around and test the game’s engine by running into various objects or placing your car into a cannon. There’s even a giant spider with rapidly moving legs, allowing your car to get wrecked simply by being stepped on.The derby was also quite fun. It pitted a ton of cars against each other in an arena-like environment, with the sole goal of being the last one standing. I somehow won my very first derby (all skill, no luck …maybe). The derbies are very hectic and I spent most of my time waiting for other cars to get somewhat wrecked before I made a move on them, which turned out to be quite a good tactic.The racing mode was not as fun, probably due to the fps issues I kept running into (frame drops down to 5fps?!). That was probably due to the massive amount of debris everywhere. I would think that the derby would have caused more lag in this regard, but it did not. I failed to get anywhere near 1st place during any of the races I tried.Next Car Game is fun, but severely lacks in features. I recommend the game, but I’d advise you wait for some more updates or for the full release before purchasing.			"

								A lot of people are complaining about the cost of the game and how it isn't a whole lot for the money. But I think of it this way: as an investment.I'm investing my money into the developer to fully flesh out this game. Right now it is a concept that I like and would love to see developed into a popular multiplayer game.The soft body physics are fun, and the destructive environment is also a ton of fun. If you think you'll like the game once it's completed then you should take advantage of being able to see the game sprout and become the full vision of the developer. If you don't think you'll like it, or want to wait to see the next steps they take, then don't complain about how you won't buy it.			"

The Arenas, the damage model (especially that damage-indicator on the bottom of the screen), the roundcourses are giving me that same feeling, like it was back in time of Destruction Derby... I was never that happy, like today, while i was testing the Next Car Game Alpha Access. It felt like, then with DD2. Just pure destruction without any extra features, like time rewind or extra turbo reload, wehn im drifting or or or. its just that simple gameplay, like 12 years ago...today I felt, like I was 13 - 14 years old.I'll give this Early Access a thumb up to support it.

								First off, anything I say here is as of early alpha and shouldn't be taken super seriously as this game could go to ♥♥♥♥ by the time it comes out.When I first got this game I heard all the good news about it and didn't really think it would be all that great, but man, was I wrong...I'm having a hard time explaining this game to you without caps so, OMG GAEM SOO GOOD BUY NOW, now that that's out of my system I can (maybe) describe it. So, the screenshots you see on the homepage are literally what the game looks like, and the crashes are NOT the coolest I've ever seen happen in this game. But really, this game is like the advritisements from other games, amazing crashes, a true sense of speed, and an always working crash engine to fuel it all.On the topic of this games crashes, they are AWESOME the engine may not (arguably) be as precise as something like Burnout Paradise but the fact that it doesn't glue you to the ground and that it has no annoying ""crash mode"" makes it better than any other. It's a wierd thing to describe but it feels like the crash engine is always present, barring realistic car weights your not glued to being in the upright position, and if your not good, you can end up roling over other cars or even getting stuck in other cars (it happend to me, not a glitch or bug, just the physics engine working) Speed is not the coolest part of this game but it is as good as any Need For Speed or otherwise good racing game, the turning and driving feels heavy yet controled, as if your piloting a muscle car, but it isn't as heavy as it is satisfying, and sure as hell, bumping into another car is satisfying as hell.Last minute details, it does offer controller support, it does have different views including a realistic cockpit view, and it has JUST enough content to be satisfying with three race tracks and one derby stadium.9/10 if full game                                          10/10 if considered as a beta                              11/10 as considered as an alpha			"

Biggest mistake from devs is still focusing also to derby and single player mode. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.Game got an update. At last driving have some sense. Got no problem to drive it from first corner. Everything feels how it should be. Now it's good but not awesome.IRL track kaanos is the best. Fantasy tracks are mostly not so playable from drivers point of view.Dev is still totally amateur and erratic. I will recomend version from late 2015 only.

Early Access Review
								Sitting on Steam just a few days past, I felt the sudden urge to buy into this game. Next Car Game may not be the most ingenious title for a video game, but I can assure you it’s well worth the 20 quid (or equivalent) right now. I should note, it’s still in early access, don’t take this as a final say.For a PC only game you expect top notch explosions, collisions, physics and visuals, and Next Car Game delivers in every one of those aspects. While small details may be missing, such as the steering wheel just being mute to a point where it’s rendered non-existent (literally), the pre-alpha for the game certainly impresses me. We’ve come to expect a lot from PC gaming, quite why isn’t clear to me, but at first glance, I’d blame it on the so-called next generation consoles. In other words, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The PC has long been outdoing the dust attracting heavyweights, and for an unfinished and incomplete game, Bugbear Entertainment certainly have crafted one of the best experiences, for me personally, in a long time.There is no recipe for a racing game, sure you have the cars, the AI and the main aim, but it seems as if Bugbear have stepped into a gap for the genre. The option to go into a hardcore derby or race on an impossible gravel track just satisfies everyone’s needs.The lack of tracks, cars and any real options will detract you from the game, but again, it’s pre-alpha. It has unfortunately fallen victim to the early access trap, which may not necessarily be a bad thing, it’s a pest that certainly has invaded, not only the Steam platform, but also the master race in general.I summarised the review in the introduction, inject your 20 pounds. Just get the game. You’re going to loaf the title once new features are added, for the time being, while it’s in early access, you can grab the game for considerably less. Of course if you’re a racing fanatic you can also obtain some extra perks if you’re willing to part with a little more cash. Enough advertising, back to the review at hand, for those who want to read more.While the game itself impresses in it’s relatively early stages, like I mentioned, the early access virus has infested every corner of the game. Just a while back, when Bugbear released the first sneak peak for their new title, money was already flooding in, for what? A mere crumb of the game. Sure, the mechanics were there (to an extent) and it did impress? I guess? It may have been a free sneak peak, but I can’t help, but think, the game has been a small cash grab for the indie company. It’s certainly an accusation I don’t write down lightly, but I feel as if this is a perfect example as to what an early access game is. While it works, the version you get to play, even if you paid a full amount for what could be a triple A title, you receive a condensed stripped down pre-pre alpha, which barely functions. Now don’t get me wrong, it does function, but barely. Not for what I would expect, the same can be said for the full game. There’s another point.I’m not in the know what state the game is currently in, is it done? (I know it’s in pre-alpha) Steam shows the title as ‘Next Car Game’ – So is the pre-alpha it, no more sneak peaks? I can deal with that, but the game has sneaked onto Steam, taking money, with what is just the sneak peak version two with added gravel and tarmac scenery.If you’re looking for an easy-to-play racing simulator, this most definitely isn’t what you want. Simulator yes, easy, no. Having been through seven to eight races, on both tarmac and gravel, with the various tyres and engines and the default level 2 cars currently available, Next Car Game does not go remotely easy. There may be the practice options, tactically placed right down the list, but if you’re as professional as me, you will want to jump right into the 24 car race.Admittedly, the races themselves may not be as fun, but there is a satisfying feeling to crashing into your opponents and racing to the finish. At this moment you won’t find a 54 lap frenzy, you’re limited to choosing between two tracks and racing for 3 laps. The three laps are a little disappointing, it’s not an option I would consider particularly hard to integrate, especially for a pre-alpha, but hey ho, it’s not in the game (yet). If you want the core fun of the game, where you spectate the real beauty of this game, play the Derby. More specifically the 24 car derby. The hilarious sight of a bonnet completely folded in itself, still capable of driving and crashing (purposely) into an opponent just sets me off every time.There isn’t an awful lot to talk about, which you have gathered from the rather slimming context of this review. There are just two modes as of now, the derby and the race both with options for the number of opponents. You can change the spec of your car by upgrading wheels, better suited to the job at hand, and installing a more powerful engine. Customization is largely restricted however, with no alternative paint jobs and just a different car altogether, you won’t find your creative side come to life just yet.If you’re looking for a cheap car game where you can really push the boundaries of destruction (and possibly test your PC), Next Car Game certainly won’t disappoint. But it’s far off a solid car game, at least in its early access stages. Bear in mind however, if you do decide to wait it out, you will be digging a little deeper into your pocket.			"

								A soft body physics racing game. Pros: The physics are the best i've seen in any game.Great AI.Good controls.Exellent use of physics(you can crash into literally anything).Derby and some fun modes not just diffrent tracks.Realilistic handling.Cars and surroundings have their own weights and properties.Cars will flip and break just like if you watch NASCAR(not comparing them in anyway ;)    )Cons: Expensive for what it is. Not alot to do. Only three cars. Only 2 racing based tracks. AI will ram you ALOT. AI are quite skilled( probably my fault for not playing enough racing games and the lack of a gamepad(you should get one).No difficulty settings. Have to exit the game to change important settings. The first menu's settings ( the important settings) should be low mediun high settings (just being picky).Overall: it was hard to find much wrong with it considering it Is in PRE-Alpha stage or even Alpha or beta stage.most likly the Cons will be fixed in a matter of months . I would recommend this for the reasons above. Thank you for reading.			"

								One of my all time favourite racing games is an old PS1 game known as 'Destruction Derby RAW'. I can't imagine how many hours I've put into that game alone. It had a decent number of cars on one track, and the tracks were absolutely mental. As a result, I enjoyed the immense chaos that was always had whenever I played the game.I thought I'd never find a game quite like it... Until I discovered this game. 'Wreckfest' (or whatever title Bugbear decides to finally give it in the end) is as close of an experience to that old PS1 game I've ever had. The game, whilst only still in alpha, has the option to play against 23 other opponents on a single track, and the current build at the time that this review was wrote, already has a nice selection of tracks to choose from. The tracks aren't as insane as the ones I came across in Destruction Derby RAW, they're still pretty hectic. The damage modelling on the cars is also brilliant to witness and having 24 cars on a small figure of eight track is pure utter chaos that I adore.  While I wish I had access to some more cars and the option to have more laps, I've been enjoying my time with Wreckfest and I do get the odd flashback of Destruction Derby RAW. The game already is worth a purchase, in my opinion, and everything to be added on later will just make my experience with the game even greater.			"

Wreckfest Written on 17/12/2014Even though you might get such an idea, Wreckfest isn't a wreckfest of a game. Not even in early access. As the game does not contain a storymode, I've broken the review fields into 4 categories: Core gameplay, Multiplayer, Visuals and Audio. The score does not follow a logical method and is based on my subjective experience of the game at the time of the writing and may not 100 % accurately reflect it's ""Early Access"" -state. It goes from 1-10 with 1 being the worst possible score.    Field Rating Review   Gameplay 8 At this point of development the game already has a very solid feel to it. The soft-body physics and the dynamic damage your car takes has a feel to it. The damage caused also affects the properties of your car. Sometimes a very bad hit might break your gearbox while leaving the car in running condition. The track properties also affect handling. Mud and asphalt make the car handle very differently. Currently there are a few racing tracks to choose from as well as 3 derby arenas. In races your goal is to finish the race as well as possible while avoiding smashing your car into a broken, burning toaster. Derbies are all-out wreckfests which you can play as DM FFA or TDM. Your goal is to wreck as many opposing vehicles as you can while trying not to get #rekt yourself.
The camera controls are wonky. By default your camera is from third person. Assuming you have a controller with default controller setup, you can flick the left stick to quickly look at different directions. You can also have a cinematic camera, but turning it off is a mystery to me. It will also make you crash for certain. Post-wreck, you can cycle random camera angles to watch others race. However, this feature is slightly buggy and probably won't let you watch the player you actually want to. 
Outside of game, you have a selection of cars to choose from, each with different feel to it. You can customise the parts to set the stats to your liking and choose the best setup for the track you're about to race on. As someone who plays racing games very casually, I find the core gameplay already worth the price I paid for the game. However, this early into early access the variety of cars, customization and tracks is very low.   Multiplayer 6 The multiplayer portion of the game has a lot of  important QOL updates on the near horizon. At the time of the writing though, it's very barebones. All of the servers right now are p2p, so host is always a player. You can set some basic settings like track, weather and various newb-switches like ABS and Traction control. 
For the player though, the experience is very frustrating at times. Currently you can not change cars while in the server lobby. You have to leave the server to do that. If a race is going on, you'll have to wait until next round while staring at the lobby screen unable to even watch the game. You have no timer either, so you don't know when it will end. If you forget to press ready before it begins, you will stay in the lobby. So better be fast with that microwave. If the host abruptly leaves, there is no migration. Everyone gets booted out.   Visuals 7 At max settings the game looks good. Anti-aliasing doesn't seem to work. Framedrops happen, but fortunately not often and they aren't very bad. The damage modeling on the cars looks satisfying, although sometimes weird. Weird because a slight bump might take half of your hood off and sometimes a very powerful hit will only leave a scrape. Outside stadiums, the enviroment is mostly pine forest.
Weather also affects the feel, although the selection is limited to day, sunset and stormy-ish. Hopefully we will get more harsh conditions like winter, storm and night in the future. Besides that, there's not that much to say. Technically, the game looks very solid by today's standards, but it's not something I would herald as ""holy ♥♥♥♥ look at these grafix"", Aesthetically it doesn't have much variety, but the aeshetics serve to set the feel of the game well. Audio 6 This is obviously very subjective. I found the audio and music to be the weakest part of the game. The lobby music is a terrible, short loop that completely throws out any concept of harmony between visuals and music. Within the races itself you have some sort of background music, but unless you tune your settings it's completely drowned under all the sounds. The sound effects of the game are bland. They fail to bring out the power of tires screeching against the surface. On top of that the different surfaces don't sound different. I assume this flaw will be fixed by release. The engines are loud, but don't have any character to them. Metal crushing metal, which is the selling point of the game, sounds lame. There is no proper ""screeching oomph"" to it. It's just ping pong your car's density is now twice what it was before.
Overall, if you're interested even casually about purchasing a racing game, Wreckfest is a solid choice even in Early Access. It has a fair price and it's been on very good sale prices many times already.If you are a fan of racing games, Wreckfest can fill a niche in your catalog. However, to those unsure about their interest in the game or it's state of development I'll give the advice I usually give: Safer bet to buy later rather than possibly finding yourself with buyer's regret.TL;DR It's fun in it's own manly way.

								Overall it's a great game.Great graphicsGreat destruction physicsGood map varietyThe AI is NOT the best. As soon as a single player race starts, you better floor it and veer hard off to the left. If not, you'll be caught up in a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of AI who don't seem to know how to brake or turn.As SOON as you reach the first turn, they don't turn. They just floor it and keep going, until, you're either forced off of the track, or you have to restart out of pure frustration.However, this game is from a very sucessful development team. They made FlatOut's 1, 2, and Ultimate Carnage. Don't bother looking at that atrocity FlatOut 3, this dev team had NO part in that. I fully trust giving them my money, especially in Early Access. They're a very trustworthy dev team.			"

								Although certainly cheaper than crushing cars in real life, you don't yet get many perks to playing the game. There are not many cars available in Alpha and no signs of fun customization to the existing 4 or 5 cars. I would like to see customizable paint and possibly stickers as well as items to aid your vehicle such as improved tires, brush guards, and nuts that look like balls dangling from your car. Other fun items to add to the car customization could be snow plows, spikes bolted to miscillaneous places, and maybe other items you would find in a redneck neighborhood/TMZ series. I would generally love life and quit my existing hobby of destroying my neighbor's vehicles if some of these features were added			"

								This was an impulse buy during a sale of course, and I don't regret it one bit.

I have no idea where the game will go from here, but I do know I’ve already got my money's worth out of it.This is the farthest thing from Gran Tourismo you can think of. Its arcade racing taken a step further by physics/carnage. You’ll often find yourself racing around a track that resembles the set of a Mad Max movie by the fourth lap.  Thanks to some gracious players hosting their own servers, multiplayer has been a blast.  Can you race to win? Yes.   Do you benefit from holding you line across the turns? Yes.   Will it guarantee you a win? Nope.			"

As someone who thoroughly enjoyed FlatOut:UC, I can say I look forward to the full release of this, and even now, the fact that you can ""shape-shift"" your car to nonsensical proportions in a race, whether you consent to it or not, and have pieces of cars just scattered all over the place is just damn-tastic. However, in it's current state I do not think it's worth the full price tag, maybe $20 at the max, simply because to me there doesn't seem to be enough content, such as cars, upgrades, tracks, minigames, and a good soundtrack. The two or three music tracks currently in the game get repetitive and annoying when sitting in a lobby for so long, so I ended up turning off music altogether and just used my own.Should you buy this game? Yes, but you may get bored of it quickly due to a lack of content. Pick it up on sale and if you get bored, you can always wait for release, which may or may not have a full $60 price tag. "

								Quite possibly the only game where the phrase ""Get #REKT"" can be taken literally.The physics are good, the racing is quite decent(though I personally don't like the fact that crashing into each other during races is encouraged, but others probably will), Destruction Derby is always great, and the graphics are beautiful.What's nicer is the game is actually capabld of running decently on an old computer like mine but it will look like art and run smoother than butter on something nicer.

								Overall it's a great game.Great graphicsGreat destruction physicsGood map varietyThe AI is NOT the best. As soon as a single player race starts, you better floor it and veer hard off to the left. If not, you'll be caught up in a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of AI who don't seem to know how to brake or turn.As SOON as you reach the first turn, they don't turn. They just floor it and keep going, until, you're either forced off of the track, or you have to restart out of pure frustration.However, this game is from a very sucessful development team. They made FlatOut's 1, 2, and Ultimate Carnage. Don't bother looking at that atrocity FlatOut 3, this dev team had NO part in that. I fully trust giving them my money, especially in Early Access. They're a very trustworthy dev team.			"

								Although certainly cheaper than crushing cars in real life, you don't yet get many perks to playing the game. There are not many cars available in Alpha and no signs of fun customization to the existing 4 or 5 cars. I would like to see customizable paint and possibly stickers as well as items to aid your vehicle such as improved tires, brush guards, and nuts that look like balls dangling from your car. Other fun items to add to the car customization could be snow plows, spikes bolted to miscillaneous places, and maybe other items you would find in a redneck neighborhood/TMZ series. I would generally love life and quit my existing hobby of destroying my neighbor's vehicles if some of these features were added			"

								Remember this game is an Alpha, which means it's not even near release...Not everything they are doing is available, but I have to say this game is extremely fun.Honestly for around 15-20 dollars this could be a finished project and make a great game to hold a playerbase for a year or so...The graphics are above average, the handling is a mix between sim and arcarde, but closer to simulator in terms of handling.The collisions are arcade, but honestly, it gives the game a unique flavor seeing the jumbled mess...The multiplayer is where this game shines, it does take 1-2 hours to get to a place where you can get in the top 5 in a 24man game, but besides the learning curve, it has a unique way of always making you smile. Whether you just got blindsided in a turn, or just pit maneuvered a person into a wall. There is no crying :)If you are looking for a polished game like Forza or Grid, wait until this game is officially released. If you are looking to have a few hours of fun, that does not demand a grind to get too. This is your game.			"

								Bought it when I saw Markiplier playing it years ago, very little progress since then in terms of overall game polish but that was fine the game was fun as it was. However, this morning after not playing it for a while I booted it up to see if anything had changed, something had changed all right and that was that all ai was broken so other cars didnt move and non matter how hard I hit things there was no damage indicated.Fix that and I may reverse this reviewEDIT;Just fired it up again and the AI is now working, comment still stands around low polish and I would not reccomend this game at full price but it is very fun for a quick bit of mayhem			"

								I have many games and never write a review.  I've played many many games for many years and hours spent.  Wreckfest tho...nearly everyone that I have played with raves in game and says how much fun it is including me.  I can't rate this highly enough!  Amazing Early Release game.If you like racing and mayhem and great physics (that are still being updated), or if you just like to take aggression out and smash things, or if you just got your student drivers license, or if you like games that let you be independent yet also involve teamwork (FPS, MOBA or MORPG style), or if you love NASCAR but hate that there isn't enough carnage, or if you're just normal and love games...this game is for you! (I think that's about 95% of the gaming world).Some servers like to just race with minimal carnage...that's cool too!Love this game and in my unscientific poll of users that I've played with (in the Early Access game remember which I bought on a whim) they all LAUGH HYSTERICALLY in this game.  I mean this in all sincerity that people literally say over and over in chat ""This is awesome"" or ""This is so much fun"" or ""I can't stop laughing!""  I wouldn't post this if it weren't true 100% my experience.10 out of 10!!!  (or  5 out of 5  if you can only count that high)The community is still waiting for the next patch but I appreciate that BugBear wants to release the next patch completed and be proud of it with enough testing that they don't get embarassed by some minor oversight that gets blown out of proportion by the internets community.  I'm a patient person but I hope we don't wait too long because...well I want to play!			"

								As it stands I can only reccomend that you pick the game up on sale, otherwise it's best to avoid it as full price.The games foundation, core mechanics & physics engine are really good. The graphics are nice & the optimization is surprisingly good for an early access title and it's an awful lot of fun to play. But.....Unfortantly things go downhill from here, I bought this game way back in late 2013 when it was a just a tech demo, and while it's come a long way since then, development has been slow...very slow. Considering it's been 2+ years, the game is still in a Pre-Alpha which by this point in time I would have expected it to be in at least an early beta, it's kinda just felt that the project has been put to one side with maybe 1 + 2 devs adding the odd new track or something?If Bugbear can get development on track again, more regualr updates etc... they do have a really solid game here and it would be a shame to see it sink into the early access abbyss.

								The crashes, the physics, the dirty racing and the players complaining of said racers.  This game has it all.Problem is that the game is largely unchanged since 2014.  And even some of the updates that have been released have been complete duds.  The driving physics were changed to such a state that game was unbearable to play. While they have fixed the driving physics for the most part, the game is essentially the same game it was over 2 years ago.  Early Access has produced some gems - this game is not one of them.  This game is the epitome of an EA game and the pitfalls it brings. All this said, I am glad that I bought it when I did and have no regrets - I have gotten my monies worth out of it for sure!  But in the current state, I would not recommend it and the group I play with have not even played the game in months now.			"

Early Access Review
								Wreckfest is an racing game with focus on banged up old cars crashing into each other while racing at gravel pits. No new cars, no famous brands, nothing glamorous. Anyone with a barely running clunker can participate. It's a great premise and a departure from other racing games. Currently there appears to be 18 tracks, 7 which are ""under construction"" and 10 cars. It's an ok selection, but it's nothing special.The look of the game goes for realism. Wreckfest is a really crisp looking game. It doesn't have motion blur, post processing or any of that. Normal graphical quality looks a bit dull, but on highest settings it's clear what the developers are going for. While my rig can't run it on highest i really liked the look of the game. I do feel that the game could use better effects like dust etc. It would be awesome, if after a few laps a haze would develop over the track because of the dust kicked up.Physics are the selling point in Wreckfest. Car handling is really detailed atleast under the hood, but this does not translate to driving. I play with a controller and liked the feel on highest realism, but it is kind of floaty. Visual damage modeling is great. Cars twist and bend from hits and by the end of the race, it's hard to tell front end from the back end of the car. This doesn't seem to effect handling, which is really strange and feels underdeveloped. Tracks have tire walls and other objects and crashing sends them flying all over. It looks really good. Unfortunately Wreckfest doesn't have terrain deformation or other newer and fancier physics gimmicks and those would really help the feel of the game. Most disappointing thing in this current version is the sound design. It's pathetic. Surfaces make no sound and you can't hear the switch from tarmac to gravel. Rocks don't hit the underside of the car etc. Worst of all, collisions don't sound like anything. At first i thought it was an issue with the sound mix, but adjusting the volumes only revealed that while there are some effects, they are really really weak. Also the game appears to have no music.UI is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ in this current build. I play on TV and sit a bit further from it. Clearly this is not the way Wreckfest was meant to be played because all of the text is really small. The tooltips are meaningless to someone who doesn't understand cars and there is no comparison between car parts. You can buy other cars, but there are no stats about their handling or anything. Only price. Shopping for a better gearbox only gives a tooltip saying ""Gear ratios: I - 2.96, II - 1.86, III - 1.31"". What are these, how they effect driving and are they better than my current stuff is not explained. Wreckfest feels like early access. A lot of the stuff feels underdeveloped or missing. Premise is nice and the idea is solid. What worries me is that the game has been in Early Access for 2 years and seeing that its nowhere near complete, i'm not sure if it will ever finish. Or if it finishes, is it dated on release. I do not recommend this game in it's current state, but instead advice people to follow the progress and decide later.			"

								Am utterly dissapointed in Bug Bear. I was a MASSIVE fan of the Flatout series and when I saw the Tech Sneak Peak I was amazed at the physics and the destruction that the game engine supported. I filled with joy when I heard this game was being made and when I bought it, it felt empty. I shrugged it off and was in denial just saying to myself, ""they'll add more content, this is just the Early Access"". Well, 2 and a half years later, I admit I was wrong. This game is pretty much abandoned. There is no new content coming into this game and I feel ripped off, even more so than some folks here who payed $40 for this game while I payed $15 because I bought it a long time ago. Oh, and did I mention that they keep increasing the price? Yeah, that's right. Summer of 2014 you could get this game for $15, and it still has as little content as it did then. What a disaster of a game this is. There are thousands of games worth your money and it's sad to say this isn't one of them. Not even on sale.			"

								The pictures and the demo's look cool but the game isn't fun for more than 20 minutes.  I wish they took some of what their engine can do and made a fun car game where you can wreck stuff and race.  Waited years for them to polish it off and make it a fun to play car game but I don't think it's gonna happen.			"

It should have been complete by now and at the edge to become an abandonware because of ""slow development"" it also lost his core gameplay spirit from the amazing FlatOut series. Instead we have here is a cunfused mix of a game which wants to be Forza motorsport, DIRT Rally with a vague remembrance of flatout demolition style.Maybe in 2020 they will finally develop the final features but i'm not sure if that will be what many flatout fans have pledged for.Update: now they're pushing hard on mods because, like many others EA games, they expect community to save what can be saved so they can do even less work! how can this go worse?

Years of broken promises by the developer and a slow dribble of hotfixes to maintain the appearance of a game being updated does not make this a game worth buying for $5, let alone $40. Developers need to learn to not be so greedy with early access games as the long term backlash far outweighs the initial profit gained from over hyping a massively over priced yet largely unfinished product...I'll glady take a refund even if the only is condition that im never allowed to own another bugbear game again.

								Knowing Bugbears history, I jumped into the early access program and expected a polished and solid game in no  time. It's been a few years now and it's still in early alpha, and all the promises are being discreetly buried. The development has been a trainwreck, and after abandoning all the ambitions they don't seem to be able to even make this another Flat Out clone. Steer clear, this is vaporware, and will be a Wreckfest only for the developer.Btw, they already started a new kickstarter program, and this is game is not even in a shape to call it a good start.

								Quite a good game for those that loved Flatout, and Destruction Derby 2 (Old PS1 game). Great destruction models, really good tracks and vehicles, awesome graphics, good physics, and great driving feel to it (Note, I'm on a force-feedback steering wheel with pedals).  I would suggest getting this if you enjoy vehicular destruction, racing, and demolition derbies. Not a good idea for those into arcade type racing games, this one has a more realistic racing model.

								If you're a sim lover and had fun with Destruction Derby on PS1 and its realistic handling and outcomes, then you will hardly be bored by Wreckfest. According to what has been done already and the devs plans (career mode fundations are there already, and we have a nice clue of what it's going to be), it's very promising. To the point that even simply spectating a race is fun (much like it's fun to spectate real stock cars races).Also, networking simply... works. Though obviously, there's still too few people playing it to find a non-empty public race session 24/24, better try it during prime time for now, or with friends at anytime, or solo (though AIs may need some tweakings to be a bit more agressive, devs also plan to give them more personality).Stability is quite good too. I played it several hours and I only had one crash to desktop.Granted the price is quite insane for an early access. I usually ignore such highly priced early accesses (for the principle only, it's not a money issue to me). But I finally decided to make an exception... and I don't regret that at all. To me, Wreckfest is now the best realistic stock cars games ever, even in its current state.			"

								There is not enough content to warrent the current cost of the game. It's a neat game with some great ideas and mechanics, but ultimately it's too expensive. It's also one of *those* early acces type games. As of October 15 2015 there has only been a single major update to this game.In the end, it's just not worth the money.Edit: So now I've owned this game for over a year, and it's gone from pre-alpha to (drumroll please)... Pre-alpha. This is another one of those games that stays in early for absolutely ages without anything significant added. I still don't recommend this game.			"

								If you asked me in December 2014, I couldn't recommend this enough, but as much as I love(d) this game, I cannot recommend it right now. Since the engine overhaul which released in around June last year, the game has had all the fun removed.Bad driving physics, poor body deformation, God-awful health bar which had no reason for existing and absurd changes to the car cams have all contributed to this ill-feeling to what was a very promising game.The developers don't listen to any feedback, make absurd changes like those I already mentioned, then don't work with the community to improve or remove features, they just truck on with whatever distorted vision they have. There is also a severe lack of direction right now, which also contributes to absurd changes.Put simply - The build prior to the engine overhaul (build 6), we had player-run leaderboards, championships and events. Now, since build 7 onwards, we have had very little of that. Until Build 6 returns, this is a STAY AWAY.			"

								Update - Well there has been an update to the game, so I'd better edit my review. As promised, the update changed the physics of the game to make it more realistic. Whilst I don't mind the new handling charateristics of the cars, a lot of what made this game fun has been lost. Cars no longer crumple up into impossibly small spaces and produce a lot less debris when smashed into. Everything seems less destructable. The handbrake also does nothing any more, which is really sad. I hope that's just a bug and not a feature. Weird that after eventually choosing the name Wreckfest that they decide to remove the ""wreck"" part. Pre-update this game was very silly, and that's what made it fun. Now it's just a generic semi-simulator racing game, and there are better examples of those available. Kind of sad, as there was only one mad demolition game around at the moment. Now there aren't any.Just thought I'd add to the ""beware of no updates"" theme in the reviews section. This is genuinely one of the most fun racing games I've ever played, but at present it's little more than a tech demo and has been that way for months. The single player is incredibly shallow, with no currency or progression. It's the equivalent to arcade mode on Gran Turismo; fine for a one-off race, but not something you're going to find yourself playing for hours.The online is where I've found most of my time being spent. It's great fun tapping the guy in front of you, watching him lose control and smash into the chasing pack whilst you run off into the lead. But again, it's all so shallow. There are no ranking tables or race series - every race exists as a one-off. The online experience itself isn't great, as you're often forced to wait 5 minutes staring at a list of racers whilst they finish their current race, with seemingly no way to spectate.I bought this game in good faith that it'd improve over time, but with several months having passed since the last update, my faith has gone. It might turn out to be the great game that it deserves, but my advice for the moment is save your money and see what happens.  "

								Oh how I want to love htis game and recommend it to others. But sadly I cannot. I purchased this a long time ago during the early access period. The game was an exceptionally fun smash and crash racing/derby game, a modern take on the fun that was Destruction Derby. The cras were arcady enough to handle, real enough to lose control when hit well. They were fast and manouevreable and the choas that followed wes gold. Made some friends through this game and we had a blast for a few months.BUT... things have changed. The game has become more or a simulation and the cars are now heavy and the game feels slow. Hitting another car seems to not be satsifying anymore, like hitting a concrete wall with a foam swimming noodle, it just doesn't do much. It seems to be turning more into a racing sim and team career managment game than...well...a wreckfest. Don't get me wrong, if you like a good, semi-realistic game with wearing parts and accurate handling, then this might tickle your fancy for a while. But if you wanted a game where you could jump in, smash stuff up using skill and gile and have a blast without it feeling too arcady, then this is not the game for you...at least not any more or at the moment.

								This is such a fun racing game. I've thoroughly enjoyed every moment. And there is still so much potential here. The physics are great, the vehicle models look fantastic, and the handling lines are excellent. The tracks are fun and challenging, plus they're frequently improving existing tracks and adding new ones. Of course, none of those things I just mentioned are absolutely perfect, but I think that there's plenty great stuff here to build off of now, and the main focus should be to create in-game goals, challenges, and an end objective. Currently the game consists of racing just to race. You earn money and experience, but there's really no point to those things in the game's current state.Understanding that this game is CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, I would still absolutely recommend it to any fan of the racing genre. If you're turned off by the idea of spending $40 on an incomplete game, drop it in your wishlist and wait for a sale.I really do hope Bugbear can make this game a complete reality, because I can see potential of it being the best Demo-Racing-Sim ever. (Well, it probably is the only Demo-Racing-Sim ever, but you know what I mean.)			"

								Game isn't being worked on anymore. The last major update for the game was the overhaul update in 2015 (added DX11 and updated the physics engine). Then a career system was added but this just added in needless and monotonous features such as repairing your car when it gets damaged (using points you get from your teams leveling up, not cash) and needing to go to an in-game market to pick up parts for your vehicles.The new engine has crippled the fun and satisfaction of driving around, the cars now feel super-heavy and sluggish compared to how they did before, people have also complained about how poorly the game runs even in DX9 mode, multiplayer can be fun but there aren't enough maps to choose from and the cars aren't varied enough since you just have some bangers and a tractor, it can seem like there is quite a lot of variety in the bangers at first but some cars are just way better than others especially with the best parts.It was a great little game back when I got it in 2014 but now it's messed up beyond repair and the devs are gone.

Now it's just a generic semi-simulator racing game, and there are better examples of those available. Kind of sad, as there was only one mad demolition game around at the moment. Now there aren't any.Just thought I'd add to the ""beware of no updates"" theme in the reviews section. This is genuinely one of the most fun racing games I've ever played, but at present it's little more than a tech demo and has been that way for months. The single player is incredibly shallow, with no currency or progression. It's the equivalent to arcade mode on Gran Turismo; fine for a one-off race, but not something you're going to find yourself playing for hours.The online is where I've found most of my time being spent. It's great fun tapping the guy in front of you, watching him lose control and smash into the chasing pack whilst you run off into the lead. But again, it's all so shallow. There are no ranking tables or race series - every race exists as a one-off. The online experience itself isn't great, as you're often forced to wait 5 minutes staring at a list of racers whilst they finish their current race, with seemingly no way to spectate.I bought this game in good faith that it'd improve over time, but with several months having passed since the last update, my faith has gone. It might turn out to be the great game that it deserves, but my advice for the moment is save your money and see what happens.  "

								This game is very fun to play and is probably one of the most enjoyable car-based games I own currently. Love the destruction, the driving, and almost everything about this game. The options for the cars and upgrades are mostly limited right now, but the game is still being updated and more content comes once in a while.			"

								What the hell happend? This was such an amazing game before the most recent update. I reccomemed the game on the features it had alone, but now... The graphics have been signigently downgraded. Every thing is now dull and muted. The handeling is more realistic but  that just takes all the fun out of the game. By far the words thing that came with this update is the new physics system... The devs took every thing that made this game fun and amazing and took it out. They took the wrecks out of WRECKFEST... The cars used to crumple and compleatly fall apart but now they hardly dent. Its like the dammage system from FORZA! Do Not get this game. Even if this update is compleatly taken away. 9 months between updates and this is what we get... An amazing game absoutly ruined. DO NOT BUY!			"

								if you take time to check the fourms you will see this game takes months for a simple update. the devs are extreamly silent about updates and when they do post they tend to say things like ""its not ready"" ""its comming"" ""next week""in the mean time we have waited 3 months for update. i am extreamly upset that a company that had over 1 million on kickstarter in one week could fail this badly.i would say dont waste your money as this game might get pulled like other games.updates tend to take 3+ months to happen and when they do they hardly do anything at all.

								If you value gameplay and driving experience, this is definietly the car game for you.If you want a cool plot and fancy sports cars that feels like a paper box to drive, there are a ton of those games already. Go and play them and don't waste your time trying to bring this game down to the same level.Because sadly, that's what makes Next car game so unique among todays load of car games.You feel the weight of the car when you drive, it behaves the way you would excpect a car to behave. That means this is one of those games that is easy to learn but hard to master.You will have to plan your driving, adapt to the track and to your opponents, make quick decisions that could throw you off track or get you into or keep the lead. Things can change in an instant wich makes the game, in my opinion, more exciting and enjoyable.And if you find the game too overwhelming, there are aids like anti spin and ABS breaks wich you can enable at diffrent degrees.But honestly, what really got my attention in the first place is the soft body damage system.When I bang my own or my competitors cars up, I want them to look damaged. Not just a few scratches and broken windows, but real dents.This game does just that excelently.This seem like something the developers put quite a lot of effort in to improve as well.Besides, the enviroment is usually destructible.All of this makes both derbies and races really satisfying.And this is just the mechanics of the game, wich besides are still in early access.New content in the form of tracks, cars and car parts, improvements to the gameplay, game engine and game mechanics are constantly being added. Where this game ends up, I have no clue. But I'm quite certain it will be, even more than it already is, the best car game ever.			"
