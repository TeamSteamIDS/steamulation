												I am speechless! I expected this game to be good, but it blew my expectations out of the water! This could very well be the Vive's main attraction! I could see myself playing this for hours, and hours on end. The social interaction is just so wonderful! The ability to actually see the other players hands and head really adds a new level of immersion to this game! I have already made two friends by just joining a random session, talking with them, and shooting some pool! The details in this game (or should I say ""accurate simulation""), are so polished and beautifully created, you easily get immersed in a whole new world...or bar I should say. The physics are 100% accurate, and it is not noticably different from real life. This is greater then real life pool, this is...Pool Nation VR! Even if you have no interest in pool, or you have never even played, you will LOVE this game! Its worth it to learn! "

												So... I have a pool table in my family room now. This is absolute VIRTUAL REALITY. You\'re in a bar, you can manipulate most things, the atmosphere is great, and the game itself actually has a game IN it :O what a concept!- There are a number of AI opponents that range in difficulty- Winning spawns presents that give you unlockables... it is the MOST satisfying thing- The controls, to me, are some of the best implemented in a game for world manipulation, the grip controls are the greatest thing in this game!- Using the cue and the aiming system is great, however I wish there was a height adjustment. Being a little taller(6\'1) I find I have to almost squat to line a shot up. But man...it/'s too cool when you sink something you meant to- I have yet to try multiplayer, but I\'d rather play AI. But playing with a friend would be awesome.- There\'s darts in the game. Not the easiest to play but still very satisfying when you hit the board hahaI hope they continue to update this game with some features that would make it pretty damn awesome:- Control the music with your own music library, including shared tunes across streams- Varied environments and perhaps even a few story modes where you play in front of crowds and have rival VR bots- Branch out to Snooker and trick shotsEither way, you like pool? This is pool.This made my day :)			"

												This game is awesome!!! I love coming from working cracking a beer and playing this to wind down.  There are only 2 things I would love to see this game add.  The first is the option to play my own videos on the tvs in the game and the second is it would be sweet to walk into this room with like 20 people in it and be able to challenge whoever is in the room.  Great game, a must buy, and well worth the money.			"

For someone with kids thiat can't always get out for this kind of fun, this is absolutely amazing.

												First off, this is a great pool game. Physics as well as hit detection is just perfect.I only have about 40 mins to 1 hour invested so far but that time passed by in what felt like a split second.So far I've only fooled around a bit in the environment and played the AI a couple of times.It's probably just me (sucks at pool) but the AI has bested me every time, and since it's the easiest difficulty it should be a little easier. Don't get me wrong, I like a challenge, but since there's about 10-15 difficulty settings the easiest one should be a cakewalk. That way it would be both a casual game that caters everyone, but they seem to be aiming for the hardcore pool enthusiasts.Pros:   Great physics   Awesome graphics   Truly immersive    PriceworthyCons:   AI a little too good (like I mentioned, probably just me)  Dart physics are a bit off at the moment    For some objects the SFX sometimes doesn't playConclusionA hell of a game that's more or less free.There are some minor caveats, but they're all patchable.ImprovementsPlease oh please add multiplayer hubs for about 15-20 players so you can just hang out by the sofas and chat, walk around and spectate tables etc. That would be EPIC!

												SportsBar VR is a great experince and really fun. My friends and I love playing and just hanging out together. I would reccomend this game to any one who wants to have fun and relax in VR or wants a great bar sports game. The game is a little laggy but it doesnt affect game play that much. but there are some features I think would make the game even better and more fun to play. -Add the ability to change the tvs in the bar so my friends and I could watch sports games while playing pool or something like that-make the games like chess have a more competitive feel by not allowing the other player to move your pecies-suggestions on other games you could add are ping pong, bear pong, 12 pin bowling, cards, blackjack, roulette, poker, bean bag toss, or horse shoes-add more items and make a currency system to get thoughs items while you can still unlock some items from leveling upThoughs are all my suggestions if the developers dont read the reviews can anyone tell me the way I could tell this to them I would really appreciate that.

Posted: June 1, 2016
												Awesome. Awesome.Firstly, the pool game itself is very good. It’s intuitive and slick, and the whole environment looks great. You can also play darts, but I found this to be fairly tricky. I’m sure it could be mastered with a bit of practice though.But that’s not where the appeal of this game really lies. It’s an insight into just how social strapping a brick to your head, in a dark room, on your own can actually be. Until now, fun as it may be, VR has been a pretty lonely experience in most games, but Pool Nation VR changes that.The multiplayer mode is hilarious. Even though your opponent only appears as goggles and controllers-for-hands, their realistic movements really do give you the sense that you’re actually in the room with someone. Once you have a buddy to share the space with, the pool almost becomes secondary because there are so many other amusing ways to entertain yourselves. Virtually everything in the room can be interacted with, and the physics are pretty spot on.Bearing in mind that it’s this much fun with total strangers, I can’t wait until VR is more commonplace and my mates and I can have virtual get-togethers, presumably on a more regular basis than is feasible to arrange in real life. I’m thinking poker games etc.In the games I played against numerous opponents, neither of us spoke much. I put this down to the poor quality of the microphone in the Vive, and the fact that it was late at night and the rest of my family were fast asleep. Instead, all you can hear (aside from the background pub noise and the music) is the pair of you rapidly descending into uncontrollable fits of childish giggles. I could actually see them physically bent over double, as was I! Almost every time I played a shot, I’d look up and see the other guy doing something comical, and vice-versa. I was crying with laughter for most of the time, more so than I’ve done in ages. We tended to use gestures to show, for example, frustration at missing a shot or an outrageous fluke, rather than saying things out loud.It was all the more entertaining because this was on the day of release, so you could see that everyone was still figuring it out and were awestruck by the novelty of it all.Technically this game excels too. The textures look great, and it’s the only game I’ve seen that manages to make the resolution of the screens look several times greater than they actually are and as they appears in other titles.My only complaints thus far are:•	I’d like to be able to adjust the position of my grip hand on the butt of the cue. The reason being is because, by default, it’s quite far forwards and I can see no way of changing it. This means you’re hitting your body with the controller as you stroke the cue back and forth. In real life my hand would be further behind me.•	Sidespin doesn’t seem to take any affect when the ball bounces off a cushion, and I can’t appear to get the ball to swerve. Maybe I just need more practice.-       The background sounds are on a loop of a few minutes, and every so often you hear some bloke banging on about 'Tuesday night, Tuesday night'. If it weren't for him you probably wouldn't notice it looping. It just breaks the immersion slightly.Some suggestions and wishes:•	Multiple players (as in more than two), and/or spectators. It would just add to the atmosphere and hilarity. You’d probably need to be able to set up an exclusion zone around your table though to stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to ruin your games. Either that or a vote-to-kick or some sort of block system.•	Access to your own music library. It would be cool if it could be displayed and selected using the jukebox in the room. I could create a playlist and then anyone could choose songs from it to queue up.•	I’m sure there’s a technical term for this, but it makes things so much more realistic when objects resist each other. E.g. at Present, I can grab a bottle and wave it through other objects. In Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades, for example, the physics are just a little better in this way.•	Following on from the point above, I shouldn’t be able to play a shot where my cue is intersecting another object – a ball in front or the cushion of the table etc.•	When positioning your head within a solid object, such as a wall or the pool table, the sound and vision should go blurry, like in Call of the Starseed.•	Be able to write messages – maybe on a board so you can hold it up to the intended recipient (assuming more participants are allowed in later releases). Could either type text or scrawl it with chalk or the like. Maybe have a set of predefined sentences and/or be able to define your own (‘good shot’, ‘you fluky♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc.). This goes back to what I was saying earlier about not being able to talk if the rest of your household are asleep or whatever.•	Beer to flow from the bottles and bar taps.-       Mirrors on the wall so you can see yourself also.•	Change the TV channels, or even play music videos from your library.•	More environments.•	Be able to create and share new environments, tables, people, cues etc.•	Be able to create, style and position bystander avatars.•	Be able to control lighting levels etc.•	Be able to control ambient noise and music levels.•	Have a full head visible instead of just the VR goggles and hats. Could even have facial expressions to select from. Could be amusing.•	Hands visible in the game instead of controllers? You could then have hand gestures like in Hover Junkers.•	Miscues if you hit the ball at an acute angle and/or haven’t chalked your cue (need to be able to chalk the cue!).•	More game types/rules. English pub rules. Red and yellow. Two shots upon fouling etc. Display the rules somewhere.•	Snooker option.•	Replays. Slow-motion etc.•	Pocket tightness adjustment.•	Table speed adjustment.•	The potted balls to show up in the clear slot on the side of the table like in real life.•	Room scale and height adjuster.•	Adjust the scale of the people in the room. Everyone seems a bit small, which is fine for the girls, but the guys look a tad out of proportion.•	The bystanders to walk around instead of just dancing and chatting on the spot.•	Be able to punch the guys and undress the girls. There, I said it. Everyone was thinking it!Tip: You can actually grab the three big lights above the pool table and take it with you to illuminate the sweet, peachy asses of the chicks around the room. You’re welcome. Update: They just fixed that bug. It was fun while it lasted. Maybe they could put a torch in the room instead??Until now, Audioshield was my favourite (followed by Project Cars), but Pool Nation VR now easily takes that crown by a loooong way.I already had high hopes/expectations for the future potential of VR hardware and apps, but this definitely raises the bar and whets the appetite further. Lest we forget we’re only a few months into this whole VR adventure (proper), and if we’re already achieving this then it bodes extremely well.Props to the devs.This is the future!Awesome.			"

												This is easily one of the most immersive and 'full' feeling VR games out there right now. The bar is gorgous and has a great atmosphere and the devs took full advantage of UE4's powerful lighting tools.Interaction with the game is simple, fun, and predictable. The physics of the pool balls and how they move around the table/react to the cue are spot on. It's almost frightening. There's a ton of other stuff in the bar to grab and toss and interact with. You can even play darts and it'll track your score for you, which is pretty cool.This is my first VR title with mutliplayer and the feeling of being next to another human (who may be on the other side of the world for all you know) and being able to hear their voice come out of their 'face' and see their gestures and mannerisms, and understand when they're shrugging or leaning on something or holding their hands on their hips when it's just represented by a set of floating goggles and controllers is an unreal feeling. My first multiplayer match was with someone I didn't share a language with, and we just spent 20 minutes throwing bottles and chairs at each other and fooling around and giggling like children.That alone was worth the cost of admission.Plus, the devs are active in the community, seem like good guys (or gals) and are working towards improving performance and adding content.You can't lose with this purchase.

												An easy recommendation.  It's exactly what VR pool ought to be.Things I like:- Arcade-like assists like ghost ball that are completely optional.- Multiple game modes- Locking the cue in place mechanics- Teleport, snap-to-table-edge teleport, AND wand-based positioning- Efforts to support a physical table in the play area (though completely optional)Things I'd like to see changed or improved:- Scale feels a little bit small to me.  NPCs are all about 5'2"".- Ability to turn off NPCs and misc. throwable objects to save performance.- More environment choices (with less ray-inducing neon), including a VERY basic environment for performance.Others may disagree, but while the environment looks very nice and is lively (nice job!), my personal preference is the quality and performance of the table and game of pool.  I can run medium settings on my GTX 780 with reprojection, but I'd gladly turn everything else off if I could run high settings on the table itself.			"

												I saw all the positive reviews and bought this believing it was a great game, and even still I was pleasantly surprised!! Pool Nation VR is truly a great VR experience and perhaps a showcase for what is possible moving forward. It looks terrific and the pool playing feels very realistic, enough that I keep trying to lean on the damn table that doesn't exist! I only have about an hour of playtime, but only because I haven't had much time lately. Stupid real life always getting in the way! ;) I really want to sink more time in this and can easily see my self spending hours in this bar playing pool with buddies. Great job on this one!! Totally worth the 17 bucks.Minor critiquesI wish you could play an actual game of darts, from my quick experience it seems the score resets after every three darts.I can't seem to figure out how to put a player name in the box. I don't wanna be ""player""!! Optimization. On medium settings I run 90fps, high 45ish fps, and ultra 30ish fps. I'm running an I7, 32g ram and 980ti SLI on an Asus Rock MB. Now I realize that VR doesn't utilize SLI, but I still feel like I should get higher than  30 fps on the ultra settings. Maybe I'm wrong here. At any rate, I list this as a critique and not a complaint because it looks fine and runs superbly awesome on the medium settings. 9/10 - Will keep leaning on invisible table.			"

												Just bought this game when i came on sale - widely expanding my VR library.Alright - where do I start?This is a game yes, but I think of it as a tool.A tool of social interaction.I've limited experience with 8-ball, and have only played the little we did during recess in school, so that's a point to have in mind. Well, I just got the game, jumped into my first game and was in a lobby with a british dude, whom I barely understood due to his /jargon/ ( what's it called in english? Accent?) Well, this guy was a nice lad. He was talking a lot, I think with someone in his room, but also to me. We were playing and chit-chatting. We were playfully interupting eachothers plays and cues just for laughs. He was aiming his shot when I put a chair on the table interupting everything when he burst out in laughter. It was just as much interaction as it was playing pool.10/10 best experience ever!			"

												As a child, this game is exactly what I dreamed VR would be. I feel so lucky to finally be experiencing it. I loaded up the game and spent what felt like 30mins playing several games of Pool and trashing the bar with a few guys from Germany. It turned out I was in there for 3 hours which is the longest I've ever spent in VR. I was totally immersed.The physics are great, the graphics are amazing, there's plenty to see and do and the social interactions are the icing on the cake. This feels like a lot of time and care has gone into making it and it feels like one of the first fully polished experiences for this gen of VR.

												By far the best best VR game I've played and enjoyed on an ongoing basis (100 hours nearly).  It's a highly entertaining enjoyable experience, made better when you can compete and interact with other players.It defiantly needs better multiplayer options however.  A better robust matching system, the ability to customise your sessions and more focus on the pool aspect.I'm hoping the next update addresses some of these shortcomings as it's strength definitely lies in it's MP experience.Overall it's a great title and has plenty of further potential if the developers listen to the players.

The VR interactive bar with tables, darts, dominos etc is very very immersive. Multiplayer is essentially inviting someone into your house and with the current vr pricetag pricing out the trolls its a great MP experience to boot, normally with game industry people or high end enthusiasts interested in just have a good bit of bar talk and a good game of pool.Was up till 4am playing MP with some USA guys last night, still stunned by the experience this morning awesome and I see its looking to be imporved by the devs too!Dont forget to play with the giant dominos too, free the inner child and go wild!

If you dislike pool, don't buy this. Otherwise, get this right now.It's an amazing experience. I got so immersed in my game that I find myself leaning over the table, barely able to reach the cue ball, just to get a shot in. The table isn't there, of course, and I could just walk through the table to easily shoot. But because I felt like I was in a bar, and I felt like I was playing pool in real life, I found myself leaning. It's great.The game is very nice, graphically. The sound is good, with the thuds and scratches of the pool balls sounding realistic. There are jukeboxes in the bar, but there isn't a whole lot of song selections. I didn't mess with it myself, so there may be more options available than I'm not aware of.As far as the gameplay is concerned, it feels very fluid, and the controls are fairly simple to learn. Having to aim both the cue ball and where you're going to strike the cue ball itself is a little tricky, I've found, but that's more of a player being bad kind of thing and not the games fault. There's single player, with multiple levels of difficulty to choose from, and multiplayer. I've played a few games of multiplayer, and it was a great experience. There were no hitches, both of us moved fluidly, and the voice chat worked flawlessly.I did experience a few bugs, though, such as the game telling me I was supposed to hit the solid balls, but then calling a foul on me for hitting the wrong balls (I was actually stripes). A few times the game called a foul on me for scratching the cue ball (hitting it into the pocket) when I didn't. But these experiences only happened one time each, and I feel that they'll be fixed soon.I cannot recommend this game enough. If you're not a fan of pool, then the novelty of being in a bar, throwing objects around and playing darts isn't going to last you long enough to justify buying the product. But if you are a fan, or even if you don't really like or dislike pool, you should get this. It's just an amazing, immersive experience.			"

												Everyone with a vive is buying this game and I can certainly see why. Its polished, fun, and has working multiplayer - something rare in VR right now.  The physics feels impressive and it really does feel like you're playing pool.  The polish level is also very high, especially for VR which unfortunately attracts shovelware developers.  If you have a small-ish VR space like I do, this game will definitely make you wish for larger space so you don't have to teleport for every shot.But, its just pool. There's no crazy game modes or anything.  This isn't a complaint, but its important to know this game is faithful to real pool rules and  a high level of pool simulation.  Personally, I find it very relaxing, but I can see how others might find it boring after a while.  I have read the devs want to add more mini games. Currently you can play darts in the virtual pool hall. I guess we'll see when that stuff comes out and how it affects the game.  I would love a real human avatar, but asking for that kind of thing this early in VR might be too much. Still, highly recommended. One caveat: Your mic is on by default in this game and it is not push to talk. The other player can hear everything you say, and often your breathing. I would have greatly prefered push to talk or muted by default.			"

												Very good VR game with atmosphere and a great multiplayer aspect to it. Only problems I can see are the size of and overall doucheness of the AI characters in game. There are only a few rules in a Pool hall and one is do not sit on a Pool table. No matter how big your♥♥♥♥♥♥there is no reason to park your♥♥♥♥♥♥on a table.Darts should be a real game and not just some side attraction. Music should be able to play your own in the back ground. The Tv's should show sports, wet t-shirt comps or at least horse racing (see Australian version below). Topless wait staff, High Vis shirts and $2 coins on the table all need to be incorporated to make an Australian version with the odd glassing happening in the background.The whole 'bar' seems a little to middle management after work drinks and not really Pool hall like.But game is great and one of the better titles on the Vive ATM			"

It's fun, you can hang in the loung with a real beer in your hand or koolaid, its wonderful.  Since my room scale is bigger than the average human here, I was able to place a few chairs so when I'm shooting pool and between a shot, i can sit on a virtual chair that i placed a real chair in my real physical spot as well as a beer in the spot where in virtual reality is a beer on hand.  Please don't try this at home.  ONly for proffesionals.hope this made sense.  BURP!			"

												Feels like pool and plays closest to the real thing more than ANY sim I have ever played.  A transcendent experience. A real glimpse into what the future can look like for VR in terms of the way we socialize and play together.  I highly recommend stacking a couple boxes so you DO have something to lean on.  Something for other Devs to note:  The ""wheelchair"" or ""walker"" locomotion that is enabled by gripping the hold buttons is a touch of brilliance and works pretty awesome for this game.  I have not played any other VR games that use this but its one of the best methods of movement i've found without having to Teleport.Things that can be added: shot calling OR just add a free table where balls can be taken back out of the pockets and people can play with house rules.Bugs i've foundOther matches starting in the middle of a match already in the processShot timers stop working for no apparent reason.

												So yeah...when I fluffed shots, I did have to check to see if anyone had seen me, and if so, give an incredulous glare at my cue as if it was broken in some way. It\'s realistic, in other words.The table is a bit \'fast\' compared to the ones in British pubs, but otherwise the physics of the game is very close to reality. It\'s a shame that you can\'t put the ice buckets on the somewhat un-interactive denizens of the bar, but I guess if that was possible, it would be a different game entirely...Not played multiplayer yet: I\'m still getting the hang of not having anything to rest your weight against: an unfortunate side effect of it not being real. So, like all other video game sports, it can only be an approximation of the real thing.Overall, it seems to be a great game of pool so far. It\'s a lot cheaper than playing down the pub too: proper VR awesomeness at a sensible price.			"

												Just great.  I've had a blast in this so far.  No gamebreaking issues.Pros:- Matchmaking seemed to work quickly on day one.- Game looks great (though the people are a little weird.)- Controls are slick and easy to grasp.- Physics are great, though I couldn't get a masse to work.  Basic english on shots work fine.- Community has been great--3 good sports and no ragequitting or anything. (A note on this--you have the air of being in an actual bar and playing with a real person so I felt some of my real life tact kicking in even though it was just a video game.)Cons:- Performance is a little iffy, (GTX 970 and an 8-core I7) I ran on medium settings and had solid 60fps.  No motion sickness for me.- I couldn't figure out matchmaking options, but I can probably do it with more tinkering.- The bar environs will likely get old, as well as the soundtrack.  Hoping for new halls.Overall, this has been my favorite multiplayer experience that I've tried so far, and will be a great multiplayer game for those who want something at a relaxed pace.			"

												Initial thoughts from Vive owner, and old-school 9-ball tourney player.Environment: Very immersive environment, I initially forgot about Chapperone and tried walking around the table as though it were real. It was nice to sidle up to the bar and pretend to order a drink, and throw bottles around. The sound effects from the bar get repeitive, and the AI ""extras"" just repeat the same motions, but they're not meant to be the focus of the game.  I do like that you can wander around the bar and find a few quiet spots, but there's little else to explore.I'm 6'1"" tall, and all the AI extras seemed like they were 5'0"".  This, combined with how ""low"" the tables feel, it seems there may be a slight scaling issue.  It would be nice to adjust player height, or be able to adjust vertically with the grip movement.Interface: The controls were very good and responsive, and once you understand them they feel natural and intuitive.  I am especially a fan of using the grips to move the table around the user - this let me line up shots naturally as I normally would, as well as let me stand in the middle of the table so I didn't have to reach too far into cyberspace that I'd fall over IRL.  The grips felt like using ""wheelchair"" mode, and was by far the best-designed part of the game.I was a little disappointed with the ""fine tuning"" aiming helper - it definitely helps line up shots, but seems to have the same sensitivity as normal shots (only it locks one hand).  But this is a minor issue.Game/Physics:  This is the #1 most important issue for hardcore pool players when evaluating a pool game.  The physics are ""okay"" - it's no Virtual Pool 4.  Cue-english seems to work somewhat, though the table feels slippery, so english doesn't affect it as much as expected.  The pockets on the tables feel very sloppy, at times too tight, at times too wide.  Ball contact angles are pretty solid, so after some mental adjustment you get the feel of how the game wants to be played.For other objects, physics seems janky - beer caps and dice barely bounce at all, while bar chairs will bounce all over the place.  I'm not a dart player, but I felt like I could get to learn the proper throws for darts.Overall:  If you're into billiards/pool, you'll have a good time.  There are only a few game modes, doesn't seem like you can choose different tables or environments, so it's a pretty limited experience yet.  I haven't had a chance to try MP, but unless networking code is wacked out it should feel similar to playing the AI.  If you're looking for deep career-mode style pool with ladders and locales, it's not here.  If you're not into pool much you may need to pass, because throwing things around a bar at short people who don't respond to you gets old pretty quick.7/10 - recommended for pool fans			"

												TLDR: If you enjoy pool and own a vive buy this.What an incredible experience Pool Nation VR is. I am running an old i5-2500k and a nvidia 970 for reference.The graphics in this game are top notch. You spawn into a bar with weird npcs silently dancing/shuffling in the corner, TVs showing ads for a pool game, a jukebox, dartboard, and of course the pool table. The default quality setting of medium did not allow me to hit 90 fps so the reprojection was kicking in and fps was 45. Turning the quality to low, while sacrificing some visual fidelity, allowed my system to consistently hit 90 fps with a minor hit to graphics. The main attraction for this game is the multiplayer. After starting a game and getting someone to join it becomes a very interesting social experiment. I have played with many people, the vast majority either have their mic muted or have not figured out how to setup the vive mic. Others speak languages that I have no clue what they are saying. A handful have actually spoken Enligsh (I am a stupid American and don't know many languages) and that is where the majority of the enjoyment from this title has come from for me. Playing with a random person, talking as if we were in the same room and playing pool. It is an incredible sense of presence for me and really makes me feel like this random person is in my room. This is where some caveats come: this is the internet and people are not generally known for demonstrating common sense or respect for anonymous people who they will never see in real life. This can lead to people messing with you, some do it aggressively with spamming beer bottles, smashing lights, or the destruction that is the jukebox.The majority of the people I have met have been cool dudes that are as impressed with the game as I am and just want to play a game of pool.I strongly encourage players of this game setting up a real life table to lean against and steady shots on. This helps IMMENSELY (use the arrow keys on the keyboard when you are in game to change the height of the table to match yours). If you have a vive I recommend you give Pool Nation VR a shot. I am terrible at pool in real life (sort of) but with ghost balls (cheating, sue me) it makes the game a lot easier and it allows you to have fun with people a world away. Last note: The 'hulk mode' reorientation/locomotion was extremely disorienting and disconcerting for me when I began to play it, this has largely gone away and I have acquired stronger VR legs throughout the games.Oh ya and HATS. I got a pirate one (arrrr) and a cowboy one (yeeeehawww). See you in game!			"

												This game is absolutely amazing.The graphics and physics are very realistic.  So realistic even, you'll want to lean on the table as you play only to discover your floor instead.I love how you can play other mini games like air hockey, chess, darts and more...The controls are very intuitive and easy.  The ""hulk"" movement system is very smooth and should be implemented in other games as well.  I would like to see a game of table tennis being added in the future.There are a few minor points I would like to see improved though.There don't seem to be many online players.  It can take while before you find people to play with.  This game should be cross platform with Playstation to increase the general player-pool.Also, the speech audio could be slightly improved.  Such as when a player speaks further away it is more silent.  Because when 6 players are in the room speaking with each other, the dialogue can get very chaotic and it can be hard to know who's talking to who.  And I would love the ability to listen to my own music on the jukebox.But apart from that, this is a must buy! The developers definitely earn the price tag for this game.			"

Brilliant environment but best of all it plays a superb game of pool.Have been waiting for this game for ages and it has surpassed my expectations on every level, the developer is constantly engaging the players and seems like updates will be very frequent.Brilliant game and one of the very best VR experiences you can have, the feeling of taking a shot is impossible to explain.

												This is absolutely the best thing I've played for the HTC Vive so far. I wasn't sure about buying this new game at first, a lot of indie VR games cominng out are gimmicky and just plain crap. When I saw that you could pair up with others online and play I thought it would be fun, I wasn't dissapointed!The graphics are really really good, it's not too blurry as a lot of VR games can be with the current generation of hardware. At times it can be difficult to tell if a ball is stripe or solid when it's far away, it's not a big deal to just move your head in a bit closer and have a look. The physics of the pool table are about as good as they can be!I usually complain about everything but I don't really have much to say here. All I can think of would be a couple of feature additions such as the ability to change the way you look in game, maybe the option to use your own music on the juke box, and maybe to join games as a spectator (just hang out off to the side of a game). It would also be nice if they made it so you couldn't actually move yoruself over the top of the pool table. I don't really see how they could do that so I guess that's why they didn't do it lol.The only issue I seem to have found with this game is that the button to put the pool stick away doesn't always seem to work when I tap the button, it's not really a problem but it's something I noticed. I may even be doing something wrong to cause this idk.I'm very excited to own this game and I look forward to any and all updates they may release for it =]			"

												I bought the game to enjoy its atomosphia in the bar though I don't play billiard.Eventually I think that was a good purchase. The game itself is extremly well-made, especially the physics is amazing.You'll find balls' weight real when they bump each other.However it's very sad a few people is found in matchmaker.THE BAR NEEDS MORE PEOPLE!

												While playing this game I accidentally knocked over a full can of beer.   I immediately rushed to grab it and stop it from spilling except there were two problems:  The can wasn't open  The can was in VRI really surprised myself with my default reflexes of ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I better catch that!""  So basically this is Pool in VR.  More ""Virtual Pool"" than  ""Virtual Pool"" is... (though I would have argued Virtual Pool was pretty realistic back in the late 90's).  You have a few tables, a jukebox, a couple of dart boards, a bar with a bunch of bartenders doing the ""I gotta pee"" dance. A few bar patrons also doing the same ""I gotta pee"" dance.  And that's enough to remind me of weekends hanging out at Rusty's Billiards. The coolest thing is, you could play darts if you wanted to, you can change the music on the jukebox (though it seems like they only have a handful of songs), you can conjure yourself up a beer... bottle.  It's empty though, so no getting virtually drunk and starting a virtual bar fight.There's also a multiplayer mode which I have yet to try but it looks great.  There's only one thing missing:  Something to lean on as you make your shots.  If I had a real world ""surrogate table"" to play against, this game would be so very awesome.   It's still great though, don't get me wrong.  It just kinda ruins the immersion when you have to hover your arms in the air while taking a shot.  Things I liked about this game:   They really nailed the bar atmosphere.  The only thing that would make it more authentic would be to have it filled with smoke and have some arcade games off in the corner... Oh and maybe a selection of cue sticks to choose from and some chalk for the tip of your cue.  The tables are my favorite color for pool tables (though I could see some people wanting the traditional green felt)  Darts!    They give you 8 ball and 9 ball at least. I would like more game options (rotation? Straight pool?) but 8 and 9 ball are a good start.  Makes good use of all the available room scale game spaceThings I didn't like:   Aiming without something to lean on is really awkward and ruins the immersion (This is not really the game's fault though)  The people seem to be a BIT on the small side.  Like the height is ok, but their body size is super skinny...  it's a small complaint really because the main focus is the game, not the people standing around, but I feel like they could make the people a bit wider.  Imagine a 5'2"" girl stretched out to 5'6"" and that's how it seems  Squish her height back down to 5'2"" and she looks fine, but stretched out she seems unnaturally skinny...uncanny valley style.  Only two pool games (8 and 9 ball) and the dart game seems like there's not much to it yet other than throw the darts and look at the score on the wall.I really didn't have that many complaints with this game, except for the AI really is kinda lame at the easiest level, but it always is... I feel like the AI lets me win on the easiest level, and the level 3 AI is the closest to the real ""novice"" player. So anyway, my recommendation is: find something like a barstool to lean on so you can take your shots more realistically.  Don't forget to pick it up and carry it with you (or else teleport everywhere) or you might be tempted to put your hand down on thin air and fall to the floor.This game is definitely worth buying.

												[after 30 minutes]I've only had 30 minutes to play, but first impression is very positive. Graphics are great. Controls are great. Presence is great. There's a good teleportation system--I was able to play just fine with about 4 square meters of space.You can move the whole room around to get a good angle, and it's not very nausea-inducing if you look at the table while doing it. There's a grid that appears around you while moving the room, which stays stationary and keeps you feeling anchored in space.It's a bit weird to line up your shot when you can't rest your hand on the table, but you can lock it in place so you don\'t have to worry about holding it still while you follow through.It felt more natural than any computer pool game I've ever played. I even found it easier to line up my shots when the ""ghost ball"" aiming aid was turned off.[after 90 minutes]Still really impressed. The resolution of the Vive is a noticeable limitation on long shots. I ended up using the back of a recliner as stand-in for the table itself. With a steady bridge hand I started making shots much more often.The atmosphere is tuned really well. There's movement and noise around you enough to make you feel like you're in a bar. I would say it's like a pool hall, but the only pool noises are the ones at your table. But the atmosphere is never so loud or animated that it distracts you. They clearly put a lot of work into the setting and it paid off.I have not had jutter playing on medium quality. High was manageable, but not smooth enough for extended play in comfort. i7 6700k w/ R9 Fury			"

												This game is an absolute perfect fit for VR, with intuitive controls and an accurate physics model this is a must buy for anyone interested in pool or snooker. I played throughout the Beta of this game and the devs made constant tweaks and updates during it\'s development which is a really positive sign. In the last update they enabled proper spin/english on the cue ball so it follows natural paths off cushions along with an easy to use height adjustment hotkey. This enables players to use a real life table to lean on when taking shots just like real pool, this increases emmersion and comfort during play. There is an option to use a ghost ball if you just want to play casually but I prefer the realistic feel of playing snooker/pool at home with the guides and aids turned off.This game is multiplayer online and I would say this is probably one of the very best experiences currently available for virtual reality so far. I have made some videos on YouTube and recently included a brief review of this last update, just search Falandorn on YouTube and click my uploaded videos.With all the current options it is just impossible not to love this game and they are looking to keep developing it in future too. Wholeheartedly recommended! I was lucky enough to receive a free copy as a Beta tester but will buy this game out of principle.			"

												I played pool with some random guy that felt like he was in the same room with me. We took turns putting garbage on the table to make eachother's shots more difficult. He won, and I then I shot him in the face with the cue ball. A+Edit: Only thing I would recommend to dev is scaling the NPC's a little larger, they are just a tad small. Maybe adding one of those basketball arcade games. Amazing Game!!			"

												SportsBar VR:~~~~~~~~~~Hey guys, I know a fantastic bar where the atmosphere is great - good music, TVs everywhere to watch your favourite sports and plenty of games to play.  You can’t miss it! Put on your VR headset and it should be right in front of you! Come on in and let’s have fun at SportsBar VR.SportsBar VR is a casual / sports simulation game where you immerse yourself in a virtual bar and play a variety games, the likes of which can be found in real bars and clubs. What a cool bar we have here – there’s an old-style jukebox in the corner, several pool tables in from the bar. Oh, have a look at this! Let’s play rampball, darts, air hockey . . . what’s that? You want to play chess? Be my guest, here is a chess table and right beside it a checkers table, too. I’m off play to something else for a while. There are fun games in this venue and the most important point is that they are easy to play with the Vive controllers. I had a few turns at pool and air hockey against online opponents and I must admit it was fun. I really like the feel of pool cane - I was surprised how realistic it was; just brilliant!The rampball was ok; you have nine balls and if you reckon you’re a top baller, show us how to get nine hundred points with nine balls – I’d love to see that!  The darts game was ok, too, but I personally did not like the feel when you throw the darts; you either throw them too softly or too hard, the motion is not quite there in my opinion. I was better at throwing darts at the balloons and seeing them fly into the air! As for the air hockey, that was good too, as I mentioned above, but it took me a while to get properly used to the mallet - it could be a little bit smoother. There are also objects that you can pick up to throw at people, or even build a house of chairs, books, dominos or cans of beer. Yes, there are bottles of beer that you can smash against the wall, but I prefer to juggle with them!You’ll receive presents too; how nice is that? With these you came customize how people see you online. There is also the option to upload your own music.SportsBar is graphically polished.  The controls with the pool game are great but need to be better for the darts and the rampball in my opinion.  The atmosphere is spot on and now I can go to a bar without leaving home - safer and healthier. Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Polished Graphics-	Several games to play-	Great atmosphere-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Controls could be better in some games-	No trading cardsThe bar atmosphere is well done. Are you ready for a game of pool, darts, chess and more? Take your pick, mate - we’ll be waiting for you!6/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												I don't usually post many reviews, but I really wanted to leave a positive review of this game, because it's the most fun I've had in ages.If you own a Vive, do yourself a favour and buy this. And then play it with online multiplayer with a friend. It's just a nice combination of an actual fun game (the pool part), together with a scenario that is full of little details and can be used as a mini physics sandbox.Plus, the game is super polished and full of nice usability touches. Teleporation, summoning the cue, moving around the world - everything just works really well and slick.Highly recommended!			"

												Why haven't I reviewed this game yet? This is easily THE BEST BUY for Vive now bar none. The only way you could fail to get good value from this buy is if you hate billiards. It has online coop that works, and social people can talk, or others can just stand silently and play. They recently added in air hockey, there's a set of large dominos you can setup and tip over, and a digital dart board (that said, throwing darts in VR is anything but easy. Well, throwing them is easy, throwing them accurately...not so much).The physics on the ball are good, and supposedly if you turn off ghost ball and some other feature you unlock 'pro mode' where the ball physics are more or less perfect to real life (the only issues you'll have with ghost ball on will be trying to do backspin across half a table length or more; it won't curve durng the shot as it would IRL).English (the ball physics property, not the language) is supported, so you can safely backspin a pocket shot to recall a ball across the table or avoid pocketing the cue ball. Jump shots also exist. Oh, and the AI has many small increments. You'll find an AI opponent that fits your skill level, I promise. Seriously, out of all the paid-for games on Vive right now, the ratio of cost:fun for this game is easily #1. You will not regret this purchase.			"

												This is one of the most immersive games I have experienced in VR so far. I actually felt like I was in a bar playing pool and chatting with a real person. All of the people I played with so far were really friendly. The physics is perfect and with the haptic feedback it actually feels real when I hit the ball. You can also play darts and break bottles or chairs while waiting for your opponent to finish their shot. The AI is good and the harder difficulties provide a nice challenge. The game looks good on medium and I get a stable 90fps with my 390x. In my opinion this is one of the best VR games out right now and I highly recommend getting it if you enjoy pool.			"

There is something jaw dropping about seeing another person in the same room as you in VR, the sense of pressence is unreal. Even though you can't see their body, just controllers and headset, you know how they are positioned in your room and then... They start chucking beer bottles and chairs at your face and totally ignoring the game in front of you. It's like your internet personality meets real life. It is beautiful.			"

												 I'm a pretty amateur pool player and have on a very casual interest in real life in pool.  I mean amateur in the ""oh look I hit a ball, yay"" kind of amateur.  Yet I love this game.  It's one of the best, most full featured games on the Vive currently.  The Pool Hall itself is fully realized with loving detail to explore.  A full physics engine lets you mess around with basically anything in the environment in some cool ways.  Menus are a breeze to navigate.  Playing pool feels very natural and inuitive after only a few minutes.  I don't know if these skills I'm gaining would transfer that well back to real life, but I have a feeling at least the knowledge I'm gaining would.  At the very least, I can already feel a real sense of progression in my ability after only playing a dozen or so games of this and that feels great. Now if the developers could just find a way to make self aware AI for the sole purpose of letting me make my opponents feel shame when I beat the AI.  I want that birthday hat wearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to feel HUMILIATION when I take him down.Pros:-Great looking game with a nice hazy hool hall atmosphere; amazing in VR-Great online multilplayer.  Finding random games or inviting friends to play is a breeze and very snappy.-Great unlock system with hats, new pool tables, cues, etc.-Great inuitive controls that feel very natural-Nice assists for new pool player such as the ghost ball telling you where your ball will hit before you shoot.Cons:-Could use some sort of Single player ladder/tournament (right now just AI matches which are still a good deal more fun than you'd expect though)-Only two players per game/lobby.  It would be great to let more people hang out in a game/hall or have multiple games going on in the same space.-No Self Aware AI to make victory over robot overlords feel totally sweet. If you have a Vive this game should probably be in your library.  Even if yout have that much interest in pool. It's one of the best, most polished games on the platform right now and it's a ton of fun.			"

												Great game and lots of fun/ The multiplater system works very well (kudos for allowing AI play while waiting). Physics are pretty good. Balls do stop at pocket edge about twice as much as in reality pool (guess they need to round bevel the felt near pockets more). Once and a while we see some impossible spins (too curved). Twice I played a legitimate game and sunk the eight ball properly but the game would not end and I was forced to forfeit. These are minor complaints. This is easily the best game in VR if you even slightly like pool. Graphics are stunning. There is plenty to play around with (nearly everything is interactive). I wonder if it is possible to have multiple players playing several tables in the room? Can't wait to see how this game progresses. It is fantastic as it is.			"

												Just purchased and played this game.  After playing around with the physics in free play for a bit, and playing against the AI, I jumped into a quick match against another person.  While we did play a couple of games of 8-ball, it quickly devolved into stacking chairs onto the other pool tables, throwing darts at NPC's, and finally trying trick shots around strategically placed beer bottles.  Without realising it, almost an hour and a half had passed.So all in all, pretty much an accurate simulation of a night out shooting pool at the bar!			"

												Very fun VR experience, but would work better with 2 people. Thankfully it has online play, but is fun regardless. It features darts, air hockey and pool games. Darts is...functional at best. With no real weight to the Vive contollers, it's hard to throw consistently. Pool is the main attraction and works surprisingly well. Provided you have good tracking in your VR space, you can place shots accurately, and you can either play solo, play against the AI or online.Just remember: Don't try leaning on the pool table!			"

												Pros:Great gameplay, graphics and physics. Fantastic sense of imersionCons: Low framerate even on blurry low quality setting.Scale of objects seems about 25% smaller then real lifeBoth these issues can be fixed with patches and the Devs are already looking into the preformance issues.

												This is actually a very good showcase for VR.  I actually lost myself in the bar as I crashed my way around the table.And its also better than real life pool.  You can walk through the table to make the trickier shots if you need to.Pros - Very immesiveNice environmentGood ball physicsDarts inclusion is funCons -Can be hard to aim your shots (mainly because of focus depths).Only two pool modes (I'm not including freeplay because it has no objective) "

												This is the ultimate man cave. And the addition of adding your own music and video makes this so much more enjoyable. Pool and air hockey feel so real it's just creepy. Now if they could somehow add cross platform play so I can play my PSVR brother from across the country I'd be even more amazed.			"

												This game was a mix experience for me.  The graphics are great.  There's plenty of awesome things to do; darts, dominoes, air hockey, and obviously pool.  But alone the game quickly gets dull so you will want to play with someone. I don't know if there's just not many people playing, server issues, or just my own internet (which I doubt), but if you do ""manage"" to find someone to play with, unless they have a mic, the gameplay isn't much better.  I did request a refund, but here's why... I spent 30 min with the game my first time to find someone to play with and came across no one.  I tried again the next day and DID find someone who didn't speak my language AND he was AFK.  The game then continued to pair me up with this individual over and over, but FINALLY I found someone, but... he didn't have a mic.  We played a game of pool, threw around a couple bottles and darts, and shook hands when the game was done and went on our ways.  It was an enjoyable experience, but for the amount of time and work I had to put into finding someone versus the enjoyment I had made the game not worth it for me.  I do think the game is awesome though, it has a lot of opportunity for friends to have a good time in a virtual bar and do what ever they want, but if you don't have a friend who also has an HTC Vive, you might want to reconsider.  I really do think this game is more tailored towards players who just simply enjoy playing pool or two friends who have a Vive, just don't get your hopes up with trying to find multiplayer.			"

												A very well made game VR game, one of the few which is quite polished and well thought out. I've so far done 2 games on my own in free mode and 1 online game and it was very fun. The physics feel great, and the game was clearly well designed with the limitations of current VR room scale tech in mind. Particularly handy is the teleport function which can snap you to the edge of the table in one location, facing the table, very handy! The cue is also very well designed, there's a grip function which feels very natural for holding the cue straight as you try to hit your shot, which would be otherwise impossible without a table to lean on. Amazingly I can play this game with relative ease even in just standing mode in the tiny space of my bedroom, whereas other room scale games have me carrying my PC out to the living room for more space. Highly recommended to get with your new Vive!			"

My number one beef right now is all the screens playing videos..This seems to be huge waste of resources to me..There's way too many to begin with,and they just aren't interesting aspect of game. Also there's tons of open space (hope this fleshes out with something in future),if not once again..Wasted resources.. That said. I've enjoyed my time so far..Decent game for cost..Keep up good work!			"

SummaryGreat game for single or multiplayer to hangout and play pool (or another one of the various games)Note: I am not very good at pool in real life and have barely played any real pool Locomotion This is a room-scale game so you can walk around. They use a blink mechanic for most locomotion with a slight fade.The other option is to grab and pull the world around you (surprising if you don't know about it, very useful afterwards)ReviewI've seen this game improve over time, but will try and focus on the current state of things.The pool controls are easy to use and allow you to add spin (or ""English"" I believe?) to the ball.The AI at easy has a mix of good and bad shots, which helped me to learn.I enjoy playing it on my own against AI, with friends online, or via hotswapping the headset in person.The music is customizable but the default adds to the atmosphere and the bar itself is quite nice!Pros  Great movement options  Good atmosphere  Pretty looking environment  Fun gameplayCons  (Used to) have heat issues when on max settings  That Easy AI is sometimes an idiot savantComputer SpecsFor VR performance reference VR HMD: HTC Vive CPU: i5 6600K GPU: GTX 1080 RAM: 16GB RAM "

												Luv Luv Luv Pool Nation VR.  I totally got into this awesome pub.   It took a little while to figure how to best use the options the controllers offered, but once I got it, I was shooting a nice game of pool.  The pub has allot of game playing.  You can teleport over for a little AWESOME dart throwing,    I loved the Air Hockey table.  Totally addictive.  Did I say great graphics. WOW  There's some cool Dominos to knock over and a game I can never remember the name of.  It's like mini bowling except the balls go up into different rings to score.  The higher the ring the ball goes into the higher the score.  That was fun! There's quiet a few good looking avatars hanging out.  If one approaches me...OUCH Is there LIMO service to a VR 5 Star Hotel... :-)  I should mention there was one avatar behind the bar with a scary white face.  I thought Oh no, I hope there isn't going to be a sudden Zombie  Attack.  Phew.   It was just a little scary. bartender.  Also there's some great R&B music playing in the background. I think I was in the pub for an hour without realizing it.   Pool Nation VR Is definately at the top of My Favorites List.  Two Thumbs Up.			"

												A pretty solid VR experience with online multiplayer to boot. Although the NPCs look terrifying, the bar setting is quite enjoyable and allows the player to play pool, ski-ball, and darts. Maybe we'll get more games in the future. If psycho antisocial behavior is your thing, you can also smash bottles, pool cues, etc, over peoples' heads, so there's a little something for everyone in this game.If you own a Vive, and have any love in your heart at all for beer drinking sports, you should probably enjoy this game a lot.

												Haven't spent too long in it - 87 minutes - but it is by far the most immersive title I have played. This one is the killer title for room scale! The physics are spot on too - I'm just as pants in the game as in real life and more importantly I'm pants in excatly the same way! Hopefully this game will improve my pool skills in private :)The big suprise though is that it is in essence a bar simulator too. I really feel like I'm at a real bar!

												This is the VR game/experience I keep coming back to.I enjoy shooting pool but have never owned a table IRL, so now I can play anytime in VR! It's nice to play a game or 2 even on an open table to just relax in the evening.It's a perfectly immersive poolhall with (at time of writing) 8-ball, 9-ball, open table, darts, air hockey, and skeeball. The ball physics are good, and you can turn on cue ball spin. There's an AI player to play against, but even a low level 1 AI will sometimes run the whole table off the break and do trick shots. (I swear the AI is hustlin' me!)You can also queue to find a random live human player, and this game really shines when playing with a real person with the voice-chat on. You really get the sense of presence that you're both together in a poolhall and not in your living room (or where ever your PC is) somewhere unknown.There's an XP bar and levels for your account, leveling up unlocks cosmetics: hats, cue stick colors/types/art, and table felt art.To move around you can walk around via your roomscale space, teleport (with a sticky option to get you at the edge of the table, very handy), and grip & push/pull the world around you which is nice to get right into position.Definitely a must-have VR game for me.Worth $20, especially if you compare the cost of an evening (or 2) at a real poolhall.""What you wanna do... you wanna stoke it, don't poke it.""

												Really awesome game, playing pool feels real except you just have to remember to not lean on the table otherwise you may fall on the floor, lol.  Multiplayer is awesome too, you can see their controllers and headset and carry on a conversation while playing.  Throw bear bottles at each other if you get mad, roll the dice to see who breaks, and throw some darts.  I'm running a 980 TI video card, when you put settings on ultra you get a little motion sickness, nothing bad, but its due to frames dropping down around 50, at high and medium it's no problem as your in the 80-90 range, and the game still looks awesome.  Can't go wrong at this price, surprised they have it on sale on day 1, I would have paid 25 - 30 for this.			"

												This is probably the best VR game i've paid for. Can't attest for how accurate the physics are but everything feels pretty solid. On top of billiards, you can also explore around the bar, picking up anything you want and throwing it around, and to be honest, that's what i was excited about VR for. Barstools, bottles, books. All tossable. There are darts too, and i haven't mastered the dartboard just yet, but i can whip them at high speeds at the other patrons. "

												This is abrilliant game! If there weren't any other worthy VR games, this one would be enough to get the Vive for. Perhaps a VR killer app? :)If possible, I'd love if there was a graphics update that made everything sharper. It's currently hard to hit the ball across the table without the ghost ball option (and manual supersampling options don't apply for UE4 engine games). Other than that, a fantastic game!BTW., does anyone else also use the (height adjustable) ironing board for a fully realistic experience? :P			"

												I love me some pool, and this game is pool. The collisions feel good, the aiming is well implemented, and you can even jump the cue! All the physics, lighting, controls, and atmosphere are what more VR games to aspire to. The amount of polish put into the game is evident. For example, if you're using the pool table, the now-common teleport mechanic can snap to the edge of the pool table and automatically face you inwards, making follow up shots quick without tangling the cables. You can also make fine adjustments by moving the world around you with the grips. The AIs are pretty good (though it would be nice if they would try to sink the 9-ball early in the 9-ball game, which even the hard ones don't currently appear to do), the multiplayer works well, it's great all around.But it doesn't end with pool! There's darts, and now air hockey. I have to say, the darts feel like the gravity's been turned up, but they still seem to work well with precise automatic scoring. The game is actively being updated, and minor issues are being worked on, and new features coming out all the time.So if you like playing pool and throwing virtual bottles at your friends, get this. It's worth it, and a good example of what I want to see more of in VR in terms of games and virtual spaces.			"

Worked just fine for me!  Things seem so realistic, it fools you!!

												Pool is cool. Aesthetics are nice. Progression through cosmetics is nice. Everything is set up in a way that you dont see godrays. actual animated characters in the distance add to the immersion.But clientside positional tracking of objects such as bottles is nonexistant. Cant throw and catch a bottle for example because of how laggy it is. Cant really play around with them either because of how uncomfortable the lag of the objects makes it.But thats about my only complaint after 2 games.Recommended, especially for a pool player.			"

												Really Really enjoying this.  I play a lot of pool in real life, and this game, in my opinion is fantastic.  The spin is close to life (at least feels realistic).  Guaging the power is a little awkward at first but you soon start to get it.  All in all it feels like im playing real pool.The social aspect is very nice, sometimes the opponents can be a bit ""troll-y"" but, otherwises it good.  Having a little laugh with your opponent here and there is a nice touch.Things id like to see:- Multi-person rooms,   Theres like 20 odd tables in the room would be nice if they were in use by other people.- Ability to not have trolls interfere with the table (or make them invisible).   A way to toggle this would be nice, some times it can be fun but other times you just want the pot!- English pool tables - so slighty different shaped pockets- Cut Throat - Three Way poolReally though, fantastic game.

												Pool Nation VR, one of the most inmersive experience for virtual reality.If you like pool, you are lucky. This game is almost like playing pool in real life.Everything that surround the game itself, makes you feel like you are in a real pool bar.The way you get the cue to use it, it just feel so cool.It has many little details, to play arroundAlso has a good progression with unlockeable items and many different AI Levels.The fact that you can play against other players online is a plus plus.The Teleport to just one side of the table in stead of doing it to the floor is just great.Very Well done Game Design !!The controls are a bit strange at the begining but once you learn it, it became very easy to use.Just to mention the controls sometimes doesn\'t work properly and the one for the darts, that need to be polish.So yes, I am very surpirse for this game.Review and Gamepay in Spanish:

												Bought it months ago thinking that I would LOVE it, but hadn't had time to play until tonight. That decision cost me $20 because now that I've played it (and spent an hour trying), I wish like hell I could return it. I'm more than decent at billiards; bar table or 9ft, 8-ball or 9-ball, house cue or my own; I can run a table well enough and in this ""game"", I was lucky to sink a single shot. A large part of that is the fact that I'm hovering in space, not setting up a bridge on a real table so it's inherently unstable. The ""lock"" system would take care of that, except that there's not a stable way to get a shot setup and nothing to even assist in that such as a dampened movement system (something between the free and locked modes perhaps?). While walking around, the graphics are pretty, but that's about the only good thing I can say about this and I SO wanted to love it.Multi-player seems to be a bust too. I waited at least 30 minutes for a 9-ball game and never got an opponent.All that might have even been tollerable if I didn't have those damn ""lock"" dialogs in my face the whole time. There was a settings option to turn off hints, but that didn't remove them and there wasn't much else to tweak. The same issue made darts impossible because the dialog was between my face and the dart board.Don't waste your money. RecRoom is free and though it doesn't have billiards, it's infinitely more entertaining and has a lively crowd (sometimes too lively). Though it's graphics aren't so pretty as with Pool Nation (why the hell would you rename the game to ""SportsBar VR"" when there's no games playing on the TVs?! You guys DO realize that a sportsbar isn't where you play sports, but a bar where you watch sports right? Without alchohol and a game to watch, it's not a sportsbar and it makes finding the game impossible when looking for ""Pool Nation VR"", which is the obvious name given the ""Pool Nation"" line of games.

												Pretty disappointed here. I can't play offline because the AI just stare at the ceiling and do nothing, I've leveled up 4 times but haven't unlocked anything and nothing tells you how to, and the online connectivity is terrible-constant glitching and dropped matches make it unplayable. Wish I could get a refund but its too late :(			"

Great fun, the pool physics are excellent, graphics are good (now that they improved performance).I can run 90fps on MED settings now on my gtx 970.I recommend this game to anyone who likes pool or even if they don't, friends will.Multiplayer included is great too.Rack 'em!

												Here\'s the thing. Pool Nation VR is a cool game. It accomplishes its goal of providing and hyper realistic pool hall environment in which you can play pool, throw darts, and break beer bottles to your heart\'s content. But like, it\'s way worse than watching VR Porn. I just got my HTC Vive a week ago and a few days later I watched some VR porn and ever since then everything pales in comparison. I want to want to play Pool Nation. I want to want what it provides. Instead I mentally drift back to the sensation of having a porn star dangle her jigglies in my face and tell me how big my Johnson is. Is VR Pool well done? Yeah. But a 10/10 in VR Pool is a 2/10 in VR Porn. Facts are facts, don\'t kill the messenger. I\'d love to continue but let\'s just say I have a virtual load to blow.You could buy this game, but just know the promised land is calling you. Go to her.			"

												Read fully: I do like this game a lot but it takes some getting use to since there is no table to lean on and looking at where to hit the ball can be tricky if the game is not clear which is a problem for me. The update today hopefully addressed that issue. I have a GTX 970 video card so maybe that is the reason for not optimal visuals but VR devs need to support at least down to these cards since a lot of people have them I think. The physics in the game are pretty good also. You can do most of the tricks you do in real life in VR.Air Hockey is live now and it is fun but again there is a small learning curve since you can't actually hold the strikers. Also, today's update you should be able to use a real table (as a pool table) and set up the height so you can use it to play on when in game. I have a short video of the Air Hockey and already have a video up on Steam and YouTube of the pool play. Have fun in the bar.

Update to my review: I have a GTX 1070 and the graphics still look the same. I only get 45fps on high and ultra. When I look close at things they are very clear. Why can't they just make it so when you look from afar it is still clear? The whole bar has a blur to it. Other games can do clear so I don't understand their method of coding in this game. You may ask why I don't turn the settings to medium or low? Well because the game looks worse at those levels even though the FPS is higher.The devs just added more graphical tweaking settings to the game. Finally. A video to show you below.

												I like the concept of it and I think the controls are good.  However the game doesnt run well.  Even on the low setting (which looks) far different from the screen shots and video on the store page.  Medium and high settings both run at 45 FPS for some reason and the low setting was running at about 90 fps yet still I would just jitter when looking around at times.  I dislike the the fidelity is so poor on the low setting yet they are still rendering in the bar and lights and people int he background.  Strip that stuff out on lower settings so you can still have high frame rates and a clear looking pool table and balls.   I am running a 970gtx and have had no issues with other games on steam in VR.This was the first game in VR where I felt somewhat fatigued after trying it.  I hope they address the porformance issues and I might have a look at this again in the future.  If you want to give this a spin do so knowing you might want to decide quickly on a steam return if you have borderline VR hardware.			"

												This game is very well made compared to some other VR games on steam, but my major issue is that it just doesn't compare to playing pool in Real life. The problem lies with the simple facts there is obviously no table and moving around the table is jarring at times. Overall it lacks that genuine experience of a real pool game, i could quite easily go somewhere nearby to find a table and likely have more fun.In my eyes VR is for experiences i can't otherwise do in real life, for example shooting robots in a space station or drawing in the air. Pool is not something I believe is right for VR, there are too many things missing. That said i can understand why people would rate the game so highly.			"

Exactly wtf am I doing playing VR pool that is like an uncanny valley to simulate something trivial to do for cheap in real life? It's just not that special by design.			"

												This game promises so much but fails to deliver, due to the awkward way you have to move around the table.It looks great and is fun but it soon becomes frustrating.It would be much better if there was a decent way to turn your player around, without having to keep tying yourself in knots.Just a simple button press to do a 90 degree clockwise turn would do it.Currently theres a ""Hulk mode"", you hold both triggers and move the controllers. It's slow, imprecise and nauseating.It's such a pity because it plays lovely, when you can get into position, but all too often I find myself quitting because it just takes miles too long and is unintuitive.Another major problem is the fact that you have to choose your handedness before entering the bar.I play pool left handed and darts right handed. I can't swap over and play the other way but once in the bar your handedness is set, if you want to change you have to quit out, start again and change handedness.Like I say it's awkward and unintuitive and the devs don't help much either, simply choosing to ignore most discussion threads.In it's current form I just can't recommend it.IF the devs get these things sorted out it could be a fantastic title, but with poor controls, poor movement and poorly implemented features then it will continue to be a title I visit for 5 or 10 minutes at a time, before quitting in abject frustration!3/10I will update this review if things change for the better!Here is an update to my review.After several comments and discussions, with the developers, they have implemented changes that address almost everything I originally complained about, the main one being my complaint about rotation.This has now been sorted and makes a huge difference to the game.I just tried it from a seated position and it was working fine, will try standing when I get more time but it's much improved.It's so nice to have contact with developers who listen and act to improve things.While it's still not perfect it's much much better and as such I can now recommend it!7.5/10I will continue to update as things improve :)			"

												Virtual reality's strongest argument of the validity of its own existence. Cherry Pop Games nails it with the most immersive and social VR experience yet. The pool mechanics work VERY well. Was concerned about how it would work without having an actual table to lean on, however they solve this by implementing a sort of ""lock-on"" system to fine tune your shot. Very effective. What really makes this game shine is its one of a kind, holy-crap-this-is-the-future multiplayer. You and one other player can walk around the pool hall, play darts, throw bottles at each other, and of course... shoot some pool. What makes this experience unique is how immersive and how realistic the other player's movements translate into their avatar. I played against a total stranger. I could not get my mic to work for voice chat and I'm assuming he couldn't either, but that didn't stop us from communicating with our body language!

												Absolutely incredible. You can play pool with anyone in the world (with a Vive) and it honestly feels like you're playing pool, not a game like pool, straight up pool. Performance optimization could maybe use some work, I've been playing on low with a gtx 970 to maintain a solid 90hz and even that drops frames now and then. It looks good even on low and on ultra its seriously great (just can't keep up with the frames). If you enjoy paying pool this is a no brainer, not only is it a must buy, it's a must buy whether or not it's on sale. Just buy the game, you'll sink at least an hour in the first time you step in.

												Wow! The urge to use all sorts of expletives in describing how cool this is is very strong! Just add them yourself wherever you feel appropriate because I would sure use them if this wasn't a public forum!I love this! I never would have thought I'd like a pool game in VR, but this is just done so well! The only thing that got to me was ""reposition"" and that was just mild since I wasn't expecting it. Don't be moving your controllers when you press those buttons until you have tried it and know what you are about to do. But other than that, it's like having your own pool hall!Other than that, it's just so amazing how it all works. With being able to teleport around the room to teleport to specific positions around the table, shift from right to left hand, line up your shots, and so on, this just rocks! Extremely well done. Just no real words. It blew me away.All I can say is if you like pool at all and have a Vive, get Pool Nation! I've only played it a short while and can't wait to go back in. And who knows what things open up as you gain achievements and experience or play multiplayer. Just amazing!			"

												This is a killer app for VR, for sure.I grew up with a pool table in our basement, but it's been covered in laundry and laundry baskets for over a decade. I've had to settle for smoky bars with questionable bathrooms to get my 'shark fix. ... for the record, I'm terrible at pool, but I think it's great.If you have any interest at all in pool or VR, this game is for you. In fact, when I heard about it, before I had even purchased the Vive, I was like ""That game ... now that is a good reason to have VR."" And now it's out, and yes. It is.Yeah, you won't be leaning on the side of the pool table to set up your shots. When my roommate and I first booted the game up, I actually got on my knees and yoga'd myself into a tabletop for him to set up his shot. We quickly stopped that though, and not only because it would have been super weird if anyone walked by and looked in the window*, but because the game's clever controls negate the need for you to set your wrist on anything.In 'cue' mode, your two hands are placed naturally upon a pool cue, and squeezing the left hand trigger ""locks"" the angle and position of your stick. Then you can use your right hand to control the speed (and thus power) of your shot. It works wonderfully.You can kneel down and get a line of sight with the cue ball. You can lean all around the table. Walk around it as far as your room-scale setup allows. The teleportation handily locks onto the edge of the table if you aim at it, and always orients you so you're facing a sensible direction. Pro-tip: You can also squeeze both grips to ""pull"" the scenery around you. (This is super weird at first, but actually SUPER useful and I wish more games had this feature.)You're not limited to teleporting just around the table. No no. You have full freedom to roam the bar. The atmosphere really does capture the feeling of a poolshark-type joint, with a bunch of glowing TVs above the bar, a jukebox (which you can lift over your head like a beast, but not load your own music into, unfortunately), darts (and a dartboard to throw at), beer bottles to throw and break, and lots of other fun things to discover. The NPCs are dumb, and don't do anything at all, but entertaining to look at. Partly because they're the dumbest thing in the place.The first night my roommate and I got this we only did the 'free play' mode. We basically just traded wearing the headset every time it was the other person's turn. This worked beautifully, and allowed for lots and lots of sipping a beverage of your choice between shots. (Dev request: please enable this to run in full-screen in mirrored mode! Window is too small!) In general this worked just great. It felt like we actually walked into a bar and just started playing around with a table; there were no rules imposed whatsoever. I DO wish that it showed you which balls were already sunk, or had a basic local scorekeeping mode, but frankly it worked so well that we played for basically five hours. This is by far the most seductive VR game right now; we've easily put more hours into this in a night than anything else yet.That was yesterday. Today, then, this was the first game I booted up after work and I decided to try an online match. It was an absolute blast. I met a stranger who had played a couple more games online than me, but not many. It had this crazy effect that so far I've only experienced in BigScreen, where it really feels like the other person is there with you. I felt my body language shifting like we were both in the room. I found myself gesturing naturally and laughing a LOT. (It could have had something to do with playing with beer bottles in a vulgar way ... nah, it was just everything.)As of this writing, the VR crowd is still so selective. The few people I met when i booted up BigScreen the other night were really cool. Lots of similar interests. I love the idea of the LAN party thing, but we ended up just chilling. Pool Nation VR is even better, because you're actually sharing an activity — a fantastic activity. I almost asked for a friend request from the person I played my first game with... it was just a very natural, very fun, fantastic time. Oh yeah, and the multiplayer gameplay is great. It basically has the scoring system I wanted when I played free play for five hours. And of course you can explore the bar with your buddy and do whatever you want. You're not stuck to the table at all.As far as performance goes, I put it on Low straight away. There's a nifty FPS meter that updates on the settings screen. I have a GTX 970 and an i2500-k, and this game usually hovers in the 80-90 range with my rig. Not a solid 90, unfortunately, but the developers seem to be focusing on performance issues, so I'm hopeful it will be ironed out soon enough. In any case, it's not a dealbreaker at all.The person I was playing with had a 1080 card and he said that on the very highest settings the FPS were poor compared to most anything else he's tried, but again, the devs are looking into it.Anyway, get this game.* Yes, someone did see us playing Vive through the window the other night. They definitely wanted to come in and play. There was that look of longing. Aw, guy, come back. We'll let you play pool for a bit.			"

Would have liked it even better if I could cause some actual carnage (rip the pool table cloth, make people yell in pain after hitting them with a ball) but this is great too.			"

												Really fun game and they nailed the atmosphere of the bar.  The ball physics are great (though I feel they could up the friction a tiny bit), and love that you can jump the ball.  It\'s also really fun smashing bottles and throwing darts.  To me though, where this game really shines is the locomotion system.  You can tp anywhere on the floor, tp to a specific part of the table, AND by squeezing both triggers you can reposition the room.  I think this type of movement is INGENIOUS and could clear the way for other VR games down the road.  Well done.However, two more things...a) Level 1 difficulty my a$$, b) Mark my words, people will eat ^#&@ when they try to lean on the table.			"

												Very awesome pool game. With a room scale as big as the table it honestly does feel like you're at a bar with a friend playing some pool. Something things are still a little wonky like items flying out of walls, teleporting holding the white ball causes some grief but nothing terrible and definitely playable.Can't wait for some new features like being able to choose your own music (or play from spotify/AM/???). The darts could use a bit of an overhaul, maybe it's own menu and proper scorekeeping.Great great great game for the cost. #1 in my books. "

												Pool VR is the best game for the Vive at the moment, its the only game that does not feel like a tech demo. I have only played alone (not even a match against AI) and the first thing I tried out was the physics of hitting balls and I was little disappointed I could not put a spin on the white ball and have it bounce of the walls in different angles, however when I turned of some settings to help you aim, spinning the ball got enabled and I could hit the ball exactly like I do in real life and it was a amazing feeling how well it is translated into the game.This game is great I can only recommend it to anyone who has any interest in PoolPros++Complete pool experience+Great physics+Feels like playing the real thing (have a pool table at work) once you get used to the controls I got used to it after 1-2 games+Great environment and ambient sound that really takes you away from your room and into a bar.+Progression and unlocksCONS--Not a lot of settings, you can't tweak what happens between different graphics sets (low, medium, high, ultra) also not a lot of sound optionsFor some reason my framerate was locked to 45fps but I will investigate, I am not sure its the game that locks it there.-No sound when balls hit the walls on the pool table, I am expecting a  low *thump* sound when the ball hits the soft table cloth wall but it is not there for me. (especially the white ball)This is a reminder that I have not even played multiplayer or against AI yet and I am expecting my impression of the game to get even better! GREAT GAME!			"

												The first 30 mins for me with Pool Nation VR was really fun and interesting. Firstly, you really respect the virtual table in front of you. I had plenty of room in my office but found myself stepping around the table as the immersion I felt made me think it was unnatural to simply walk through it. The pool mechanics are fun and very easy to pick up. The dart board is a nice bonus and a lot of fun. This is a great use of the room mapping functionality and I will definitely be spending more time with it. Just make sure you have enough space for room mapping, as you\'re going to find yourself walking \'around\' the table quite a lot.			"

												This is how multiplayer in VR is meant to be.Hang out; throw some darts; throw bottles; stack chairs; just shoot the s#%t while playing some billiards. I don't think I've enjoyed playing a game with a complete stranger as much as this.If you like pool, there is no reason to not purchase this game. Probably the only VR game that's a complete game for its price and not just some ""experience"" / tech demo.The real flaw is that it could use some sort of clean-up/reset system for all the broken beer bottles. After an hour or so the physics start to lag the game. And maybe some better music on the juke box.			"

It is my most played VR game.You really feel like you are playing someone in the room because you see their headset an hands, I have played people from all over the world and had drunken converstions with most of them :)It could have been a sub standard pool game and I would still have liked it but it is top notch physics and controls, you can move the room with the grip buttons and teleport as well, it becomes second nature.Defo my must buy game and I have bought a few :)			"

												By far the most comprehensive VR experience to date. Great graphics, wonderful features. Truly immersive and fun play. However, there needs to be some important fixes in order to make this truly shine.- Graphics CHUG at high quality, even though the quality isn't all that high (even on a TITAN X)- You can cheat by taking a shot from inside or even underneath your pool table, they need to disable this. You should only be able to take shots outside of the pool table! - English, does not seem to effect physics.- Would be awesome to be able to customize or choose from a variety of 3D avatars, instead of seeing the generic visor.

												Pool Nation VR works very well. Controls wise, you hold the cue using the two touch controllers and the game feedbacks via red dot and ghost where you're gonna strike the white and where the white will strike the first ball. When you have the cue in position you pull a trigger which locks the cue, you then pull back with one hand and push forward to play the shot. While locked there is some minor adjustment available using the other trigger. Its not a simulation but its very approachable and fun.Your opponent's headset and controllers are visible as a ghost of the equipment which is neat. You can customise yourself with a hat.Also in the bar you can play darts but this is nowhere near so well thought out and polished. Almost impossible to judge aim and strength. May be with some practice but there are no assistances here.The bar looks good and is fun to explore. Managed a steady 45 fps (half of ninety I assume) on high settings from my GTX 970. Most striking difference between high and medium being reflections on the floor. The game feeds back your fps when adjusting settings, nice one! For some reason I seem to be 2 foot taller than all the NPCs. They look and move alright though. Makes me excited for the VR strip club!Hope there are more environments to play in coming, perhaps as DLC.			"

												All I can say is ""WOW""!!! I had really high hopes for this title and it definitely didn't disappoint. I genuinely felt as though I was playing a game of billiards. I even fell through the table several times as I attempted to lean on it. My only feedback is to have the people in the bar moving around and mingle a little bit. Would also like to be able to choose my own music from the jukebox. Otherwise, absolutely LOVED the game and it has immediately climbed into my top 5 list!			"

												Virtual reality's strongest argument of the validity of its own existence. Cherry Pop Games nails it with the most immersive and social VR experience yet. The pool mechanics work VERY well. Was concerned about how it would work without having an actual table to lean on, however they solve this by implementing a sort of ""lock-on"" system to fine tune your shot. Very effective. What really makes this game shine is its one of a kind, holy-crap-this-is-the-future multiplayer. You and one other player can walk around the pool hall, play darts, throw bottles at each other, and of course... shoot some pool. What makes this experience unique is how immersive and how realistic the other player's movements translate into their avatar. I played against a total stranger. I could not get my mic to work for voice chat and I'm assuming he couldn't either, but that didn't stop us from communicating with our body language! Too awesome!GET IT!Check out some gameplay here:

												Of all of the titles I have played in VR so far I think this is the ONLY one to have gotten me so immersed that I almost fell over. Hear me out, lining up a shot is nice and easy, feels great. To the point that I actually tried to lean on the table and expected it to support my weight... only there was no table there! I haven't gotten up the courage yet to attempt the multi-player but I'm hooked!			"

												Pool Nation VR works very well. Controls wise, you hold the cue using the two touch controllers and the game feedbacks via red dot and ghost where you're gonna strike the white and where the white will strike the first ball. When you have the cue in position you pull a trigger which locks the cue, you then pull back with one hand and push forward to play the shot. While locked there is some minor adjustment available using the other trigger. Its not a simulation but its very approachable and fun.Your opponent's headset and controllers are visible as a ghost of the equipment which is neat. You can customise yourself with a hat.Also in the bar you can play darts but this is nowhere near so well thought out and polished. Almost impossible to judge aim and strength. May be with some practice but there are no assistances here.The bar looks good and is fun to explore. Managed a steady 45 fps (half of ninety I assume) on high settings from my GTX 970. Most striking difference between high and medium being reflections on the floor. The game feeds back your fps when adjusting settings, nice one! For some reason I seem to be 2 foot taller than all the NPCs. They look and move alright though.

												This game is wonderful.When I saw $20 for a pool game, I thought this was going to be some JV effort to show an obvious application of VR. I wasn't aware there was a whole Pool Nation franchise, and that these folks take this game (and getting everything right) very seriously.It's amazing. Yes, this is one of the best games on the Vive at the moment, but even more than that, it's great at its primary task, which is being a pool game. It's great, great, pool.Also, this is the first VR game I've played that has realistic, simulated people. Granted, they seem to be heavily drugged people with some sort of repetitive motion disorder, but you can walk right up to them and stand beside them, and... it's a little freaky. Just like in Windlands, where your brain can't help but thinking ""Oh crap, you're not really going to jump off that huge cliff...?"" when you're standing beside a virtual person, you feel a wee tiny bit like there's someone actually there.VR is crazy and cool and I can't wait to see what's next. In the meantime, I'll be playing some pool.			"

												Fantastic.The pool gameplay is surprisinly great, it's visually gorgeus and runs without a hitch on my gtx 970 and i5-4590k.But the best part is the interaction with the other player, there's nothing quite like it.My only complaints are the fact that the dart board is apperiently not synced with the other player and lining up your queue with the white ball and simultaniously lining up the white ball with whatever you're trying to actually hit can be a bit tricky, if we could lock the queue on both hands individually rather than on both hands at the same time this would be easier.Aside from that, GET THIS GAME!

I don't think I've enjoyed playing a game with a complete stranger as much as this.If you like pool, there is no reason to not purchase this game. Probably the only VR game that's a complete game for its price and not just some ""experience"" / tech demo.The real flaw is that it could use some sort of clean-up/reset system for all the broken beer bottles. After an hour or so the physics start to lag the game. And maybe some better music on the juke box.			"

												Absolutely incredible. You can play pool with anyone in the world (with a Vive) and it honestly feels like you're playing pool, not a game like pool, straight up pool. Performance optimization could maybe use some work, I've been playing on low with a gtx 970 to maintain a solid 90hz and even that drops frames now and then. It looks good even on low and on ultra its seriously great (just can't keep up with the frames). If you enjoy paying pool this is a no brainer, not only is it a must buy, it's a must buy whether or not it's on sale. Just buy the game, you'll sink at least an hour in the first time you step in.

Just add them yourself wherever you feel appropriate because I would sure use them if this wasn't a public forum!I love this! I never would have thought I'd like a pool game in VR, but this is just done so well! The only thing that got to me was ""reposition"" and that was just mild since I wasn't expecting it. Don't be moving your controllers when you press those buttons until you have tried it and know what you are about to do. But other than that, it's like having your own pool hall!Other than that, it's just so amazing how it all works. With being able to teleport around the room to teleport to specific positions around the table, shift from right to left hand, line up your shots, and so on, this just rocks! Extremely well done. Just no real words. It blew me away.All I can say is if you like pool at all and have a Vive, get Pool Nation! I've only played it a short while and can't wait to go back in. And who knows what things open up as you gain achievements and experience or play multiplayer. Just amazing!			"

												This is a killer app for VR, for sure.I grew up with a pool table in our basement, but it's been covered in laundry and laundry baskets for over a decade. I've had to settle for smoky bars with questionable bathrooms to get my 'shark fix. ... for the record, I'm terrible at pool, but I think it's great.If you have any interest at all in pool or VR, this game is for you. In fact, when I heard about it, before I had even purchased the Vive, I was like ""That game ... now that is a good reason to have VR."" And now it's out, and yes. It is.Yeah, you won't be leaning on the side of the pool table to set up your shots. When my roommate and I first booted the game up, I actually got on my knees and yoga'd myself into a tabletop for him to set up his shot. We quickly stopped that though, and not only because it would have been super weird if anyone walked by and looked in the window*, but because the game's clever controls negate the need for you to set your wrist on anything.In 'cue' mode, your two hands are placed naturally upon a pool cue, and squeezing the left hand trigger ""locks"" the angle and position of your stick. Then you can use your right hand to control the speed (and thus power) of your shot. It works wonderfully.You can kneel down and get a line of sight with the cue ball. You can lean all around the table. Walk around it as far as your room-scale setup allows. The teleportation handily locks onto the edge of the table if you aim at it, and always orients you so you're facing a sensible direction. Pro-tip: You can also squeeze both grips to ""pull"" the scenery around you. (This is super weird at first, but actually SUPER useful and I wish more games had this feature.)You're not limited to teleporting just around the table. No no. You have full freedom to roam the bar. The atmosphere really does capture the feeling of a poolshark-type joint, with a bunch of glowing TVs above the bar, a jukebox (which you can lift over your head like a beast, but not load your own music into, unfortunately), darts (and a dartboard to throw at), beer bottles to throw and break, and lots of other fun things to discover. The NPCs are dumb, and don't do anything at all, but entertaining to look at. Partly because they're the dumbest thing in the place.The first night my roommate and I got this we only did the 'free play' mode. We basically just traded wearing the headset every time it was the other person's turn. This worked beautifully, and allowed for lots and lots of sipping a beverage of your choice between shots. (Dev request: please enable this to run in full-screen in mirrored mode! Window is too small!) In general this worked just great. It felt like we actually walked into a bar and just started playing around with a table; there were no rules imposed whatsoever. I DO wish that it showed you which balls were already sunk, or had a basic local scorekeeping mode, but frankly it worked so well that we played for basically five hours. This is by far the most seductive VR game right now; we've easily put more hours into this in a night than anything else yet.That was yesterday. Today, then, this was the first game I booted up after work and I decided to try an online match. It was an absolute blast. I met a stranger who had played a couple more games online than me, but not many. It had this crazy effect that so far I've only experienced in BigScreen, where it really feels like the other person is there with you. I felt my body language shifting like we were both in the room. I found myself gesturing naturally and laughing a LOT. (It could have had something to do with playing with beer bottles in a vulgar way ... nah, it was just everything.)As of this writing, the VR crowd is still so selective. The few people I met when i booted up BigScreen the other night were really cool. Lots of similar interests. I love the idea of the LAN party thing, but we ended up just chilling. Pool Nation VR is even better, because you're actually sharing an activity — a fantastic activity. I almost asked for a friend request from the person I played my first game with... it was just a very natural, very fun, fantastic time. Oh yeah, and the multiplayer gameplay is great. It basically has the scoring system I wanted when I played free play for five hours. And of course you can explore the bar with your buddy and do whatever you want. You're not stuck to the table at all.As far as performance goes, I put it on Low straight away. There's a nifty FPS meter that updates on the settings screen. I have a GTX 970 and an i2500-k, and this game usually hovers in the 80-90 range with my rig. Not a solid 90, unfortunately, but the developers seem to be focusing on performance issues, so I'm hopeful it will be ironed out soon enough. In any case, it's not a dealbreaker at all.The person I was playing with had a 1080 card and he said that on the very highest settings the FPS were poor compared to most anything else he's tried, but again, the devs are looking into it.Anyway, get this game.* Yes, someone did see us playing Vive through the window the other night. They definitely wanted to come in and play. There was that look of longing. Aw, guy, come back. We'll let you play pool for a bit.			"

												Pool VR is the best game for the Vive at the moment, its the only game that does not feel like a tech demo. I have only played alone (not even a match against AI) and the first thing I tried out was the physics of hitting balls and I was little disappointed I could not put a spin on the white ball and have it bounce of the walls in different angles, however when I turned of some settings to help you aim, spinning the ball got enabled and I could hit the ball exactly like I do in real life and it was a amazing feeling how well it is translated into the game.This game is great I can only recommend it to anyone who has any interest in PoolPros++Complete pool experience+Great physics+Feels like playing the real thing (have a pool table at work) once you get used to the controls I got used to it after 1-2 games+Great environment and ambient sound that really takes you away from your room and into a bar.+Progression and unlocksCONS--Not a lot of settings, you can't tweak what happens between different graphics sets (low, medium, high, ultra) also not a lot of sound optionsFor some reason my framerate was locked to 45fps but I will investigate, I am not sure its the game that locks it there.-No sound when balls hit the walls on the pool table, I am expecting a  low *thump* sound when the ball hits the soft table cloth wall but it is not there for me. (especially the white ball)This is a reminder that I have not even played multiplayer or against AI yet and I am expecting my impression of the game to get even better! GREAT GAME!			"

												Very awesome pool game. With a room scale as big as the table it honestly does feel like you're at a bar with a friend playing some pool. Something things are still a little wonky like items flying out of walls, teleporting holding the white ball causes some grief but nothing terrible and definitely playable.Can't wait for some new features like being able to choose your own music (or play from spotify/AM/???). The darts could use a bit of an overhaul, maybe it's own menu and proper scorekeeping.Great great great game for the cost. #1 in my books. "

												Might be the most polished vr game currently (other than the lab, which really is bunch of demos). Great pool physics and effortless control of hitting the cue ball as well as getting around the table to take a shot. Graphics look really nice even on low, which I prefer so I can supersample (in the actual game menu) to 2.0 with my 1070. The pool hall looks really cool to just move around in.

												Just buy pool nation, host a match, you have to wait a couple of minutes to wait for a game and you are playing. You can chat away while you play like a real pool game, you find yourself having conversations while you play because of the nature of pool! no pressing buttons to talk and you can mute everything if you cant be bothered. It is my most played VR game.You really feel like you are playing someone in the room because you see their headset an hands, I have played people from all over the world and had drunken converstions with most of them :)It could have been a sub standard pool game and I would still have liked it but it is top notch physics and controls, you can move the room with the grip buttons and teleport as well, it becomes second nature.Defo my must buy game and I have bought a few :)			"

Controls are super tight, and is an overall it's just a fantastic translation of real pool into VR; even down the to atmosphere of the bar you're playing in.Online play is incredibly fun as well; you see the headset and controllers of the person you're playing against, allowing for really special body-language expression to come through. (You can see a player hold and shake his head as he misses a clutch shot, or clap to congratulate you on a win, etc etc).Highly recommended!			"

												Wow! The urge to use all sorts of expletives in describing how cool this is is very strong! Just add them yourself wherever you feel appropriate because I would sure use them if this wasn't a public forum!I love this! I never would have thought I'd like a pool game in VR, but this is just done so well! The only thing that got to me was ""reposition"" and that was just mild since I wasn't expecting it. Don't be moving your controllers when you press those buttons until you have tried it and know what you are about to do. But other than that, it's like having your own pool hall!Other than that, it's just so amazing how it all works. With being able to teleport around the room to teleport to specific positions around the table, shift from right to left hand, line up your shots, and so on, this just rocks! Extremely well done. Just no real words. It blew me away.All I can say is if you like pool at all and have a Vive, get Pool Nation! I've only played it a short while and can't wait to go back in. And who knows what things open up as you gain achievements and experience or play multiplayer. Just amazing!			"

												One of the must have games for VR! The chaperone adjustment takes a little time to get used to, but apart from that the game mechanics work flawlessly.It looks really good, I'd say it's probably one of the best looking VR games I've played so far.But what really stands out for me is the multiplayer option. That's what differentiates the game from so many other vr games. It's one of the things I looked forward to since the day I got my vive. Interacting with other people around the world through virtual reality. It's why I liked Altspace, CloudWorlds Minigolf and now Pool Nation. VR is just so much more fun if you can share it with other people.			"

												This is the type of polish VR owners have been waiting for!It is pool, pure and simple. I enjoy pool in real life, but in VR you have to advantage of always finding opponents to play with and you don't have to insert money for every game like in a pub It provides AI opponents for challenge, but the most fun lies in multiplayerIt's a very social expereiecne playing 1v1 match making. VR makes multiplayer gaming much more social and authentic. Add that to an already social pub game and you have a smash hit that you can play for hours Also, somthing cool you can do is, if you have a table nearby, is adjust the virtual table in game to the hight of the real life table for added authenticity. Just a cool touch that shows the polish  Looking forward to what this game will bring in the future This might be the game to actually forge a pool nationcheers :)   "

												This is a killer app for VR, for sure.I grew up with a pool table in our basement, but it's been covered in laundry and laundry baskets for over a decade. I've had to settle for smoky bars with questionable bathrooms to get my 'shark fix. ... for the record, I'm terrible at pool, but I think it's great.If you have any interest at all in pool or VR, this game is for you. In fact, when I heard about it, before I had even purchased the Vive, I was like ""That game ... now that is a good reason to have VR."" And now it's out, and yes. It is.Yeah, you won't be leaning on the side of the pool table to set up your shots. When my roommate and I first booted the game up, I actually got on my knees and yoga'd myself into a tabletop for him to set up his shot. We quickly stopped that though, and not only because it would have been super weird if anyone walked by and looked in the window*, but because the game's clever controls negate the need for you to set your wrist on anything.In 'cue' mode, your two hands are placed naturally upon a pool cue, and squeezing the left hand trigger ""locks"" the angle and position of your stick. Then you can use your right hand to control the speed (and thus power) of your shot. It works wonderfully.You can kneel down and get a line of sight with the cue ball. You can lean all around the table. Walk around it as far as your room-scale setup allows. The teleportation handily locks onto the edge of the table if you aim at it, and always orients you so you're facing a sensible direction. Pro-tip: You can also squeeze both grips to ""pull"" the scenery around you. (This is super weird at first, but actually SUPER useful and I wish more games had this feature.)You're not limited to teleporting just around the table. No no. You have full freedom to roam the bar. The atmosphere really does capture the feeling of a poolshark-type joint, with a bunch of glowing TVs above the bar, a jukebox (which you can lift over your head like a beast, but not load your own music into, unfortunately), darts (and a dartboard to throw at), beer bottles to throw and break, and lots of other fun things to discover. The NPCs are dumb, and don't do anything at all, but entertaining to look at. Partly because they're the dumbest thing in the place.The first night my roommate and I got this we only did the 'free play' mode. We basically just traded wearing the headset every time it was the other person's turn. This worked beautifully, and allowed for lots and lots of sipping a beverage of your choice between shots. (Dev request: please enable this to run in full-screen in mirrored mode! Window is too small!) In general this worked just great. It felt like we actually walked into a bar and just started playing around with a table; there were no rules imposed whatsoever. I DO wish that it showed you which balls were already sunk, or had a basic local scorekeeping mode, but frankly it worked so well that we played for basically five hours. This is by far the most seductive VR game right now; we've easily put more hours into this in a night than anything else yet.That was yesterday. Today, then, this was the first game I booted up after work and I decided to try an online match. It was an absolute blast. I met a stranger who had played a couple more games online than me, but not many. It had this crazy effect that so far I've only experienced in BigScreen, where it really feels like the other person is there with you. I felt my body language shifting like we were both in the room. I found myself gesturing naturally and laughing a LOT. (It could have had something to do with playing with beer bottles in a vulgar way ... nah, it was just everything.)As of this writing, the VR crowd is still so selective. The few people I met when i booted up BigScreen the other night were really cool. Lots of similar interests. I love the idea of the LAN party thing, but we ended up just chilling. Pool Nation VR is even better, because you're actually sharing an activity — a fantastic activity. I almost asked for a friend request from the person I played my first game with... it was just a very natural, very fun, fantastic time. Oh yeah, and the multiplayer gameplay is great. It basically has the scoring system I wanted when I played free play for five hours. And of course you can explore the bar with your buddy and do whatever you want. You're not stuck to the table at all.As far as performance goes, I put it on Low straight away. There's a nifty FPS meter that updates on the settings screen. I have a GTX 970 and an i2500-k, and this game usually hovers in the 80-90 range with my rig. Not a solid 90, unfortunately, but the developers seem to be focusing on performance issues, so I'm hopeful it will be ironed out soon enough. In any case, it's not a dealbreaker at all.The person I was playing with had a 1080 card and he said that on the very highest settings the FPS were poor compared to most anything else he's tried, but again, the devs are looking into it.Anyway, get this game.* Yes, someone did see us playing Vive through the window the other night. They definitely wanted to come in and play. There was that look of longing. Aw, guy, come back. We'll let you play pool for a bit.			"

												Well, it isn't that often that I write reviews here on steam, but this games really deservers it, i would rate it 10 out of 10, really.I got my Vive a few days ago, and after seeing this on sale I decided to buy it, it isn't pricey and  for sure worth it.After playing about an hour, all I can say, that this game is amazing with a VIVE. Forget all other games, you'll only need this one to truly into VR. It feels like the real thing, Controls are very well done, graphics are great, a bit demanding though. Im running on a 980ti with a 4790k and have to set the graphics to medium or high. Medium is fine, High stutters somewhat, Ultra isn't usable with about 40 frames per second. I would apprecciate if the developers could tweak the engine somewhat more, because it look awsome in ultra and the immersion it the best I've ever seen on my Vive (or even the Rift)This game is a masterpiece for Roomscale VR, it's a must have. I won't say it's a system seller, as pool isn't for everyone, but it's very near that.I feel so much like in a bar playing pool billard, that I often tried to lean on the table, be carefull, you'll fall over onto your nose ;)Sound is good, physics seem very realistic, though the AI is a little bit too good, even at lowest setting it's very hard to beat them.Haven't tried multiplayer yet, I'm satisfied with singleplayer until now. Maybe I'll try multiplayer later, but I hate starting a game and then having to leave it because of real world things, same for the oppenent.If you've got a VIVE and you like Pool Billiard, or want to get a game, that truly makes a use of Roomscale VR, the Controllers and all the stuffe, that makes a VIVE, this is four you!Really, this is 10/10			"

												TL;DR-This game is my favorite multiplayer experience and is the only game so far to make me forget I'm wearing a headset.I've seen a few threads about it already, but I wanted to make my own in hopes of persuading anyone still on the fence about it. The more people in multiplayer, the better.I loaded up the game not expecting much. It's a billiards simulator, how great could it be? Luckily, it was not what I was expecting, as I was smiling pretty much the whole time. The billiards hall is pretty big and you can teleport almost everywhere. The hall itself has more activities than pool, such as darts, dominoes, and breaking bottles. You could also try flirting with some of the ai's, but I guess I wasn't their type, as they just ignored me.After messing around with the various activities scattered about the hall, I decided to dive into the meat of things, the billiards table. Due to haptic feedback, hitting the cue ball feels great and breaking is just as satisfying as in real life. Walking around the table felt so natural! You can teleport to any part of the tale by clicking the edge or, by using your side triggers, you can push and pull your play space. Luckily, my play space is 4mx3m, so once I had the table centered, I could walk all around it without having to worry about my chaperone bounds. This greatly added to my immersion. At one point I actually began to lean on the table while taking a break, but caught myself before I fell. This is the first game that's made me forget I was wearing a headset.Once I got comfortable with the table controls, I decided to hop online. It was late here in California, so I wasn't sure if anyone else would be online. I joined an empty room and went back to messing around with bottles and chairs. After a few minutes I hear a noise behind me. ""Hey man, what's up?"" I turn around and there's a pair of floating controllers and a vive headset. I wave at him and he waves back at me. ""Here, have a drink!"" I reply, as I place one of the bottles I had spawned in front of him. We both laugh and start shooting some pool. I talk to him while we play and it turns out he's from New York and just like me, he's been staying up very late ever since getting his Vive. Halfway though the game we start messing around with putting bottles and chairs on the table. It doesn't affect the balls, but the balls will push the furniture around, so it's pretty entertaining to see. At some point I see my opponent wander over to one of the dart board. I follow him and we play a few round of darts, after which we go back to the table and finish our game. I won, we said good game, and with that, he waved and vanished.This whole thing was such a great experience. It really feels like your playing with someone in the same room. I can't wait to play some more and get some unlockables. All in all, Pool Nations VR was such an awesome experience. It's definitely a game I'll be adding to my Vive demos when people are over.			"

												This game is truly incredible. Really what VR is all about. Gameplay feel real, only missing something to lean on (I did not fall though). Play about 10 games in multiplayer, experience was flawless for me. It was amazing just trying to communicate hapiness or frustation with your hand and controller.I have a GTX 980 Ti and did not fell any particular lag. The screen door effect is pretty apparent espicially for afar. It's making it hard to complete long shot.A must have if you enjoy pool even a little. Recommended 5/7.			"

												This is the best VR experience hands down!  Pool physics are right on!  I do, however have a few suggestions that I think would make the game better:Absolutely Needed:----------------------------1) Implement varying rulesets, or allow customization of the rules (ie: in US 8-ball, non-break fouls result in ball-in-hand only behind the head string, and the target must be on the opposite side of the head string)2) The ""locking"" system really needs to use both triggers.  The trigger on the bridge hand should lock in the contact point on the cue ball, but leave the grip hand free to adjust the shooting angle without losing your desired contact point on the cue ball.  The trigger on the grip hand should lock in the shooting angle.""Nice To Have""-----------------------------1) Make the ""dummies"" more reactive to what's going on around them.  Make them duck or yell ""ow"" or something if you throw objects at them.  2) I haven't checked to see if this exists, but the ability to import your own music or load an internet radio stream into the jukebox would be nice.3) Darts is kinda weird-feeling, not the fault of the developers, but rather the difference between how you hold a dart vs how you hold the Vive controllers.  Maybe add something else like Air Hockey or Foosball?4) Implement Cutthroat (a 3-player pool game)			"

												Definitely the kind of game for people who love the sports bar setting and have some extra cash to spend, but personally, I think that this game is a little expensive for what you are getting. Don't get me wrong, the presentation is amazing and I can tell that a lot of effort was put into making the game look great and for the game to play out fluently. The main problem I have with it is that many of these games (and sports bars in general) are supposed to cater to the lazy type (like myself) but in the absence of actual tables and chairs, your emersion is broken as soon as you tire out. What breaks your emersion further is these creepy low resolution CGI humans, who just waddle around with blank expressions. Meanwhile, the ACTUAL humans who you play with online are just floating hats without bodies or faces. I can’t tell which is creapier.Only giving it a thumbs up because there is no in-between rating and I don't have the heart to thumbs down something that brims with such effort.			"

												The game at its current state would be worth buying at a sale.I'm saying this because on one hand the client itself is done right. Everything works smoothly and is responsive, graphics are nice, physics are amazing for each game, and the bot ai is also challenging.On the other hand, the server side, the multiplayer side, is not on the same level at all. When it rarely works well its great and can lead to some very unique and fun situations. But most often players (if you find any) will disconnect every few minutes, everything lags and jumps around, air hockey is just unplayable, so is the ramp ball... very poor performance reported by me and any player i interacted with. I tried addressing this in the discussion boards but devs are not responding.TL;DR;Game is great as a single player experience, average to bad as a multiplayer experience due to technical issues.

												Not only is this the best pool game for VR right now, but I am happy to see that the game gets regular updates.  I got this game back when it was ""PoolNation VR"", and it's seen a lot of changes since then.  The only downside is that it does seem impossible to get a a game going from the lobby currently, but I like playing solo vs the AI anyway.  I didn't get the game to play with strangers, I just wanted to feel like I'm playing pool.   And even the easiest AI is a pretty tough player, but the AI's difficulty is adjustable.  I'd say it is very likely I've put more hours into this game than any of my other VR games.  And they just added a custom playlist to the jukebox!  So there will continue to be many, many more hours into this game for me.  It was definitely worth the price as far as I'm concerned.			"

												This is a pretty excellent multiplayer experience.  While the pool is by far the most developed, the other games are getting there.  Darts needs some work.  Skiball is always fun.  I look forward to what they do next!			"

												I really liked this game when it was just the best pool game out there, but the devs have added so much more that they even had to change the name to reflect this. I'm happy to support devs who constantly update their product in EA. Great game, and the physcis feel good for a game where you get no real haptic feedback. "

												I didn't play this for a long time as the cueing action was too basic. You couldn't move your planted front hand after first fixing it. Which meant it was fun for a bit but then frustrating and relied too much on getting lucky. I'm delighted to see they've solved this and I've just had a great game. The pool physics are fantastic. With all the other additions this is one VR game that is certainly worth the price.			"

												Almost fell over because I tried to lean on the virtual pool table. 10/10 would stumble again!Honestly though, the game feels and looks pretty great. Amongst the sea of early access and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥""VR Demos"", this is a refreshing change. This is a SportsBar I'd visit.			"

												If you have a Vive/Rift this is a MUST have.The polish is there and the gameplay is great, but the social interaction with others really sells it for me. I can't say enough good things about it.I joined up one time to play pool and me and this total stranger just started hanging out and would randomly trash the bar laughing our butts off the entire time. By far one of the most fun games I have played on the Vive and I would recommend it to everyone.			"

												Shuffleboard, Air Hockey, Darts, Skeeball, Checkers, Chess, Billiards, and just random dicking about. (the place really needs to implement real physics pinball machines) The games all play damn near perfectly, (air hocky in particular feels almost exactly like in real life) though something seems wonky with my perspective in billards. I'm not an ace player on anything, but something about the perspective CONSTANTLY throws off my aim for every shot.I still have yet to meet any real players though. I'll try inviting a friend through steam and I'll update this review once I see how that works.			"

												The environment and atmosphere of this game is excellent.  The experience feels like you are walking into your own bar without smelling like a lot of cheap booze, the feeling of sticky floors, and coming out with clothes reaking of dirty smoke. The pool, airhockey, and table shuffleboard games are very good as far as realism and physics, darts seemed ok, other games like skeeball are not very realistic at all.  Skeeball tables I found very disappointing.  They feel too high and don't feel like the floorbase ones you find in most arcade centers.   There was something about the ball movement that did not feel like it had the right roll as far as weight, gravity, and speed.  It also did not feel like it had the right pop you feel with a wooden ball when it goes into the air and then bounces around.I understand this simulator is best for its pool table simulation and not the other games that are included.  I refunded the game because I felt the game was too empty being a single player.  The game felt hard to come back to for replayability.  I didn't see many people online to play multiplayer and I felt very bored after awhile walking around an empty bar.   This will be a great simulation if more people can be found playing.  There is an area in the game where alot of AI are standing about but, I didn't find a way to play single player against AI, other than shooting pool by myself.  I recommend this game if you want to shoot pool with some friends and they are willing to join and play with you.  If you are single player and looking for others to play, you will get bored rather quickly.  The other games included (other than the pool) don't feel as refined to real world physics as the pool simulation does.   Hopefully they will improve the physics to make the other games included feel just as real.  I will definatley keep my eye out to play this game in the future as it improves. "

												Best VR Pool game so far.  Multiplayer hangouts with all the minigames.  I think I would class this game as ""essential"".  Graphics are great, the multiplayer is nearly bug free.  I would like a global leader board, big competitions and a snooker table as well please :)Just get this game, come and play me!			"

												This game was formerly  called PoolNation VR and it has come along way with more things to do now. You can play around at the bar, play pool, air hockey, , skee ball, darts, chess, , juke box, shuttle board. Multiplayer works well, although I found that if you join a multiplayer game I could not hear any music or bar chatter. Still, it  is entertaining and good quality. I did a multiplayer review here:
