												Simple. Fun.  I'm a retired hockey goalie.  When on ""Bullet"" mode it felt like I was playing again.			"

												Being a former Hockey Goalie, this game pretty much simulates what it is like to be in net's. This could be a huge game changer for sport training/practice, athletes could practice at anytime in their own home! fantastic A++++.Great for cardio too ;).			"

												Good for short bouts of occasional exertion and to test your reflexes. Use your marshmallow hands to block the incoming footballs. A few game modes to mix it up but fundamentally the same objective. Price is okay. It's not much to pay, but there are free VR titles which offer an equal or more content than GoalkeepVr.			"

												I quite enjoy the game, but I wish the developer would add an 'old man (55+) easy' setting;  both a bit slower and the ability to shrink the height/width of the net, particularly the bending over - perhaps the balls coming in no lower than the knees.			"
