												Bought the game for the hell of it since it was 5 bucks - No graphics options but graphics are ok.Gameplay is more like the classic duck hunter from Nintendo in the 80's. You have a time limit to kill the animals in question and are deducted points if you shoot things you shouldn't. If that's your type of game then you will like it otherwise it won't hold your attention long.			"

												So far terrible!  I purchased the game did not expect much for 5.00 but there is no volume in the game all other files have volume, turned up volume in setting and on computer.  Tried to play game without volume and now it says I have no lives?/ ?  Do not waste your time or money.  Steam support refers me to raylight games I emailed them and no response!			"

			the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/328670		

1st off there are few to no option and there was a cash shop in here that no longer works.2nd yes i'm against real life big game hunting (outside population control hunting like deer) but this is a game.This is a ""light-gun"" type clicker game where you click to shoot instead of using a gun.As you kill random animals (no doe's though) some will drop power-ups or health.Animals including but not limited to dear, rabbit, squirrel, moose, wolf, duck, mountain lions and many more.The 5th level is a extinct Jurassic animal.You will have 2 weapons depending on the mission like shotguns, rifles some have scopes (you can zoom in), pistols, bows, or tracking darts.Mission consist of kill X of Y animal, kill X of Y animal with a vital hit, don't hit any does, kill X of Y animal with range shots, tag X of Y animal, kill the dino, and yes they are all timed.After each level you can upgrade some 1 of 4 skills, precision, reload time, heart rate, & health but i feel health should be a priority as the games not hard enough that you'll need the others as much.If you die (only a issue on the dino's) its game over and you need to reset the game or close it before it saves.You could buy more lives in the cash shop but its closed so now it's only possible to have 1 life per game.

												If you are looking for a shooting gallery kind of game on the PC then give Deer Hunt a try. It does a pretty good job even though it's a bit dated and on the easy side. If you are looking for more than that, you aren't going to find it here.

			Grab your guns and dawn your camo, it's hunting time. Take on different challenges in 4 locations around the world in this shooting gallery style arcade game.

												Extremely simple but fun.  You have a time limit to shoot things and are penalized for things you shouldn't have shot.  Pros: - the mechanics are fun, the murdering is satisfying- everything seems to work- graphics are decent- has multiplayer!Cons:- overly simple- UI imperfections, sloppiness- no online leaderboards yet, I think that would be an essential thing to add			"
