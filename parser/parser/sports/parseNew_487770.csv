												This game reminds me of those token-sucking arcade basketball machines. I can see VR games like this inevitably replacing those machines. Like's:- The game modes are fairly fun. All easy to pick up and start playing.- Physics are very well done. Things like velocity, arc, and release all translate really well.- Love the little ""enter initials"" game. Nice touch!- You actually get a pretty decent workout!- This game is everything Wii Sports wished it could be.- I have a new go-to for demoing the Vive.Dislike's:- No music- Needs more difficulties - ""Garbage"" mode is a bit glitchy. Items disappear mid-throw.- When the ball is on fire, it's a bit distracting and screws up your aim.- I wish the controller models were hand models instead.Here's some of my gameplay!

												Only basketball game available. It is well done and plenty of room for additions. I hope you have high ceilings.Would like to see an accurate display of the collision instead of vive controllers to make it easier to do tricks outside of the normal gameplay. Not sure if this is just some effect of VR or a game problem but the balls feel ""heavier"" than they should to me. I feel like I'm putting in a lot more effort than I would IRL.In Garbage mode, all the food based assets seems to LOD out and vanish about 3 feet from the camera but they still count if the invisible fruit makes it in. Not sure if this is some sort of blind shot feature to prevent correction or a bug.			"

												This is the first basketball game for the Vive and it is a ton of fun. Think of it as one of those basketball arcade games but on steroids. Graphics/sounds/phyics are all very well done. Unlike a lot of other early access games this does have a global/friends leader board which is nice to see.Some things that can be improved upon or added - After hitting 3 shots consecutively the flames on the ball can be very distracting and make the follow up shots that more difficult. If anything maybe it would be good to have the flame shots worth a extra point. The time remaining should following you around instead of having to find it in the arena.The developers are off to a great start. I'm looking forward to see where they take this one.			"

												I am very pleased with this game.  It's one of those games that the screen shots don't do justice to at all.  Being on the platform and shooting feels really good, and the idea, while simple, has been done in a pretty neat way.  Don't fall off the ledge!			"

												Firstly, this does not feel like shooting hoops does in real life - without the weight of a basketball or the use of two hands to grip one ball it feels and behaves completely different, and it's physics feel very different to a basketball. One of the first things I noticed was that the hoops were all quite low (many of them even spawn below you), but this is really necessary due to the way physics behave without the weight of a basketball or proper throwing technique.Having said that, it's still a lot of fun, and I don't regret buying this for a second. If you want to throw balls into hoops, or garbage into bins, or paper planes into hoops I'd recommend it - it's fairly well polished and makes for a good distraction for a while.Disclaimer: I suck at basketball in real life and probably don't know what I'm talking about here.

												Really fun and addicting. Just picked it up and started playing, next thing I knew I've been going at it for over an hour and I'm dripping in sweat lol. Pros:-Addicting-Simple yet kept my interest for an hour straight (didn't even move past easy yet)-Scoreboard is nice (Reason why I didn't go past easy yet is because I wanted the high score first!)-Controls are very simple-Small, almost meaningless feature...but I really like how you can dribble the ball and try for bounce shots or just volleyball spike it for fun!Cons:-Lack of music. Sure I can play my own music, but a nice tune in the background would be nice! I think I could get even more into it if there was.-I dislike how a hoop can come up right in front of another and block your shot. It almost punishes you for scoring too quickly-The fire from the ball can block your vision a bit. Would be nice to see it tuned down a bit (Though I love how the ball lights on fire. Reminds me of NBA Street lol)That's really all the cons I got. Fun game, worth the $9-10. Simple yet addicting and fun!			"

												It's okay. There isn't much too it. Like people have said, the feeling is different since you dont have any weight to the basketballs. Also, it's more of a mini game. There isn't much to do as it gets repeatative. I whish there were maps, or actually at a basketball court. But it's fun, or at least a little fun with friends.			"

												One of the recent updates broke my game. The first couple times I played, it worked great. Fun and difficult, but enjoyable. Now, the ball doesn't stay connected to my ""hand"" as I attempt to throw it. The ball sticks where it is spawned. It can still be thrown, but doesn't follow your hand, so it's super frustrating to get it to go where you want. This is literally unplayable right now (no sarcasm intended). Please fix this for Vive users.			"

												Very interesting game, but personally I just can't get used to basketball without the weight of the ball. Beyond that, 4 game modes, easy, hard (smaller nets), trash (random shaped trash into trash cans) and planes (paper airplanes through hoops). After 3 baskets in a row, objects become flaming, which is kind of neat but ultimately just distracting. In paper airplane, aiming it is very annoying because they are so large it takes up half the field of view. All modes are timed, which I dislike as well, would be nice to just free play to practice the mechanics, but ultimately nothing really making me want to go back.			"

												This game is outstanding -- I cannot stop playing.  The game is simple but the environment is classic arcade and the physics are on point.  I'd love a few more game types (maybe realtime versus multiplayer or a ""longshot"" challenge/waves where the hoops get progressively further away, etc.), but I'd pay 5 times the price at the moment.  I'll be playing this for years.			"

												Better than I expected, and something that I certainly will be playing again with friends to challenge each others scores.  Actually quite a decent fun VR 'arcade' game.  Obviously it's not a deep strategy game that you're going to spend 100s of hours playing, but it does a good job of being what it is.Physics seem good; bounces, angles, and gravity all seeme to behave. Trash and paper airplanes are okay, but I can't see myself going back to play them much.  The hoops on the other hand - will be played - esp, if friends beat my scores.  Which bring up something missing... challenges.  Leader boards are one thing, and having friends challenge for scores is also good.  But, I think the addition of some unlocks for beating scores would certainly add to the solo-play longevity of the game.   Obvious ideas for unlocks would be different balls, wrist bands, controller models, ... lots of possibilties there, I think.  Devs?? :-)Overall - thumbs up for a fun, but not deep, basketball shooting game.  As mentioned in other reviews - if you enjoy arcade basketball (the real one, not digital), then you'll probably like this too.   "

Either way, the price is a little high considering the amount of content, but it's low enough to keep my recommendation.  :)			"

Whether it's thowing paper airplanes through hoops, garbage in trash cans or practing your jump shot, this game leaves you teetering on the edge of frustration and jubilation. Two player mode would be awesome so you could go one-on-one with other top scorers.  Hoops VR is definitely worth a shot. <Rimshot>			"

Or have you ever wanted to feel like one of those trick shot guys without wanting to edit highlight videos all day? Then this game is for you. I straight up played this game for so long I couldn't lift my arms. I'm writing this review with my nose! The game is fun, simple and challenging enough to make you cry while starting again to break your last score. Definitely worth the money.
