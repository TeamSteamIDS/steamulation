												An alright endless runner, but the obstacle randomization is garbage and makes it impossible not to hit something most of the time. Also, at this time, the game is partially broken. Select the stage, hit the trophy icon up top, then the red restart button to make it work properly.Side note, when you lose a stage, hit the back arrow or escape. The red button resets all progress and treats it like a new game. Also. stage 10 is nearly impssible due to the aforementioned rqndomized obstacles, but people have done it.Only pro is the management system. Hitting birds lowers you gift count/progress, hitting ground obstcles takes away life. More times than necessarty, you are gonna have to decide which is more important in that run. Sometimes, it doen't even matter at all. Much like life...			"

- Very low in content, every level is exactly the same, you just speed up slightly on each stage.- The gameplay is extremely simplistic, consisting mainly of pressing the up arrow to jump to avoid obstacles while your Snowman auto-scrolls across- Music that slowly sucks out your soul- In my personal opinion, this is a classic case of Russian shovelware being dumped onto steam. It was greenlit within 2 weeks (who would vote yes to this?), and then got on steam with 30+ positive reviews almost entirely from Russians (paid reviews?)   No one in their right mind should give this game a positive review.- Reminds me of something you would see on a free flash site for toddlersTL:DR  This is garbage			"

												0/10Worst mobile phone port ever. Greenlit by vote boosting... GG Russians.I was told it was a quick 9 achievements. After I bought the game, and found that the only way to get it to start a level, was to use a player found workaround, then finding no saves for the game, (just lose a ll progress if you quit the game or lose a level), and THEN being told that the only way to get the quick achievements was to use SAM...Played (ior tried to play) for 5 minutes. Refunded right after. Worst decision ever- buying this game.Second worst decision ever- playing (or trying to play it).Best decision ever- refunding right after I hit the 6 minute mark.Not worth installing, even if you got it free somehow. Don't waste your money or time. Especially your time.			"

												Easily the worst game I have played on Steam. Pretty sad when even the menu to select a level doesn't work properly.			"

												Hawai music in a winter themed game.Everything is randomly placed, this means there are often moments you can't dodge without getting hit.The movement and hitbox are very odd.Really repetitive.Can't take a screenshot, when I press F12 it opens the google chrome console window, only have this problem with this game.

												Snowman is a 2D sidescrolling game where you have to collect presents and jump over the hazards coming towards you on the ground. It is also one of the worst games on Steam.To even start playing it you have to click on a trophy icon from the main menu and then reset the game. If you don't do this first, the level select screen just won't respond. Once you actually get in to the level you'll likely find that the music track has decided to duplicate and play itself two, three, or even four times over creating a cacophony of sound so offputting that you have to mute the game (something you have to do from your OS, because this game offers absolutely no options menu).Once you start playing, you'll immediately regret that decision, as this game is something straight out of 2001-era flash gaming, except somehow with less content and worse graphics. Comically awful hitboxes make the game range from frustrating to downright impossible, with there being several patterns in the final level that are guaranteed damage, and about half of the appearances of birds in all levels impossible to avoid, meaning you have a coinflip chance of losing progress whenever one shows up.There's two ""power-ups"", both of which seem to make the game more annoying - one is a guitar that gives you +5 presents but causes a giant popup to appear covering half of the screen and making it impossible to see what's coming, and the other is a rocket boost which makes you go significantly faster, but significantly extends the length of your jump, meaning that every time you press the up arrow you're committing to having to land 2-3 screens further than you can actually see, and if something spawns there your abysmal lateral speed means you take damage.Forget paying a dollar for this, I wouldn't play more of it if the developer was the one paying me.

												What a garbage ""Game"".  I wanted to take screenshots to show how bad it is but hitting F12 opens up the developer console lol, what a joke.  The game doesn't even work.  I can't play the first level.  If you go to the high score screen at the start all you see is NAN: NAN: NAN: NAN.  For any non computer programmers out there, NAN stands  for ""Not A Number"", which is usually what you get when you divide by zero in computer code, which the developer of this game seems oblivious to.  Another broken piece of junk just trying to make money off of trading cards.			"

 Holy bonkers this is bad	I can say without any doubt in my mind that this is probably one of the wrost games i've ever played. The game is so simple and so so bad. The controls are nothing short of disgusting and the level design doesn't line up with the controls so you can't really play this game properly. The art is what it is and not something im going to ♥♥♥♥♥ about but the music on the other hand is close to ruining my hearing. This game really doesnt have much good to it so try to stay away from it. It is a fairly easy 100% game but that's it			"

												vertical scroller where you are a snowman jumping the obstacles gathering gifts for Santa.first thing you see really funny game characters, though game mechanics seems to be pretty simply its rather competitive -due to random gifts drop you just cannot gather all the gifts, so you run and run and run and die and die again and again.Should be great for small kids, i recommend, especially for the price.

												простенький, но довольно таки затягивающий горизонтальный скроллер, где просто невозможно собрать все подарки, так как они падают рендомно, и какой то из них точно будет у медведя или вороны, которых нужно избегать, чтобы не тратить жизни. смешная графика - можно сразу пилить демотиваторы со скриншотов :)но за эту цену - все равно что даром			"
