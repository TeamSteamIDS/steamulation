								So far this has to be my most returned to VR game out of the 50+ ive purchased.   The physics are spot on and the AI plays as well as you expect.  (PLEASE dont nerf world class, I STRIVE to beat it!)  Its a little low on content but so is a normal ping pong table..   If you enjoy ping pong, tennis, ect buy this.  BTW Devs, just a thought but one of the things ive been doing to increase my enjoyment is to only allow myself to play through the ranks to world class.  I start at amateur trying to progress to world class and if I lose I start back at amateur.   I cant imagine it could be too hard to impliment something like this as a starter career mode or a playoff ladder.  I would LOVE to see a torney mode where you progress to win the championship!			"

								I must say, i love this game. My suggestions to modernize the game: - Multiplayer (The better the ranking system, the more time people will put into it)  - Many different variations on rackets/tables  - Different Locations, maybe even custom locations  - Better ball physics (I believe that this came in the update yesterday) - Spawn ball with upper menu button or touchpad - Training area - MP3 player in game + folder where you can put your music - TV Screen with custom video capability - Body with arms (Could turn out really cool) - Different grip modes (How you hold the controller)Although, i'm really suprised by how good the game is now. Please keep the updates and new features coming!			"

								Playable. The physics take a little getting used to, but I think they are about as good as the best VR games I've played (Pool Nation and Pier Arcade). I would agree with anyone that says ping pong physics are a real tough nut to crack. The resolution is a bit low--I hope the developer gives us a setting to increase resolution scale or whatever. The music is something you'll probably want to turn off (developers let us play our own mp3's, okay?). I say buy it, the price is about right.Update: Wow just a few weeks later and Pong Waves VR has gone from good to great and now one of my favorite games. Totally playable and I have played many games of PR (Physical Reality) ping pong. The two handed serve update is great, AI is better. Physics are predictable and work well as to not get in the way of being immersive. I think that Pong Waves VR qualifies as a competent simulation in addition to a great and fun game. Really this game is a steal at the current price and I highly recommend you purchase now.			"

Unlikely killer-app and true ""eSports""Disclaimer:Played with Oculus Rift + Touch, 2-front-facing camera setupI like table tennis in RL. If you don't, this game may not be for you.Before buying this game, I tried VR Sports Challenge from the Touch pre-order bonus. This was fun for 1-2 hours, but never felt like real sports. My expectation when buying Eleven Table Tennis: just another tech demo with unintuitive controls and assists that make every shot magically hit the target. But, what a pleasant surprise: The controller is just a paddle! The buttons have no function. The only control is to swing your paddle against the ball. There are no assists. This is pure physics, the real thing. To make such a direct, raw control scheme is brave because it requires perfect tracking and perfect physics. And to my tremendous delight, both are spot-on. The tracking shows how marvelous the Oculus Touch tracking works (judging from reports of other players, the Vive tracking works equally well). The physics can only be credited to the fantastic work of the developers. Ball and paddle physics are nearly perfect. All kind of spins work as expected. If there are differences to the real world, they are subtle enough to only be noticed by very experienced players.As a sport, Table tennis is a perfect fit to the current generation VR headsets. It requires little room and is played front-facing with minimal movement on the spot. The paddle has comparable size and weight to the motion controller. The ball is small and light enough to make the controller haptics feel realistic. While the player moves his whole body, all movement culminates in the force applied to the paddle and therefore it is adequate to only track the hands.As a result,  this game skips the uncanny valley and goes directly to holodeck. After finding the right settings (which is a bit troublesome, see below), the game feels just like playing real table tennis. As someone who likes playing in real life, I can immediately use the play style I already know. And I notice making the same errors.Single Player modeThe setting is a stylish apartment with the ping pong table in the middle. In the left hand you see the Oculus Touch model, in the right hand the paddle. You have no body or arms. The opponent is shown the same way, plus a (somewhat scary) mask for the head that conveys which way he is looking. Each game is basically one set (11 points). The basic rules are enforced by the game.In Singleplayer mode, you play against a surprisingly good and natural AI of several difficuly levels. On the higher levels, the AI starts to apply spin and play faster balls.Additionally there are a few Practice Minigames. For example, in one you must return balls to specific corridors. This game mode as a lot of potential to turn it into a more useful training tool, but feels quite limited at the moment.Multi Player modeIn Multiplayer mode, you can play against a (Steam) friend or random player.A critical point here is the connection quality, especially the ping. In most cases, this worked surprisingly well for me. If the connection is good, there is no noticable difference to the Singleplayer mode. If it is bad, the ball ""jumps"" a bit after the opponent hits, making it harder to react. While the game does everything it can to smooth that out, above a certain lag threshold, the game becomes unplayable.Unfortunately, there is no ranking system yet. Still, to be able to play table tennis against players from all over the world as if in the same room is magical and tremendously fun. The game has voice chat activated by default. Laughing together on funny balls or praising nice shots makes the experience even better (of course not all player use their microphone or speak the same language).SettingsThe most important setting I had to change was the paddle position. For Oculus Touch, the default position is unfortunately tilted. I adjusted it so that when keeping my hand vertically the paddle is also vertically, like a continuation of my hand. The Rift's nose gap is very useful here to AR-like see your own hand and the paddle at the same time.Also there are some settings related to the paddle. I imagine it to be like the choice of the physical rubber properties of the paddle. You can experminent and adjust those to your liking.Wish list for the developersThe raw gameplay is in place and extremly fun. But I think there is a lot of potential to make this game even better. If the developers are reading this, here are my top three wishes: Better Match making: Introduce rankings (visible or hidden). It is no fun for either side if the gap in play strength is big. Also check the connection quality and do not match players if it is too bad. Simplify the settings and provide better default values. Oculus Touch paddle position is tilted, use the correct rotation as default. Instead of sliders give some beginner friendly choices for paddles. Hide the sliders in advanced settings. Bring the game to Oculus Home to reach more Oculus players (Cross-play with Steam!).ConclusionTable tennis is a uniquely suited sports for VR. Eleven Table Tennis provides an incredibly realistic simulation of an olympic sports making it arguably the first true ""eSports"". The Multi Player mode on top of the raw, but near-perfect gameplay provides endless replayability.			"

												Wow!  I am absolutely blown away by how fun and realistic this is.  I don't really think it could be much better.  I have over 40 games for my Vive and even though it's such a simple concept, this is my favorite.  I have played A LOT of table tennis over the years, and actually competed in some pretty big competitions at an Ivy League school with players from around the world, and this game is SPOT ON!  Just wow.  I want to share a few improvements/suggestions only because I'm such a big fan, that I want the options to continue to evolve (please!).  Do not take these as too critical, as my overall rating on this game is 10/10, A+++.  1.  There seems to be an issue during ""waves"" mini-game, that the ball is mistakenly shot into the net or off the table and there is no way to retrieve the ball.  It's easy to abandon that game and start a new one, but a bit annoying, and maybe fixable?  It would be frustrating if this happened during a record-breaking run!  2.  I'd love to see high-scores for the mini-games, even if just local scores.  Most of us are very competitive and want to have high scores to beat or compete with others in our household.3.  Add another vote to the ""locked"" table height, using the floor calibration to determine and set.  As many of us are sticklers for consistency, it would be nice to know the height is the same every time.4.  Any way to have a multiplayer lobby?  Maybe even a self-rating of sorts that could indicate which level you've beaten within the game to separate players?***5.  And most importantly (unless I missed a setting), can you add a setting of matches to 21 points?  Especially for multiplayer?  And even consider adding a Best of 3, Best of 5 option?  Prior to 2001, games to 21 were the normal, and some of us still like to casually play that way, even if it's not the International standard any longer.  Again, KUDOS!  I absolutely love the gameplay and I can't stop telling all of my friends about how much fun and realistic your game is!			"

												Great physics, feels like I'm actually playing table tennis.  Nice AI options for difficulty and it looks like different environments are on the way. There are some mini games but the meat of the experience is the regular games, which are great.  You can feel that little oomf on the touch controller / paddle when you hit the ball, put spin on it ....all that fun stuff.  The AI is pretty good so I havnt bothered to try multiplayer yet.  I bought at full price and it's worth it completely.  If you play on extreme settings prepare to sweat and watch out you don't smash your controllers into something.			"

												Last year, I had to choose between the Vive and a Ping Pong table.  I chose the Vive.  It's the smart decision.  And now, it only cost me five dollars to learn that I'm the worst ping pong player on the face of the earth, the solar system, our local star cluster, the Alpha Quadrant, and the galaxy at large.  10/10 would suffer soul crushing defeat to the Amateur AI again.Seriously though, it's the most accurate portrayal of ping pong I know of because my scores accurately reflect my skill.  Often 11 - Nil.  Worked up a sweat, contemplated suicide, and had an overall great time.Don't like the minigames though.  The wooden rabbit mask of the AI is enough to give me nightmares, thank you very much.			"

								Wow, my new favorite game in VR and pretty much have them all at this point. I am so immersed in this VR experience that I am even using the same footwork and body english I use when playing real ping pong :) Everything about the paddle and ball spin feel bang on, so real. This is going to be a killer VR app when Multi-player is available. Grab it now while its $5 bucks, odds are its going to go up as more features are added. Its super fun right now as is.

								It's table tennis, pure and simple. The game puts you in front of the table, you pick up the bat and ball, and you are playing. It seems quite close to the real thing. The main drawback is the controller feels different to a table tennis bat handle, but it passes for one quite well, especially if you go into the options and angle the bat to your preference. At the time of review, the game is still in early access. As such, I think the AI needs a bit more development. The computer opponent seems to find it impossible to counter shots close to the edge of the table, but has no problem with ones close to the net. Who wins is determined by whether you ace your own serves or fail to return the AI's. The computer opponent is almost infallible in its ability to keep the ball on the table, even on the easiest difficulty setting. Of course, multiplayer adds the element of spontaneity missing from single player mode, but I lost patience waiting for a human opponent after only a few seconds because there's nothing else to do while waiting. You can't even throw ping-pong balls out of the open window. Trailing wires and lack of space made moving quickly to the left and right a bit risky for me and so I spent the whole game rooted to the spot.I have to say, this is a really good use of VR and I think this has the makings of a great game. Even in early access, it's very good. As someone who enjoys table tennis, I can say it is about as close as I can imagine table tennis simulations getting without a table tennis bat shaped controller.			"

								I have to commend this amazing VR adaption of table tennis. I was worried it would feel more like a controller-racket than a table tennis racket, after playing it a bit, i was more or less playing the same style as in real life. With spins and precision long/short balls, had a lot of fun vs the bots, It read the controller pretty damn well, except when i would smash like hell, but thats understandableI would like to see an option for raising or lowering the table, as standing felt too tall, and sitting was almost better. Had a lot of fun both standing/sitting with this game!			"

The physics seem spot on, and the AI is just tough enough for someone with my skill level.  The genral polish of the game is good and I realy like how you're able to adjust both table position and paddle position in an intuitive way.The only feedback I have is cosmetic.  The bunny mask guy is creepy it would be nice to customize that, there is no door anywhere in the room which just seems wierd, and the couch is in a terrible place for watching TV :)			"

												Wow!  Really incredible game.  Once you tweak the settings around for a while (paddle position / power / spin), it feels almost *exactly* like real ping pong.  I'd recommend the power and spin sliders set to about 1/4 of the max value.  When setting the paddle position relative to the controller, try to line up the palm face of the handle to the palm surface of the controller (top surface underneath the menu button).  I found that mating these two surfaces was critical to emulate the real feel.  If the surface of the controller is at any other angle or position, hitting the ball just feels off.  I was expecting latency to kill multiplayer, but they correct for it pretty well.  Real life ping pong skills transfer 1:1 in the game no matter how janky you hit your shots.  Topspin, backspin, sidespin, and even hitting off the edge of the paddle!			"

Entire time felt like I was playing table tennis.  That experience alone was worth $10.That guy never played table tennis before this game.  He said he started playing two weeks ago.  He had some serious skills all due to this game.You can change your paddle orientation, table height and location, softness and hardness and spin and such on the paddle surface (and I hear they're going ot update to be able to have both sides have differing surfaces).  Also, I got quite a workout in those 90 minutes. I can't think of any reason not to get this game.			"

												I've been playing ping pong for most of my life, playing almost daily for a few years a while back (purely on a casual hobby level, though), and this game lets me do almost all I could do in real life. Other VR ping pong simulations I have tried may offer more game modes, but the tables feel like playing cheap all-weather tables you might find in public parks. ""Eleven: Table Tennis VR"" feels like playing with a high quality bat on a tournament table. The multiplayer mode is great fun and I have played against players from all over the world (USA, Spain, Sweden, England, Germany, you name it). While there are still some bugs to be squashed and fine-tuning to be made, it is already an awesome experience and the developers are extremely helpful, responsive and eager to constantly improve this excellent game.Without any exaggeration, for me, this game alone justifies the pretty hefty investment the HTC Vive is (including new computer parts to make VR run more smoothly). I'm really looking forward to all the future features yet to come! "

								Wow this game is fantastic. Only thing it desparately desparately needs is multiplayer.  If you add multiplayer I'll buy another vive just for that. The thing I hate about ping pong is having to constantly chase balls after every point and not being able to practice on your own. Well, this sovles all the issues I have with ping pong. So its better than real ping pong. For real. When you hit the ball some how there is a tiny amount of force feedback which makes you think you really hit a ball, and the sounds are perfect as well. (And you can mute the music or sound effects too). All of the physics, ball spin, etc from real ping pong are there. I can't find any difference between it and real ping pong. I'm sure a pro might. I have a hunch that the spin is less than in real life but I could be wrong. Top priority should be multiplayer. I only care about local multiplayer but I'm sure most people will want internet multiplayer. Other possible purely optional enhancements could be options to allow games that go up to 21 points instead of just 10, adjust degree of ball spin.This is my favorite vive game. All of the graphics and fancy acting, etc, sometimes the most fun games are the simplest. IMO this is what smaller vive developers should be concentrating on. Most sports are relatively simple but have stood the test of time. I like it better than a tennis type of game because I don't have to run around and get tired, I can play standing and remaining relatively still. PURE GENIUS THIS GAME AND REASON ENOUGH ALONE TO OWN A VIVE 9/10 (Multiplayer would be a 10). Thanks so much for making this game and making me glad I own a vive and making me like ping pong and play it a lot more.			"

								Background/Context: My name is Anthony and I am a casual gamer. My favorite games of all time for PC (in no particular order and off the top of my head)  are Diablo 2, Witcher 3, Skyrim, Heroes of Might and Magic, Might and Magic, BF2,and  Mass Effect (all of them). I mention this to give you some insight into the type of gamer I am to give you some perspective on my reviews. At the time of this review, I am a 30 year old white-male. I don't intend the 'white-male' part to change; but who knows. I have been playing table tennis since I was 5. Onto the review for Pong Waves.Prior to the most recent update, I would not recommend. The backhand, my primary weapon, was not even remotely close to realistic. With this most recent update, this game is MUCH closer and I can recommend with some warning -- it is not perfect. It will frustrate you when you mentally know you've hit a solid shot, but it doesn't respond that way. With this most recent update, I would say that 80% of my shots feel realistic. That is good enough for now, for me to enjoy myself and have a spirited game against the AI, or in 'Wave' Mode.AI: The first two difficulties are a cake-walk. The last one, is beastly. I haven't beaten the best setting yet -- ""World Class"", I think. You can easily exploit the first two settings with serves that they will never return. That is a bummer. Once you get to the most difficult setting, it is like you can't get anything past it. This isn't a bad thing per se, but I would like to see some better balancing on the AIWave Mode: Although this is OK, it needs some more content. It is currently setup in a manner where you get 'x' number of balls and you get 100 pts for each that you land on the other side of the table. That's it. I think they need to add an endless mode with a 'strike system'. Three, five, and seven (hard, medium, easy -- respectively?) maybe? Then add a leaderboard. Maybe a progressively more difficult endless mode? Starts of super easy, then progressively gets ridiculous -- sudden death style. Additional modes: Should be an ""accuracy mode"". Maybe there are rings you have to hit the ball through? Or targets, or something. Different Environments: Self explanatoryRPG Elements to add: Add different paddles with different stats that can be unlocked as you level up. Maybe you get stat points as you level up and can augment the following player stats: Power, Accuracy, Spin, others? Maybe add some accessories that you can win in tournaments to augment your stats. Very simple RPG elements would put this game over the top.Playing Against Real Players: Add this feature with the above RPG features and create classes of tournaments: Bronze for players level 1-5, silver for players 6-10, gold for 11-15, etc. That would be a good time. Out of 5, I would give this a 3 right now, with the potential to be a solid 5 if they implement some elements that increase replayability, immersion, and engagement. I recommend this game as it is the only, and thus, the best pong game on the market.			"

								Experienced ping pong player here (I've played and won a couple tournaments).Pong Waves VR is not perfect, not yet. But it is not that far off. After an adjustment period, this feels like playing ping pong. CONS:-Really hard top spin is making the ball go farther down in the air than it should. Makes a lot of your all-out slam shots hit the net until you adjust for the crazy amount of top spin. Could this be fixed with some sort of cap on the spin? Good luck fixing it. haha-Most shots just don't feel like they're going high/far enough, overall. I'm not sure what would cause that, but an experienced ping pong player will easily notice. -No multiplayer. IMO, adding this (along with a ranking system eventually) could be interesting, because people who don't have a ping pong table could compete in a game that is truly not that far off from an IRL ping pong game.PROS:-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of fun. I have a ping pong table in my basement, but rarely have people to play against. This is a great alternative (I'm worried about it affect my IRL ping pong game. I feel I will be able to kinda switch my brain back easily, but this is yet to be seen. Will update after I play some actual ping poing!)-Spin feels pretty damn great. I was pleasantly surprised that for most of my shots, even with complex slice/ cuts with diagonal back spin, the ball acts accordingly. The harder your shot, though, the less accurate it tends to be. Some spins can become very exagerrated because of a really hard cut. I know there are fewer pros, but I implore you to look at the weight of the pros. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is possibly jonesin for some ping pong.PS:stoked for multiplayer. I think it would dramatically increase the gameplay quality, along with a ranking system to feel that legitimate improvement.PPS:If you usually place your index finger on the backhand-side of your paddle, DO THIS in Pong Waves VR. It will greatly help your insticts. This being said, I feel the paddle should be very slightly lowered in the grip. Compare x)the location of your finger being on the back of a real paddle with y) the percieved location of your index finger on the back of the in-game paddle. Seems just barely high. TL;DR:I am the Forrest Gump now.   "

								Always wanted a ping pong table, bought this on sale after reading reviews of those available on steam for vive, so now I have one.With Pong Waves VR unlike the table I would have had, I don't have to keep a clear space in the garage, unfold the table when I want to play, find the bats and at least one ball without a dent in it, then coerce a member of the family into playing.Then during play, I don't have to keep wandering about getting the ball back from under the table or from behind the garden tools.The controller implimentation is very good, the method of ball holding and release feels natural and makes it easy to either drop or loft the ball for different serve styles.The game is reasonably configurable, I like that you can adjust the bat angle, change the colour of the table, turn down the ""muzak"". I also like that you can apply spins and the ball behaves pretty much as I expected it to.I have not played the game for that long yet, but found that the feel, sound  and speed were good enough to fool me into believing I was actually playing table tennis like I have in the past.Starting on amatuer I quickly changed to semi-pro and was having some gentle rallies after just a few games.If you own a vive then, for good gameplay and the money this is a bargain ( even more so while on sale ).

								I've become noticably better at this game. I don't know if I adjusted to the physics model of it, or just remembered my old skills from the real life. I guess I'll see when I try the real ping pong again :)Overall, more environments, game modes, and a more granular AI skill levels would be great (world class level plays perfect, it's almost unbeatable, only freak bounces off the net or table score me a point). Also, multiplayer would be great! (I'm not sure if it is doable due to the network ping, though...)			"

								So, this game is hard for me to recommend. I like the single player mode, but it clearly needs a lot of work.  Graphics really need to get bumped up. The resolution and textures just look really bad in VR right now.  Also the serving mechanic is really not ideal. They should take a lesson from selfie tennis on this one. I do however strongly approve of the AI they are using for the single player version and do look forward to seeing this in multiplayer once they work out the kinks.  This game definitely needs a lot of work, but I am going to hold on to it and hope the developer makes it worth it :)Edit 8/21/2016: This game has actually ended up being one of the games I play most often. The mechanics have gotten so much better.  Looking forward to continued improvements with Multi-player.  I'm a big fan of this game now.			"

												Edit: Thankfully the developers contacted me and we talked over the issues I had with the game, and every problem I had is being worked on and they said will be fixed soon. I was given some advice and it really helped my experience with this game, so I can definetly give it a positive review. Buy this game if you enjoy a simple, yet fun design.This game, in theory, is perfect. I really like it, even though I've played it for a bit. The game is fun if you don't count the score. Why? Because serving is broken--atleast for me. I honestly don't know what I'm doing wrong, it's exactly the same as the AI and most other players do the same thing I do. (I hold the ball in the air and hit it as it is falling), but the second it touches the table, my opponent gets a point. The ball bounces and would stay on the table, and the AI returns it, but it still counts as a negative point for me. I understand this game isn't finished, but something as dire as serving is a serious issue. A smaller scale problem is that the AI seems to clip and randomly get a point even though the ball never came to my side. The AI jumps to the left, hits the ball, it disappears, and he jumps back to the middle with a point. It's weird, and this game makes me angry. Hopefully this is fixed and I can give this game a positive review.			"

												You want a game where anything above the lowest skill level makes you hate your lack of coordination while a virtual opponent mocks you without saying a word every time you reset the game after missing a shot you ""won't miss next time"" to the point that you go into a death spiral of self hatred and maniacal laughter despite being pretty sure anyone you showed this to would be able to beat it on their first go? Get this! This is what I imagine it would be like to go to an arcade with a friend... 😭. It's addictive and I almost feel like that Donnie Darko character you vs actually thinks they've got better things to do that wait for you to serve. I love it.			"

												I must say that I am impressed. I am no amster at this sprot, but the level of immersion I get from the game is really high. I do feel like I am playing at the real table. Occasionally game reminds you that this is a VR world - be it by letting you hear your opponend through mic com or by dropping a frame or two between plays. Other than that this is solid yes, even for full price (which is not term I use often with Vive VR games).Also - the AI is amazing. I know I am not pro, so impressing me isn't that hard, but I like the way it plays and behaves between plays. It does feel like real human being! (although it wouldn't hurt if he could say something from time to time - seriously not much of a talker this one).			"

												Eleven: Table Tennis VR is, without a doubt, the king of all VR table tennis simulations and beats all other VR ping pong alternatives hands-down! The in-game physics is incredibly accurate to the extent that it makes me forget that I'm playing it in VR. The developers have been working really hard on it, regularly tweaking the physics and adding new features, listening to and communicating with us constantly via social media, and even consulted professional table tennis players to improve the physics.Before the latest improvements were added, my other favorite was Paddle Up. But after the devs had added the recent improvements, Eleven Table Tennis VR has now become the only table tennis game that I can recommend confidently with my eyes closed and label it as a 'must-have' if mind-blowing realism and accurate physics are what you are after. This is the first game I launch when I first start up my Vive everyday, even though I've played it for more than 5 hours already. Several gameplay features have been added recently, and numerous bugs have been fixed. The devs have also informed me that they are already working on adding more environments. Multiplayer (with voice, of course) had little to no lag, and I've played with several other players online without any problem whatsoever. The only thing I dislike a little about the game at the moment is the default environment, which looks a bit gloomy for my taste. Hopefully some different ones will be available soon.In conclusion, if you have even a passing interest in table tennis and own a Vive but still haven't bought this game, you have absolutely no idea what you are missing out on. Do yourself a favor and get the game. Also, check out the 'Replay' feature that has been added recently and thank me later! On a scale of 1 to 10, Eleven: Table Tennis VR easily earns a 9.5 from me! Thank you devs for all the hard work you have put into this project for us.			"

								If you live by yourself and enjoyed playing table tennis in the past, this game is far cheaper than a real ping-pong table and the bot doesn't argue, is not self-centered, nor has pyschological issues.  The gameplay feels like the real thing, or at least it does to me.  There are five levels: Amateur, Semi-Pro, Professional, World Class, and Legendary.  It is not an impossible mission to beat the Legendary level, even in causal wear. "

												I have played many games in VR and some are good but mostly they feel short and you get tired quickly. I haven´t played this one much, but I believe I have to write a review because it´s one of the best VR experiences I have had with the HTC Vive. I played a lot of table tennis before so I knew exactly what to expect and to my surprise, this feels like you were actually playing Table Tennis in real life. The controls feels exactly like a Paddle, it´s really amazing. I started to play with an amateur AI and he did made some stupid mistakes, but if you start to play well, the AI starts to play better. After a while, I played with a Pro and whoaw, it´s the third level in the list of 6 in how hard it is, and let me tell you, it´s hard but so good. He did effects and I´m almost sure I manage to do some effects too but you really have to work hard to do it well, because it´s very realistic (it´s been ages since I played). But depending on how you hit the ball and how hard, the balls reacts like a real ball, it´s really, REALLY realistic.And the feel of the ball, oh, let me tell you about it. I started to play with the paddle and the ball trying to do some equilibrium and I felt the control vibrate every time I touched the ball, like a real paddle!!! I don´t know about the oculus controls but people say they feel great. Well, the Vive controls feel exactly like if you had a paddle in your hand, you just use it EXACTLY like a paddle. And what´s best, you can adjust the position of the table, to the sides, to front or back, to higher or lower, wherever you like, until it´s in the best position. I don´t have much space in my room, like 1,50 x 1,50 if much, I believe lower than that, but as you can move the table, you can adjust very small spaces to play and move without concerning you will hit something.As other reviewer said, buy it only if you like Table tennis, because is that, table Tennis. I haven´t played more because I have back problems so I got a backache the next day, but I just didn´t want to stop, is that good. The mini games are great also, mini games like hit a target with a ball is thrown to you, hit a particular place of the table, hit balls that come from diferente positions and heights. Multiplayer? I don´t know, I didn´t use it so no idea, and you don´t need it, there are levels for the complete beginner to the pros, I didn´t try the hardest because the pro (that as I said was the third one in level of 6 levels)kick my♥♥♥♥♥everytime.

												This really is a great game! I didn't play table tennis in real life a lot, but I like this in VR very much.Do take the time to practice and adjust settings (how you hold the paddle, the ball speed etc.) until satisfactory because this will make playing much more enjoyable.Since there is also left hand support my wife (who played it in real life a lot) plays it as well and is also very positive.Things to improve:- multiuser saving of settings (like I have other settings than my wife)- haptic feedback doesn't seem to work on the touch controllers- practice mode where you can select that balls are shot at you every time the same time. that way you can for instance practice your backhand.I recommend buying and with the 50% discount it's a steal!

												I love this game. This was one of the first games I bought 2 months ago and it has gone through a lot of changes. I actually loved it way back then even though the graphics were jaggy and the physics felt a little fake.  Now with the recent update the physics are amazing and the new AI opponent is not only extremely talented but also freaking hilarious! I love taking breaks from coding to play a few rounds of table tennis against the AI. I've noticed that my playing style is resembling more and more what it was when I used to play for real, almost as if I'm being forced to use real life techniques! I hope it keeps getting better and better. I haven't tried the multiplayer feature because the AI is too good!			"

												So good! My personal killer app for VR! The physics are excellent, and the gameplay makes excellent use of 180 degree roomscale setups. I'm playing this with a 2-sensor Oculus Rift setup with 2m x 1.5m play area, which is the minimum recommended area. This is my favorite VR title so far because the gameplay is fun and seems to have a high skill ceiling. Fortunately, lots of VR awkwardness is mitigated thanks simply to the fact that it's table tennis. You don't really have to worry about getting tied in knots, losing trackig due to rotation, or locomotion.Couple of notes that might help:1) If you're using an Oculus Rift, you may start the game with the floor at eye-level. You can fix this by repositioning the table, but you can also just run SteamVR setup, which should configure your height correctly.2) You might need to reposition the table so the edge of the table would be touching your virtual thighs. By default, the table edge seems to be at the front-edge of your play area. That means if you reach in to swing at a ball, you might put your hand through your computer monitor or something. I think serious players stand back quite a bit, but at least on lower difficulty levels, the AI hits short balls often, so you'll often find yourself needing to make swings that are right over the table.3) You'll want to configure your physical-to-virtual control mapping and it's not totally obvious how to do this. Go into settings and then look down at your paddle hand, and you will see that you can adjust paddle position. Wish more games did this!4) It actually took me a little while to figure out that you need to squeeze the trigger of your non-paddle hand to spawn a ball so you can serve. I sat in front of the table staring at my AI opponent for longer than I'd like to admit.Looking forward to the additional environments!			"

								This is the best ping pong game(except the real one) I've ever play! Highly recommand!After the main description at the first line which I know most of you guys may only read, I'll comment some details.This game do have the convincing experience makes me truely think i'm playing the real ping pong. But here's some suggestion for you the dear developers :First, no spin ball, no spin ball, no spin ball. In ping pong games, spin is not only make ball tto change the moving path and speed, it make lots of attacking movementt possible, like the fast attack top spin. As a trained semi-pro ping pong player, I feel that with out top spin, most of the right powerful loop will be impossible in this game. With out topspin, the right loop will be too slow to go through the net or to high to catch the table. Chop is the most impotant defend weapon for tennis grip, while loop is the most impotant counter-attack weapon. Abandon the spin makes tennis grip impossible to play, which is the most comfortable grip way for using HTC Controllor;Second, no let in the game. Which means no reserve for the net serve.Third, I know it is almost impossible to make the mass touch feeling for smash on Vive. But after fix the spin ball, can we have the custom paddle? In this systerm, we can custom the out look, most impotantly the rubber. Different rubber has different effect on spin, the stroke speed and so on. That will make this game amazing.Fourth, social network play and multiplay mode.This is my first comment on steam.I'm always too lazy to reply my experience. But for this promising game, I just so love it and tribute my first time.LOL好了，该来一发中文了。这游戏强力推荐，我玩过最好的乒乓游戏，完美模拟了乒乓球的物理轨迹和触感。但最大的毛病是，没有旋球。上旋下旋侧旋拆球都没有。这让拿横板的情何以堪。拉不了球削不了球，神烦- -但是直板要是不旋的话，触感还是非常感人非常棒的，适应时间非常短就能很轻松的像真乒乓一样控制球路。游戏还是早期版本，有些缺失也能谅解。接下来的版本除了旋球外，希望还能加入社交和网络对战，自定义球拍胶面等。到时候这游戏一定屌翻天。强烈推荐			"

												I've played a fair amount of ping pong in my day and I'll just say that they've nailed it.  I wasn't expecting much even after reading all the great reviews but I have been highly impressed with this game.Take some time to play with the settings to get the ""feel"" right and you'll be rewarded with an excellent experience.  I found the initial settings to be off for me personally as it was taking far too much power to get the ball over the net and I wasn't getting the spin I'm used to getting.  I played around with the settings for a few matches and after about 15-20 minutes I settlted on something that feels super realistic to me.  A word of caution though... be careful while playing.  I lunged for a ball that the AI had hit into the net and my brain was expecting to be able to use the ""table"" to brace myself from falling over.  Well... I guess you see where this is going.  Made me laugh and feel stupid at the same time but I think this is just another testatment to how immersive and awesome thsi game is.If you even like ping pong a LITTLE bit, get this game.			"

I haven't tried out the multi player yet...I am not that great so I want to go in at able to beat the second level AI, at minimum. I really like the physics and for the most part it plays great. There are a few bugs. One is when the ball will randomly get stuck close to the AI and they make gestures for me to hurray up and play, but, it is impossible and you have to restart the match. Other than the few quirks, it is a fun game and worth the purchase if you like ping pong.			"

												Out of all the games in the Oculus and Steam stores, this game along with Rec Room is my most played. Probably because it (by far) surpasses any other attempt at mimicking an actual real-life activity in a video game. This game FEELS like actual table tennis on a very precise level, and this is also why it is constantly challenging. Lots of things can be improved of course, like:- Ranked multiplayer instead of just random, and/or save preferred players- More AI variation - the Semi Pro and Pro are two very different beasts :)- Better keeping up with rules, e.g I've gotten away with net serves many times. Also I reckon the need to avoid getting hit by the ball in real table tennis? I.e. an overshot ball need to miss the opponent as well as the table in order to count as a point for the opponent. This could get abused though.- More polish in both game and menus. The ultimate would be a ""multiplayer arena"" with multiple tables, where you can play and get up the ranks (physically by moving up tables!), or just watch and cheer on others playing. Also maybe Oculus avatar support?-More players! Maybe this game needs better promotion. I find it incredible that Oculus (or Valve) have not pushed this game since it beats out their own ""AAA"" titles in pure gameplay,There are so many things that could make the experience even better than it's current state, but that said - this is still THE killer app for VR this far in. Now come at me with those n00b smash serves! ;)			"

												It's the most realistic game I've played. The way I hit in real ping pong translates perfectly. You know when you hit it just a bit too hard or one that feels like it's going to land perfectly...it does just that in this game. It's crazy how accurate it is. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys ping pong.			"

								Well polished table tennis game, for a great price.  The physics feel good and the ball behaves as you'd expect. It needs a few tweaks, like different environments/rooms, multiplayer, and maybe a few mini games to help improve skills. The price point is great too! I would actually pay more for it!Very recommended.			"

												While I think the game is impressive and could be fun if you treat it as a video game table tennis either the game or the hardware is not able to keep up with the movements of a club player. The only way I can score points is to play like I'm having a hit with a novice. If I try to put to much spin on the ball it either misses the paddle entirely or the ball flies off in a random direction.The immersion is great and the environment is good enough that I often have to stop myself from putting the paddle down on the table when i stop, but I'm giving it a thumbs down just so that quality players know that at least at this stage you will not be able to practice your real game as I thought I might be able to from all the reviews I had read.

												Ping pong is the perfect game for VR. Right-sized play area, physics, perfect game length, great use of controllers, etc. I like this implementation very much and recommend it.There seem to be a couple of small quirks I hope the developers will address soon:1. The ""Rematch"" button doesn't seem to do anything when pressed by either of the players who just finished a multiplayer match.2. Lag can a problem, even when the ping indication shows <100 ms. 3. Even at 90 fps (?) the ball animation is still not 100% smooth. I wonder if motion blur could help.Regardless, this is a great app, great game, and great example of VR. You should buy it. :) "

								Feels mostly real for the average person and fun to play.Needs improvement in graphics,need to be able to serve the ball betterinstead of having it kinda float on the paddle,need more single player levels.Great start though, there's no denying that!Since updates, major improvement in graphics, trail effect on ball  removed, more levels, options to change table colour, and serving the ball is better. Perhaps making the left controller a hand that picks up the ball would be a nice touch. But overall developers have listened to customers and made the necesssary improvements. Great fun, major improvements, well done! More locations please.			"

 Before the review starts I am aware the game is still in Early Access. Ping Pong Waves VR is a really true testament to Ping Pong in real life! The Physics in this game are so much better than other Ping Pong Games avaiable on the Vive. So far as of  7/24/16  there are only two game modes, Waves and Single Matches. I will also go in depth in the Graphics of the game and in depth in the Game Modes! Waves Waves is a arcadish type game mode that challenges you to hit balls the computer throws at you. This sounds really cool in theory, and it kind of is! However this mode only last for about 1 minute and then it's over. Here are some tips to make this game mode better:  Make additional levels Make an Endless Wave Mode Make a mode where both hands act as paddles so both have to hit incoming balls Single Matches Single Matches in this game are really what shines in Ping Pong Waves VR. There is lots of Opponent AI difficulties as well! From Ametuer to Legendary this mode will cater to veteran Ping Pong players as well as beginners. This game mode stays true to official Ping Pong rules and is really addicting. I was going to suggest what would make this game mode better but this mode is already good! Graphics/Looks of the game The Graphics/Looks of the game is still what reminds me this game is still in early development. Don't get me wrong it doesn't look bad but it still looks like it's a placeholder or something along those lines. The look is very realistic where you are placed in what looks like a Apartment and it's feels really cool to be playing Ping Pong in a place you wouldn't ever play in. there are some weird Graphical Things I will mention now. The Ping Pong Buckets Ping Pong Balls are shadeless and look kind of weird. Most of the TableTop Colors are really bright and can't see any detail on the table with the Black option. The overall lighting feels very plasticy and basic.Overall Ping Pong Waves VR is a very promising title and one I will keep coming back to! I would definitely reccomend people who like Ping Pong or people who haven't ever played a Match in their life! However now I want to give some things I would love to see get implemented into the game in the future! A One hand serve option. More modes. (Tourney Mode, Practice, Multiplayer, ect.) More enviroments. (The Moon, A Rooftop, An Office Building, ect.) More realistic lighting. Make the net on the table Physics based. Make the enviroments interactible, so you can hit objects and it interacts.That's all I could think of. Hope development goes smooth!			"

								This game is absolutely brilliant! (If you like table tennis)It's still early days and there's clearly room for improvement (it's ""early access""), but as it stands it's very, very playable.At 5 Euros it is great value for money.If you launch it with the shift button pressed, you can choose the desktop resolution (this doesn't affect the VR resolution, just takes some of the strain off your gfx card) and also choose the game graphics quality. You can choose between: Fastest, Fast, Simple, Good & Beautiful. It runs fine on beautiful with my R9 290X & Phenom II 1045T @ 3.2GHz.If you like table tennis, you're going to come back again and again to this simulator.Good points:Nice graphicsGood ball movement with different spin effects.Don't need to bend down to pick up the ball 8)Different levels of difficultyIt's a lot of fun.Possible improvements:Better multiplayer supportTournaments with NPCs (playing more than one match)Different bat holding options (you can only alter the angle at which you hold the bat, but no pen grip option yet)Higher level NPCs should be able to do a smash (I've yet to see one take advantage of a high ball, even on legendary)Keep up the good work!Just a quick note. This is probably really obvious, but it wasn't to me! Duh! I started off holding the bat as I would normally hold the controller. I think your're supposed to hold it with the haptic trackpad to your palm and your index finger on the controller ring. This way, the bat is in the right position and you get the haptic feedback every time you hit the ball.It would also be great to see the score when you finish playing, as I'm usually too engrossed to look at the scoreboard and then suddenly the match is over and I don't know what the final score was. It would be cool if the NPCs had names or something too, that way it would be more emotionally involving when you beat them.			"

												I think this game should feature in every recommended list of Vive games! At it's current a price it' a steal. The simulation is very realistic, your AI opponent is worthy (more than worthy, in ""Legendary"" it's pretty much unbeatable :D), and the graphics are polished and smooth. I have played table tennis for many years as a youngster, and  it's feels very much  like playing the real thing. The physics is spot on, and entirely predictable... Also, this feels like a ""finished"" game that  can provide you with endless hours of fun, unless some half-baked pre-releases that cost three times as much.  If you are into ping pong, do yourself and the developers a favor and buy this game! :)P.S.- I have not tried the multiplayer option yet. "

Iron out these two things and for me this is the best game on here with tons of replay value. Tons of value for $10 period IF they correct these issues.

There is a bit of a learning curve, but if you can play ping pong in real life then you should be able to get the hang of this within a few minutes.  There's not much content yet as far as the mini games or much variation, but there are more things coming soon so that should improve.  The lowest difficulty level is still fairly difficult for anyone who isn't already pretty familiar with actually playing ping pong.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing! The physics are impeccable.  All of my serves work as they do in real life once you adjust the spin setting to maximum.  The computer AI is quite good, and playing online with other players is a lot fun.  Ping rate can be an issue from time to time given the speed of ping pong.  I hope to see round-robbin tournaments in the future. If you love Ping Pong, you should buy this and join the community! I also recommend to the developers to create more game-oriented practice devices, like an AI that always serves to your backhand to practice one's technique...or, a CPU that exactly copies your serve so that you can see what an opponent sees.  Oh, and link in Pandora or Spotify on the radio, that would be cool!			"

												I own 50 VR titles and I play this game the most.Physics so real I feel like I'm actually playing ping pong. The only other vr ping pong  I've tried is Paddle Up, and this game has the clear edge on realism.I almost want to vote this down, because my one big complaint is the multiplayer. I've had a few incredible matches with people where there was very little lag, and matched quickly. HOWEVER, the normal experience has been to wait for 20 mins not matching with anyone, and only being able to rally with a painfully easy AI. A few lag crashes too. DEVELOPER RECOMMENDATION: Since we have to wait so long in multiplayer queue sometimes, please make it so we can do single player matches and skills games without losing our spot in queue.Single player gameplayI find the AI to be an incredible opponent. I started off not particularly skilled. The lowest difficulty got me good at basic ball control, and now I'm having epic over hand smash rallies on the third difficulty level. Levels 4 and 5 are basically Insanity and Asian. Every shot is a wildly spinning bullet. But more and more I'm returning shots. All flukes for now, but it's happening more often. I would bet that playing this game is getting me good a real life ping pong.  "

												This is a pretty great ping pong game in terms of the touch on the ball. I was using this with oculus touch controllers, and while I did have to rotate the grip on the control to orient the paddle correctly, it worked really well.I play ping pong recreationally in my office, last year I think I played everyday on my lunch break. I was able to start playing this game immediatly and start making all the same errors I do in real life. Everything feels right, down to the spin and power on the ball. The AI levels are pretty good, though the jump from amature to semi pro feels too steep, and the legendary AI is not screwing around, which is great.I'm not too happy with the audio on the ball bounces and contact, but this could be improved in the future. There was also no feedback on the touch controllers, not sure if this applies to vive, but either way it could really use a very gentle buzz depending on the type of contact with the ball so you can start having some slight physical feedback.I played only one multiplayer match, but it was too laggy to really play well. The problem here is the game seems to force correct the balls position through the latency, so you can expect the ball to warp around a lot, making play almost impossible. This may not be the case with a better connection though, I saw no ping indicators so I had no way of judging whether that one game was an outlier or not.I also found out how sturd the touch controllers were. The AI gave me a nice high loft that was begging to be spiked back down, and I did, right into my desk shelf. I knocked a chunk of wood off the desk and drew blood, touch controllers in tact, ping pong ball on the floor. 10/10 would bleed again.			"

												Very addicting, the physics is good even if I feel it's not perfect yet, maybe related to the lack of haptics or the ball/racket collision.Some features that would be nice :- Keeping count of games and sessions of games won/lost with the same opponent in the current session and in all past sessions- Keeping the AI level selected since the last launch of the game- Saving high scores for the mini-games- Saving count of games won/lost against the different AIs- Specific training for the different types of strokes- More mini-games, more places (I'd love a camping/holiday/exotic setting)- Support for Oculus Rift configured floor level- Rating system similar to sport games like PES to allow meeting players of a similar level if you chose to do so- Custom avatarsThere is a recurring bug that is a bit annoying, when you disable the ability to change the floor table position/orientation sometimes it doesn't work, pressing the trigger will still move the table.

Early Access Review
								I've played table tennis actively for 10+ years (I was once anihilated by Jan-Ove Waldner in Sweeden), and for me this is the most immersive and near to life VR game on HTC Vive so far! The game settings allows you to adjust the table position, height and the racket angle (I prefer to set in the middle with the HTC Vive controller) - which are all important for the gameplay. The first 30 minutes I could not manage to play an agressive game, but had to play safe with blocks, backspin and counter-loops. Drop shots positioned on the short left and right on the table felt very real, and I really got to put my table tennis experience and reactions to use, last millisecond wrist turns to save the ball was very true to life. Being able to change colour of the table was nice, the graphics are much nicer then any other table tennis game out there. Another reviewer had a nice tip to press Shift when starting the game and select Beautiful graphics.After some time I also got the hang of the drives and managed to play a more agressive game on both forehand and backhand by using actual table tennis techniques (but a bit slowed down from real life). It took some time before owning the legendary 1-player opponent, but I managed at last and worked up a good sweat. This game feels like the real thing! A couple of things can be improved. For example when serving an ace, no point is given but I have to serve again. Spin don't seem to have very much effect on the game. It would be nice to be able to adjust the amount of backspin in a serve or stroke according to speed of movement and point where the ball hits the racket, but maybe the players just need to get some more expensive rubbers or glue up the racket before the game :) Also the training robot could have a forhand / backhand & letter practice mode.Looking forward to following this game and to finding any other players in the multiplayer section! It would be awesome to have a online table tennis league.			"

												(Comments here are directed at the 09-22-2016 update.)Having tried this latest update, I have to say I prefer the previous version. Perhaps I just need time to adjust to the new physics. Though I'd still recommend the game, it feels like it's taken a step back.While the increase in difficulty is welcome (even Legendary was cake before), and the introduction of the announcer is nice, there are many new detractors:   -The new supposed emphasis on spin seems to have been overdone with respect to back spin while at the same time nearly eliminating the effects of side spin (it's almost impossible to curve the ball like I used to--and can in reality--with a sideways backhand). Back spin is now so strong that the computer opponent often sends serves that appear to travel (and arc) in slow motion (very strange) and die when they hit my side of the table.   -The ball seems heavier now in a way that feels unrealistic. More shots end up in the net, yet still if I try to put any real power behind a hit the ball almost invariably ends up going too far. The computer opponent now has no trouble blasting the ball, though (which is nice).   -I've had several occasions where I'll return a ball and it'll disappear mid-air above the net, pause a second, reappear seemingly stationary against the computer opponent's paddle and then get fired back at me as if the computer returned it without any of that ever happening.   -Were the spawn points in Waves always such highly reflective red chrome? Because Waves was always such a short experience I didn't play it much before. With this update having Infinite Waves, though, I'd like to play it more, but the spawn globes are terribly distracting (a softer matte color and smaller spawning spheres would improve this). Also, the globes are often very high above the table. Like, Magic Johnson reaching up over his head high. Seems a little ridiclulous (and doesn't make for good practice since in-game shots will pretty much never come from those locations).   -Sometimes on serves, the loss-of-point buzzer will sound the moment my paddle hits the ball even though the serve goes through cleanly and within the rules/bounds. This also happens to the computer opponent (though less frequently).   -Lastly, in spite of having a beefy system (i7-6700k, 32GB RAM, GTX1070, SSD), I'm getting much more sporatic graphical stuttering than in previous versions (this comes in the form of minute pauses, particularly just after the ball leaves a paddle).

												I keep going back and forth between Paddle Up and Eleven: Table Tennis VR.Paddle Up does many things better than Eleven: Table Tennis VR, but at the moment I definitely prefer the actual playing in Eleven: Table Tennis VR. That's not to say Paddle Up is bad though, because it's really not, I'd just recommend you get Eleven: Table Tennis VR instead. However, you really should get both. :)			"

												Wow this latest update rocks, the physics is almost perfect now, i do the same errors i usually do on the real table.i had purchased paddle up and ping pong vr too and before this update paddle up had the best physics.In paddle up on its side it's easier to do curved shots, but i've just seen in the options they have added a couple of fader to tune the paddle speed and spin, nice.Multiplayer is ok and it looks it handle latency a bit better than paddle up, i have played with a 100ms ping opponent and it was somewhat playable, obviously not perfect but there's not much they can do with that latency, anything above 40 ms produces visible latency and probably going over 100ms gives unexpected behaviours, the key is how they handle it.EDIT: Played again with a 95 ms opponent in california (i'm in italy) the match was very smooth to be honest, i didn't expected so much quality with a so far connection.i've lost a couple of points where i was sure i did it right, but we played several matches and the overall experience was great.So for the guys that have problems with multiplayer they have probably packet loss due to other factors, like other people using the connection, other programs inside the computer using bandwidth, a low or disturbed wifi signal in case of wifi, or some nodes over the net that have problems (saturated dslam or node for example), if connections are smooth, game is smooth.Remember to serve FAR from the table, if you serve over the table you will lose the point ( i think it's a real table tennis rule)			"

								This is a really nice game that just sticks to the basics of table tennis. The physics are quite nice and plays smoothly. One tip at this Early Access point is that if you have a very nice video card you can hold down the Shift key when starting from within steam and it will give you an option to punch the graphics up to ""Beautiful"". They are quite nice anyway but that setting really gives the table a nice matte/satin look.			"

								Pros:     - Physics are almost perfect     - AI is fun to play against, and the difficulty levels scale up nicely     - Environment is detailed, homey, and overall pretty immersive     - It costs $5, so the cons are mostly mitigated, but I think it will be helpful to list them anywayCons:     - My no.1 complaint is that the serving mechanic lends me to smacking my Vive controllers together (although some people may serve in a way that does not do this).  Part of the problem comes from the natural ergonomics of the Vive wands, but I feel like there are alternative possibilities to get around this.     - Physics do not include spin (as far as I can tell)     - No multiplayerIf you are into Ping Pong, this game is 100% worth the $5, unless you are waiting out on another App.  I listed ""No multiplayer"" as a con, but I'm not sure that is really fair at a $5 price point.  What I really mean is that I would rather have bought this game at a higher price point with multiplayer included, as multiplayer is such a naturally desirable feature of a VR Ping Pong game.			"

								I cant play real table tennis and have no room for a real table, and I probbaly would never have even tried if it wasnt for this. I bought this out of curiosity as it looks cool and I thought it would be a good demo piece and have interesting physics and dynamics. But I got hooked. Its so real, I do now have a table in my lounge and a player always available at different skill levels too. Looking forward to playin with my sons too when they get their Vives. This is a really cool game and even if you arent into it, you should try it, as you might just really like it, like me.I did think they could do some cool extras, like different settings, maybe a beach, or in space or something, and they could also play with other stuff, like gravity, different balls, bats etc. Maybe a kids mode, slower moving balls and big bats.My only complaine is the opponent can cheat a little. If the ball is going to miss the table, the opponent follows the ball with the bat, then the ball goes through the bat. That should not be allowed to happen, the computer should have to hit it. Looks, and feels, like it's cheating. Great title otherwise though.			"

YouTube™ Video: Ping Pong Waves Eleven VR - VR Gameplay HTC Vive 

			Views: 936		

			My finest game of Ping Pong ever... Wow that's sad. I'm no Ping Pong Master so before warned that I suck. The game is pretty well done aside from some collision detection issues on the paddles.		

Getting schooled by a demon bunny. 10/10 would fail again!VR Graphics 7/10 (Decent but nothing mind blowing)VR Gameplay 7/10 (Again, decent but there were some issues like player feedback and collision detection)Audio 9/10 (Light BGM, options for adjusting sound levels, nice ball sounds and VOIP. More tracks would be nice.)Locomotion N/A Room Scale only.A solid Ping Pong simulator. Would be a good place to practice without making a fool of yourself in front of other players! My day job has  a ping pong table in the break room which I tend to shy away from for obvious reasons once you watch the video. This would be a nice place to get my skills up to a passable level. On that note, it would be nice if there were some sort of guidence or instruction when a player does something wrong.I'm not sure if I'm happy with paying $10 for what seem to be very little content unless you're a big ping pong player but it is a decently polished title and the demon bunny gets the thumbs up.

												Puhhh...this is a hard review to write. I got lucky and got a free promotion key of the developers from Reddit. I really appreciate the courage of the developers to get their game out and I understand that making a game is hard work but... I just cannot recomment that game over Paddle Up. If you have a Vive you only need one Ping Pong game and this is not it. You can bash me all you want but I want that people get the best VR Ping Pong experience for their money.UPDATE: This does not mean that this is a bad game. Just that I don't recommend it over another, basically same, slightly more polished (in my opinion) game.Pros:The enemy animation is quite awesome (although it gets kind of annoying if he only shows bad sportsmanship)UPDATE: The bad sportsmanship has become much much rarer.UPDATE:The position setting of the paddle is pretty nice and something I would like to see in more games like this. Without profiles though it is hard to show this game to a friend without messing up the own  ''perfect position'' setup.UPDATE: The physics --> see former conUPDATE:Replay view is frikkn awesome!Cons: The sound of racket and ball! Really? That's how you think Ping Pong sounds like? It's beyond bad and unforgivable for a VR game that strives for immersion.UPDATE: Even now the paddle and ball sound are.... just not realistic and absolutely immersion breaking. I play paddle up after playing real ping pong -> yep...about right. I play this after I play real ping pong -> nope... I notice that the developers put a lot of effort into getting sound samples but maybe a right sound sample is not everything. Rehall, volume...I cannot point the finger on a specific problem but it just sounds wrong. Even though I am way, waaay beyond recommended specs the ball draws 5 times a duplicate of itself as a trail....breaks immersion immediately...again.UPDATE: Still an issue (tried it with and without all possibile reprojection and 1x 1.3x and 2x super sampling combinations.). The ball carries a trail of around 5 previous ball frames. I dont know if thats because the play enviroment is very dark and thats the problem but this is also quite imersion breaking and no problem at all in paddle up. Something is off with the physics. I consider myself a quite good and experienced player in real life. In Paddle Up it feels like when I hold the bat in the wrong angle, my ball drifts off (as it should). Here it feels as if I play in auto aim mode. I can hit one fast ball after the other (even in weird angles) and the spin of the ball in the air is so strong that it always lands on the table. I KNOW it wouldn't in real life. Feels nice to play at the speed on an olympian player though I guess...UPDATE: I dont know if the physics have been further updated but it feels better now (maybe i've gotten used to it). I am far less able to ''wii sport'' a ball and just quickly pull up the paddle and the spin will always take it back to the table. The enviroment is just depressing. Jeez, get out of your parents basement already.UPDATE: Still super depressing and dark. Also I realize that my parents comment is quite snarky so .... sorry for that. But please please implement those other enviroments soon for your players :). Am I allowed to critizise the creepy, not at all jolly, donny darko mask, too, while we're at it.....?In my 40 min of play I had 5 times of clipping of the ball through something (racket, table). In Paddle Up: Never.UPDATE: This did not happen once now so scretch thatFinal verdict: You only need one Ping Pong VR game. Get the better one!UPDATE: A review is always a biased opinion. The verdict still stands and sadly, I still cannot recomment this game over another. I updated my review because I want to be as fair as possible.			"

												First refunded the game but since it's got some nice updates and a good price, I bought it again.It got some potentials. Now it's really nice looking graphics. I just miss the shadow of the ball.Really need more content to be fun. Campain mode? Career mode? something is missing !! It feels like it's only got tutorial and training modes.About the waves.. why not speed it up a bit?? Make it a FUN game!Physics. Sometimes it feels like the ball just got too much force, but just sometimes... Consider some average/mean calculations of the speed!Edit: After the patch, I can't complain about the physics anymore. The AI is really really good and you almost think he's a real person.Now, just missing the shadows, tournaments and fun stuff to do...Edit 2:Just playing inside a room, with a beep when missing the ball???!

												This game originally sold me on the premise of fun virtual table tennis, but it did not follow through with intuitive and enjoyable gameplay. When I was dropped into the room with the table, despite the presence of a menu button label, there was no clear indication as to how to begin my serve (hint: it's the trigger button). Within my ten minutes of trying to play, there were numerous instances where I attempted to hit the ball as it was about to go past my right side, but I couldn't actually strike it despite quickly placing my paddle in the path of the ball flying through the air. This is something that I can do easily enough in reality, but not so much in virtual reality.My frustration with the game only increased in the extra modes against red, spherical bots. There was absolutely no pause between my failures to strike the oddly high-angled bot serve and the bot's next serve, resulting in a very quick game over in the Waves mode. The Zones mode asked me to hit particular zones on the opponent's side of the net, but these exceedingly rapid, odd-angled serves didn't allow for any chance to hit the ball ... or the next one ... or the last one, resulting in that swift game over. Maybe I'm just a poor table tennis player, but I won't be sharpening my skills in ""Eleven: Table Tennis VR"".I feel like table tennis in Rec Room might be more my speed.			"

												Managed to get one of the 100 free copy's that where given away by devs to celebrate the merging of Ping Pong Waves and Eleven Table Tennis.When I saw this game I was hoping for a playable Ping Pong game. I recived more than I thought I would get for sure. Not only is it playable but it's also really fun and the multiplayer works great.It's still early access and some bugs are around that are a bit annoying now and then but Multiplayer is amazing. Even when playing with an American while being in Sweden I noticed no delay issues. 80-90 ping without even noticing an issue, that's some impressive stuff.Posetives:Physics that work almost always as you would expect. This will most likely become better with time but it's ""good enough"" for now :)Multiplayer that works suprisingly well even with a ping of 90 ms.AI that feels really human (A bit to human perhaps with some annoying (time consuming) reactions)Negatives:Hard to tell why you lose your point sometimes (Pretty sure it's when paddle touches table most of the time)Suggestions: (For devs)Add in some info for when you lose a point for non usual reasons. For example if you lose your point because you hit your table you should be told so.Make your non paddle controller vibrate if it's your turn to serve.In Waves mode don't have time between shots be depandant on when your ball gets counted as pass or fail. This results in it being advantagous to do high balls to get dead time between shots and fails result in faster balls towards you which easily starts a ""fail train"". "

								Right from the start I noticed this was a great product. The room environment is very nicely detailed and modeled and runs great. The mechanics of spawning a ball and the ability to throw it naturally was spot on, and I prefer it much more than VR Ping Pong. I personally prefer the real world environment here as I feel much more comfortable and at home. I really like the ball trails and the Waves mode, just want more waves!The game does have some aliasing so super sampling should be added. I noticed if I spawn additional balls while some are still at play they can stop in mid air or lose momentum and just keep bouncing on the table in place which is annoying. Obviously this is Early Access and will be improving, but this is my favorite Table Tennis game most certainly! FEATURE REQUESTS:Super Sampling to fix aliasing. Change ball colors (for fun or better visibility on certain table colors)More Wave levels! Right now it only goes for a minute it seems.Keep up the great work!			"

								Don't listen to these negative reviews that say this game is a buggy mess, because it's not. Does it need some work on the physics?yes. But the game is still very fun and alot cheaper than buying a ping pong table. I would also love to see multiplayer in the future. If you like ping pong this is a good game and with a little more work on the physics It'll be a great ping pong game.			"

								I love this game.It’s been a few years since I played the genuine thing but to me the physics feel spot on. The ball goes precisely where you'd expect, the slight tap as you hit the ball is perfect, and the level of immersion is immense.I would rate this game right up there with The Lab, Vanishing Realms, Holopoint, Pool Nation, Raw Data and The Gallery as one of the very best games available on the Vive.My only gripe – you can’t hit balls out the open window in the basement. They just bounce off.Great game. Should be in everyone’s library. "

								This is a really good game. With a lot of VR games being expensive compared to the amount of content, this is good value for 3.99I used to play quite a lot of table tennis and this quickly got me going for the same sort of shots. It feels surprisingly realistic. Probably the biggest compliment is that when I think about what might be wrong with the game, I'm thinking about there should be more top spin on that the way I hit it, or a real player wouldn't play that shot, or the haptic feedback isn't strong enoough to feel like hitting a real ball. It's not the graphics or the motion tracking or any VR issues - it's comparing it with the real thing. Not many games can say that.			"

								Wow!!  This early access game is NUTS for $5!  I have tried maybe close to 50 VR titles and so far this may be my favorite!  If you want to get into ping pong I would highly suggest checking this out. Some things that I think would make the game perfect:-Infinite mode for waves and single player.  Like no score keeping, so that you can just keep playing for as long as you want without going back to the main menu.-It should be able to save audio settings between sessions, so that when you start it up you don't have to mess with them again.-Maybe a high score of number of hits between players?Great game!!

								I didn't have to play this long to give a solid recommendation.  I've played a lot of ping pong in my life and this feels pretty accurate, it's not perfect but for an early game in VR, it's solidy.  The physics are pretty darn good.  It is bare bones yes, but it is pretty cheap, so you can't really complain.  If the developers give some more options, it will be a fantastic game for any VR owner.  One little complaint I'll make is it seems you can't adjust where the table is in space, so it dictates to you where you stand in your playspace, so it had me pretty much backed to the edge of mine, I'd like the ability to adjust my perspective movement similar to pool nation.  I'm sure they will add this.Definite recommend at this price.Edit:  You can adjust the table on one axis before you start plaing.			"

If I was able to use my left hand to hold the ball and use the paddle on my right hand I think that would work a lot better.Graphically I would like to be in some exotic location rather than a plain Jane gymnasium. For instance, a Tron environment with some good music pumping in more of an arcade mode would be more fun to me.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has several issues which make it not worth the purchase, even at a $5 price tag.1. Serving.  The serve mechanics are extremely awkward with the ball attached to the same controller as the paddle.  This makes it very difficult to serve.  The ball should be in the other hand so you can have the paddle in any position and orientation you choose at the time the ball launches.2. Multiple balls on the table.  if a ball goes in the net, it is not removed before the next ball starts into play.  This can get very distracting.  Hearing multiple ball bounces makes it more difficult to guage speed and timing.3. Spin.  I am very surprised that there are positive reviews that comment on how great the spin mechanics are.  I would be surprised if spin is accounted for at all.  I am a very experienced ping pong player and I was never able to impart any spin on the ball.  Quite the opposite, it seemed to me as if the balls motion was very dumb, only using the orientation of the paddle to determine a reflection angle.  This meant every top spin shot went straight down into the table, every backspin shot popped straight up and attempts to slice side spin were fruitless.If you are just interested in a very basic demo and you are a novice player who just likes to pop the ball up a little onto the other side of the table, this game will work fine for you.  But if you are looking for a simulation of actual ping pong, this game is not there yet.			"

												Even with the hype of a million suns, this game stood out as THE most brain-tricky of any VR game I've played.  As a casual ponger, I feel COMPLETELY satisfied with the physics of the game.  The haptic response is silly, how good it is; you can feel that tight sort of pinch when you execute a good spin the way it actually feels on the physical paddle.  Magicians at work is what we have here.  Couple that with a bombin' and bumpin' soundtrack (read: ""song"" -- it's also a shame you can't use your own music library atm), some sweet digs to play in, and a complete multiplayer experience (some audio and video lag have been very common so far, but I've only logged a couple hours -- it's possible I've just gotten really bad luck) and you have a very good VR release backed by developers who appear to have developed a regular cadence for updating the game and listening to players.  Great work all around.			"

								Afer update- WOWHuge improvement in physics. I can play as close to my real game as any of these VR apps can get (so far.) I can hit hard with top spin, slice, even made some shots from behind my back out of desperation. Touch is working. I like the fact that you can ""feel"" the ball on your paddle. You have to exaggerate this a little bit, but it's quite close. Maybe a fraction of a second less, and a little more grip from the ball when you really get a hold of it with topspin- but again, this is by far the best one.I wish this would incorporate the cool tournament that one of the other games has. Now with multipplayer coming, it's even getting better.8.5 stars. If that fraction of a difference from real life control gets there, adding some new locations, a crowd and a tournament, I will give it a 10.			"

								TLDR: Best Ping Pong VR so far, worth the $ and support the developer, but still has a long way to go.My review is going to be ""harsh"" because I am trying to give ideas for improvements. The game is actually very good with a lot of things done right.It took me a while to translate my real world skill to the VR game. Topspin (hitting the ball angled over the ball) seems to be very challenging with the orientation of the controller and in game detection. I couldn't figure out how to consistently put spin on the ball aside from on a serve. (Such as a horizontal or vertical chop when hitting the ball back).Improvements:Real ping pong competition rules. Have to serve behind the table (I can reach over real far and hit the ball from right near the net). To serve, the ball must be thrown 16cm into the air and hit from the air. Implement service lets.One more AI level, one that hits the ball close to you. Currently, even Legendary AI hits the ball and it lands halfway on my side. I can play standing at the table to hit everything back - this is unrealistic.Great job by the developer. I'm looking forward to multiplayer.			"

Early Access Review
								I previously had written a harsh review of this game mainly aimed at the physics, however it has now been updated.Since the most recent update the game really does feel like a ping pong game. I was finally able to complete the wave mode without missing a ball, and beat some opponents. The ball weight and spin feels natural, and all of my ""signature moves"" from real life worked as I would expect them to, which was really great.It is not quite perfect yet, but that's why it is early access. I think this game is worth the price and is going to be a lot of fun as the developer adds more features.In fact,  I find myself liking the waves feature more than anything now that the physics are real enough to play naturally.

								Just gave it a quick spin and I have to give props to devs. This was quite amazing. I was playing ping pong quite a lot back in the days and was really looking forward to try some ping pong game with Vive. Well, I must say Ping Pong Waves is better than I ever thought ping pong could be in VR. It's incredibly realistic and just a pure joy to play. feels like I have my very own ping pong table in the house :)I have only two critics: 1. graphics contrasts could be turned down a bit (bright-dark contrasts are too strong)2. I oftem accientaly press menu button. That's not a big problem on itself, but the game doesn't pause when the menu is on and I lost quite a few balls this way. So yeah, it would be nice if pressing the menu button would pause the game as well.Anyway, great game, well worth its price!			"

								Very important note for Win 8.1 users.  I nearly refunded this game because everytime I served or returned the ball it would fly off into the air - just could not control shots at all because it was impossible to hit the ball softly.  Totally unplayable.  I wanted to support the VR community though so I held on to it.  Recently after upgrading to Win 10 before the deadline expired I tried again - perfect handling!  I could suddenly see why so many people liked the game now.  Absolute night and day.  Is now a very fun game that I enjoy immensely.  So key message is, upgrade to Win 10 if you don't want this game to 'pong' any more.  It now smells very good...  mmm the delicious smell of balls.  pingpong ones I mean!			"

								I would like to ammend my previous reviewWhen I first tried the game, I found it lacking.  The physics weren't right, and while it looked nice, the game didn't actually play like ping pong, which I found frustrating.However, I was too quick to judge, especially as the game was in early access.  The developer has shown that they are working on the physics and are pushing to make the game more realistic and better as they move towards final release.While it still has work to do, I see that they are working on it and there is good potential.  If the developer continues thier efforts, I see this becoming a great game.			"

								Firstly, WHERE IS THE DOOR IN THE LOFT? AM I TRAPPED PLAYING PING PONG FOREVER? hahaHaving played both Ping Pong VR experiences on Steam, this one is easily the best. Very realistic environment. The physics are almost spot on, and allowed me to do fast, pro shots with what almost felt like top-spin. The other game felt like a cheap gimmick compared to this.Haptic feedback on the vive controllers are pretty good but could be better. If Valve can make a bow & arrow feel realistic then hopefully this dev can do the same with a ping pong bat :) Either way, the other ping pong game does not have haptic feedback at all, so this is much better!The difficulty levels of the AI are great, I managed to have a tough point-for-point match on the World Class difficulty (and I get smashed on the difficulty above it, 'Legendary'). I imagine even better players than I may want harder difficulties though.The AI bat needs some swing animation when hitting the ball to make it feel a bit more realistic.The environment is nice, the music is calming, the bed has been slept in. I am genuinely excited for more environments, say on top of a city skyscraper at night? The views would be fantastic and I would love to smash ping pong balls off the edge of a building and not worry about consequences!I attempted the Multiplayer component briefly, but a Windows Firewall prompt appeared on my Desktop and I wasn't aware of it in the VR headset. Only found out after stopping the game that that was why it wasn't working. I am sure it will work now that I have clicked Allow on the prompt.8.5/10, will play this for hours.			"

								Amazing game. Spot on physics! If you like ping pong, buy it. It takes some getting used to with how to hold the controller kind of on it's side in your hand, but once you get that right it is spot on. Cool background, but would be awesome if there weren't jaggys on the edges of the white net and table, developer needs to clean up those edges because you're staring at them constantly. Also multiplayer needs to get off the ground, match making has never worked for me. But besides that this is a solid game. It's actually making me better at realy life ping pong and I vs guys at work that are pretty damn good.			"

												Very very funny game!Great phisics and great AI, that makes mistakes and good shots in a realistic manner.Maybe it could be introduce an option to ""regulate"" the position of the racket/controller, becouse with the oculus touch it is not so comfortable (you have to turn your touch to have better grip and realistic position).Nice nice job!

								I was so happy to see a pong game on the store, and when i saw the price i bought it.As many already pointed out. The physics takes a little to get use to, but when you start getting a hang of it, you will be making the back- forehand spins like a boss.I am currently struggling with the world champ AI and can see it will take many hours before i can beat it.Played a lot of this in real life and think that made my learning curve shorter.This went to my top played game in less than 24 hours. not much to do besides the 3 AI's and some waves, but don't know, i just keep hitting that ""new game"" after each match, wanting to beat that AI.Look forward to see what the devs will bring to the game in the future, but i can only recommend supporting this game and it's devs!Final conclusion: Price contra gameplay i would give it 8/10 , last notch up will be when they integrate multiplayer and overall get more scenes and content into the game.

												Physics is extremely realistic.  Feels like you are really playing Ping Pong with another player in real life.   The paddles feel like they have real rubber padding when hitting the ball.   When ball hits net it reacts just as it would in real life.   AI is very good and really fun to play.   Multiplayer is a little bugged at the moment.  There appears to be some animation lag in multiplayer.  You will see ball hitting to the player, it disappears, and then reappears after other player hits it.   Score gets glitched at times in multiplayer.  Haven't played enough to see if this happens with all multiplayer games.  But, single player and AI experience so far is excellent.  Highly recommend this game.  It is alot of fun and does not require a large play area.			"

								I have been playing table tennis for a couple of years; just enough to have a solid feel of the game. Naturally, my biggest concern for this game was how accurate the physics would be. I was hesitant to purchase this game when I read through the negative reviews, partly written by allegedly skilled real life table tennis players. In contrast, there are plenty of positive reviews claiming that the physics was spot-on. My first guess was that those were written by casual players, and this proved to be partly true when I finally played the game myself.The first couple of minutes are mind-blowing, the feeling of presence is very strong. This feeling lasts until you unconsciously try to spin the ball in situations you would normally do in real life: it doesn't work, the paddle isn't very sticky at all. This is by no means immersion-breaking but a subtle reminder that you're still playing a game. Aside from the spin, there are some other aspects that don't feel 100% right like the force applied to the ball relative to your swing, affecting the trajectory.But this is some next-level nitpicking and I'm sure many players out there won't even notice. For 5 bucks this is a title I can absolutely recommend. It's so much fun!			"

								It's table tennis, you might think that it's a money grab for new users to VR. Something to fulfull the current void of titles, a bit like the iPhone app rush when they first came out. You'd be wrong though, as luckily I was since I thought it looked polished enough that it might be good and I'd give it a go.It's excellent, and probably one of the first experiences I'll show others. Since almost everyone has played and understands table tennis, they can immediately relate to the experience and how accurately it matches real table tennis.The physics aren't absolutely spot on but they're close enough that you really won't notice unless you like catching it out. I noticed when I took a ball and bounced it on a paddle and let it slowly lose energy until it sits on the bat. There's a small noticable jump from bouncing to resting on the bat. There's also a lack of being able to front/back/side spin the ball which I really hope is added.I'm being picky though and being that this is in VR it's these details that are suddenly more obvious than on a 2d monitor.One thing: I'd love to see a 'free practice' mode where the serving rules are less strict as it took a little while to understand why we kept getting fouls when serving (you have to hit the ball forward on to your side first straight away, don't bounce it on the table first before hitting over the net). I guess I just didn't know the rules so that's my fault overall. I feel it would help new users and letting friends/family get a rally going without becoming confused.If you have a Vive and have played table tennis then this is a must buy in my opinion.			"

												This game improved A LOT since the last time I've tried it (on launch)! It looks GORGEOS and it plays GOOD! My paddle still misses ball now and then, but now it's much, MUCH more playable then ever before! The one thing I (personally) didn't like is difficulty levels. At ""Amateur"" AI serves like REAL amateur who took the paddle for the first time. But then it plays like a really robust player! It somehow manages to hit back all my twisted balls 100% time. That's not fair! :)Other than that - that's a BEST table tennis game out there. Period. :)			"

								As a man who takes his RL ping pong seriously and has hundreds of hours of muscle memory under the belt, I can say this game has now become a physics benchmark after recent updates! My skills in real life now translate pretty much exactly to this virtual world, and the online multiplayer works amazingly well. This is a must buy if you want to experience crazy exciting ping pong rallies with the most realistic physics around.			"

								Nice! It really feels like table tennis (at least 80% real)!Of course a table tennis pro might not like it.For me it's nice and I have been playing ping pong quite a few times in my life.The graphics is very good. But only one setting atm available.I was not able to try multiplayer, because there are not enough peoble online.The matches versus the AI work very good.So, spend the 5 bugs to try it and maybe I will have someone to play with!

								I don't know if I have left a review for this one yet. It's good. It's the game I load when I want to play VR but don't feel up for any other games... or in-between other games for some quick pong fun. A lot of times I will setup the Vive just to play this game for a while before bed.The ball physics are great. Multiplayer is hit-or-miss. The matchmaking could use some work, and it would be great to be able to hit a ball back to yourself while you wait for other players. There can be lag in MP, but most of the time it's not too big of an issue. About half the time (for me) there is no lag, and MP turns into TONS of fun. It's great just chilling, chatting it up and ping-pingitty-pongging with other people from around the world. Thanks!			"

								I'm really impressed with this little game. The physics of ping pong (slices, lifts etc.) is very well replicated and it genuinely feels like actually playing on a real table. This specific game got me really hyped with sports game on vr (and it wasn't my first at all).update: I've been playing more. Left a few match sessions yesterday night completely sweaty and filled with adrenaline after winning on 3rd difficulty, now 'legendary' difficulty awaits. Its ridiculous how realistic it feels. Even in its early access state I cannot recommend this game more, especially if you like racket games in general.			"

								I am glad of having tried this game. I remember playing ping pong at high school, like 20 years ago or so. Always wanted to buy my own table, but none of the flats I've lived were big enough. Also, I don't have any friends to play against with, so having my own table didn't make sense anyway.Ok, so this game kills both problems for less than £10.I was kinda afraid that the physics or the ball behaviour could be off, but it only took me a few matches to release that I was doing the same strategies, body motion and literally, playing the same than when I played in the real world.The only thing I am missing is having something to do while I'm waiting for someone to join to an online match. The game keeps me waiting doing nothing. Apart from that, this is a must have. Specially at this price!So far my review it's been about describing how is it like playing ping pong in VR, but that is something other ping pong games can give you.After September  2016's update this game has become the best one for me. The improvements they've put has all it needs.I have to be honest and say I was trying another ping pong game that has more configuration options, game modes and it's multiplayer seemed to work better, but after this update I've requested a refund for that other game.I hope that these guys keeps improving this game the way they've done this time.Yeah, I am missing some more locations, ball colors, avatar customization and perhaps more game options/fun, but it's a matter of time and I won't refuse a game with a solid fundations like this one. 100% recommended			"

								Firstly, WHERE IS THE DOOR IN THE LOFT? AM I TRAPPED PLAYING PING PONG FOREVER? hahaHaving played both Ping Pong VR experiences on Steam, this one is easily the best. Very realistic environment. The physics are almost spot on, and allowed me to do fast, pro shots with what almost felt like top-spin. The other game felt like a cheap gimmick compared to this.Haptic feedback on the vive controllers are pretty good but could be better. If Valve can make a bow & arrow feel realistic then hopefully this dev can do the same with a ping pong bat :) Either way, the other ping pong game does not have haptic feedback at all, so this is much better!The difficulty levels of the AI are great, I managed to have a tough point-for-point match on the World Class difficulty (and I get smashed on the difficulty above it, 'Legendary'). I imagine even better players than I may want harder difficulties though.The AI bat needs some swing animation when hitting the ball to make it feel a bit more realistic.The environment is nice, the music is calming, the bed has been slept in. I am genuinely excited for more environments, say on top of a city skyscraper at night? The views would be fantastic and I would love to smash ping pong balls off the edge of a building and not worry about consequences!I attempted the Multiplayer component briefly, but a Windows Firewall prompt appeared on my Desktop and I wasn't aware of it in the VR headset. Only found out after stopping the game that that was why it wasn't working. I am sure it will work now that I have clicked Allow on the prompt.8.5/10, will play this for hours.			"

								I consider my self a skilled, yet casual ping pong player. With just a slight adjustment I was comfortable playing the game in my preferred style. Never been so relaxed playing a VR game. The AI is decent, the second the highest level is pretty much perfect for my skill and ambition. Bring on more backgrounds and some more single player options and AI tweaks and this will be go-to game for a relaxing evening. Functional multiplayer would be icing on the cake. Certainly worth it for the price. Recommended. "

								Alot better then the other ping pong VR games I've tried, but needs some work done aswell.I think the option of increesed pixles or AA wouldn't hurt for those of us who can run it smoothly plus could you add the option or just up the haptic feedback, cause I barely feel it when I hit the ball.The paddle is also at a wierd angle so I have to hold the HTC vive control way up between the controls and the sensor up top to have a feeling of holding is straight. Would hurt to have some sort of a angleing mehanics of the paddle to get it the way it feels right your hand.Think those things need to be sorted first and then add some more enviroments and better opponents and maybe one day a 1vs1 multiplayer or 2vs2. But for now I think the previous stuff should get sorted first.All in all, a great expirience and was really fun to play!! If the other things get sorted I would gladly recommend it to anyone.			"

												Thumbs up for a good VR ping pong experience.  Only played for about 1/2 hour so far, but will be coming back for more.  Feels good to play.  Certainly worth its sale price right now (1/2).  Good as-is, but I think if the 'coming soon' menu options get filled, then  possibly worthy of must-buy VR status.  The ball physics and room 'feel', seem really good to me (I'm a gamer, and not a pro-TT player).Glad I picked it up, and playing more myself.  I think it also may stand up for a game that I will pull out to show others some of the wonders of what VR can do. "

												I've always considered one of the strengths of videogames to be either allowing you to do something that you could never do in real life, or to do something you could do in real life better than you ever actually could. VR has somewhat upended this assumption, as you can now play a game of perfectly ordinary table tennis with a high degree of realism. This is the point you find out you are objectively terrible at table tennis. Even with the AI on the very lowest setting I am embarrasingly awful at it. I find myself in a trendy New York loft apartment faced with some dude in a rabbit mask and he is kicking my♥♥♥♥♥ After enduring this a little while, I spend a moment checking out my excellently rendered surroundings and realise the trendy loft apartment has no door.

												Jesus it's amazing! Also good workout! Love it. I play table tennis a bit in my spare time so I am no pro. Not even amateur I think, but it's hell of fun! The Amateur AI is very good programmed and really feels like a humble and forgiving, yet accurate opponent who is still beatable for me. I was very surprised. Didn't try Multiplayer yet.			"

												I'm surprised this game is only $10. It's surprisingly relaxing just rallying with the AI since you don't have to chase the ball down. The last couple of weeks I have started my VR sessions with this.Some of the reviews have commented on the lack of updates since December, but I believe the devs are working on the psvr version and will incorporate those features when that's done. I'm satisfied with it as is and would recommend it regardless, but it's nice to know they're planning on adding more features.			"

												Feels oddly nice to play, even if you suck at it.  I never played real ping pong until after I played it in VR and was surprised by how natural it felt to me after some VR practice.  I hope they add some more environments because the one it ships with is pretty attractive to look at.			"

												I own both table tennis VR titles, and I prefer this one.  What makes this one special is the realistic AI opponent movements (motion capture?) and the 3D audio and sounds make me feel like I'm actually there.  The ping sounds of the ball actually match the balls location within the room, and the stereo on the right side of the room and the announcer voice on the left, really helps to place me in the room and gives the game great presence.  The physics of the ball and paddle also feels extremely real.  I think the minigames are a good start but seems like they aren't fully done making those (I consider them a bonus though).  I haven't tried multiplayer yet, I'm having too much fun just with the expressive AI opponent,			"

												seems about as good as a VR pong game can be given the current state of VR hardware. However,  i played on Oculus Touch and did have a few issues. For exmaple, its really ddifficult and unnatural to hold the touch controller as you would hold a paddle with the right hand, striking with the pal (not the back) of the paddle. the controller just isnt meant to be rotated in that way. this is an example of the vive controller'sbeing more verastile, since its just a stick you can hold however you like. cant do that with the touch controller.Problem number 2 is that even though I have a lrage playing space (12 feet X 10 feet), The default orentation of the game is such that I am always getting close enough to the wall for the chaperone/Guardian syste, to show up which is annoying. If I could rotate the in game world so that the ping pong table matches the longitudinal direction of my room, I will have less problems.  I know th egame allows you to move the table around, but there does not seem to be an option to rotate it. would be very helpful. Sucks that the touch controller just isnt mean tto be held like a ping pong paddle. In real life im pretty good but im♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game. Still, great game.			"

												I had the most realistic experience with it: I balanced the ball on the paddle and as it rolled on it, the vibration of the controller followed the ball! I know it sounds dumb to be amazed by this detail but I really felt the ball was on my hand. I tried it with the Rift. Amazing physics. I wouldn't have bought it if I had read the minimum requirements because it needs win 10 and I have win 7. The only problem was that I had to set the graphics to the minimum resolution or else the AI would always react too slowly and would never catch the ball (not stuttering or losing frames like the pc having problems, just moving in slow motion). The rest of the game would be fine, my hands, the ball, everything. My pc plays everything in max settings so I believe it had to do with me having an older version of the windows than the one needed.If you like table tennis, you are going to love this!UPDATE: Turns out that setting an Aero theme, fixes the slow motion thing! Thanks Hillary!			"

												This is the VR game I come back to daily. The physics are so satisfying and well done, this is a great game to just jump into for 20 minutes. Features are somewhat bare-bones, but I trust that a lot of things should be added in the future. I would however like to see updates come a bit more frequentlyA few things should be addressed:- There is an awful glitch where the ball falls through the floor in multiplayer. There is no way to reset the game, so you need to exit the match and restart. It really screws up the flow of the game.- A more gradual increase in AI difficulty. I have over 20 hours in this game and I can barely ever beat semi-pro.- More environments are said to be on the horizon, I can't wait for that. The ability for user generated backgrounds would be great as well.- More efficient matchmaking. I sometimes sit around for 10 minutes before I get matched with somebody.For these shortcomings, I still can't recommend this game enough. Nothing matches it for replayability on the vive. It's so simple, but so immersive.			"

												One of the best video game experiences I have ever had. The realism at an awesome level. I am fairly experienced in real life ping pong. At first the difference of the controller vs a racket seems off and the underspin seems difficult to master compared to real life, and the jerking movements of a real life smash may jostle your headset an uncomfortable amount. Everything else is great though. I don't go out of my way to go to the gym and play ping pong anymore because I can play here. It is real enough for me and I can't wait to see where this goes. A must own for any Vive owner interested or with a past in table tennis.			"

Even the freaky AI guy, is way better when he starts moving and you can see a nutty room mate playing with you instead.*Give options to change the AI mask.

												If you like ping pong, you need to own this.  In the first few minutes, I thought it wasn't amazing, but merely good.  Essentially, once you are used to the controller, this is flawless ping pong.  I liken it to buying a new paddle and learning to use it over the paddle you've been using.  There's a slight adjustment, and then you're just in it, and it feels real.(despite the nightmare Donnie Darko creature you are playing against.)			"

												Thumbs up for a good VR ping pong experience.  Only played for about 1/2 hour so far, but will be coming back for more.  Feels good to play.  Certainly worth its sale price right now (1/2).  Good as-is, but I think if the 'coming soon' menu options get filled, then  possibly worthy of must-buy VR status.  The ball physics and room 'feel', seem really good to me (I'm a gamer, and not a pro-TT player).Glad I picked it up, and playing more myself.  I think it also may stand up for a game that I will pull out to show others some of the wonders of what VR can do. "

												This game is absolutely fantastic. I've probably spent more time playing this than all other VR experiences combined, and I'm not even a fan of table tennis :)  The physics is remarkably spot on, with spins and everything, and there is a very nice haptic feedback in the controller, too. AI is pretty good to offer a variety of challenges. Multiplayer mode is unfortunately greatly hindered internet connection speed (not a developers' fault) and makes the game practically unplayable in that mode.Interestingly enough, since I suck at table tennis, I looked for some tips online on how to improve game. I applied these real-life tips (ranging from the focus on the leg movement to paying attention to improve backhand control) to a VR game and it worked great: I quickly managed to improve a level and then two of the AI. I wonder if these VR gains improved my real-life game: something I will try soon.Apart from trying to somehow improve multiplayer, I can only wish for more superficial stuff: more environments, more tables types, stuff like that.

The Devs seems to be really active on the Discussion board and have cool changes planned for the game.  Tip #1 - I found practicing with the AI before going to the menu was a great way to skill up.  I finally beat him after about an hour of practice and game.  Tip #2 - you need to be in the menu to change the grip of the paddle.Can't wait for other rooms for this game.  Anyway, thumbs up, this is a great use of VR and a great game to show your friends (just make sure the playspace is greater than arms reach away from your desk).			"

												This is my first ever review and I feel compelled to write this because the game is so damn good. The most fun I've had on the Vive and it feels incredibly reaslitic. Multiplayer is also a lot of fun - just needs a leaderboard now and perhaps some ranks to match people evenly. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a fun and realistic VR game to play.			"

												Giving this a positive for the physics, the best ball physics I've seen in VR (not perfect in all shots but pretty close).The rest of the game doesn't have a ton of features (the minigames seem to last about 20-30 seconds, I would prefer if the challenges went on much longer or infinitely to just practice those shots, it's difficult to get into a groove when you spend half the time restarting them).Tried one multiplayer game and the opponent quit due to ping (not meant as the first half to a pun).Looking forward to some new features and locations in the future.

												I'm capable at social table-tennis.... so when the first handful of rallies saw me over and underhitting wildly, I was tempted to ragequit! But my pride wouldn't let me, so I tried to learn the weight and power, and strange ""impactless"" qualities of my new bat. For the Oculus touch, it seems the controller has to be held at a strange angle - which can lead to some positioning glitches.... but once I figured out how to hold the controller for best effect, it was all good!The physics of the ball are amazing, and I can see myself having some seriously long ""low-intensity aerobics"" sessions on this game in the future! WARNING: Be sure everyone around you knows you're playing and likely to flail your arms without notice! "

												What wizardry did you use to create this? It's just perfect! As a longtime fan of table tennis I can whole heartedly recommend this one! The tracking is great, and everything from the haptics to the way the ball reacts to your hits just feels... right. If you have a VR headset and are even mildly interested in table tennis, this is a must own! So happy to support devs who obviously care about this new medium.			"

												Actually its a really good table tennis game. Feels real. Even though I really hated the look of strange horror movie mask AI opponent, and the mini games are poorly made and implemented, I just grow to actually like this. Even the freaky AI guy, is way better when he starts moving and you can see a nutty room mate playing with you instead.*Give options to change the AI mask. Make a few more environments (coming soon) and clean up the terrible mini games and its a really good game in the pile of VR dross. Recommended* "

												I have tracking issues with the Oculus Rift with the experimental 2 sensor room setup but I have tracking issues on most SteamVR games at the moment, so this isn't a con of this game. I love this game even though the tracking drops out periodically. I am going to pick up a third sensor soon and hopefully that will fix things.This game has a really cool looking room for the pong room, if they added a some different rooms maybe in some extreme environments like the top of a mountain, or inside a fiery volcano, or outside in a field or in a lush forest that would be a really cool addition to the game.

												I think this game is great, defenitly worth my money. It would be nice if you could add some people around it, or a function to change the opponents appeareance, and maybe change the scenery as well (I know you can, but it all says coming soon). The scoring system is also broken when playing with the AI, it is impossible for me to get points and only the AI gets points. But other than that I think it's an amazing game. I would defenitley recommend this game, one of the best I have seen for VR. (I didn't get this game for free but I got it for a discounted price)			"

												One of the best video game experiences I have ever had. The realism at an awesome level. I am fairly experienced in real life ping pong. At first the difference of the controller vs a racket seems off and the underspin seems difficult to master compared to real life, and the jerking movements of a real life smash may jostle your headset an uncomfortable amount. Everything else is great though. I don't go out of my way to go to the gym and play ping pong anymore because I can play here. It is real enough for me and I can't wait to see where this goes. A must own for any Vive owner interested or with a past in table tennis.			"

												I usually play Elite Dangerous or DCS world as they are the best VR supporting titles (Project Cars works too, but I'm not really into racing ) that actually are more than a demo.Table tennis is however a very good example of a type of game that works perfectly in VR, but will not work on a screen.When you play Eleven: Table Tennis VR, you feel like actually playing the real thing. I did nto play for a lot of years, but my moves are slowly comming back. The things I learned with an actual table work in VR. This is amazing. I'M getting better every time I play this. I suggest not to call this a computer game, as it is actually more a sport.			"

Early Access Review
								Much better since their latest physics update. Once (if) this gets multiplayer it's going to be a fine game.2017 update: Well, the game ultimately implemented a multiplayer component and it really does change the dynamic of the game for the better. I can't tell you how cool it is to play a few games against people from all over the world whenever I want. Multiplayer games just feel different in VR. This demo, specifically the multiplayer component, is a great show for VR newbies as it lets them see the craziness of where the technology is. My one gripe, and it is minimal, is that the audio in the multiplayer lags at what appears the be the same lag as the video. 30ms is doable for ping pong, but for having a back and forth conversation it can ruin the natural rythms. Humans are extremely sensitive to speech timing Way in the weeds, I know, but if you play multiplayer and try to have a conversation you will immediately know what I am describing. Seems like a thing other games have fixed or optimized... Buy this game. It's 10 dollars. Play it for two hours. Thank me. Continue playing.			"

												This game is absolutely on point!!! I cannot imagine what a table tennis simulator could make better at all! I play table tennis since my youth and the feeling of the size and weight of the vive controller fits a real paddle very good. The vibration when the ball hits the paddle feels just like real and can be configured. Also the realtion between the vive controller and the simulated paddle can be freely customized. The ball physics are very good.The only negative points are graphical decisions... why do I have to play against Donny Darko all the time? ;) Some more enemy skins would be very nice!			"

It feels real.Congratulation to the developers. This has become my favorite game. So much fun. Tip: At start up on rift, go to settings and rotate the wrist of 90 degree to get the racket correctly in your hand. For the developer: In multiplayer mode, sometimes (about 1%) I win (or lose) a point but no (point win/lost) sound is played, you see the ball on the floor and nobody can have a ball to play the next point. Only solution is to exit the party.When waiting in multiplayer, the AI sometimes moves to amateur (I missed a few services) but then never seems to back up when winning.To Oculus: consider this game as a must have in your store.

												This game seems to be a pretty good vr version of table tennis, but it needs an easier AI. As a person who has never played table tennis I just got incredibly frustrated as the AI Player never screws up a serve and routinely would return my best exchanges of volleys up to 8 or 10 returns. If you're good at table tennis already or are willing to lose dozens of games before seeing any improvement then sure buy this, the rest of us shouldn't bother.			"

If you've ever played table tennis in your life this is a must have: so far it's basically the only ""real life"" sport that is close to being 100% replicated in VR (physics are pretty good!). There are some tiny limitations (failing to hit balls that I definitely would have hit in real life), but it's hard to say whether the game or the 1st gen VR hardware is at fault.			"

												I had the most realistic experience with it: I balanced the ball on the paddle and as it rolled on it, the vibration of the controller followed the ball! I know it sounds dumb to be amazed by this detail but I really felt the ball was on my hand. I tried it with the Rift. Amazing physics. I wouldn't have bought it if I had read the minimum requirements because it needs win 10 and I have win 7. The only problem was that I had to set the graphics to the minimum resolution or else the AI would always react too slowly and would never catch the ball (not stuttering or losing frames like the pc having problems, just moving in slow motion). The rest of the game would be fine, my hands, the ball, everything. My pc plays everything in max settings so I believe it had to do with me having an older version of the windows than the one needed.If you like table tennis, you are going to love this!UPDATE: Turns out that setting an Aero theme, fixes the slow motion thing!

												As a single player game, I really enjoyed this - the controls feel really intuitive; just pick up the bat and play.  The AI is also good fun to play against, and at the higher levels is extremely tough to beat.  The multi player side however sucks.  I regularly had to wait 10 mins plus for anyone else to appear as there just aren't enough players using this game for the match-making to work.  This isn't the fault of the developer; just a limitation of the size of the player base in VR at the moment.  Even when there is someone else there though, the lag makes the game almost unplayable as the ball jerks about, vanishing from view then reappearing as it crosses the net; for a fast paced game like this that relies on players reading the motion of the ball and opposing player, it just doesn't work.The bottom line though is that the game is worth the money just for the single player - buy it.

												First thing that I thought was how good the physics feel, just feels natural from the first go....has a good to look to the game and intuitive from the start.Playing the multi-player mode is really good fun, you can talk to the other player through the mic too, I didn't even realise the Vive had a mic on it until I played this, so that was a nice surprise........Would be nice to have a few more arenas types to play in but that would be only a small criticism from me for what is overall a very good fun game you get.Oh and finally what a good price, its nice to see reasonable priced VR games out there so it made this a no-brainer for me to buy.

												This game seems to be a pretty good vr version of table tennis, but it needs an easier AI. As a person who has never played table tennis I just got incredibly frustrated as the AI Player never screws up a serve and routinely would return my best exchanges of volleys up to 8 or 10 returns. If you're good at table tennis already or are willing to lose dozens of games before seeing any improvement then sure buy this, the rest of us shouldn't bother.			"

												It feels like real ping pong, the AI is fun, the multiplayer works great. Only thing I would recommend to the devs is putting an actual radio station selection as the music gets pretty mundane. I know you can turn it off but would be nice to have the option for public stations.			"

												As a single player game, I really enjoyed this - the controls feel really intuitive; just pick up the bat and play.  The AI is also good fun to play against, and at the higher levels is extremely tough to beat.  The multi player side however sucks.  I regularly had to wait 10 mins plus for anyone else to appear as there just aren't enough players using this game for the match-making to work.  This isn't the fault of the developer; just a limitation of the size of the player base in VR at the moment.  Even when there is someone else there though, the lag makes the game almost unplayable as the ball jerks about, vanishing from view then reappearing as it crosses the net; for a fast paced game like this that relies on players reading the motion of the ball and opposing player, it just doesn't work.The bottom line though is that the game is worth the money just for the single player - buy it.

												Everything about this VR game is great except for 1 major negative aspect. Read on:This is a spectacular ping pong VR game with incredibly realistic physics. The only complaint that I have - and one that keeps on consistently coming from family and friends who play this on my machine, is for crying outloud why there is such a horrifying Donnie Darko rabbit mask as the opponent. What's the relevance of this terrifying rabbit and how does it fit into this game and environment at all? Was this a conscious design choice? Could the devs please offer other or additional opponent avatar options so my family and friends will buy this game???			"

												Great game, physics are very realistic once some settings are tweaked. On sale price makes this more than worth it. Playing people online is a blast. Only complaint is the developer is taking forever to release the new environments and game modes. This has been out almost a year and even one developer should have been able to accomplish the full release by now.			"

												This is my favorite tabletop tennis game so far. It is not as polished and doesn't have as many options as some (like Paddle Up), but the physics are smoother, and that's vastly more important in this kind of VR game, I think. I really enjoy Paddle Up as well, but I think the two definitely have different strengths, and if accurate, stable, consistent physics is a priority for you, and you don't mind skimping on a few features, then I think this one is a good investment.

												I haven't played it a ton, but I really, really like this game. All table tennis games that are not VR with a motion control have been disappointing, but this feels completely rewarding, although it is hard. The only negatives are that games with a bad ping are almost unplayable, and I would like there to be an even easier AI for new players. But even with those provisos, it's such a blast you guys. It is one of my two favorite VR games, along with a driving sim.			"

												I honesty believe this would be awesome if you'd never played Table Tennis before, or didn't mind changing/losing your skills.It's very accurate at what it does, but plays nothing like the real thing.Holding the paddle, from what I can see, is in a fixed position, so I had to hold the controller awkwardly to play how I play. Serving is strange, and not feeling the ball hit the paddle so you can put spin on it it strange.As I said, I bet it wouldh be a great game had I not played the real thing and honed a play style before playing the VR version.

												Wow what a fantastic game. As an avid table tennis player I have to report thatplaying this on my oculus touch is incredibly realistic. I actually forget that I havea controller in my hand and it just feels like the bat and i'm playing in RL. Can't wait for more locations/sprites to play against. It's so damn cheap too so if you're on the fence and like table tennis I highly recommend. OK...time to work onmy serve!			"

There are a few bugs but they are well worth the effort.  The haptic feedback, the graphics, the audio.  It's all amazing.  I have been playing for one day, and my current play time is 12 hours.

												Great to play a VR game that successfully emulates the real thing. It's really hard at first, but you'll be surprised at how quickly your skill level increases. The easiest AI seems difficult at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's satisfying to start winning against it, and wonder why you found it so hard to begin with. A bit like driving or riding a bike in that regard. What I love about this game is that when you lose a point, you blame yourself rather than dodgy physics or a cheating CPU character - the physics really are on-point.On the minus side, it's a bit buggy. The ball gets stuck somewhere after some points, then you need to go back to the main menu and start again. Also, the repetitive music coming from the in-game stereo becomes annoying after a while. It would be great to be able to stick some MP3s into a folder somewhere and have those play instead.			"

												Great table tennis simulator, ball and paddle physics seem spot on. I wish the mini-games/practice modes didn't pop immediately back to the menu once they're complete. Maybe could show a high score list on the TV to the left? Feels very jarring immediately going back to the menu.Only tried multiplayer once (got my♥♥♥♥♥whupped ha), but it seemed latency free and was very responsive. TBH I thought something like table tennis would need to be too fast to have accurate online mulitplayer, but it felt perfect.			"

												AI is terrible; is not able to return any serves so winning against a 'Legendary' AI opponent is as easy as winning against a 'Very easy' AI opponent. So playing online is the only alternative. Played some nice games there but also found matches where opponent was just clowning around (hiding under the table) or leaving games half way when they were losing.So please fix the AI opponents ... or take it out all together and promote it solely as a online game with maybe some kind of competition possibilities ...ED: I was contacted by the dev shortly after this review. Seems like it is a bug that is only affecting me. I hope it will get fixed though; just trashed my AI legendary opponent again by 11-6. As it is obviously only my problem, I change my recommendation to Yes and hope it will work for me sometime. I am enjoying the online game :)			"

Product received for free
												There are still some concerns but judging from the amount of Vive usage that I've put on this game there must be a reason for it being so addictive. The replay option is nice. You have done a good job!Things I'd like to see.1. Adjustable time from finished point to AI serving. I know you decreased it, but I'd like it even shorter.2. Option to reset just one point back. On occasion a match gets stuck and you have to start a new match. This would also be good if tracking is lost during a point. It rarely happens and I don't think the game is to blame but it would be a good feature when it does.3. Option to adjust audio relative to visuals. No one else seems to be bothered by this but I have been playing without audio from day one because I don't think it is in sync with the visuals. The haptic is perfect and has been enough but sound would be fun.			"

												Very simple and well done Table tennis game. Unfortunately, the adversary AI does not catch balls, even on the highest difficulty. In about 10 games i played vs this AI, it only catched a ball once. It is so rare that i was not expecting it and i didn't catch it back. Other than that, velocity and physics are realistic. I'm not a good Table Tennis player, but it reminds me when i was 16 playing with my best friend.Other than that, i think there is a bug regarding the ""Waves"" mini-games. Sometimes, the ball does not hit the table and the game just seems bugged since the next waves are not continuing.I would welcome a kind of automatic response for training, where the ball always come back like if you had a good and kind player in front of you, wich is not this actual AI who doesn""t catch any ball.Overall, great game. Just need a bit more of polishing and it will be perfect.			"

												** Edited and changed this to a positive review now.Originally negative, simple reason was down to how long it takes to make a multiplayer matchup. There's no lobby system, it's just click quick match and wait. It can take 30-40 minutes to find a game. I guess there just aren't many people playing.The game itself is OK, quite realistic, feels quite intuitive the ball responds to the bat as it should. It just gets a bit boring playing against the computer all the time.Since my original review, it seems to have gotten quicker to get a multiplayer match. My brother downloaded the game and he loves it. He had problems with C++ redist not being installed, but the developer replied almost instantly to solve the problem. Great service :-)			"

												Absolutely great physics. It takes an hour or so to re-learn your muscle-memory, after that, it's friggin' awesome.We do however need more players, and the netcode needs a serious fix. Look at how Rocket League (actually not a great example, but acceptable) and even small indie titles does it. You need to add prediction code to a game which demands close to no-lag response.Prediction code, prediction code, prediction code. And REGION servers.That said, I still recommend it. Because the physics are great. You can spin and curve, just like in real life. Just takes a bit adjustment.This might mess up my real-life game xD			"
