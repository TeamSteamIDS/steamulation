												I will admit it is very nice to see some sports games on Steam, and while I wasn't expecting a whole lot (I paid a whole 3 bucks for the game) I started off really enjoying the experiance but that turned quickly.First, it does look like a nice game. I ran it at full everything and it never saw a chug or hiccup. The lighting was done well and you felt like you were actually boxing. Fighting in Russia saw snowflakes and in Vegas tonnes of flashing lights.It's the little things that get to you after grinding the career mode. Firstly, it's a grind. If you win the first belt quickly you will need to replay the same tournement a few more times to earn the credits to level up your character to stand a chance in the later stages. But by the time you've done that the game's terrible AI flaws are very apparent and you won't need half the stats.Start with a block, jab until your stamina is gone. Block and repeat. You have no actual need for uppercuts/crosses at all. No matter when you knock someone down, you get the same animation as they teleport to the middle of the ring and all replays have what I can figure as sneaker shoe sounds. This is boxing, not basketball.But the MAJOR gripe I have. In BOXING you knock an opponent down 3 times... TKO. Real Boxing doesn't have that. I knocked one guy down 5 times in ONE ROUND...... That alone makes me not want to recommend the game. They spent more times working on the giggle of the breasts of the ring girl then googling how Boxing is done.			"

												Well, er. Boxing fans don't exactly have a whole lot to choose from when it comes to Steam games, do they? The truth is, until the Fight Night series makes its way to Steam, this is the best we're going to get. The unfortunate thing is that the ""best"" isn't really that good. GameplayThe game plays very similarly to a dumbed-down version of... You guessed it - Fight Night. Fighter movement is controlled with the left stick whilst the punches are mapped to directions on the right stick, or alternatively the face buttons. Left and right shoulder buttons are used for the high-low modifier and block, respectively, whilst tapping the right shoulder button lightly allows for a dodge. Both you and your opponent have a health and a stamina bar. Big punches such as uppercuts do more damage but drain more stamina, whilst jabs … You get the drift. Dodging a punch successfully results in a Matrix-like slowdown that allows you to get a solid counter-hit in for extra damage and less stamina. The fight goes on until one person knows the other person down and they stay down for a full 10 seconds, or a decision is reached at the end of however many rounds you set it to. It’s the bare bones for any game that tries to call itself a boxing simulator, although the aforementioned issues prevent it from really being a good game.  Poor dodging system - Real Boxing only allows you to dodge in a single direction (i.e. you cannot influence the direction you’re dodging), so the only thing that’s required of the player is timing. The problem is that the dodge comes out so slowly that you literally have to press it before the opponent’s attack comes out. It turns the skill/reflex-intensive dodging system of Fight Night and turns it into a skill-less guessing game  Poor high-low system – Since there’s no high-low blocking system, holding the block button will block both high and low attacks. What’s worse, unlike Fight Night, where punching the head does more damage whilst punching to the body does less damage but drains more stamina from the opponent (the so-called “money in the bank” approach in boxing), Real Boxing makes no such distinction. It’s almost pointless that they bothered to include body punches at all in this game.  Button-mashing - You can get through the entire game with button mashing. At no point in the game did I feel that throwing one particular punch was more effective than throwing any other. I beat the first opponent in the game the same way I beat the last opponent – mashing.  Shallow career mode – Literally has you fight one opponent after another, earning cash whilst buying upgrades. Rinse and repeat until you become the supreme champion of the universe or some ♥♥♥♥. Every so often you’re allowed to do a “training mini-game” in order to increase your stats as well. Speaking of which…  Tedious mini-games - There are 3 training mini-games, each improving a separate stat (strength, stamina and speed). Unfortunately, all three are essentially glorified quick-time events, and very easy. It’s incredibly repetitive and tedious, but necessary in order to improve your boxer’s stats  Poor multiplayer implementation – Purely online matchmaking. No local multiplayer or even the ability to host a game against a friend. I can’t comment further because quite frankly I never got a game going.Overall, the issue is that the game boils down to a skill-independent, button-mashing affair. I’ve figured out the secret to the game. You ready?If opponent has worse stats than you – Mash anything. You can’t lose.If opponent has equal or better stats than you – Hold block. Wait for opponent to drain his stamina, then mash anything. Rinse, repeat.PresentationI have to admit that the game does look quite pretty for an indie title. Character models look realistic, even if the models are fairly bland. Supports 1920x1080 resolution, which is nice. Sound effects are adequate. Sadly lacks any real music outside of the nauseating entrance music that plays when your boxer walks towards the ring. A single commentator is present for the game, and whilst it’s a nice touch, he appears to only have approximately 10 lines and uses them all at the wrong time. Be prepared as he calls every one of your uppercuts a jab and a complete one-sided pounding as the “Fight of the decade”. Overall ImpressionI’m an indie gamer at heart. Because of that, I hate games like this. I hate that games like this exist because it’s an example of an indie game making a strictly inferior version of a AAA game like Fight Night and dumbing down all the mechanics and depth whilst hiding behind the fact that it’s an “indie” game. Indie games should never, ever be strict downgrades of AAA games. Unfortunately, as I said before, us Steam gamers looking for a chance to practice the art of the sweet science aren’t exactly spoilt for choice. This is the best boxing game on Steam right now, and if that’s what you’re looking for then I would recommend you give it a shot. For everyone else though, stay away.			"

												Do not be put off by all the negative reviews comparing this game to Electronic Art's Fight Night series of games. Fight Night is a AAA Sports title created by a developer who has a long history of developing boxing games, and it costed 6-times as much as this game. Of course Fight night going to be better, but that does not mean Real Boxing is not an enjoyable game worth it's $10 price tag.Real Boxing Is more arcade than simulation, and there is not a lot of depth, but the action is fast paced and the multiplayer mode should be entertaining for hardcore boxing fans, at least in short spurts.  The single player career mode is basic, and there are not all that many different characters to fight against, but the mode exists. There are options for editing the appearance of your boxer, but you do not seem to be able to edit your boxer's name, which is a little bit annoying.Aside from that, there are also the standard training mini games that you would expect to see in a boxing game. These mini games require you to press the right-stick in a certain direction in time with the on-screen cues. As you might guess the mini games become repetitive very quickly (but so did the mini games in fight Night).The in-ring boxing action is not very simulation-like, but it's not exactly the mindless button-masher other reviews make it out to be.  You can throw all the punches you would expect (using either an anolog stick or the buttons) but there is no option for using dirty tactics such as headbutts or low blows. You can grab and clinch your opponent, but only when your energy drops below a certain level. Blocking is done with a single button, and it automatically blocks head or body shots as needed. You can also use a perfectly timed press of the block button to slip an opponents punch, creating a slow-motion effect allowing you an extra moment to throw a counter punch. There is no bobbing/weaving. There is no way to take a knee if your getting pummled, and there is no option for switching from orthodox to southpaw stance.Pros:- Fast paced action with easy to pick-up controls- Decent looking graphics and presentation for a budget title- Online multiplayer boxing matches- Commentary is repetitive but sounds good for an arcade boxing experience- it's the only (somewhat realistic) boxing game on SteamCons:- Boxer movement/footwork is not very smooth- Small roster of characters - No real world boxers- Short/uninspired single-player career mode- No matchmaking options for the online multiplayer modeThe bottom line is that it's not exactly a great game, but it's the best boxing game I have on my PC. The game will not have much appeal for most gamers, but hardcore boxing fans will probably find it fun being able to swap leather with other players now and then. It's not Fight Night Champion, but it's actually better than I had expected it to be.			"

												Sluggish, bothersome, stuttering...and that´s the nice things.No really.. the pace is so slow you think the fighters aren´t moving at all. The animation is standard at best, stuttering and ugly at worst. Also the ""career"" itself is a joke, with tournaments aligning one fight after the other, with just marginally different fighters/animations.That you have to ""buy"" nearly everything from customization to your skills is the bothersome part.Can´t really see much good about this game, except that the low price is fitting to its quality.

												REAL BOXING- This may not be Fight Night but let's face it, EA Sports has all but abandoned the PC player with no sport titles except FIFA, what about Madden, NHL and Fight Night for PC, oh well.. I have this boxing game (REAL BOXING) on my iphone and I enjoy it, here on the PC version they have removed the micro transactions and given you the ability to move around the ring which is something that feels added because that part of the game just seems a little sluggish, there are no Muhammad Ali dancing masters here just flat footed Rocky Balboa type club fighters. But I have to say this is the best ""PC"" boxing game I have ever played and will gladly support it in hopes we get more Boxing games on PC. The graphics are good, the game supports both keyboard and controller inputs, I like that you can adjust the number of rounds and length of rounds.  There is a quick fight or a career mode, in career mode you can customize and train your fighter to improve his attributes, (although you cannot rename them* UPDATE- The Devs say you can rename the fighter when you create them, click in the box with the name and retype the one you want), there is also multiplayer which is nice and I look forward to. I do not care too much for the in game music or the lame commentator, however the punch sound effects are decent.  I would like to point out that although the Ring Card Girls do seem to have nice physics for their breasts the game really could work on Presentation and Fighter Damage. I would really like to see the DEVs work on and add various cuts, fighter fatigue, some swelling, better footwork, corner men working on fighters between rounds, camera men outside the ring, better fight commentary, a in the ring referee, and ability to change fighter name and face. I will say that I did have a great 12 round fight last night that was very close, I knew this going into the last round and was worried, I did win on points!  I am really hoping that the DEV Team continue to update this game, there is some great potential here and a wide open market for it, now if we could only get someone to make good hockey game! So if you are on the fence I would say get it, it's your best PC option for boxing right now and a decent game for the price. This game screams for the STEAM Work Shop- let the modders go wild and shut EA down!			"

												It certainly contradicts the title of the game, ""Real"" because at best it is an extremely basic arcade boxing game. For those looking for Fight Night comparisons, you'll be bitterly disappointed and probably not like the game.For those looking for an arcade boxing game to play at times with friends, you might like this game.This was the first game I used my Steam Link with, so with a friend I had fun playing this. Its quick, its really simple & easy to pick up, and its guaranteed to make a few laughs if with company. The enormous downside to this game, is that mostly everything is dreadful. Boxer customisation, commentary, physics, not to mention the single player aspect doesn't have a storyline. But I mean honestly, for £3.99 on steam your not looking for an AAA game. I purchased the game on a deal so it cost me 20% of its ""now"" price, so with all things considered and the price that I paid I am fine about that. But the reason I am giving this a thumbs down rather then a thumbs up is because of the Developers ridiculous game description, which in essence is a complete lie.  Vivid Games describes it as ""ultra-realistic"" with ""incredibly deep gameplay"" with a ""comprehensive career mode"" which is an absolute joke. If it wasn't for me being such a huge boxing fan and the lack of boxing content on steam, I would have completely skipped this.			"

												I'm a big fight night fan and this is not it, not nearly. Thank God it's only a fiver because this game is not a step back but a long long jump back from fight night champion which was released in 2011. There is about an hour of enjoyment here if that, until you realise how lacking it is. It's basically a button basher with no thinking whatsoever. I've had a few online fights and even though the first couple of fights I beat the guy senseless and knocked down my opponent I lost on points somehow, I think when punches are blocked they count as an hit. I quickly realised that if I spam the counter button then it's an easy win. It's only a fiver but I still feel i've been ripped off. If you buy this then after an hour you will realise it's money wasted. Shame because I would love a new good boxing game to play.			"

												Not sure whether or not I can recommend this game. It's simple but if you have time to kill there are other games more enjoyable than this. It's also really easy to just farm attributes in the beginning of your career. Just don't proceed to win the first championship and continue doing solo matches. Then bulldoze through the three championships.			"

												Vivid Games mainly specialises in gaming apps for smart phones. Real Boxing is such a game (its sequel with its Rocky homage could be pretty cool and probably a more refined version of this game) which sports an arcade style boxing game that can be a good pastime if you are patient enough to wait for your next AAA game on your wishlist until its released or receives a substantial discount.The problem is that Real Boxing was not a good pastime for me. I hated the frequent FPS drops, the mindless grinding that is needed otherwise you simply cannot complete the next tournament. Visiting the gym to increase your stamina, strength and speed is possible after every 5 matches (only participation counts; winning these is not mandatory) or you can spend your hard-earned credits to increase your stats right away. So, you go to a quick match then quit after 5 wins or you repeat the same tournament you have already completed - rinse and repeat.The simplistic menu design and the overall gaming experience clearly indicates this is a mobile port. There are, however, better games than this and perhaps picking its AAA equivalent is a much, much better choice. Real Boxing is not necessarily a bad game - it just does not have anything to do with real boxing.			"

												I'm torn on how to review this game.If I consider it as arcade-ey, it's absolutely passable.  I might even recommend it to a friend who is into the sweet science.  If, however, I consider it as a boxing sim (which I think is how it's trying to present itself, given the title and promo material), it falls far short.While the graphics are decent, that's about it.  There just isn't much to this game.There are three ""tournaments"" which will give you completion and credits.  Credits can be used to purchase some upgrades (not many -- think ""lower the stamina cost of your jab"").  You can also play training minigames once every five fights to gain a few points in each of the three (just 3) main skill categories.  If you fight above your ratings, you'll be slaughtered.  If you fight below, you'll be doing the slaughtering.As for the fights, again, there's a good deal of what I'd consider necessities for a sim completely absent.Blocking is all-or-nothing -- if you block, you'll block all punches, regardless of where they're aimed.  No covering your midsection at the expense of your face, no getting your hands up and leaving your body exposed.  Which, I should mention, isn't a huge problem, as there's no practical difference in where punches land.  An uppercut to the midsection is equally as damaging as an uppercut to the chin, and neither will have any long-term bearing on the fight (e.g. no laying into body shots at the beginning of a fight to wear out an opponent).Though the scorecard shown at the end of a fight has 12 rounds listed, fights always last 3.  Rounds are 1 minute long.All in all, if you're looking for what's essentially PunchOut with a less interesting cast of characters and improved graphics, this is probably worth your time.  If you're looking for a sim, trying to be light like a butterfly and sting like a bee, applying that sweet science all over your opponent's face, look elsewhere.4 DQs (afaik impossible in this game) / 10 TKOs (afaik impossible in this game)			"

			This is my first impressions of Real Boxing by Vivid Games S.A. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam. You can read it here - http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032161980/recommended/296770/		

It's not the most amazing looking thing but overall the game looks good. The sounds of punches landing and that sort of thing is satisfying. There is supposed to be bruising and stuff on characters who take hit's. But I didn't notice any of that. Maybe the Australian version is censored or I need to select it in the options.You improve your boxers stamina, speed and strength by complete mini games (the skipping, speed ball, hard bad stuff). You basically just have to press key's in a certain sequence. I think it's supposed to get progressively more difficult at high levels. Then you fight. You can do quick fight (which just pitted me against the same AI opponent repeatedly), tournament for a series of fights or online vs other players. I didn't wait long enough to get matched for an online fight so I haven't seen what that's like yet. Also I'm sure you're supposed to be able make bet's using in game currency on matches but I couldn't find anything like that.Beating up your opponent and knocking them out is fun. Initially I just spammed the exact same punch repeatedly and won matches without a problem. But in career mode it was starting to get hard by only the second match.I think this game could be a lot of fun because it look's like it might be really challenging to beat the career mode. And I really like the sound of the online mode. Might be really good to vs. some friends. You can punch people over the internet. The $10 price tag is pretty good.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			"

												Well. I generally do not like to diss on the product of other people's hardwork; viz-a-viz negatively criticize a developer's game, but only if I smell a single drop hard work's sweat in the same zip code of the 'product' I am reviewing.Let me give you a little background, I have spent more than half my childhood playing fighting games on my good old ps2 and the other half I spent tending my sore thumbs after over-playing Fight night games from EA. With that said you might think I'd compare this game with the Fight Night series but to be honest this is not even a half arsed attempt to make a proper clone of that game.Anyone wanting to try this game, I'd stop you right there and rather suggest you to try the old Fight night series of Ps2 or Ps3. Off course you'd be downgrading graphically but fighting game's are not just about graphics. The Fight night games of Ps2 will beat this game hands down in every department - other than graphics off course. Speaking of which they aren't really that great to begin with here.The Good :┼ The game is on PC. Cheaper than buying an used Ps2 and Fight Night CD's. ┼ Get to pounce a HHH / Kofi Kingston lookalike.The Bad┼ Everything.. it's not even an early access game and it has a lot of bugs including getting you and the ai opponent stuck in a groggy state for an entire round and no keys would work - not even the Game pause / ESC key.┼ A bad re-skin attempt of Fight Night games, the developer must be in the wrong industry, this is NOT the iphone/android game-app market.The Ugly┼ Even if I forget every OTHER ugly thing about this game, which includes - but is not limited to : lack of customization for characters, lack of country flags / nationalities etc etc .. despite all that.. the ONE most annoying thing about this game is that it reuses the theme music from Falling Skies (not the game).. albeit a remixed version.. a very annoying remixed version.┼ My Rating : 1/5 NOT RECOMMENDED  Nuff said..

												As a pugilism game, Real Boxing exists in a category all its own, and not in a good way. It isn't realistic enough to pass as a sports career simulator, nor is it fake enough to pass as a Punch Out! clone.Boxer customization is limited to the same two character models (tall troglodyte or small Asian) with varying skin tones, hair styles and tattoos. You can buy your character different gloves and shorts, but they're expensive and with little variety. Facial animation are so limited that you can barely tell apart the winner of a match from the loser. The round card girls range from a dead-eyed blonde to a dead-eyed brunette. The training mini-games are uninspired run-of-the-mill rhythm challenges sans the music. The fighting physics are rough, with knockout animations totally unrelated to the type of punch that provoked them. When more effort is put into the bosom-giggle physics of the girls than the fights themselves, you know you're in trouble.There are some good details in Real Boxing. Its fight mechanics are very easy to learn. The ring environments look very good. Career Mode is limited to only 27 fights in 3 categories, so at least it's a very short commitment. And you can't beat the price. All of Real Boxing's many defects would be forgiven if at least the game was fun.Vivid Games seems to be doing well with this franchise on mobile platforms by doing a Rocky tie-in. I wish them well. I believe eventually they will make a great boxing game, but Real Boxing isn't it.			"

Those people are comparing it to a AAA title (Fight Night) which this may not be, but it for sure wont dissapoint. To me this feels like Fight Night Round 1/2. The controls are nice, gameplay is fun and come on who hasnt been waiting to KO someone on the pc? For the $9.99 asking price that is more than fair for what you get. I hope they will maybe add workshop to this title, that could get interesting. Please give this game a chance before you write it off based on some reviews from people that expect to get miracles for $10. FN will cost you $40-$60 and the cost of an Xbox or PlayStation. This is $9.99 and ready to go. Trust me, try it and knock some b****es out :D			"

												this is just an iOS port with enhanced graphics.  controls are basic and lacking giving not much depth to the gameplay.  there is no parrying and dodging is wonky since it's activated by a tap instead of any leaning system like traditional bob and weaving in boxing.the single player is not well paced forcing you to replay easy fights so you can upgrade your character for the next level of competition and aside from that the progression is 3 basic tournaments; beginning with a group stage first (7 fights) where every one is fought once and then a finals final 4 elimination bracket for your last two.while others may say that there is not much more to boxing i argue that there is a lot more left to be desired.

												Real Boxing is not a bad game but it has its fair share of flaws.Let's start with the customization.You can choose from about 10-15 different hairstyles,sneakers,trousers and tattoos.I know this is not a Sims game but it would have been nice to have more customization.Another lackluster part of the game is its singleplayer experience.You can only win 3 belts.For each one you need to fight a number of opponents then qualify in a 4-man tournament to compete for the belt.It gets boring extremely fast and because of the lack of diversity you will feel like you fight the same guy over and over again.The game has only 3 arenas in which you can fight..again not much work done here.Your boxer has 3 traits.Speed,Stamina and Strenght.You can improve those by playing 3 minigames for each one.It's a nice addition to the game and helps with the repetitivness aspect of the singleplayer.You can also buy 2 additional perks from a total of about 8..again not much to choose from.The actual gameplay is actually fun and rewarding.You feel every punch and it has a nice clinching mechanic,giving you health if you win the clinch.Even if the game is fairly easy,you can enjoy it.Real Boxing is a fairly decent game in terms of graphics but it has a weird way of registering punches.Whenever I watched replays of me knocking out an opponent,the jab/hook or uppercut didn't even connect most of the time.After awhile you will get bored not because the gameplay itself is boring but because the opponents have only three or four ways of falling to the ground or getting up.Even the music never changes which becomes annoying.Also after two or three matches you will probably just mute the commentator because he reapeats the same stuff over and over.It's a shame developers didn't put much effort into this game.Overall I wouldn't reccommend Real Boxing for the price it has and even at a sale I would put it last in any list.You can enjoy the game for a few hours but it's lack of...everything makes the game not worth your money.If you are looking for a few hours of fun you can pick this up but if you want a longer and more engaging experience you can get that for the same price or even cheaper.

												I tired to like this game, but it's just not good.  Pros --It's a boxing game on the PC-It doesn't look terribleCons --The controls just feel bad.  They're clunky and the dodge block system is basically one button.-There isn't much to the game.  A couple tournaments and quick fights and that's about it.-The in game mechanics are just clunky and it kills the game.If you want a good boxing game, just go get one of the old Fight Night games.

												This game baffles the crap out of me. This is a sub-Knockout Kings level boxing game. This is a sub-Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing boxing game. This is a modern game made on modern hardware with modern sensibilities and it has literal decades of boxing games to learn from.Instead you have no create-a-fighter, pointless training games, a career mode that's just a linear procession of fighters and boxing with no impact, bad timing and no actual flow.Nothing about this satisfies, and when you're talking about the fine art of bludgeoning someone into unconsciousness with your fists, that's an accomplishment.

Only Fun For a While, And Not Very ""Real""- While the game does well in certain aspects to make the game fun and interesting, such as the counter system and the AI being challenging at the start of the career mode, it seems like there isn't much else to the game once you have played it for a while.- The customisation options in this game are very limited as you can only change the accessories of your character, not the features of your character itself as you are given some pre-determined templated to use.- Graphics look good on the highest settings and the sounds dont vary too much, pretty basic to be honest.- The combat mechanics are simplistic for the punching, however when it comes to the movement of the player it is quite awkward and it sometimes feels like you are moving along a grid and your character jolts which looks odd.If you pick this game up for like $1 then it may be for it but other than that i wouldn't really bother with it.

												Where to start with this game??? Game play is boring same maneuvers  over and over the character models are all the same; with the exception of a few tattoos, mustache and other bodily augmentations. Its like the developer just followed a simple default template. Dodging needs work. Moving around the ring is not fluid. The graphics are good, not great some rough edges around the character models. AI is repetitive and it becomes easy after a while, too easy. All achievements are attainable. I purchased this game to give it a shot. At $5 its worth a try, if not wait till it drops even further maybe a $1 or so. Don't expect awesomeness. Purchase @ your own risk!!!3/10			"

												For a mobile port this is pretty good actually. has these settings every graphical feature nearly. AA up to 4xMSAA with 2xbelow that and High/Low FXAAAF up to 16xVsync on/offFX on/off Shadow Quality L/M/HGame Details  L/M/Hgamepad works good. has either face button striking or right stick striking. the movement is a little janky but its not gamebreaking unless you are a bit nitpicky. its obviously not going to be as good as FIght Night but like i said for a port of a mobile game it is surprisingly well done.i think a lot of reviews are beating the game up cause its not a AAA 60$ chocked full of content game but thats really an unfair expectation when this game is 10 bucks reg price and 7.99 on initial release. for the price its worth it and plenty of fun.besides isnt this the only boxing and or fighting game on steam or even PC that isnt either drawn with crayon or full of superpowers. not sayng its great just cause its one of a kind but untill PC gaming gets a real AAA boxing or MMA fighting game you wont find anything better than this for what it does.

												I'm an amateur boxer. I've been in three amateur fights and even though it's not a pro fight I have to say this game isn't like real boxing. Basically whoever has the higher stats wins the fight. And you can't increase your stats while you're in the ring. Only outside when you train in the gym. And the training simulator is pretty bad too. If you want a good boxing game this isn't it. Find another one that's fun. If you want a realistic boxing game. Fight Night Round 4 or FN Champion are good ones. This wasn't that fun and I'd have to give this game like 5/10. The only thing good about it are the graphics. The game is very repitive. Like when you get into the ring the guy always says ""this'll be a fight to remember"" and the walk in intrance is always the same besides different music that you don't get to pick yourself. And the collision from gloves to the body isn't as good as Fight Night. Also the online doesn't work, at least not for me.			"

												Real Boxing, unfortunately, fails to deliver. I am not talking about the gameplay. I am not talking about the blood graphics. I am not talking about the commentary. I am talking about a combination of them all. The commentary especially is repetitive, though they do change ring announcers after a match, so that's a good thing. The Career mode simply has a series of matches where your pre-selected character goes though in order to receive the belt. However, the matches are simply too easy, though I do agree they scale from belt to belt and from match to match.The Training system however, is rather fun. Sure, it's a simple rythm mini-game, but it does give a nice addition to the game.I would only reccomend this to boxing fans that want to try out a different angle at the sport. However, since the graphics actually look good (minus the blood) I do hope for a better Career Mode for this game.			"

												Don't get me wrong, but the game misses one very important word in its name - Arcade. It is Real Boxing Arcade.It has its fund playing with friends, but as a boxing game it will disappoint every single Tyson/Mayweather/Klitchko wannabe.Punch block counter, that's all that matters, your opponents movement does not even count. Oh and there is boring level up through repetitive training mini-games. And once you level up of your skills, all of your 3 skills that is, then the fights with PC are just pure boredom.One Grumpy Russian score - 6/10 when Vodka is shared aplenty during a soirée with your friends.For more reviews join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ "

												The fact that this is a handheld/mobile port is frighteningly obvious. While there is a lack of boxing games on PC, this game is not up to standard. The animations are very poor and the gameplay is poorly thought out. Career mode is very skinny with three mini-games that you can only occasionally use to train your boxer, and the title fights are insanely easy on the first circuit and insanely hard on the second circuit. Progression is really repeatiing the same low-level circuit until you can get enough cash to boost your stats to survive getting hit in the next level.The fighting mechanics lack any flow or depth. You cannot throw combinations, so boxing is simply a matter of tapping the jab or hook button. Blocking is a one-button affair, and while you can punch through a block, you don't have enough stamina to exploit it. Hit reactions are awkward - punches don't connect to the opponent, so if the opponent is staggering, your punches are sure to miss, which is very unintuitive. The counterattack system seems like something nice, but it's really just an opportunistic slow-mo which is botched by the lack of fluid fighting.The characters are all the same. There are no distinctions between boxing styles, so it's really just a slugfest. It's disappointing to see a ""Real Boxing"" title feature nothing that makes boxing real.Some other huge flaws:* Clinch mini-game has no timer. You can clinch for the entire round.* Getting up from a KO immediately goes into the fight, allowing the opponent free hits before your controls are live.* No three-knockdown rule. The AI is generally unable to come back and gets knocked down right away, but there is no way to win by TKO.In a nutshell, winning the game is merely based on when the AI ""forgets"" to block rather than any tactical gameplay.

												What would I expect from a sports game?- RealismThe game should reflect how the sport actually is in as many facets as possible.- OR epicnessIf realism isn't possible, show the best side instead.- Different game modesUnless the one game mode is REALLY detailed.- Replayability / Skill-basedIf it has no story, it should be skill-based. If it is skill-based, I expect it to replayable, so I can improve and feel better about myself. Sports games have no stories, so there you go.- Exciting commentary / Great musicYou hear it all the time, it should be enjoyable.- CustomizationIf there's a career mode, I want my character to look goooood.Real Boxing has none of the above. It has 2 game modes, which are essentially the same, you win by skilling your character, whose haircut and beard you can change ... and most fights are pretty much the same over and over again, including the commentary.But there are good things about the game, too.It feels like combos matter. Knocking a guy out within seconds with 7 hits is quite satisfying. The character model (singular) looks quite nice. A boob of the ring girl wiggles when she's applauding.I read people got all achievements (which include finishing the game) within 4 hours, it took me about 5-6. It was somewhat fun most of time, but I see no reason ever launching the game again. It's just way too shallow. There's hardly anything ""real"" about ""Real Boxing"" ... it's barely ""Boxing"". Tbh I wouldn't recommend the game for any price. It is just way too shallow.			"

												This game is terrible, I guess it is okay for pc since there is nothing else. Fight Night 2004 on PS2 blows this out of the water. I am very disappointed in the reviewers on this page. I love boxing and boxing games, thought I would break away from the fight night series and try this. Boy what a terrible waste of money. I did not even play through the full campaign. I find a numerous flaws with fight night, and do not care to play it on my ps3 anymore, and this was a horrible representation of the sport. Punches are unrealistic and you are better off spamming, as the position means nothing. You can just wildly swing, not use this to counter that. The jab is incredibly over powered and dumb.Movement is absolute garbage.Dodging system is a joke, you hit the button before they even throw a punch, haven't played online yet but would imagine people just spam that until you throw a punch and then counter.Trust me DO NOT BUY THIS!!!

												I wanted so hard to like this game. I really did. But it has just far too many problems to ignore. I'll list some of the pros, and then some of the cons.PROS:-Nice variety of modes, from career, to multiplayer, to quick fight, to sparring sessions and training where you can improve your fighter-Game looks pretty decentUnfortunately, the good essentially ends there.CONS:-Animations are atrocious, especially in the training sessions-Moving around the ring feels like you are fighting the air, it is so rigid and stuttery-Nearly every punch looks like they are ragdoll based, so you get horribly disjointed and unnatural looking arm flinging-camera is zoomed in way too close, giving you no sense of location in the ring-Stamina bar has huge issues, 3 punches and you are dead tired. It takes 3 to break an oponent's block.-AI is terrible-The pace is so slow because of the stamina issues, the matches just become long drawn-out staring contests between 2 boxers forever in block mode-because of the snail's pace, plus stamina problems, speed and finesse are completely non-existent-Annoying announcer-Extreme lack of customization-Lack of gameplay options-Lack of fight venues (even Rocky for the NGC had more than triple what this has, and it came out in 2002!)-Each player has a health bar the size of Long Island, meaning KO's never happen-No point total shown at the end of a roundAll in all, I would stay well clear of this game. The PC still sadly doesn't have a good boxing game yet. and it looks like it won't for a while. If you have a Gamecube, do yourself a favor and find a copy of the Rocky game online. It is miles better than this, despite its age.			"

												I gave this game a solid 2 hours before writing this review. I'll keep it short and simple. It's not quite a ""bad"" game. It's just very clunky, rigid and that you'd question if the game was actually made by people who know what boxing is.Gameplay:Essentially I breezed through the Rookie fights, tried online play, fought a guy with 100% stats. Got KO'd in 4-5 hits.The online just matches you against random people it seems so it's probably a good idea to get your guy to 100% before trying online.So after being disappointed about the online play, I decided to try the story mode again and play the next stage. Which also seemed to be a very bad idea. The difference in strength between me and the NPC characters was quite staggering. I landed 24 hits and yet take off only a portion of their HP and everytime I staggered them they seemed too far for me to even hit them. Overall the gameplay experience was extremely exhausting and frustrating.Sound:It's very limited and the commentator ends up being an enigma that just repeats the same lines all the time. Nothing special here.Graphics: The graphics are surprisingly good. The game itself looks nice however their seems to be a lack of overall uniqueness to the characters and a lack of just about every type of customization. Overall Rating: 4/10 - Not RecommendedFor 1 Dollar or 87 pence on Humble Bundle it's worth the 2 hours I put into it. However I'd recommend you not spend any more than that on this game unless you are a serious boxing fan that's willing to play anything. "

Its true that some people should not compare this to a AAA game. This is an indie game from what i know and they would not have had as much experince as a AAA developer.I do like the training part to it but maybe adding ""combos"" would be intresting for example I + I + O = a move etc. I think this would make it great.What i dont likeYou can't rename your character (after chosing the name)You can't edit the looks of your character as in body structure etc.Training is a bit slow and repetative.Overall:I would say the game deserves an 7-8/10 since its a really nice game and worth the price but theres a bit too much repetative things.

												Brilliant game, honestly. It really is fun, well made and executes nicely. Now I have clocked over 3-4 thousand hours in Fight Night Champion. And I can say that is the top standing boxing video game to date. However this Real Boxing is most definatley a very decent shot at a good real boxing game! It does not have the silky smooth gameplay of most of the Fight Night series, and in actuallity it is a touch screen port I believe. At 1.1 GBs it is something that most boxing fans will love to play here and there, especially on the touch devices, and overall without giving spoilers or any inside information. I do reccommend this game, very lovely.			"

FN has real boxers, better graphics, better controls, more scaled difficulty... basically better design in every way. Your time would be better spent begging EA to bring FN to PCs.Real Boxing has the foundation to be a good game if there were future installments, but this is not a good game. Would rather play Punch Out on Wii.			"

												Real Boxing is indeed boxing, but not much more.  The graphics are good and the game play is arcadey.  The game is fun for a few hours but becomes quite repetitive.  The repetitiveness comes from the fight system being very basic.  Punch Punch Punch and back away.  You rinse repeat this system over and over again until you knock the other fighter down. You progress through 3 different belts with 10 fights a piece.  However the jump in difficulty from the first to the 2nd belt is big.  You need to beat the 1st belt several times before you can compete in the 2nd belt with a fighting chance.  As you progress you can upgrade your character, but at such a slow rate. I had 50 fights to my fighters name and still couldn't compete in the 2nd belt.I don't want to say avoid this title, but you may end up putting it down in the short period of time I did.  So unfortunately, i can't recommend this title to the gamers I know.			"

												Early Review: Real boxing is a mediocre boxing game for the few bucks it wont hurt to try. Pros: Creating and developing the character is great.Feels like a boxing game even with the short roundsSound and training mini games are great and difficulty seems to be not an issue with practice.Cons: Sluggish controls at times but overall works well Lack of character selection:Repetitive at times and simpleFor five dollars this is an ok game to get if you are a boxing fan. With few flaws its enjoyable for a quick hour an so. I would recommend it but as well wait for it on a lower price. 3/5 for me.Update: As playing more I realize there were more flaws and its still enjoyable but not the best game out there. New Positives: NoneCons: Clunky controllers became an issue as the game progressed.55/100 Get this game on a sale. Its ok but has many flaws			"

												This game is terrible and fails in all regards, sorry boxing fans.Gameplay - in case you're interested in boxing - gameplay is shallow, console-like, and not very representative of actual boxing.  Control schema is what you would expect if an orang-utan performed a console port.   It's not fun, it doesn't do a good job of emulating boxing, which is why I would imagine boxing enthusiasts would want out of a sports boxing game.Technical stuff - No customisability, resolution and graphics effects are locked, you can't change them.  No advanced settings.  Utter failure.Art - This game has... well, graphics.  Adequate?  Not really, fairly average and hampered by the technical limits the developers imposed on the game with their clumsy console port.   Another utter failure.  Having said that, the poor graphics are the best aspect of the game, everything else is worse.If you like boxing, go watch a boxing match, you won't find anything to scratch your boxing itch here.

												The game is the prime example of ""Get what you pay for."" I was in the mood for a boxing game and there aren't really any to choose from on steam. Was it a bad choice? It depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a straight up boxing game with solid control, okay. But if you're looking for something that has an indepth career mode, good character customization and the real sense of glory, then prepar for major disappointment. I have to honestly say that the biggest draw of this whole game was the price which was a whopping $1 and it shows in every little way.So for the price it was good, but it certainly doesn't even come close to contending with other boxing titles.

When you get to a knock down the ""replay"" the hits don't even look like they hit. I have never played a game this bad.. even the original Mike Tyson's punchout for nintendo is 100 times better then this game. The only thing worth looking at in this game is the gfx. They at least are ok. As for most comments saying it's ""arcade style"" I think even arcade gaming on an old arcade machine is better then this.

												""Down goes Real Boxing, down goes Real Boxing!"" 5/10I'm not sure why, but whenever I find out that a PC game is just some lame mobile port, I'm not too happy about it. Actually I do know why; buying a mobile game for the PC makes me feel gypped, hustled, ripped off, like I paid real money for some fake game made for lesser devices. Like someone took my hard earned money right out of my pocket when I wasn't looking. Like a thief, a con-man, a low-life would do! Needless to say, I don't think too much about mobile gaming, at the moment at least. And in case you haven't guessed it yet, this game is in fact a mobile port.The majority of mobile games I've played felt incredibly easy, most likely to account for the fact that they're meant to be played on a touch screen without a physical controller. And this game is no different. Which is a bit upsetting for me to admit actually, because at first glance this game comes off as a pretty solid boxing simulator that I never would have guessed originated on smartphones. But after playing it for a few hours I quickly realized how bad of a game it really is, and how clearly meant for smartphones it initially was. Basically all you have to do is lose a handful of matches, level your player up, then never lose again. Because the only difficulty in this game comes from having a weak player. After his levels raise, your opponent's weaknesses become blatantly apparent and all you need to do from there is blindly punch and jab your way to the top. Seriously, all you need are your right and left jabs and nothing else. The game is seriously that easy.Aside from the simplicity of the game, there are still plenty of other reasons to avoid this game like a week old gas station breakfast burrito. For starters, after you complete the incredibly short career mode there really isn't anything else to do, and the game doesn't even try to give you any kind of incentive to keep playing. Typical mobile game. Also, the announcer has about twenty things he says in total and you'll grow tired of them all within an hour. Typical mobile game. The intros are the same for every match, the controls are good but could be better, and there is barely any variety of places to fight. The only thing that may be redeeming about this game is the online play, but I never got into that because I was too discouraged by the single player experience. At least I got this game in a cheap bundle for a few bucks. And for that I'm grateful.			"

												Have to admit I kind of expected something in the vein of Fight Night, but everything about this game feels awfully generic, especially customization. One thing that seemed really stupid was that not all countries are represented, even though it nearly only takes simply putting out a flag. It seems like devs only included the ones they can recall.I think devs had a good approach when it comes to the execution of boxing moves, but rudimentary tippy-tappy controls spoil it.Poor music that sounds half-dead is also a detriment, as it doesn't put me in anything like the mood to punch a sandbag or defeat my opponent. Boxing games need the atmosphere where being a sweaty powerful brute is the ultimate virtue.Overall, this is a game that had the potential of competing with Fight Night, but half-hearted development and a lousy selection of musical/graphical content makes it not worth the time.

Movement is almost non existent, which makes it hard to press your advantage when the opponent stumbles back under your blows.Wanna play with a controller? Prbly not going to happen.

												There's really not too much to like here. The game just lacks polish.Terrible announcer:  He sometimes shouts ""and another punch lands!"" on the first punch of the match. Simply names the type of punch you just threw.Bland graphics:  Identical ring girls standing behind each fighter. Wounds on both sides of the face look like mirror images of each other.Shallow gameplay:  Punch, punch, run out of stamina, block. Repeat. Ring movement is awkward and nearly pointless. Holding block blocks all punches, high or low, and seems too easy. Tapping block when your opponent swings allows you a slow-mo counterpunch, which was the only aspect of the gameplay I liked. No weaving, no parries. A bit boring.Overall weird quirks in the gameplay: After recovering from a knockdown, you're immediately standing nose to nose with your opponent, who's already throwing shots at you.After I'd completed 44% of the game's career mode (which is as bare-bones as you can get) in less than an hour, I'd already seen enough.Fight Night it ain't.

												TL:DR - Not a boxing sim, but an arcade beat-'em-up. 6/10'Real Boxing' is exactly the opposite of what it says on the tin. This is not, in any way, shape, or form, a real boxing game.First things first, the game doesn't help itself by having a shoddy set up. The game defaults of medium graphical settings regardless of your rig when you first start the game. Do yourself a favour, ignore the people moaning on the forums, go into the settings, set everything to max and switch blood on, then restart the game. The game looks at least on par with Fight Night Champion, possibly better, though it's hard to tell as this has a more cartoony aesthetic that makes a direct comparison difficult. For a budget title, the graphics are more than adequte.It doesn't help that this was obviously put together by people with no real knowledge of boxing. A 'right jab' is not a jab, it's a straight cross. Common terminology here people.So, the boxing itself. This game stinks of 'gotta match budget Fight Night' all the way through;Training mini-games? Check, but they're ripped straight out of a late 90's early 00's copy Dance Dance Revolution and require you to press the right button when it flashes green in a box, at the right rhythm. The training teaches you absolutely nothing useful for in the game, it's bashing buttons to increase your stats.AI that struggles to overcome a simple jab-jab-straight combination? Check, with the added bonus of having an AI that only seems to throw Hooks/Uppercuts, it's easy to play an outside fighter and jab them to death. Speaking of styles... Even less of a distinction between the styles than Fight Night has. No stances, no punch styles, as far as i'm aware no southpaws, no footwork, no leaning beyond a rudimentary 'press button to dodge'.Unlimited hold button to block? Check. Slightly better than Fight Night in that 3 punches will break the block, ruined by the fact the canned stagger animation ALWAYS takes them out of the range of any of your punches, meaning breaking the block is essentially worthless. Speaking of animations...Animations are horrible. Knockouts could have come from Knockout Kings on the old N64, no physics, no impact, just a guy falling over like a tree. Tiiiiimbeeeeeeer!Canned, nonsensical commentary? Check! My guy has not won the title, it was a standard tournament match with nothing on the line. 4 jabs in a row is NOT a 'tricky combination', a straight cross is NOT a 'nice jab'.Bad blood effects? Check! After the bad blood developed in the Fight Night community after EA rebalanced the blood effects with the bare knuckle DLC, this game looks like it's been made by a group of 15 year olds who think every boxing match should have arterial blood sprays coming from every hook. The ring gets spattered with bright red blood, dripping from each fighter by the end of the first round. Speaking of damage....There is no inter-round mechanics. No trainer tips, no swelling/cut management, no punch stats. Your health is auto-healed between rounds and you have no real idea of how you're doing, as there are no colour commentator scoring cards.There is also no referee. This means no fouls, no point deductions, unlimited clinches, no rabbit punching, etc. The clinches are especially annoying, as there is no end if you and the AI are evenly matched. It's another pointless minigame.There are some pros for the game however. Punch stats are generally realistic, as your fighter will be winded after throwing 4-5 punches that land, or missing 1-2 punches. This leaves a realistic rhythm of jab-jab-hook/cross/uppercut before backing off again and finding a new angle. This is however ruined by the lack of footwork etc. meantioned above. It is also ruined by the fact that Stamina is permanent and non-degrading. This means body shots have no value whatsoever. It also elaves something to be desired when you're pushing for a KO, as there is no way to keep up real sustained pressure.Overall, this is an above average game. It's very reasonably prices, it looks and sounds fine, while the gameplay has been made by people with no real understanding of boxing. Treat it as a arena based quick beat-em-up, with 3, 1 minute rounds, and it's passable.Better yet, download an emulator and play Fight Night Champion.6/10.Edit: Upon completing the game, several achievements did not unlock. 3/10 if they don't sort this basic functionality out.

												This game I thought was going to be good,and I honestly like boxing games no matter if they are like arcade style but this game wasn't very fun at all and is pretty bad overall. There are a few good things but most of them really doesn't matter if the game play is somewhat horrible and the customization is lacking quite a bit.			"

												I will never waist my money with vivid games again as they dont follow through with their work. I really have fun playing this game, but there is too many simple problems to fix that are not going to be. Multiplayer takes at least a minute to match make IF a match is found that is. The majority of the time I am cought in an infinite search never leading to a fight. During training the symbols that correspond to what you need to replicate dont appear. How do you produce proper input if the symbols are not even suggested? Fight Mechanics are broken. When you open up your opponent they stumble back leaving you out of reach for any follow through punch. What is the point of adding this feature to the game then??  Block is anything but responsive which should be essential to ensure before release. Campaign mechanics are really poor. The stats make no sense. Between the three belt titles the same situation happens. The first couple of players are too easy yet the championship match is just a push over. Players with the least amount of wins end up being more of a challange then the leading players.  The whole game was just far too easy and i dont consider myself amazing at this game.  Well vivid you did exactly what you planed, put your game on steam for cheap, have everyone say why not i will try it, then screw them over by never fixing it.			"

												Real Boxing is as much ""real boxing"" as Mario Kart is ""real driving"". It is a fairly simple game with a not-so-great control scheme and a lot of bugs. The campaign took me about 3 hours and was very easy - I didn't lose a single fight, and all but two ended in a knock-out in the first round. It is a very fun game, but at a price of more than a few dollars I just can't recommend anyone buying it because its lasting appeal is short and there isn't much to do outside of the campaign.			"

												I can overlook a boxing game with iffy graphics and dodgy sound, as long as the combat holds up.  Unfortunately, in Real Boxing, it doesn't.  Controls are clunky and non-intuitive, boxers move as though they are knee-deep in mud, and all punch types behave almost exactly the same.  There is no high-low block system to speak of and really no variance to keep things interesting.Additionally, this game lacks all polish and charm.  No character creation or custimization, no sense of progress, nothing to keep you coming back.  Give this one a miss.			"

												Nice graphics and the controls are like the old 4D Boxing game; simple and effective.  However, there is no depth.  What the description of this game doesn't tell you is that you have to choose from a fixed set of characters so your starting stats are also fixed.  The training mini-games are neither interesting nor challenging.  Overall, it just seems like a LOT of corners were cut.  The makers of this game saw an opportunity: there are no decent boxing games for PC out now so they made a poor game with good graphics to distract you.  I would much rather find 4D Boxing somewhere in the depths of the internet and play that than play this game.			"

Nothing to do except fighting and doing some training or changing your accesories. Thank God that fighting system is decent here. Slow motion at KO is nice but camera angles. Ugh that likes to bug.

												Ok game on sale. For a tablet game this is probably great but for a PC game in lack some depth in the gameplay both during combat and career development.+ nice gfx, using Unreal 3D engine+ good menus and options+ good overal production- combat is too mechanical, you can use the same patterns repeatedly to defeat your opponent, - combat is very inferior to games like Street Fighter IV, no combos or special move- combat seems too much stats dependant, if your stats are inferior to the opponent by 5%, you will probably loose every fight, similarly if your stats are slightly above the opponent you'll never loose => in effect the career mode, is grinding to get better stats, then every fights are a walkover.

												The game advertises as being ""real"", and though I don't have any real-world experience with boxing, this just feels clunky and anything but like a real match. From the description I thought this was going to have interesting choices of tactics (in vs. out) and customizable characters from the get-go (chin vs. speed). All fighters stat the same, and build up, spent on winings. You can also buy different colored gear and hairstyles with the money, which is just throwing away money that coulod be spent on better stats, and is a compele trap. Overall, the controls feel unresponsive (there feels like a long delay between when I hit the button and the attack) and clunky. The game just always turns into a in-fight with periods of rest.  if you want a game with a more fluid counter-attack system, I'd recomend the Arkham series or Sleeping Dogs.			"

												I have beaten the game and brought a character up to full stats in close to 6 hours. The game starts as 3 1-minute rounds. This should be a good indication of how good of a simulation it is. If you are going to play it, be sure to adjust the round and time totals and also turn on the blood. I would highly reccomend playing with a contoller. I found the keyboard controls to be nearly unplayable. Even with a controller, the controls were sluggish and occasionally unresponsive. The mechanics of the game are pretty basic. You have a health bar and a stamina bar. The stamina bar determines the strength of your punches. It is short and regenerates quickly. Your health determines how many hits you can withstand before getting knocked down. There is a block and it will block any three consecutive punches where it will then break and place you in a stunned animation. The sway mechanic is a joke. You tap the block button when you see a punch coming for your head and if you timed it right, time will slow and give you a chance to swing back with bonus strength. However, there is little rhyme or reason to it it seems. There will be times when they ""dodge"" the punch but your arm crumples up against their head after connecting with  their character model. When you get low on health you are allowed access to clinching up to regain health. This is a button mash game which starts off easy but becomes quite difficult against later opponents. Standing up from a knockdown is played the same way but the difficutly picks up after the 2nd time you go down.There are only 3 stats in the game. Strength is for damage. Stamina is for your health and stamina bars. Speed is for the speed of your punches and how fast you walk around. You upgrade them through minigames that you gain access to every 5 fights. They aren't very enjoyable. Minigames is the right way to go but they made them feel more like a chore than a way to make your guy stronger. Thankfully you end up buying most of your stats instead of playing those games. You can pick two perks for your fighter out of 8 or so. They can make your punches cost less stamina or help you in the button mash clinch/standup games. While your characters stats feel like they don't matter, having a strength 5 points above their stamina will give you incredible amounts of damage. Strength feels like very much the most useful stat, especially early.Pros-It is a boxing game on PCCons-The mechanics are bad-Character customization is lackluster at best-This is not a boxing simulation game			"

												* Please note my review is based on the single player career mode only and not online play.After 3 hours played, I have to sadly give this game a negative review.Without any regret, I placed this title on my list of ""completed games"", where it was promptly uninstalled, despite me not finishing the game. This can only mean that the game was so flawed that there was nothing I could do but give it a miss and not feel guilty that it was being put on the backburner...permanently. Why? Initially I had trouble understanding how the game worked because I don't really watch boxing, nor do I ever play it in real life or in the virtual World, even though I personaly have thrown a punch or two during a pub crawl. So because I only knew the basics of boxing, it should really have meant that I would struggle in a game happily named ""Real Boxing"", but alas here is where I ran into quite a big problem. Since I was a huge novice, as expected I lost my first two matches because I was doing what I thought was ""real"" boxing. That was to try and ""mix it up"" and jab a couple of times, then try a much more potent move, wowing the crowd with a powerful KO. Instead every match seemed rather tame and while they were close affairs, I could not buy a win and quite honestly things were going as expected. During my first three career matches, I had lost two games on points and the last had ended as a draw but things were about to change...drastically. In the game I got myself a draw, I noticed I didn't have to throw so many varied punches, but just throw one particular punch, a jab - then back off a little to recover my stamina. It was a cue that I would definitely bring into my upcoming fourth match where I decided to roll with this uninspring but effecive style of boxing and went back to the ring seeking revenge with my new jabbing prowess... In my fourth match all I threw were jabs, and did so with devastating results. I got the combo count to about 3 or 4 then as my stamina wore down, I backed off and let it recover and then I just went back in and hit left and right handed jabs again and again. After each round I had landed about 40 to 60 punches and my adversary had a mere 5 to 15 each time. At the end of the match, I had a resounding unanimous victory.I then went to the gym and put all my winnings into my boxers speed and also completed the mini games which were available. After 4 matches my speed was something around 70 and by 3 hours played, it had hit the 80 mark. I had a quick footed boxer, with fleeting punches ready to lightly jab into any boxers face as if he were putting on powder with a puffy makeup brush. It was a heavily feminine style of play, but it was effective - and I was tempted to call my boxer Blue Steel.I won every single match with complete ease, all the way to the title belt! Yes you read that right...! Even though I started with two defeats and a draw, I won match after match thereafter to become the champion. So I went up a division and again put all my coins into speed and again with the same boxing style I won fight after fight all the way until I hit the uninstall button on the game.This game has a lot of fighting mechanics, but you don't need any of them. You don't need uppercuts, haymakers, strength, perks, hugging or whatever it is called when you take a nap on the other boxer, etc etc etc.You just jab and run away, and inevitably win - which some how reminded me of World of Warcraft back in 2006 when I used to ""dot and run"" with my Warlock. If you don't know what that means, then you know exactly how I felt when I first started playing this game - clueless. Yet at the end you feel like a champion and it's not because you are good, it is because the game is completely flawed.Rather than kid myself that I indeed was a ""real"" boxer, I inevitably preferred to uninstall the game. I knew I was nothing but a jabbing phoney and I just could not bring myself to win the career mode knowing that.  Who want's to be the Lance Armstrong of boxing?I know I didn't. I give this game an F, or 2 out of 10.			"

												I don't do many reviews, but I feel that this game is getting a lot of undesvered and unwarranted hate.Let me just go ahead and say that this is not Fight Night. If you go into the game trying to compare it to that, you'll be disapointed to say the least. But, if you go into it looking for a game where you can waste a few hours every now and then beating on peoples faces, you'll quite enjoy this. This is a mobile port, but I was surprised to see that it's not your crappy run of the mill port that you usually get. The graphics are decent, not mind blowing, the controls are very responsive, and it just feels good when you land hits on the AI. There is a career mode where you can create your own character and fight various other fighters in a bracket for a belt. Leveling up your character is quite fun. The more fights you win, the more points you get to help level up your character. You can even buy perks for your character to get more of an advantage. The fights do sometimes come down to button mashing, but there are also tactics involved in being proficient at the game.There is also multiplayer. I've played a couple matches and it's great so far. I got my butt kicked in both, but I admit that it was a fun experience. There was hardly any lag and I connected immediately when another person was found. I was surprised that the multiplayer even worked considering how some of the big AAA titles that get ported to PC can't even get their multiplayer to function properly.Now, are there things that this game can improve on? Yes, of course. Many. Camera animations, voice acting, more mini games to help boost your characters stats, better character customization, and just overall a lot more content can be added to the game. But, if the devs continue to improve upon this game, it can turn out to be something truly fantastic.Edit: Yes, you can play against your friends in multiplayer. They just have to be ready to accept the invite quickly. I expect that to be fixed very soon though.			"

												Well... I never expected the game to be great to start with, and got what I expected. It had some potential to be a mediocre    arcade boxing game but the controls completely killed it for me. They were unresponsive at the best of times and counter productive the rest of the time. Graphics and sound were what you'd expect from this level title. I heard the same comments from the annoucer multiple times in the few fights I fought. Every fight was the ""Fight of the decade"". Graphics are pretty bland and none of the fighters have much visual personality. Head graphics glitch multiple times per fight out of sync with the body as hits land. Not a great title, might be worth it to waste an hour or two if you got it in a bundle. Otherwise pass.			"

												Ok this game just came out and I know the devs hopefully will update some of these issues I have with the game. 1st Power hits dont take health down any faster than regular jabs. 2nd when making sucessful hits in a row it still makes your stamina bar run out just as fast as your punches do when being blocked. 3rd I can play 12 rounds at 3 min per round and beat the crap out of them all day and there health bar still returns almost full by the next round, it never goes down to at least half. Which means I have still yet to knock down any fighter at all. Even after all that I still find it to have a solid structure to the game and if they add the things I talked about, plus custom boxer creator it would make the game a hit. I would recommend buying it as long as the dev keeps updating this game to continue improving what they have started with. Not just to make a quick buck and leave the game to rot. Hope this helps in your decision to buy the game or not.			"

												I was looking for a half-way decent boxing sim when I saw this on STEAM. There is a sever lack of good boxing games on STEAM and for $5.00 I figured I'd give this one a go. While the game looks like the developers made an attempt at making the game look graphically beautiful games, there's things that bother me about the game. Like the slack jawed, blank eyedexpression every character in the game appears to have. The game is supposed to have full controller support and while you can use a controller to play this game, the controls feel off, like they didn't give much thought to it. The training parts of the game aren't any better, for some reason the game often reads the wrong buttons you are pressing, which makes the game even more frustrating because you can only do each training exercise once after so many fights. This doesn't make sense, we all know boxers aren't limited to the gym, we also know that they don't spend all day in the ring either. It feels like this game was designed behind a free to play model and they kind of just stuck with that. When I looked it up, that is absolutely true. The mobile version of this game only allows you to train so many times an hour or so, after which it's locked behind a pay wall. Character customization sucks, plain and simple - the reason being, there really isn't any. The game forces you to take on the persona of a small handful of fighters, you don't get to design your own. After which, you have to earn money in order to unlock new hair styles, styles of clothes and more. This wouldn't bother me so much if the initial character creation would allow me to actually design my own character.The difficultly ramps up at a ridiculous rate very early on. I was having fun playing the game and then suddenly, every fighter I started facing is built like a brick house, taking almost no damage and just destroying. I don't know if this is another result of their free to play model from the mobile edition, but I wouldn't be surprised.Sloppy, lazy, unfun, these are a few words to describe this game. It's not worth the $5.00 they are asking for this game, they should have just stuck with the free to play model they used on mobile devices.			"

												ignore the moaners, this isnt actually that bad, its not just button bashing either, you will lose fights when you move up the ladder if you just bash buttons.Secondly, it will be just a button basher if you leave it on the default setting, try changing the fight settings to 3 minute 12 round fights if you want a bit more ""realism"", stamina and some element of tactics are needed then. It is a little clunky at times, quite often things like the replays will show your opponent being knocked out by an invisible fist/glove or the punch actually being about 3 feet away from their jaw.quite a bit of potential.nice to finally get a pc boxing game on steam!! now give us a slightly smoother/more classy update ;)			"

Or, you can fight your friends, or some randoms in online. Another reason why this game is suitable for boxing fans, is because its like the only Boxing game on PC, or Steam.This game also provides blood, and scars on the face as you punch giving more realism to the game, the game does have some flaws, but I really recommend this game, unless you care about every little thing, then I wouldn't recommend.

												I personnaly find only two interrest in this game : 1 => It's the first boxing game for PC on steam (and maybe at all)2 => It up the counter of the number of games you own. Ok I'm a bit rough, but the thing is I'm really disappointed by this game due to the name ""Real Boxing"". ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ where is this game real?The graphics are ok, maybe decent. The gameplay ? well almost no mobility for the characters, only one block move (which block EVERYTHING until you block 3 hits and then you are block breaked) for 12 hits you can use. But the range of the blow is weird at best. Sometime your char does'nt even try to get close while hitting. In the same trend you can counter the ennemy. (you can even perma dodge until you get a counter chance -_-' ) But what happened after this counter is that 70% of time you can't even reach the stunned opponnent standing helplessly behind you ! (but you can use your stamina in the attempt).Oh and I almost forgot => the win can be managed with jabs ONLY. And I must say that those jabs are almost as much deadly as hooks or upper, but way fasters and they interrupts ennemy attacks pretty much all the time.Last point to gameplay the training, it's a king in hid kind, it's like dance dance revolution, except it's slow, and only move harder with the number of buttons, so it's still dull, yet ""harder""...If the game were to be ""ready to rumble (PC edition)"" it would be great, but as it stand ""real boxing"" is a big ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lie.

												2 hours, finished the game with max stats and all unlocks. Waste of $8 wish steam offered refunds for abandoned projects and 1/4 finished games.Interaction:Was hoping for a game like EA fight night where dodging and blocking as well as good combos would win the day (i.e. skill). Dodge is the same button as block, press to dodge (i.e. tap spam) and hold to block (i.e. wtf i pressed dodge not block... oh you gotta tap spam to dodge). Took me about 30 matches before i figured out how dodging worked. Even after I figured it out, it's not interactive. You dont dodge incoming blows, you predict them before any form of movement has ensued. Apparently this is a mobile app port, makes sense as playing on PC you can't react to anything in real time as i explained above. Its like a dance simulator except minus the visual cue's. If you react while a punch is being thrown its too late. You need to react before the punch is being thrown, like some form of anticipatory foreplay. This made me really sad as it removed all tactical gameplay. Gameplay:So playing through single player, you will notice STATS MEAN EVERYTHING. There are 3 main stats (ikr way to many to manage :P) Strength ((how much damage you do, opponents strength stat affects this) ie. 100% strength will do way more damage vs 68% strength than 92%) Stamina ((how quickly you gas out) doesn't really affect ♥♥♥♥ as even with max stamina vs low stamina you can only throw 3-4 punches before being gassed, it only really affects recovery speed in a high vs low stat (like strength as above)) and speed (who hits first) this doesnt really affect much either as i will explain later. Doesnt matter who hits 1st unless its against high level bots who can dodge like it has its own button :PFor instance you can have better Stamina and speed yet be losing by 3 points of strength, the person you are fighting will hit you and do 3 to 6 times as much damage (ie. 10 vs 30 or 60 damage). even though you are hitting 1st and more times.Punching doesn't involve any tactics either, as there is a generic high block and no real dodge function. So if you both swing both will hit (depending on punch choice), then it comes down to stamina or strength. i.e. Who can punch for longer or who hits harder. So if you have more speed and stamina you can do 1 more hit at less damage against someone who does more damage in less hits with strength i.e. as above ^ So playing through all the single player if you just level up before proceeding you can come out and 1st round KO everyone by just swinging then block recover stamina and swing (rinse and repeat) Character development: As stated stats progession is the main point of the game. If you try to play through the game and do the minigames every 5 matches you will have a bad time. Mainly because the minigames are horrible. You are better off just restarting the tournaments and buying all your stats with the cash winnings. Character creation: You can choose between about 8 premade characters and where you are from and your name. Def next level for a mobile 99 cent app port.Multiplayer: finished the game, decided to try multiplayer got some poor guy without 100% stats. Noticed a lot of lag and blackscreen between the knockdown screens i.e. 3-4 seconds. Also noticed a lot of delay, so im guessing matchmaking isnt done on ping. All in All: Wasn't impressed, the game offered no challenge and when it did (i.e. understats vs higher levels) the lack of an effective counter (i.e. dodge) really made it a pushing isht uphill problem. I actually like playing fightnight against way OP opponents as you could still dodge and outskill them, This game offers none of that depth. Its a 3d SNES port of mike tysons punchout.  "

												For the people bashing the only boxing game I can find on steam besides some arcade one about beasts... cut it some slack. Do your homework before you buy as this is not a triple A title being sold by EA.Is there anything wrong with this game? No there isn't. Graphics are as good as they come and do not interfere with game play. The game play itself is relatively simple and sort of copies the usual boxing controls we're used to. The right stick just tapping it diagonally left or right (upwards) initiates a jab, going left or right initiates a hook, and going bottom right initiates an uppercut. The punching system sort of feels arcade-ish to a point but has it's moments of simulation. Regardless, the impact system is rewarding and it's nice seeing an opponent go down after countering a punch, putting a few combos together and finishing with a nice hook. The movement system is a bit unfamiliar however the dodging system is again rewarding. The time slows down, your stamina rises, and your fighters ready to deliver a blow given you tell him to.I like this game. This isn't fight night as many other reviewers are saying but there is enough depth in this game to keep one busy. Train your fighter, make him fight in tournaments, single bouts, make money, spend it at the gym or on your appearance. For what it is, I'd give it a RATING : 6.95/10.Gameplay B- Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+***update***I wouldn't buy this if you're barganing on playing your buddies for fun. I haven't found a successful method of doing so.ScreenShots  The ""get up scheme"" they've put in place "

												A fun boxing game.(let's get the negatives out of the way) There are a few issues with this game:1. There is no ""connect"" it takes a brief second for the punches to connect (look at number 2 issue for more input)2.  The AI is ""average"" offering no real competition unless you play against boxers with higher stats. But then again the whole ""inept AI"" can slowly pop up. The best way to win? is to keep throwing punches in any shape or form, and avoid knockouts.3. Lack of in-depth customization. I was hoping that we can customize our own entrance and make it ""grand"" for our boxing character, and lack of boxing attire and equipment. 4. Career mode could've been more interesting. Seeing your boxer rise from humble beginnings into being a superstar.5. Mutliplayer is fun, but it can be truly worth the time if you are both boxing fans. Also more and unqiue boxers to fight with.6. More boxing characters? you will face the same boxers over and over again. Play Mutiplayer if your sick of fighting the same guys over and over again.7. ""perks"" need to be more than just enhancing your characters stamaina and get ups after knock downThis game supports Gamepads. Best to play it with a gamepad so you don't have to rebind your keys the way you see fitLastly, ""Gym"" is prety straight forward. You practice to hone your skills if you have enough money you can 'rise' your stats up quicker and also there is a practice fight to see how much your character has improved.This game is not 'over the top' as fight nights. But while this game has it's flaws and issues. It is really a fun boxing game			"

												I will start off by saying this is not Fight Night. Fight Night is a 'Triple A' title from a company with a seemingly limitless budget at it's disposal. Don't be turned off by so many bad reviews that this game has to be Fight Night or it's junk. Fight Night is a full-priced title and this is a budget-priced title ($8 at the time of this writing). Some people need to set their expectations appropriately.That said, I really enjoy this game. Part of it might be related to how long I have wanted a boxing game on PC. Part could also be due to having my expectations set so low by reading so many negative comments from others. I can say with certainty that I am glad I didn't listen to all of those comments. The game is not nearly the ""button masher"" that several people have made it out to be. Speaking of button mashing, you can also use the analog sticks to fight, which was a pleasant surprise to me, as I must have missed that bullet point prior to purchase.There are already several accurate reviews already out there (look up ""Courteous George""'s for example.His is spot-on in my opinion), so I won't go into great detail. I will just sum this up by saying it's not Fight Night, but it's not a button mashing half-hearted boxing game that was made in a few weekends as some sort of money grab. It is a quality budget title (yes, they can co-exist!) that I would have no problem calling Fight Night Lite, for those who cannot get past the Fight Night comparison. :-)			"

												It's boxing. I'm not really into sport games. This was a gift so that I would play with a friend, because he knew I wouldn't buy this on my own if my life depended on it.Still, it looks good? I don't have any past boxing game experience to compare this to other than punch out on the nintendo and Rocky on sega master system....and compared to those, this game is incredibly advanced. It has a brief tutorial, unfortunately the tutorial seems kind of confusing. Maybe it's my lack of boxing experience. I don't know. I got frustrated with the tutorial for goodness sake!I played using an X360 controller, and it seemed to work fine. most of the moves were done using the analog sticks. I played my friend, he beat me up....A few times. Would I recommend it? Possibly, I guess. If you are into boxing games. The only real downside I experienced was on rare occasins the game pad would be unresponsive, or the game it's self would slow down with poor FPS.Still, the game is completely playable.			"

												Not as extensive as the ""Fight Night"" in terms of content and detail, but not a bad game in 5-10 minute spurts.  Multiplayer options are a bit lacking and it would have been nice to see a server list of some sort so I could choose my game and who to fight against.  I picked this up during a Bundle Stars sale (5-8 games for 4 bucks or some such) and don't regret the purchase.

												There are good news and bad news about this game  I will start from the good news:  This game is really good as a title , graphics are good , background music is epic , i like the whole entrance themes too. Also i like the fact that you can customize your character  a little bit and train him, the fights are really enjoyable too :DAnd now the bad news: The bad news are that this is an exact copy of the mobile game,nothing new is added in this game(except from achievements and cards of course) , i was expecting more something like entrance customisation or improved gym and character abilites, the only change is also that the game is a little bit more difficult that the mobile game.Final thoughts: I recommend this game because the overall experience is really good and you will have lots of fun playing online or single player or locallyDiothorn's rating: 7.5/10			"

												Disclaimer: THIS GAME IS NOT AS SHINY AS FIGHT NIGHT!  It's only $10 and developed by a smaller company.  If you want total boxing simulation fun time, buy a console and support EA's decsision to ignore the PC gamer community.If you are in the mood for a boxing arcade game, Real Boxing is the game you are looking for.  It uses the Unreal engine and it's obvious imediately.  However, the use of the engine in this case is rather uniqe and it's neat to see a developer using the engine for something other than an FPS.  The single player mode is pretty short but it is useful for building up stats to kick ♥♥♥ at multiplayer mode. The training mini games are pretty repetitive and snooze-worthy but getting good at timing is pretty useful too in the long run. Some reviews say that this game is nothing but a button mashing fest.  I have found that having a strategy and timing punches works a lot better than just button mashing, especially when your character's stats are low. The controls are pretty straight forward and are similar to other fighting games on PC.  Having a gamepad is ideal. Don't let the bad reviews fool you.  This game is a pretty good experience for the money providing you aren't expecting a Fight Night clone.  It's kind of a shiny, 3D version of Super Punch Out so if you loved that as a kid, consider giving Real Boxing a try.			"

												Simple boxing game that can offer a few rounds of fun. Level up your boxer through speed, strength, and stamina training. Get in the ring and throw some jabs, hooks, and uppercuts. Take part in tournaments for money and fame. I don't recall having played any other boxing games since Nintendo's Punch-Out!! so this was of a breath of fresh air. It's reasonably priced for what it offers.			"

												Edit 1/28/2015Game starts off really easy.  As soon as you hit the gold belt league the enemies get somewhat hard.  It took me about 4 hours to get all acheivements and all in game items with 100% completion.I have yet to try multiplayer so I do not know if people play online.  Overall it is a quick and fun boxing game.  Could use more leagues for single player or something._____________________________________________________________________________________So far I have only played Real Boxing for about an hour and I so far am enjoying it.  Graphics aren't bad and the gameplay is pretty good.  The right hook seems really funky though.  The game itself consits of a carrer mode featuring multiple belts.  The game reminds me of slightly older boxing games.  Pretty fun and I recommend it!			"

												A solid fighting game, for its price. It's not very complex, nor is it really expansive, but that's alright, it doesn't need to be expansive or complex. The fighting system works perfectly and it also has a nearly perfect difficulty curve. Multiplayer can be a lot of fun aswell, but sometimes you will get a horribly laggy match and one of the players is bound to lose from the start due to that lag. Just hope it's you ;P			"

												---First Impression- A decent boxing game---First off, I'm pretty sure I got this game very cheaply as part of a bundle on Bundle Stars. The regular price for this game is presently $4.99, which is quite reasonable.---PROS---+Pretty good graphics+Game has a pretty good feel to it.+The presentation of the game seems pretty good.+You can create your own player, train him, and progress through career mode.+There is a quick fight option as well.+The game runs pretty smooth on fairly low/med specs. My computer has a 1.3Ghz dual core AMD and 8 GB ram. Despite the high ram, the CPU is usually my bottleneck. However, It ran well on default graphics settings.---CONS----I've read that the career mode can be easily defeated pretty quickly, leaving a bit to be desired.-The game gives you very few choices to create your player without having to ""buy"" new shorts, mustaches, haircuts, etc with in-game currency. I don't think it works like in-app purchases, but you have to earn this currency by winning fights. It makes the game feel a bit like a free-to-play smart phone game. Personally, I feel that in game currencies should only be needed to buy signficant things... not stuff that should be standard, like a certain haircut for your customized character.All in all, this seems to be a fun game. It didn't seem to have any major problems and should provide several hours of fun. Get it on sale! "

												I really enjoyed this game (and i would recommend it for a bit of boxing fun), but it's not 'real boxing' at all. I got an opponent cornered and hit him with maybe 70-90 uppercuts in one round while he didn't throw anything back, just hammering the uppercut buttons. Still it didn't knock him out and then next round he's back to almost full health and stamina.Still it's a fun arcade style game, and there's not much else available on the PC in the way of boxing games so I'd say try it for the couple of quid it costs.

												I just bought this in a $1 bundle. It was worth it for 4h of gaming (career mode).The game is a bit buggy at some points, so it is hard to play at first. The controls are not very responsive and the fighters move very slowly indeed.It is still fun to keep throwing punches, evading and trying to counterattack.I wish there were several categories of fighters (small and quick fighters, big and slow). And maybe more moves or a more complex blocking system (basically you just keep space pressed and defend everything).A few weird behaviors I noticed:- I once got in an infinite clinch, my player was just stuck while the other could move (though he could not hit me).- When I broke my opponent's block by hitting it three times I could never never actually take advantage of that (you can't hit, it doesn't work). - Some opponents, specially from the gold league, need around 5 or more knockdowns for a knockout... It is weird, because even if you knock them down 5 times within 20 seconds, they still get up. Our player can get knocked down twice at most... I could never get up from a third knockdown (I would probably break my keyboard trying).			"

												Got this in an bundle so worth the price (1 dollar for the bundle, like 4 games).Go to options and change the rounds to 12 rounds to make it more realistic.If you choose 3 rounds, then you can win in 1 round, health/stamina drops faster, butin 12 rounds it is more punches in an round, more punches to take someone down.I would give it maybe a 6/10, it gets boring after you finish the game and get all achievments, and try to use a controller instead for the keyboard.Only worth if it is cheap or in an bundle, not worth the 5€ itself(And yes, 5 hours in the game is enough, got all achievements before 5 hours and won the game)			"

												Pros: - Rhythm game training is pretty fun-For a budget boxing title, ring action plays very well (similar to Fight Night's right stick)-Animations are oddly endearing (especially when blood sprays out of their eyes like a desert lizard on knockdown)- Announcer sounds like Stephen Hawking crossed with the lead singer of the B-52s- Looks like Devs are boxing fans and tried to make a really fun game-Many of fighters look like national stereotypes, which is always fun for a fighting game-Rounds are highly adaptable (I set mine for 6  2-minute rounds. Just the right length if it goes the distance)Cons:-Ring girls move as if devs have never seen a woman walk before, only read about it in books (also, round card is 50% too small. This bothers me way more than it should)-Hard to string together combos when opponent is dazed. I move in for the kill and he's recovered and I'm out of stamina-Judges are inconsistent and would drive Teddy Atlas to apoplexySummary:Remember Buster Douglas Knock-Out Boxing for the Genesis? It's like a modern version of that. Good deal for a budget boxer that you can play for 15-20 minutes  at a stretch.			"

The computer is easy to beat but when you play online forget about it, everybody is super amazing at this game and can knock you out in like 10 seconds, dont feel so confident going into the game online after beating it, you'll get disappointed.

												While I haven't finished the game (still in the first tournament) I have to say many criticisms are unfair. The announcer gets boring after a while, the ring girls looks horrible--I wouldn't tap that squarish booty myself, but you can turn off the announcer and you can skip the trailer-trash ring girl with a press of the button. Yes, you CAN dodge to the left AND backward not just to the right. One reviewer complained that you have to dodge before the guy even throws a punch--well, in real life your opponent isn't going to warn you that he's about to throw a punch! If you pay attention you can move just in time. While it's true that the game doesn't natively work with most gamepads (unforgivable flaw) the x360ce vibmod fixes all controller issues (just find your controller's hardware ID for your ""PID"" device, not the USB (at least in my case) and put the respective numbers after ""0x""in the PID and VID lines near the top of the ini file--like so:VID=0x0d9d #controller VID
PID=0x3013 #controller PID I almost never use controllers for games but it's way more comfortable to play this game with one, though the ""training"" is better on keyboard--just press Q & E at the right times.   The AI of the fighters is noticeable if not perfect and each fighter has his own style and it does seem that he adapts to your favored attacks. Body blows CAN slow down your opponent if you actually land them consistently. Hopefully, I'll be able to update this review after I've finished the game. But bottom line I so appreciate finally having a fun boxing game on PC.  "

												I really like this game!  I know its not the best game but as a fight fan I've learned to lower my gaming standards when it comes to boxing, mma or kickboxing games.  I love how every KO the guy falls either like how Terry Etim did when he got KO'd by Edson Barboza or like Arlovski when he got KO'd by Fedor.  Also when u first start the game the punches might seem laggy but its not, your punches will get faster once u train your fighter more. I use a Xbox controller to play and it works great and the controls r real easy and preset with the buttons, Xbox buttons show up on the screen when it tells u to do a combo in training.  I hope they add some more content with an update that would be awesome.  Overall for the price its a good game and it will keep u playing it.			"

												After 19hr of gameplay.Hi all.Here i am after 19hr (and a 10hr long session), really happy with the game (addictive!). I don't know the Fight Night series, but this game alone is worth if you like boxing or are interested in fight games, and you enjoy it for what it is (no real boxers, not really an AAA game - the game is a port from mobile devices). Plus it's the only boxing game in steam that i know.Combat is more toward simulation than arcade gameplay, where you can't simply smash buttons to win. You need to think your strategy for the whole round, and the following ones. I found the mechanics equilibrated (although dodging is a little irritating, but adds a random factor to the combat).Playing tournaments to grind stats could be a long run or boring for some people, but for me it's fun (always wanting more and more!), while learning how to play deeper at the same time.In my case were around 17h to win all tournaments (3) without any KO/lost match (leveling stats before to a little more than my adversaries). Although the last tournament is always hard.Graphics/animations are great, the sound/music is ok, the feeling of contact is really well done.I highly recommend the game, i repeat, for what it is. It's my humble opinion.And now my only ""great"" complaint:The game didn't work without tweaks.In my case: >>""Windows XP""<< (wow!), nvidia GTX570, intel Q9650, 4gb RAM.- The game works fluid with max settings, but once loaded the main in-game menu:> After 8-15s, the game tries to connect to internet, and i got kicked to the desktop with an application error window.The only solution i found myself is to block the game access to internet with my firewall. I don't know if it's a kind of protection, or check, or whatever thing it is, the only thing i can do to avoid be kicked to windows desktop is simply blocking the game access to internet.So i didn't tried multiplayer obviously :)After that, i got each 8-15s of in-game time, a pause of five seconds long. But ""ONLY"" when moving around in-game menus (yeah, it's like the game is sending/waiting for online info, and after some tries, it continues). Once started a match/tournament, the game is fluid, without interrupts/pauses. At least, i can play!> After each tournament final match, the game gives, again, an error to desktop.Solution: Not found. Just load / run again the game, and continue. The match results are saved before the error, thankfully.P.D: I hate to train after each match.Regards, Have fun!			"

												The title is my main gripe. It's not a very full example of what it says.However, for the price, it's fun and loads fast. It keeps things simple and I'm not even a sports or boxing fan, but I enjoyed it.You get to make your own character basically, different apparal and you can do the basics of appearance change. For the price the fighting is good and the AI isn't bad. It's not a button masher, but if you wear the opponent down you can hook over and over til they are down, and it makes sense.Button mashing before wearing them down will not help, unless you are grossly overstatted above the opponent. Or above, them being worn down and too tired.My main complaint is after doing the three championships I have in interest in playing. The price, especially discounted, WAS worth it though. for 7-10 USD I got three hours of entertainment. Most 1.5 hours films cost more to see and aren't interactive.People need to consider the price and that it was first on phones.			"

												I thumbs up, but, it is the price tag to begin with. The game reminds me of Ring Kings and Fight Night from the PS2. The game plays very similar to the two mentioned games. You throw punches with the right stick or buttons if you use a controller(Works seemlessly with Xbox 360 controller for me). Guard, block and duck are as you expect. Where the game falls short is the massive amounts of self promotion from the developer. Everything is tagged with the dev's name and logo. All the trunks and gloves have the logo. The ring and padding has the logo, well, it is everywhere. The game has little to no customization, just boots, gloves, trunks, hair(beard, mustache and head) and tattoes. All of which are very little. The skills are as you'd expect for a game like the above mentioned. You train every 5 fights. When you loose, you train a bit and fight again if you have the credits. But, if you need a scratch itched for something you play 5 years ago, it will work. And for  five bucks, I cannot complain too much.			"

												It's decent, if you're a boxing fan looking for a boxing game for PC, this is the best you'll find. Gameplay is a lot like fight night but lower in quality of course, the fighting mechanics itself are quite fluid and fun, my only problem is the movement, it's extremely clunky and just feels awkward, stiff.. Career mode gives you at least a few hours of entertainment, there's multiplayer as well but it seems to be broken, I keep getting matched up against the same guy who seems to not even be a real player.

												Real Boxing is a solid game marred by a few problems. The announcer is hilariously obnoxious. I really wish there was more and better boxer customization. There is no real variation in frame or facial structure. I can't play a slick, wiry bantamweight that looks like Rigondeaux - I have to look like competition-fit Kai Greene, with my choice of gear, facial features, and skin colour. You'd think that with how much variation there is in the build, height, and reach of boxers, it would at least be addressed in the game. But nope, every boxer uses the same re-skinned model.Graphical gripes aside, when I actually play it as I believe it was intended, Real Boxing is such a fun game. There are many elements to the strategy of boxing that they successfully incorporated game mechanics for. If you choose, every fight can be a chess match, with specific punches chosen to counter whatever they throw, fun and rewarding micro with timing headslips, and a range system that ends up modeling boxing footwork fairly well.Unfortunately, aspects of the game are broken -the stamina system and the stun / combo mechanic. These mechanics are supposed to reward skilled play; ideally you go in to trade 3 or 4 accurate and carefully chosen punches, then cover up and get back out of range. Unfortunately it is vastly more efficient to select the right perks and run forward while repeatedly jabbing your opponent to unconsciousness. Run at them, jab the guard until it breaks, jab them while they're stunned. Rinse, repeat. Boring.There is multiplayer and I have not yet dared. Who knows though, maybe amist all the cheese and jab spam, something resembling Real Boxing might happen.			"

Couldn't see the KO!..Good Things:-Quite cheap if you're desperate for a Boxing game.-Graphics aren't terrible, they're quite good actually.-Xbox 360 Controller support, works better than the aweful Keyboard layout.-Animated boobs.-4/10 I guess.

												I would recommend this game if you can find it on sale or part of a bundle package. It is already tough enough to find a PC game of boxing so there is not a whole lot to choose from. Real Boxing feels as if it was made before the original Fight Night by EA. It is very limited to the features and depth of gameplay involved. If you have a friend you intend to play with you are better off as the single player is very short. The game itself is repetitive but still makes for a simple fun boxing game to go 1 on 1 with a friend. Right out of the box though the matches can be very long as others mentioned little damage is done and regenerates between rounds makes it tough to even drop someone. Has potential if a bit more effort is spent in updating and improving the game. Worth a buy if you can get it cheap and have someone to play with. That way you can at least also rank up your boxers together keeping closer stats.			"

												It's not Fight Night, but it's also not horrible. It's more of an arcade style game than a simulator.I actually enjoyed the training minigames, more than the ones in FN. Streamlining hit registration, stamina usage and animations would go a long way.If the developers took a little more time on fighting mechanics and a little less time on boobs bouncing it could be a lot better. If Real Boxing 2 is on the table and designed for something more powerful than a tablet, it'd be on my wishlist. "

Or, you can fight your friends, or some randoms in online. Another reason why this game is suitable for boxing fans, is because its like the only Boxing game on PC, or Steam.This game also provides blood, and scars on the face as you punch giving more realism to the game, the game does have some flaws, but I really recommend this game, unless you care about every little thing, then I wouldn't recommend.

												TL;DRI recommend you to try it, just for the sake of playing an almost forgotten genre, but it will bore you quickly.Longer version.The game is gorgeous looking (for an indie) and decent sfx, you do have some nice details on the face (blood, cuts etc) and you even start hearing noises when you get hit hard, some blood splatter in the screen.The boxing itself isnt really that bad. Not that strategic, but fun semi arcade boxing.Combat its simple, 6 different buttons to hit (jab, hook, uppercut) x 2 hands, thats for the headshots, you have to press an aditional button to land it on the body. One tap of a button to dodge an incoming hit, keep pressing for a block.If you dodge a punch succesfully, you regain some stamina and the game gets into slowmo, allowing you to counter attack, but the AI can also dodge and counter, so you can get some really nice chains in slowmo.You do not block specific parts of your body, its automagical, and not so strategic.And thats about it about the combat, not that complicated to start trowing some punches at the IA. Its decent enough, when you start, but then income the problems.When you start, you have about the same stats than your opponents. Your punches look and seem powerful, they do damage, though you can only hit 2-3 times since you will drain all your stamina, you have to wait to fill it again (few seconds without receiving hits or dodging a punch). After a couple fights, you will get some quick wins.But the scaling is terribly. You cannot train whenever you want or have cash for it, this only happens every few fightsand you can only train once per stat. If you have leftover money, you can pay for the increase of each stat (what?).Once you finish your first tournament, the stat difference becomes abysmal. You do virtually no damage, while your opponent hits a jab and does like 5 times the damage you did with a perfectly timed uppercut. Stamina wise is about the same, you can throw 4-5 punches now, but they can throw a flurry of punches. And unlike you, when you are hitting your opponent with a combination, they do regen stamina.So at this point you practically are negated a KO fight (seriously, your opponent ends 100% hp every single fight) you do have to box and win by desition, so it gets boring real quick.Training itself its boring as well. you just have to press a button at the right time, each training its about the same as the other one, the only difference its the pace at you have to press the buttons.If you are a fan of boxing, well, you have like 1hr gameplay on this one. If you have tolerance for boring fights, then prepare yourself, you will hit with wet noodles and have to win most fights by desition (unless you want to make some grinding in already won tournaments).

The animations for the punches need a little work to make them look more realistic. Other than that, well worth the budget price. Its got awesome gamepad support (fight night style RS punches or button press punches, your choice), ring girls (with jiggly boobs), career mode with customizable boxer, entrances, punch-by-punch commentator, and invisable corner staff/cut man! The best (only) boxing game on steam made by a small team who ported it from mobile. Get off the ""This isn't as good as Fight Night so it sucks"" bandwagon and give Real Boxing a try!			"

												This review is for single player only.So this is, to put in plainly, a poor person's Fight Night.  The look, feel, and fun factor are certainly ok.  The training mini games are also just ok.  The main reason I am playing, is I am craving a boxing game.  What needs to be improved are animations, collision detection and controls.  It seems as if this is just a port of the mobile game that hasn't been optimized for PC.  A decent effort, but still a missed opportunity.  I am only recommending this to boxing fans who are Jonesing for some sort of pugilism on the computer.  As much as I am not a huge fan of EA, I really want them to make Fight Night for PC.			"

												Not a horrible game, but definitely not great. It's very reminiscent of the EA Fight Night series in the controls and general look of the game, albeit much less polished and in depth.I only played it for an hour and got more than 1/4 of the way through the career mode. You fight, you win credits if you win the fight, you train and/or purchase higher strength, speed and stamina stats, rinse and repeat.I got the game in a Humble Bundle, so I'm not overly concerned about if it's worth what I paid for it, but if you're dead set on buying it, don't pay full price... Not because it's a horrible game, but because there's just not a whole lot to it.			"

												Fun, but you get what you pay for: Very arcadey with only options to increase strength, stamina and speed in the campaign. No other traits or attributes can be changed.Fun to belt each other but don't expect an in depth sports game. I don't regret paying $5 for it.Update: I maxed all stats and won all three belts in 5 hours. It's highly possible that this could be done in less than 5 hours, as I didn't particularly rush through, but I doubt it will take many players much longer than 5 hours to finish the campaign. Once the campaign's done there's very little incentive to keep playing, unless you have a buddy to duke it out with. Two of the acheivements don't seem to work for me: the one to complete training and the one you get for completing all belts with no knock downs. So I've given up on the rest.			"

												I already played this some time ago on Android.Quite the same ofc, however, it's more exciting to play on PC with XBox controllers.Apparently, this game has received a lot of negative feedbacks from other players. I could somewhat agree. But this games was basically for smartphones and you can still buy this game for only around 2 Euros on the Internet without any difficulty. Play time very short, easy to beat up the com and hardly available to find an opponent online.Nevertheless, not a bad game to play from time to time or just for fun as a party game(PC version supports local multiplay either with two controllers or one controller with one keyboard) with friends at home.

												Great boxing simulation game. Lots of perks to upgrade and very simple and easy to pick up. Once reaching max level however, there doesnt seem to be much to do besides from online fights against people. This often depends more on your internet connection not to mention the opposing party may be using cheats. The lack of customisations of your boxer is also quite restrictive. But the point of the game is boxing and in that the game does decently well with AI opponents. The higher ranked AI opponents thankfully are alot less stupid and more aggressive unlike their lower level counterparts who barely hit you.			"

												This game may not be ""Fight Night"" but it is a very solid boxing game. The controls are realistic, you get tired if you throw too many punches without landing or dodge too many punches.  If you just hold block, your block can be broken by opponents punching you a few times in a row. You get to train up your stats by training minigames. The punch controls are nice, hooks, jabs, body punches, uppers, etc all feel good. Graphics are not bad at all at this price range, turn them up to max and they actually ook good. Itys a very fun boxing game for any fan of this sport. Good job and a steal at the price I got it at (halloween sale under 3 bucks).			"

												Real Boxing was ok but lacked a lot from bad animations to different opponents. It is setup tournament style more than an actual career. Beating the crap out of the same guys to increase stats gets stale. Stats are mainly upgraded with money which can be shared over 3 different boxers. You can use the gym every 5 fights and it is mini game style usually resulting in 1% increase to each stat you train.Overall a decent time waster and easy achievements. For some reason the counter-punch achievement does not pop at 100 and I almost gave up until I tried a quick match and it finally popped. The quick matches give some cash but stats are not counted in the career portion. So I don't know if it was a bug or if you need to participate in one to get the achievement.			"

Something you can put up on a 50 inch. Not real enough for you huh?. If you want real boxing go get into a ring and box for real instead of your fat asses.

												Well, cant argue the graphics and sound certainly feel pretty polished for a Android game port, but PC owners expect a lot better. Controls are a bit flighty on xb360 pad with it's use of analogue stick for throwing punches (can slip to wrong punch types too easily I felt). Had 6 matches in multiplayer vs a friend and noticed i was KO'ing my friend in 30 seconds despite my fighter having inferior stats etc, so dunno if that's netcode related or just bad mechanics in general, fights should be a lot longer endurance even early on, I suppose at the price it's to be expected however.

												I like it. Very simple, alot of fun, and for 1 buck during a sale, are you serious? Get it while its hot. The only thing I dislike is the balancing. First 33% of career mode you can do in your sleep, then in silver league people have about 15% more stat points than you have and that results in them doing 5 times the damage you do. Not sure if I missed something, but I probably wont continue on. The first 1.5 hours were a casual blast tho.			"

												So Real Boxing is a port of a mobile game.  Does it have depth not really, does it have customization slightly, However this game is the only choice for a boxing game on PC.  If this game was $60 or even $20 I would not recommend it, since the game is only $5 and is the only boxing game available on PC I can't really think of a reason to not recommend it.  My best advice if you get this game is play with a controller, I use a wireless Xbox 360 controller and the setup allows you to either use the right thumbstick and/or buttons to throw your punches.  This game can be slow if you don't watch your staminia.  It involves alot of going in throwing 3-5 punches putting up your guard and pulling back,  If you play your cards right in a match you can however pin your oppenent towards the corner or the ropes and throw a series of shots to the body.  This game can provide several hours of fun if you like boxing, use a controller, and take the time to learn the mechanics of it. Again for $5 you can't really beat it considering it is the only option for boxing.			"

												Really basic boxing game which is all we really have on PC. No weight classes, which is wierdly offset by the attributes making an obscene difference from start to 100%. With a fully levelled up boxer no one with less than 98% will stand any chance of defeating you. Other boxers at 100% can be beaten soundly by making heavy use of the jab and dodge counter but are nearly impossible to beat by KO.Dodge counter is an odd mechanic and there is no parry. Body shots do very little damage compared to head shots.The AI will sometimes take an embarassingly severe beating and still get up 4 or 5 times (and ironically, during a REAL boxing match, a ref would stop the fight if a boxer was so badly outmatched).Overall a fun boxing game, worth the asking price, even better on special but won't take a great deal of time to finish it, and  replayability is quite low.

												Real Boxing definitely isn't the best boxing game, but it definitely is a lot of fun. The controls are really simple and you can really feel a difference when training your character. Each time you get hit or knocked out, you struggle with the same thoughts: Can I still win this fight? Can I still win this tournament? Should I change my tactics?It is a really exhilating moment when you watch the winning ceremony after defeating a strong opponent. I haven't tried the multiplayer mode yet but I've really liked the singleplayer mode so far, though it seems to be pretty short because there are only 3 tournaments with 9 fights each. However, the farther you get, the more challenging is the game. Earning the achievement for winning each tournament without getting knocked out will be exciting.			"

												Ok, it might be a portable port, but it’s a good one. Also, after you get the gist of it you’ll start getting something really awesome going on. But even after you get some understanding of the mechanics and think you’re outsmarting your opponents, you are not outsmarting the game, soon opponents will show up on which those combos and technics won’t work. So you’ll have to figure out how to out box them. And this is what Boxing is all about.			"

The multiplayer mode makes you wait  too long sometimes, more than five minutes or more for online opponents. You can change the name of your fighter only when you select a new boxer in career mode.

												Really bad game. got it in a bundle. the punches don't actually land 90% of the time (and that's being generous.) the game looks like a straight port of an ios game (which it...is.) with some controls put on it. probably be better if you play it with a controller. because you need seven buttons for punching/dodge/block (six for punching. one for doge and block) and four to move of course. 3 dollars is a bit too much to ask for this game, it does have trading cards but I'd wait till it goes on sale for under a dollar before buying it if you can.Pros: got my moneys worth of fun.game made me laugh a few times there's multiplayer...wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole but it exists.charecter creationcon:limited character creation.game looks bad graphically (the screenshots flatter the game.)the training modes suck, just pressing A and E in random intervals.dodging is really hard to do, like impossibly hard.it crashed on me before I wrote this review right after winning a fight.Buy it if you want, but make sure you get it pretty cheap...I'd recommend it for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.

												Best Boxing Game for PC so far! But be aware! It is totally not like any EA Boxing game. That does not mean, that this game is not as good as the Fight Night series, it is just a little different. Positive aspects of this game:- Fast paced (faster than Fight Nights)- Good animations (this game looks awesome!)- Controls (easy to learn, easy to master)- Working MultiplayerTotally negative aspects of this game:- Damn Cheaters! It is so annoying to see a little damn cheater with 100% stats and no fights!- Not enough AI characters to fight against.- Annoying Training controls. You move the stick and the game doesn't recognize it. Still this game is really good. I was waiting for a good boxing game for the PC and finally an Mobile App did make it to steam. Finally I can box on my PC. Good work!			"

												If youre into fighting games then youll love this game. Its no AAA title but its just as fun.The game is very plain and stale in presentation but the actual fighting aspect of the game is really fun. Its ALMOST on par with the fun factor Fight Night brought but without all the bells and whistles.At the price its selling for I highly recommend this game.

												TL;DR VERSION: It's short and there's not a lot of variety. It's like someone having the right idea on how to make a cake and was on the right track until they f'd up the mix or burnt it. - Get it when it's on sale if you got about 4 hours to spend.I quite like the controls and the graphics are good enough but I do feel that a lot of stuff was missing considering it's a boxing game with the title """"""REAL"""" Boxing"" because there's really not a lot to this other than ""Fight five times. Do your strength, stamina and speed training. Buy some strength, speed or stamina"" rinse and repeat.WEIGHT DIVISIONS ARE MISSING:My first problem with the game is that there's no weight classes so i'm just assuming because a lot of punching is power punching, all it of it is Heavyweight. Weight divisions can change the game because you can be with the sluggish but powerful Heavyweights or be a light footed, fast moving Flyweight but no, you're just left to a one weight class set.TRAINING:This actually did annoy me a bit because they were on the right track and I really liked the training mini-games but you've only got threeStrength, speed and stamina.It's like ""come on, have some variety guys"" Endurance, practice moves to improve them.IT'S A NO-BRAINER:Go in and box, that's all your career is. Where's the management? There's no schedule and you don't really do anything in your career. Fight 8 times, have a championship match and ""oh, do you want this one deal? yes/no?"" and whatever you choose, it really doesn't have an effect on anything you do or have done; one choice gives you money, the other doesn't.I would have like to have seen an injury system so you have to be careful booking fights and being IN fights otherwise it can end your career early. A schedule calendar where you can book fights, manage signings for a new brand of boxing gear, attending a sport convention, accepting or declining movie/tv deals which effects your career time and a reputation meter so say you can choose to slag someone off on social media and that will get you bad rep or have post-fight decisions like ""shake his hand"" or ""talk trash"" which can lead you to being a good sport or a prick everyone boos at. Now I know that's being REALLY nit-picky because even big combat sport video games like Fight Night and UFC don't have a rep meter but with something called ""Real Boxing"" it would have been nice to see.CUSTOMIZATION:You can’t even change the name of your fighter. The hell? Your choice of boxing gear is very limited and because credits can be used on training you’re most likely to forget it exists because each item is like 500 credits so you’d rather spend it on training. To cut long story short: It doesn’t have create a fighter on it and also you can’t even edit the gear.So all I can say from this is: “It’s nice for it being a short game but the title was too bold a statement and there wasn’t much in the game so you’re best just getting it on sale when it’s like £1-£2.something”			"

												“Real Boxing” is a surprisingly fun action-boxing game. I’ve never played “Fight Night” (I don’t own a console), but I’ve played many others over the years (all the way back to Atari 2600 boxing!). From my perspective, “Real Boxing” is the real deal, a legitimate boxing game that’s exciting and involving.If you’re a boxing purist like myself, however, you will notice some missing elements of actual boxing, and some aspects are quite unrealistic. I’ll list the CONS of the game first:CONS:-  no body attacks. That is, no punches at all to the midsection (stomach, below the belt, etc.) This is an entirely head-hunting game.- the controls are a bit awkward, no matter which option you choose (keyboard/mouse, joystick, etc.)  It will take some getting used to.- Opponents all fight in the same style, with only their stats (strength, stamina, and speed) making the difference in difficulty.-  the “clinching” system is frustrating and unrealistic. It’s a button-mashing exercise that can last the entire round! No ref will break it up. And usually, you will lose the clinch game against the computer opponent.- There’s no three-knockdown rule. I’ve battered opponents who’ve gotten up from knockdowns five times in one round!- Once you’ve won all three champoinship tournaments, there’s little incentive to keep playing the single player mode. You've beaten the game.- In multiplayer mode, you’ll get massacred by other players online!!!PROS: -  The action is fast-paced, tense, and suitably tactical. Keep your guard up! Jab, stick, and move!- The graphics are quite good. Not “Fight Night,” but still very attractive and well-animated.- You feel like you’re boxing! (Once you get past the “no body shots” limitation). - The training mini-games are effective, if a little frustrating at times. - You can't just blast through the game without building up you're stats over time. You will have to take on some lesser ""quick fight"" opponents to gain enough ring experience (and stats). Otherwise, ""career"" opponents will demolish you.Overall, this is a very fun (if a bit limited) boxing game. As many others have said, it isn’t “Fight Night,” but for the price, you’ll get your money’s worth out of this game, especially if you get it on sale or in a bundle.  "

												I have to say I have mixed feelings about this game.  It's a fun game if you're just looking to fill a few hours for $5, but you really can't expect much beyond that.  The AI is predictable and easy and there doesn't seem to be much variation from one boxer to the next.  The challenge does get tighter as you move up in the tournaments, but if you decide to restart tournaments that you've already won, you can grind your way to the top skills very easily and completely decimate the AI.This game has a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, the lack of players online makes what could be a decent MP boxing game a rather short and less than stellar single player game in career mode.  While, I'm sure it would be more rewarding to not grind it out and actually beat the game in succession, there just doesn't seem to be much of a point unless you want to balance out the challenge and perhaps bother collecting all of the achievements.Despite all of this, I did have fun even despite the grind for 7 hours which isn't bad considering the $5 price tag.  While, I do wish there were more players online and a more varied single player career mode, I can't say this isn't worth buying or playing because it is.In conclusion, I am in fact recommending this game especially at its current price.  I would definitely be willing to pay $20 for a more polished sequel with better AI and more players to take advantage of the multiplayer mode.			"

												More a brawler than a boxing sim, this is no Fight Night, but given the woeful lack of PC boxing games, I'll take it. My only real fault with the game is it's clunky as crap sometimes. You can dodge an incoming punch, but the movement is sometimes too clunky for you to move in and counter in time. Fight Night (my favourite boxing game franchise, so naturally my go-to comparison, I make no apologies) offered very fluid controls, this feels much heavier and .. well just heavy, and I felt like I was moving on a grid (like the original tomb raider, you know what I mean), it really broke immersion and I never felt I was fully in control of my guy.That said, very satisfying to KO folk. It's interesting though, the fewer rounds you set it to play as, the more damage you'll do. My first match I set to 15 rounds, and I ended up going the distance without getting the opponent's health bar down halfway. Set it to three hours, however, and you'll get two KOs per round easily. For the best balance of realism and arcade brawler I guess go with ten rounds.Minigames to level up your boxer are repetitive but more difficulty is added to these too as you go through the escalating boxing tournaments, which was a pleasant surprise that caught me off-guard. Sadly, these involve not just the buttons but the analogue sticks, and I often screwed up because I find it difficult to judge an angle to aim the stick at, so when it wanted the right stick to go up to the right at 45 degrees, I often missed it by going too far 90 degrees, or vice versa, which was frustrating and felt like a cheap fail.In lieu of more polished boxing sim alternatives this will serve well enough, but it could use a bit of polish. More variety in unlocks wouldn't go amiss either, the gear and especially the hair and stuff is far too limited, and you stand a good chance of fighting a clone of yourself, which is amusing but kinda weird :P			"

												If you have played previous AAA boxing games, I don't recommend this game for you.If you haven't and want to have a boxing game for your PC, go for it. SCORE: 7/10Real Boxing has the basics of boxing mechanics from jabs, straights, uppers, hooks, clinch, dodge, block and counters. The graphics are great. The character creation is limited which is understandable considering this is not a AAA game. It has a decent career mode and training to impove your stats. It has a shop menu where you can buy items like boxing gloves, shorts and shoes. An excellent feature are the Perks which you can customize depending on your playstyle (e.g. lower stamina drain from hooks)As i said earlier, it has the basic boxing mechanics which makes the gameplay repetitive especially when you're up against tougher opponents which takes a longer time to defeat and having to do the same combo or dodging becomes boring. Because of this you can't develop a deeper and adaptive play style of being an in-fighter, out-fighter or a mixture of both. It could add powered punches (haymakers), step-in/out, side steps, specifics blocks and feints to remedy its limited boxing mechanics. Also the footwork in the game is not smooth and sometimes frustrating.			"

												I honestly think Real Boxing is a pretty good game. The controls (I use an x box controller for it) are quite good, pretty sharp and intuitive, the graphics are decent and I didn't experience any of the stuttering or sluggishness some others reported. The important thing is to not expect the detail and depth of a AAA sports title like Madden or the Show. Boxer customization is perfunctory at best and everyone ends up looking pretty much identical no matter what you do. Game play is a little light, as career mode and random fights (which don't count toward your career) are really all there is to do. Training minigames are nice enough but shallow. If they had managed to make a deep, customizable experience this would be a legitmately excellent game, but as it is it's a nice bit of boxing for pretty cheap.  And hey, maybe supporting something like this will create interest in a full fledged boxing game. We can hope, right?			"

												Probably the best boxing game we have on PC so far, I am not saying that it is great though.Doesn't even come close to the Fight Night Series unfortunately.The gameplay is very repetitive and the opponents are easy to defeat,unless you don't train your fighter and play for points only since there is not a chance you can knock your opponent down in that situation.The game has a few bugs as well, especially during the Silver Belt Championship. ex: you can fight against your own fighter,the opponent can win even if you knocked them out etc.It is a great game for the Smartphones though.You can find it on Google Play Store.Pro:-It can be fun if you play against a friend online-Can be entertaining for a few hours on pc.-Can be challenging if you don't upgrade your fighter.Cons:-The AI is very bad.-It is repetitive.-The announcer is saying the same thing over and over again,can be very annoying.-Poor Choice on the title.-The minigames(training and clinch) are boring.-False advertisment-Doesn't detect controllersDo I recommend this given the number of cons? Well,yes and no, it is entertaining at first,but I don't think you will play it more than 10 hours without getting bored of it.If you have some friend to play with it will be ideal.If you have a console you're better off buying Fight Night,if not, then try to get this when it's on sale.
