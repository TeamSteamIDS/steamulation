								I finally decided to leave a review of this game after seeing the AMA on Reddit, because I want to support these guys any way I can. Everything about this game makes you happy. Everyone's always smiling (because your character can only smile), other players are extremely friendly (its totally normal for people to compliment you or congratulate you if you hit them in paintball), and the devs are just as feel-good as the game itself. They are extremely responsive to the community and really have a way of making everyone feel special. I sent Against Gravity an email recently, and the response I got came back less than six hours later not from some intern, but from the CEO. And in the AMA, when someone asked how they could support the company financially, the response was to instead to make a donation to charity and to ""tell 'em coach sent ya"". They're small gestures, but it really shows that they care.In a world where it seems like we are constantly being bombarded with negativity, and where everyone is divided, this game is like a haven of positivity. Much like the reviews, the game itself is ""overwhelmingly positive""			"

								I seriously wish more people knew about this game, I just discovered it and what a ♥♥♥♥ing laugh it is. Honestly one of the best VR titles out I believe. Please try promote this game! Post it everywhere! It's got such a little player count but It's honestly amazing! Nothing worse than an amazing FREE title with no players :( 110% One of the best VR games on the market, and you don't even have to pay for it. Please give it a shot!EDIT: (Never really explainied why it's such a good title, so here it is!) So far I have 25 minutes in it, yes it's not a huge amount of time but to leave that kind of review ^ after 25 minutes is what every dev should be aiming for.You spawn in a mini 40s tutorial just telling you some basic things, how to move and your inventory system type thing. It then tells you to proceed through the locker room door behind you. Man was I blown away, If you've ever played The Division, when you run out the first tent and you're greeted by players? It's exactly like that. One simple mechanic that I love. I walked through and had 3-4 people surround me waving etc, what a warm welcome! Bunch of lovely people playing around with basket balls n frisbees which I stayed with for a good while! I then went into Paintball to give it a try, what fun it was!! 2v2 due to small player count but god It was awesome! Wasn't in very long cause I joined near the end but I managed to capture a flag and get a sneaky kill. At the end of the game I was beyond amazed at a parcel floating infront of me, to find out this game has UNLOCKABLES! The one thing EVERYONE looks for in a game is a goal, and this game has it!! Never been so happy to come across a title in the store in all my life, and thank god I tried it. I certainly won't be leaving this game anytime soon. See you all in there :)			"

								I'll put it simply - RecRoom Paintball is the best online multiplayer game that I've ever played in my entire life (and I am 40 y.o. game addict). I played it already for 400 hours, and I keep coming back every day. I would pay for it even a couple of houndred dolars if I had to. Honestly, for that amount of fun it would be worth, without doubt. So, grab and enjoy it when it's still free!			"

Get this game and you will not regret it.  This is what VR is good at.

								I'm really surprised. I never thought a FREE Virtual Reality game would be one of my favorites! It says it's in early access, however it is more polished and have dramatically more content than most paid VR games. The way you can meet and interact with people is amazing in a huge locker room with tons of things to do. This game also includes 5 different minigames; Dodgeball, Paddle Ball, Disc Golf and my personal favorites 3D Charades and Paint Ball. I think my best virtual reality experiences comes from this game. The community is awesome, keeping this game alive. If there was one thing I did not like about this game... is the servers. There is a noticeable delay in everything you do and interact with people. For example: Throwing a ball feels off, table tennis is difficult due to the ball ""lagging"" ect. If the developers manage to fix this, this might be the best multiplayer virtual reality experience.If I were to give this game an IGN rating it would be, 9/10 Too much fun. -CyberHaxerUPDATE: The game has improved a lot since I wrote this review. Tons of new content and ways to have fun. Level system is pretty awesome and rewarding boxes with costume pieces after leveling up/playing games. Graphical upgrades and new maps and updated maps makes the game shine more than ever before! Not to mention, servers has been improved by miles! This game is THE BEST VR EXPERIENCE I've ever had. It deserves a 10/10 from what it is!			"

								Recreational activities in virtual reality... a very simple concept, that is much more fun than you might expect! Controls:The controls in Rec Room are very simple and intuitive. Touchpad = Teleport, Trigger = Grab, Menu Button = Menu. That's literally all that you need to know to play this game! Graphics/Animation:The graphics in this game are very cartoonish and simple, But that is NOT a bad thing. The game is very polished and detailed and contains everything you would want from a VR title. The animations in this game are wonderful! They were very well thought out and designed. Everything moves around smoothly, and there are lots of little details that make this game great!Physics:The physics are great, until they are not, but when they are not, there were not supposed to be. All of the games physics work perfectly and smoothly, except for the darts. That's where things get fun. In the main lobby, throwing darts onto objects causes some weird things to occur such as making the object float, or spin. This is all apart of the fun though! The few physics that don't work, don't need to work, and if they did, the game just wouldn't be the same. Multiplayer: This is the main feature of the game, and it is portrayed PERFECTLY! All the small aspects of this game is what makes it so great! Want to join a party with someone? Give them a fist bump! Don't want anyone to hear you sneeze in real life? Put your in-game hand over your mouth to mute your mic! Genius! Most people that play this game tend to be pretty nice. Remember though, this is still the internet, you WILL run into some pretty impolite, no mannered, idiots occasionally. Prepare for explicit language and sexual content. If someone can say it/do it, you can hear it/see it.Customization:You can make your Rec Room avatar look any way that you want it to! There are many different items and accessories including; Shirts, wristbands, glasses, hair bands/bows, gloves, sweatbands, and more! Lots of hair style options are available, and you can change them to any (Natural) hair color. Skin color is also an option!The settings page lets you change just about everything to make the game perfect for you! Resolution too low? Turn it up! Someone talking about something you don't want to hear, or even screaming in their mic? Mute them. Simple. There are TONS of options for voice chat. This even includes a voice changer! Three different options are included for when you want people to hear you. Always On, Push-To-Talk (Grip Button to activate), and Off. Graphics and mic customization are just a few of the settings Rec Room has to offer, so play around with them until they work for you!Games:6 games are currently available to play in Rec Room; Dodgeball, PaintBall, 3D Charades, Disc Golf, Soccer, and Paddle Ball. All of which, are not only as fun as the real thing, but as REAL as the real thing. Each game is totally unique and fun in its own way! None of these games can be played by yourself (while still having fun), they all need two or more people to really complete the experience. (They are multiplayer games in real life after all.) All 6 games allow you to use your mic to communicate with each other. Whether your joking around and having a good time in 3D Charades, or Talking with your team and strategically planning your next Paintball round! Make sure you try out all of the different games, as they are all very fun, unique, and competitive (If you want it to be!).Tips and Tricks:1. You can reorientate your room by squeezing the grip button on both controllers!2. While holding an object with the trigger, you can press the top menu button to lock it in place. Now you no longer have to hold the trigger down! Rec Room is updated almost weekly with new features! It's a free application, which honestly feels like I am scamming the developers of their time and money! Please download this game right now, you waisted time reading this review when you could have been playing the game already! :)9.5/10EDIT: After 50 hours of playtime, I have to change my rating...10/10			"

This game is worth the price of owning a Vive.All by itself. And considering that it's nominally a bunch of toys, that's saying something.What makes this game awesome is the community. You step out of your ""dorm room"" (starting area) and you find yourself in this open space with a bunch of other real people chatting, goofing off, and generally just having a good time. As a bit of a socially awkward nerd, that same ""twang"" of anxiety I get when walking into a new space with a bunch of strangers? That happened here.Except there were no real people. They were all pixels on my Vive's screen.Holy ♥♥♥♥, it's the future!The games are well executed and are a lot of damn fun. VR Charades (performed with a 3d painting tool) alone will cause giggles, let alone the playing around in the common area. Developers are often online, playing games with people, chatting, and generally just having a good time. The Paintball game is probably the single best shooter on Steam as I write this, and there's plenty of other fun stuff too.It's free. If you own a Vive, drop what you're doing, make sure your hand controllers are charged, and download this NOW.			"

The controls are extremely easy to master and because there's so much to do, the replay factor is extremely high. Paintball is my favorite mini game by far, but one of the coolest aspects of the game is the lobby, where you can hit a speed bag, shoot some hoops, play darts or just mess around.

								Turns out I suck as much at VR sports as I do real life sports. Maybe more.I recommend a fair amount of room to play this game in. I'd back up to the back of my space in dodge ball and still end up hitting things when I whipped it as hard as I needed to to make it go anywhere.Somehow my racket broke (I mean literally broke, the handle fell off and I couldn't pick it up off the floor and I don't even know why this happened) in paddle ball, but the guy I was playing with was cool about it and just dropped his and we played with our hands.It's a load of fun, but damn, if you're self conscious about how uncoordinated you are, this won't do you any favors.

								GEnuinely the most fun I've had so far in VR. The graphics are simple and cheerful but colourful and bright enough to overcome the Vive's screen door issues and, within minutes, you are totally immersed.My first adventure was just pratting around in the Rec Room lobby - a social club with various physical items you can throw around, a couple of games to play and the avatar design room (as of July 2016 - I preferred the old system as the new one calls for a little too much walking and turning to select items).After a little time meeting new people and chatting I tried out some of the minigames. During one, I turned round after hearing my name, and my friend was standing spectating me. Formed a party and then off to play the brilliant (but too short) Frisbee Golf , followed by the also fantastic 3D Charades. My high point was in 3D charades where, in order to describe James Bond, I drew the opening credits iris and then used my avatar to walk into the centre and turn and shoot just like Bond. They got it eventually but it really made me feel that this was a game where anything goes and you can do pretty much as you please.The latest addition, Paintball, is hands down the most fun I've had in VR, the most action adn teh best multiplayer.Sneaking up to the opponent's flag base and then leaning through the windows and round corners to clear the way before a flag steal is just amazing. For a £20 game I would be impressed. For a FREE game, I'm beyond stunned. Rec Room deserves to be a huge success as it's truly fantastic and a must have for any VR owner.			"

								Great game!   Very social and fun.   I have one suggestion though.   I thought the 3D charades was really fun at first but then after 1.5 hours I realized that the words started repeating CONSTANTLY.  Pretty soon it became fairly easy to draw and guess other people's drawing because you are already familiar with all the words.   The word list they use must be really short.   I strongly suggest the developers increase the word list so that the game can be fun for more than 2 hours.			"

								I tried the game, got familiar with it and then I had a glorious idea.There was a table, so I aligned my couch, sat down, back turned to approaching people. Then I wanted to uhm calibrate my controllers by making a fist and swinging a bit in like.. let's say belly area. Let's face it, it's mandatory.After one or two dudes came by, seeing my back, then my front and thus inducing some laughter, a seemingly funny nice guy sat down beside me, joining my joke.So me, my cone and my new friend who offered to give me a hand sat there, laughing, blowing, giving me a hand as mentioned. I got myself a video camera trying to film ourselves, but I couldn't manage to get a nice take. (Selfie Stick DLC 5€?)Nevertheless, after some time I took a look at his profile, turns out he's gay. My girlfriend laughed at me, cause I had pseudo-gay-vr-cybersex. Talk about future.10/10Sidenote:You're a genuinly nice guy, I'd be happy to see the videos you took. I miss you. "

								Consider for a moment how life was before celluar phones and broadband internet, if you wanted to do something with others, you would generally find yourself slumming it at the local recreation center. That's what this game brings you back to, spending time with strangers doing social things. And this way you don't have to worry about seeing that old guy naked in the locker rooms, or wonder if you might get kidnapped by that creepy guy with the trenchcoat. Not to mention the wide variety of games for everyone: Charades for those times when your word is Robin Hood, and everyone in the room keeps guessing a camel because you're awful at drawing; Paintball, for all those times you wanted to know how poorly you'd do in a real fps; Ping Pong, because it wasn't frustrating enough in real life so now you get to chase a ping pong ball accross two floors; Dodgeball, so you can experience what it was like to be the fat kid during PE. Now the servers don't seem to have the greatest connection sometimes people's voices might lag, or they'll slowly start to drift off into the sky, but this is the new generation of chat rooms, and it looks... very positive. With vr you get this extra level of communication, though rudimentary, there's real body language being transmitted, and that's honestly very cool with such a positive community in this currently. This is the Wii sports of VR, as in, this game by itself, makes your purchase feel worth it.			"

								Wow, when I downloaded this I had no idea it would be so good. I was looking for some free VR games since I can't spend money on games for a bit since I just spent a ton of money on the Vive itself. Going into the rec room and playing around was awesome. Then I did paintball and that was even better. Then I formed a party for disc golf. I got disconnected playing that for some reason, but whatever. Highly recommended.			"

								Fun to hang out with friends and make new friends. Puts your VR abilities to the test.One other thing that is put to the test when in this game, that is your nerves :).I have been in and out of the recroom for weeks now, all has been great until my lastvisit. Be warned that this game being public and free that language and vulgarity canbe present. I was online with a friend recently and we could not detect where or whoit was from. Hopefully some type of control of this type of behavior takes place.Main defense for now is turn off the sound and quickly get into a game instance.Should the sexual vulgarity and language continue, I know of 3 gamers that willmove on. The game is great, would be ashamed if it turns out to be a new placefor perves. I do need to add that there is an option in place to vote a boot of anabusive player. The issue was that when there are so many players in the lockerroom that it is hard to find out where or who the abuser is.			"

								PAINTBALL! We all know and love it. This is a great VR representation of the sport. I really find it hard to believe this is free!It's a real workout: kneeling, squatting, dodging, peeking around corners, and keeping your arms raised through it all  There are two main playstyles I see for it so far:The more skilled/seasoned players tend to just teleport as rapidly as possible while shooting very accurately. Sort of abusing the teleport mechanic because it's really hard to keep track of much less hit them; you'll be flanked often. This works because the average skill level of players is very low. I just think the game is so new and the market is so small still. If everyone understood what was happening you wouldn't be able to play that way anymoreThe other playstyle is like the real sport. It's how I think the devs mean the game to be played. Using trees, every piece of cover, even the grass. Movement matters more. Putting paint down range and pinning players or covering friendlies is more important. It sets up team play and makes it feel like you are actually engaged. It's SO FUN!And the cost of gear is close to the real sport. They really ticked all the boxes on this one haha :]			"

Not only is this game FREE, the mini games within it are highly addictive and also feel really well developed. I have played many VR games that cost £10 - £15 and they aren't anywhere near as good as this! ONE PROBLEM, if you're recording make sure you mute your mic IN GAME, otherwise everyone in the locker room will hear you commentate...as I found out! aha -

								Rec Room has been one of my top 3 games to play in VR ever since I got my HTC Vive!  For the price, you get a heft amount of content plus I love the incentives you have for coming back such as the allure of new items.  I noticed the locker room area also has some renovations coming soon so it's nice to see the devs adding more content.  The basic gist of the game is that you have a few main areas: Your dorm room is where you customize your character and just fool around getting used to the controls and such.  The locker room is the lobby of sorts where people from around the world congregate and fool around with basketballs, frisbees, darts, ping pong, punching dummies, dodgeballs, boomboxes, etc.  You can talk to people if you like and it's nice to see features such as being able to mute yourself and others just in case things get a bit annoying.  The other areas are the main meat of the game which are the Rec Room activities.  You've got various things to choose from: dodgeball, disc golf, 3D charades, paintball, shield soccer, and paddle ball.  My favorite activities to play are dodgeball and paintball, they are both great for a workout because of all the dodging and ducking you'll be doing!  The games themselves, from what I've seen, typically have very friendly and fun people playing them so there's no need to feel socially anxious about joining a game with strangers.  There is one last area which was recently added and it's a private lounge which you can relax in alone or you can invite friends and other players.  Inside the private lounge, you'll find a dart board, ping pong table, dice, a card table, a boombox, a conference room complete with whiteboards, and a 3D charades stage.All in all, this is one of the best examples I've played as far as AAA virtual reality games are concerned because the polish and attention to detail is high with Rec Room and the replay value is very high especially due to the social aspect of it since it's online.  If you have a VR headset, Rec Room needs to be in your library!Checkout my playthrough of a couple Rec Room games!

								This game could be utter trash and I would still recommend it mainly due to the game itself only being part of the experience. Some people say that paintball is the best part, some would think charades; I feel like the community is the best part. I've played with 4 year olds and 24 year olds and the game doesn't change, everyone is so nice and wonderful. There's no bullying, there's no harassment, just genuine fun. I spend a lot of my time playing charades and hanging out in the locker room and there's just something about chilling out and having fun with other players that immerses me into the game a lot more than any other VR title I own. Easily a 10/10, and it's free!Just be careful playing charades at 4:00 AM, it gets dirty ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

								This is by far the best experience I have had on the Vive. I'm not usually one for role-play games where you have to make your own fun, but this game was an absolute blast. The controls, while a lot to get used to, are surpringly fluid and intuitive. The models are incredibly buggy, but frankly that just makes the experience that much more fun, since it gives every one in your room something to laugh at or talk about. The games themselves are actually pretty fun as well (minus dodgeball, which is clearly lacking). All in all, I would absolutely recommend giving this game a shot. Props to the devs and keep it up!

								This is a fantastic and must-have game if you have a Vive! It's free! This game is basically Wii Sports for the VR world, but it's also social. You can talk to other players, and even give them a high five! The fist-bump is used to join a party with them, which I think was pretty neat.Paintball is challenging, and there are a few small ""invisible walls"" you think you can shoot through, but you just splatter paint. That aside, great game! ..You get the excitement of paintball without the welts.Disc golf, dodgeball and other games are great fun, I can certainly see myself playing this for quite some time!			"

								Rec Room is important.VR is an important thing.  Those who are excited about it all have to become used to defending it.“Oh, it’s too expensive”“Oh, it’s a gimmick”Let’s answer those concerns.This game is free to play.  Spend 30 minutes in it.  It costs you nothing.  I recommend 3d charades.  Paintball seems the most popular, but there’s something special I think about 3d charades.  This game is the one that pushes every boundary, while taking every risk (it’s free folks).			"

								I'm not a social gamer, so when RecRoom was mentioned positively on reddit I took my time before trying it.It's been a great experience. With the always on mic(by default), friendly enviroment, active player base, and cartoony avatars I find it really easy and fun to interact with other players using speech, as well as various body and hand gestures.The bulk of RecRoom is made up by it's minigames.. things like the ever so popular Paintball and Charades. The social part just acts as a fun multipler in most cases.Be advised that there is an age limit, though you'll likely to see kids under that age limit regularly (just because the content is very apealing and accessable to all age ranges). But be aware that people will likely ""sexual harrass"" you, though really it's all in good humor. I've yet to have any negative social experience in this game.I have had the HTC Vive since the start. As of now RecRoom has taken the honor of being my most played VR game. Increases my level, abilities in games, getting a solid carido workout in, and finding new cosmetic items all keep me coming back for more.			"

								One of the best currently available VR games and it's totally FREE! Rec room is a fun social experience that is extremely tight and fluid, especially for an early access; it features dodge ball, racket ball, and disc golf (and a very rough table tennis). The avatar animations are impressive, altering to the dynamic of chat, (such as laughing if the user is doing so). Rec Room is a great dynamic with plenty of locker room humor.

								This was my first multiplayer experience, within minutes i had changed my outfit and got chatting to people within the lobby mature friendly people who were good for a laugh, we went through the games and played together before getting some 3 vs 3 going in the dodgeball with people dropping in and out. I now have friends who have VR and am looking forward to more multiplayer experiences.There are some minor bugs such as the camcorder disappearing when you drop it sometimes, the balls in dodgeball disappearing and im not sure what caused them to vanish. I believe going back to the lobby fixes that.The game itself is super intuitive, if you find another player and you guys want to hang out as a party you can either go through the menu or bro fist each other which is a great touch!

								This is a really fun game, especially for something that's free.  It's fun to mess around with a bunch of people in the lobby and the interactive environment helps facilitate that.  The games themselves play really well, I've spent the majority of my time playing paintball, but the dodgeball and paddle ball have solid gameplay mechanics too.  Too many small children are playing though, it ruins the adult experience and I'm pretty sure it's a violation of TOS.			"

								Wow. You guys nailed so much of the technical side of things it's really impressive. Altspace, take note: RecRoom's IK is way better, way more expressive. Grabbing and teleporting feel great (awesome idea on the loading screen too). This is a must play if you have a Vive. If nothing else to see where it goes from here.			"

								This was my first multiplayer experience, within minutes i had changed my outfit and got chatting to people within the lobby mature friendly people who were good for a laugh, we went through the games and played together before getting some 3 vs 3 going in the dodgeball with people dropping in and out. I now have friends who have VR and am looking forward to more multiplayer experiences.There are some minor bugs such as the camcorder disappearing when you drop it sometimes, the balls in dodgeball disappearing and im not sure what caused them to vanish. I believe going back to the lobby fixes that.The game itself is super intuitive, if you find another player and you guys want to hang out as a party you can either go through the menu or bro fist each other which is a great touch!

								Best free VR game so far.Better than most games that cost moneyMust give it a try!!Pros: - A great VR space to hangout with other ppl and do stupit stuff - 3 different multiplay games - Plenty objects to interact with, or can be used to interact with other ppl - customizable VR avatar - ingame camera that can record and output gif shorts - IT'S FREECons: - You can't really tell who is talking by the position of the voice, everyone talks right by ur ear - Game itself kinda lacks some content, while most fun comes from interaction with other player.   Please dev add sth more - You can always win the peddle ball without the pad10/10 would put bucket on other's head and stick darts on it again.			"

								A few par-for-the-course early access bugs notwithstanding, this is an impressively polished and super fun social VR title! The environments, soundtrack, and the aesthetic of the avatars all set a playful and welcoming tone. Fist bumping to party up with others is charmingly intuitive, and who doesn't love high fives with confetti?! The integration of equipable video cameras is a clever addition to a social space like this, adding another way to interact beyond playing the game modes proper or tossing around toys.Of the games currently included, my favorite is paddle ball. It's ridiculously fun getting into a heated one-on-one volley exchange. Make sure you're secure with your chaperone and have cleared plenty of space for exuberant swinging, as the matches do get intense!The only issues I've encountered so far have been a bit of judder in the lobby occasionally, and some minor glitchy behavior related to avatar customization. The sports themselves run remarkably solid though, with no noticeable lag or major physics weirdness. Voice chat is clear and loud, perhaps working *too* well with more boisterous chatters in the area, but individuals can thankfully be muted. Teleportation is nicely implemented, with an aiming arch and helpful preview of your avatar's warp location.If you have a Vive, don't hesitate to give this one a go. At its current price of FREE you are getting an incredible value. I'd have unquestionably thrown some cash towards this, and still would as it becomes more robust with time.			"

This is as social a game that you can get (ignoring something like Pokemon GO, which just fools you into going outside).I can't believe this is free.  Just the little starting area where you can toy around with basketballs, customize your character, and hang out with people is fantastic.  Then you have things like dodgeball, disc gofl, and their new beast of a paintball game!  Seriously, if you have a Vive, download this just for the paintball.  As of this moment, it's better than Battle Dome.Lots of updates, great polish, and it's free!  Absolutely no reason to not try it out if you have a Vive!			"

								Rec Room is still my go to VR game... specifically paintball.  It is for me, the most fun I've had in VR yet.  It's the game I play almost every day.  Yes, there are only two maps. When you get a few good players in a match it doesn't matter - the magic happens!  Maybe it's the teleport mechanic that makes it so interesting.  You have to be very quick and time things just right - teleport behind people, that sort of thing.  It's works for me but as all things VR go - YMMV.It's free, which honestly I still can't believe.  Honestly Devs - I don't know if you are taking donations but I feel guilty with all the time I've spent playing.  I'd be happy to contribute a few duckets to the cause!   I've only scratched the surface of the other games so I can't really speak to them.  The small amount of poking around them was fun though.  If you have a VR headset you should at least give this one a whirl- IT IS FREE.			"

								Extremely entertaining for a free game.  EDIT: I am 20 hours in and still having fun.  Looks like I bought a Vive to play a free game every day.  Experience varies based on active playerbase.  Sometimes you get stuck with duds and sometimes you find people who are fun.Paintball, charades and dodgeball are a ton of fun.EDIT: Had to break from all non-work related activities for over a month.  Returned to update this after launch Rec Room for the first time in a while and playing the newly added co-op theater gamemode.  I didn't think Rec Room could get any more impressive for a free game but I was proven very, very wrong.  Most fun I have had in a long time with three random VRers.			"

								First of all, I think Rec Room deserves a nomination in the current STEAM AWARDS!I have nominated Rec Room for the WHOAAAA, DUDE! Award.This is why:The social aspect of Rec Room is beyond belief, so many games I've played have been terrorized by socially challenged and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players, the so called ""Toxic"" player communities. In Rec Room, this is completely different.The ability to talk, have a chat and interact with the playerbase is awesome and I think it's all because of the way you made this game: Positive!This whole game shows positivity all around, it's all fun and games, party and laugh. The player base copies that positivity and it shows, I have yet to meet another ""Troll"" in Rec Room.The fact that this game is free I think deserves and award, I would totally pay to play this, but I don't have to!Keep up the good work!I honestly hope Rec Room will receive an award, even though unlikely comparing the playerbase of VR to the normal games, but here's one vote from me anyway!

								A Motion Controller exclusive Altspace Alternative, Free to Play, and highly recommended.If you haven't played Altspace, make sure to try that too, if you have played it, don't hold on to preconceptions when you try out this game. Both of them offer a similar experience: interact with REAL people in fun VR activities, but both have advantages and disadvantages, and a completely different style to their entire experience.The most up front difference: Rec Room is a much more exclusive experience. From the ground up, not only is Rec Room exclusively PC VR, but also seems to be designed in such a way that it is impossible to play properly without a pair of motion controllers. I recently had to send in a Vive Wand for repair and have been getting by with minor difficulty using my remaining Wand, but am left at a handicap for nearly every aspect of the game.Whether this is good or bad is still to be seen. On one hand, I personally like the concept of an experience that as many people as possible are capable of enjoying, but I can't help but notice that the interactions with people who have thrown down the $3000+ for the PC VR tech have been much more enjoyable overall compared to those with the people who only invested an extra $100-$400 for their GearVR.I'm not going to chalk this up to a straight Poor vs Rich issue though, in fact the people who use GearVR due to fiscial necessity are far more pleasant. I'm more inclined to treat this as an issue of focus; people who play VR on the PC have had to make purchases SPECIFICALLY for the VR itself. It is something they had to deliberately seek out and aquire for the purpose of VR. Other users generally don't seem as invested in VR as an experience and see it more as an afterthought.Next big difference is that even though it is listed as early access, Rec Room feels like a much more finished experience. Altspace feels like it is constantly under development, features are being added, bugs and glitches are being squashed, and developers/admins are right in the thick of things taking feedback directly and using that to improve the experience. I haven't noticed any place within the game where a developer could be directly contacted, but I also haven't noticed any particular issue that I felt needed to be reported to a developer either. There are certainly exploits that creative use of room scale can allow, but there also seems to be much fewer actual glitches that I've noticed, and if anything the exploits only add to the opportunity to step outside of the conventions of reality.The aesthetic style of Rec Room nearly had me quit in the first 5 minutes. The avatars feel like they should be in a facebook game, and make me wish I could create a Nintendo Mii instead. Everything from the hairstyles, the shirts, and all the accessories all seem deliberatley chosen to be the tackiest possible fashion, regardless of whether you're judging from a realistic standpoint or a gaming geek standpoint. Still, the physical model options are much more varied than what alspace currently offers (currently less than half a dozen distinct models and only the abilty to vary 2 different colors on most of them)Style is subjective, so maybe someone else will find RecRoom's style to their liking, or at least less detestable.The different activities that Rec Room offers come out much more polished, and a lot of this may simply go back to the initial point that Rec room is a motion controller exclusive. Most of Altspace's activities are accessible to even Gear VR users (some don't work well for them) but result in very simple static experiences like playing tabletop or card based games. Rec Room's experiences are much more physical and interactive, such as paddleball, disc golf, 3d charades, soccer, and paintball. There are also daily activites to complete for XP, which help encourage players to at least try out the different experiences available. If you want to try anything besides paintball, you'll want to keep an eye on these activities, as you have a much higher chance of finding other players in these games when they are listed as an activity. I'll take a moment to talk about each of the different activities below:Paintball is undoubtedly the biggest draw in Rec room. I have never seen less than 4 players on any individual map, and there are 3 maps to choose from. You also will almost certainly wind up going up against someone who has played longer and can completely destroy you. Some sort of behind the scenes match making would be great here, but not any type of leaderboard, or people will take things far too seriously. Taking a bad run of hits is already frustrating, but I can only imagine how obnoxious it would be to have my own team shouting at me for dragging them down.I would say my next favorite game is actually 3D charades, which is actually a combination of Charades and a 3D pictionary. You can draw crude physical shapes, but then also move yourself and gesture in order to add to the experience. This is a game that relies entirely on the honor system though. You can hit the button to say that people guess correctly even if they didn't, but you could do the same with real charades too.Disc golf is next on my list. On one hand, I don't like the throwing mechanics, as the unntural flight mechanics of the frisbee make it incredibly difficult to predict how you need to throw. Anyone who has thrown a real frisbee or disc will almost certainly despise this VR version. However it does offer one of the most interesting expeirences if you play with more players. After a disc is thrown, other players are capable of hitting the disc. While this might be seen as a bug that needs to be stamped out to prevent griefing, it does carry with it the ability to help block the disc from falling into a water hazard or going to far past the goal on a missed throw. Again, this is a case where in real life, people CAN do this, so it's not entirely clear if this even SHOULD be stamped out.Paddle Ball is a two player experience, and doesn't seem to get much draw. Though you start a game with a raquet, it actually plays easier and faster by dropping the raquet and hitting the ball with your hand, making the experience similar to a 3D pong or air hockey game. Well recommended, provided you have someone to play with, so definitely wait until it's a daily activity to try it out, and just ask people if they're interested in friending up to play later.Soccer almost plays like a teleporting rocket(less) league. It is team based, but you'll be lucky to get a second player even with it being listed as a daily activity. Teleporting is both the method of moving around, as well as the method of striking the ball. It can be very disorienting to play, and frequently the ball can be hit at a speed that is just too fast to catch up to, so defense in a 1 vs 1 game can be incredibly difficult. This is another one that really needs to wait for it to be listed as a daily activity to try out.You can also find camcorders strewn about the area, which can be picked up to record actual video capture to your PC. There might be other activities, but that's all that I have stumbled across to this point. If I see anything new, I'll come back and add it to the list, but regardless of what is added in the future, even just the current list of experiences is well worth the download for anyone with a Vive or Oculus Touch.

								I absolutely love this game!  All of the different activities are so much fun.  The social interaction so far has been very friendly and enjoyable.  I spent 20 minutes with a stranger in the lobby just rolling a bin back and forth and tossing a frisbee.  Dodgeball is a lot of fun and takes a bit of strategic teleporting and timing.  Paintball is just the most fun I think I've had in my entire life!  It is so amazing to think I have an entire paintball field here in my house. If you own a VIVE, and you haven't tried this yet, go get it NOW.  It's free, and you won't regret the time you spend in here hanging out with your new friends.			"

								Quite honestly, this game is not for me. I can't really get into the whole social-VR thing with absolute strangers, so I can't recommend rec room for people with that same mindset. Close knit stuff like bigscreen or VRChat are more what I'm after, not to mention the incredible ratio of children running around in rec room dicking around. All that said, don't take my word for it, its free! Just give it a shot, even if I don't recommend this.			"

								games such as dodge ball are broken. Hitting people and not being resigetered. Blocking balls with your own works some times but will often get you resigted as being hit, despite the fact that it hit the front of your ball. Other mini games also have their own problems. Once they fix the issues they are having i could see my self coming back and playing hours more but i do not seeing this happening since this game was released in may.Get ready to be spammed by kids, alot of none english speaking asians, the vast majority of these asians will be women that cant play for ♥♥♥♥, and finally, morons that cant breath properly and decieded to keep their mics on at all times.

								I've had some fun with Rec Room in the past, but now the recent update says that children under 13 aren't allowed. Part of the fun of this Wii looking game was watching my son experience a VR sandbox. It's a shame that it's come to this because there have been plenty of tools to create parties or mute offenders. The games play so loose anyway that it's hard to believe anyone takes it super competitively.For that reason it's now uninstalled for good on my system and I no longer recommend it. To me it was a great example of a family game, but with that expressly forbidden, there's no reason to play this game as there are better versions of the fun stuff to be had with other apps that do it better.

								I think Rec Room should add warning about racial discrimination.Rec Room is a worldwide VR social game. That's the reason why all of the people from various countries are able to join here.Unfortunately, there are some children who can't understand about this diversity of people. So, their behaviour to foreigners is extremely rude and nasty.This is the reason why Rec Room should add warning of segregation on the dorm room just like sexual harassment. Additionally, it's not easy to kick them with the voting system.One of my japanese friend did stop playing Rec Room because these kinds of problems.So please make warnig of this matter, or please add segregation category in kicking system, and make a list of them.Rec Room is really popular as the best VR Social Network game, these personal problems must be fixed if Rec Room need to remain for a long time.

								This game is Vive fun... it just is. The makers of this game just seem to get VR and keep making silly fun VR content.The new co-op quest mode is by far the most fun I’ve had on the VR yet. It provides my need for co-op content and skill based shooter in one very fun game mode. And that’s just one mode! If you want more PvP then the bunch of fun skill based games they have can provide you with a very fun and active VR gaming experience.  If you want casual fun then they have that to!Cheers guys!

								Simply put, Rec Room is the most fun I've had with any VR game. Rec Room takes everything that is fun about VR games and combines them.The online connectivity is almost flawless. When you log on, you are instantly and seamlessly dropped into an online multiplayer lobby with complete strangers, and you'll be able to interact with them immediatly. Talk to strangers, play mini-games with them, and get to know them.The physical aspect of the game is brilliant as well. Some games have you stand still, which doesn't get you very much exercise. Some games have you dancing around and moving like crazy, which can wear you out very quickly and make you need to stop playing. I'm a physically fit and active person, but I can't play a game like Audioshield or Holopoint for more than 30-60 minutes before becoming too tired and having to take my headset off. Rec Room however, for the most part involves only light physical activity, which feels good and doesn't wear you out too quickly. I played various mini-games in Rec Room for 5 hours straight before stopping.The real magic of this game is the conversations you will have with people you've never met before. I spent 2 hours playing frisbee golf with a couple from North Carolina, and by the end of the night I felt like I knew them on a real and personal basis. That was an experience I've never had from a video game before. There are more things I could say about my love of Rec Room, but I'll just leave you with this statement. Rec Room is, to me, what I dreamed of from virtual reality. I can log on at any time and I will have fun, make friends, get exercise, and be happy. No other game can deliver all of that to you. If you have a VR headset, this game is a MUST TRY. And hey, it's free so you don't have an excuse not to give it a try.			"

								I'll first start with the fact that I've never left a review for anything, and so this is in part also a praise to the power of the Vive.So the short and sweet: I love this game, and like so many have stated, its ONLY IN ALPHA! I cannot recommend it enough. The graphics are simple, but highly effective compared to a majority of Vive titles currently avaliable, the multiplayer latency is very workable, and the collection of games (which will only continue to grow) are quick and immersive (expecially dodgeball)!

								If you own a compatible HMD get in there, It's Free and it's a lot of Fun!! It is still early days and it does need some tweaking, I had to enable reprojection as soon as i went in as my old i7 950@ 3.7 and gtx1070 had a lot of frame loss with all the people around the punching dummy,  but from what I have read there are Lots of updates on the way and I am really looking forward to them. I would really recommend you have your chaperone turned on full or you may well end up with some thing broken as the games can make you get a bit carried away ;=} I am really impressed with AltSpaces sound setup and would love to see the Dev's implement some thing similar here, I am past my prime and hearing is not as good as it used to be ;( so  being able to hear those close to you as opposed to those across the room is really a nice feature.This is the first multi-user experience I have been in that comes close to being a possible Altspace killer in the future.Great job Dev's keep up the good work.

Physics with some things are off but im sure itll get better. Frisbee golf is amazing hope we get more than 4 holes. Dodgeball is great altho somewhat dangerous. Also love the freedom u have. 1st time i played someone asked me to play hide and go seek. 2nd time i played we put buckets on the pingpong table and played beer pong. As long as the devs give us more real games and more toys/props to make our own fun this will be THE app to get. 1 request to the devs-maybe make it easier to add friends u met in recroom to ur steam friends? A fist bump/hi-5 would be so much easier than searching for names on steam😬			"

								I'm not much for the free games on steam. Especially one like this that seems to be marketed towards kids. But the game is wildly entertaining. It's as if a bunch of my friends and I broke into the school and took it completely over. There's a whole mix of age in there. I've played with people that I swear could be 4 years old and others that are middle aged. So it was weird to join a game where it was more ""adult"" humor. Then join the same game 5 min later with nothing but children. The game is free and there's quite a bit of games and nonsense going on. It's worth a try. If you don't like it, at least you didn't spend money on it.			"

								This game wins out in the social VR gaming space! Fun customisation, solid physics, and regular updates makes this a must play. A key highlight is the way the devs try and allow you to do everything without using a menu - I can party up by fistbumping, mute myself by covering my mouth with my hand, and record my favourite moments by picking up a camera in game.There's a few early games to play, including Dodgeball, Disc Golf, Paddleball. Real highlight is Charades, which is basically 3D pictionary. I don't think I've laughed that hard in a long time.Do yourself a favour - download this game and just start making friends. Vive kits are few and far between, so this is a great place to meet other Vivers to then party up with for other games!			"

								Without question this is the most fun I've had in VR.  I'm addicted to Paintball!To the Devs:  Turning the world (driving the bus motion) is EXTREMELY difficult.  It's either too sensitive and spins about uncontrollably, or hardly moves at all.  When you do finally get it where you want it, the mere motion of lifting your finger off the pad is too much motion to keep it in place!I recommend making it less sensative, or perhaps scrapping the technique altogether.Also, it would be helpful to be able to spin the world in-place, without the possiblity of accidentally teleporting. Many times I've been in a comfortable shielded spot, tried to spin the world, and ended up away from that spot out in the open--where I was promptly ghosted.Great game guys, keep up the good work!

The kid was so small he couldnt watch over his cover. I kneed down besides him and laughed at him. When suddenly someone shot me from behind and waved at me. ♥♥♥♥erAfter the match i got teleported to some dodgeball. Played some dodgeball with someone who clearly was living with a vacuum cleaner on his head when suddenly the french lady appears nearby, waved at me and watched me winning dodgeball so we danced some macarena afterwards.Get back into paintball for another hour, ♥♥♥♥ yea			"

I figured out the issue with my system not allowing me to join the servers.  A firewall issue was occuring and, of course, while in the vive it wasn't showing up. So after 30 seconds the firewall would automatically close the game.  I finally saw the issue and accepted the program and now i'm in the game with no issues.			"

								In the past two months, I have broken an overhead light jumping for a frisbee, almost knocked myself out running into a bookcase lunging for a soccer ball, put two Vive-controller-shaped dents in my wall by reencacting scenes from The Matrix in paintball, and had more fun with VR than I ever thought possible.Plus, if you care about this sort of thing, according to my fitness tracker I burn as many calories per hour in Rec Room as I would playing kickball, backpacking, canoeing, or shoveling snow. That's a nice bonus.This game alone has justified my purchase of the Vive. I seriously can't recommend it highly enough.			"

Figuring out you can toss your gun in the air and then catch it made me giggle.It seems like the devs are updating it pretty constantly, which is great, but honestly for a free game the paintball alone is blinding.

								Rec Room is quite the social experience.  You get to hang out in the waiting room with other people, play some casual ping pong, even pick up a camera and record gifs.  Then you get to move into gaming areas.  By far my favorite game was paintball.  The teleport function has a cool down so you're not zipping across the map, and the shooting has a really good feel to it.  It's quite the experience getting to the edge of a wall and blind firing around the corner at the other team.  Considering this is free, I would have gladly paid for the experience it offers.			"

								A very enjoyable social hangout and multiplayer game hub.It should be noted that the fun of this game relies on its friendly, welcoming and non-toxic community. Shout out to you guys for following the rules and being nice. I hope increasing publicity for this game won't attract any unwanted visitors, but we can only hope.There is a good amount of customisation for your character that I will leave you to discover. Throughout the building are lots of interactives and toys to mess around with. Play frisbee from the attic or Beer Pong with basketballs! I made friends with a random guy following a dance-fight frisbee bout that included head balancing, teleporting and many a spin.The many games, including Dodgeball, Paintball, 3D Charades and Disc Golf, are all stable, fun and balanced.I had some trouble with finding how to configure Push-To-Talk mic settings, rendering my ability at 3D Charades inert.Overall, I strongly recommend this game to people looking for a pastime, social hangout or fun games.

								I like the game.  It would be nice to have the paintball guns modeled after real speedball guns just for fun. maybe even customize the paintjob on the gun also.  I figured out the issue with my system not allowing me to join the servers.  A firewall issue was occuring and, of course, while in the vive it wasn't showing up. So after 30 seconds the firewall would automatically close the game.  I finally saw the issue and accepted the program and now i'm in the game with no issues.			"

								Very polished work with great mini games !The dev team is very active and making this the best VR game so far... paintball itself is already the only enjoyable multiplayer FPS on VR!The only drawback could be the simple design of the characters it seems there are a few customisation options only but I'm sure it will grow soon. This kind of game can keep you entertained for hours without sitting your fat*ss on a chair, nice way to take gamers back to sport ;)			"

Dodgeball, Paddleball, Disc Throw and Paintball to name a few.

								In the past two months, I have broken an overhead light jumping for a frisbee, almost knocked myself out running into a bookcase lunging for a soccer ball, put two Vive-controller-shaped dents in my wall by reencacting scenes from The Matrix in paintball, and had more fun with VR than I ever thought possible.Plus, if you care about this sort of thing, according to my fitness tracker I burn as many calories per hour in Rec Room as I would playing kickball, backpacking, canoeing, or shoveling snow. That's a nice bonus.This game alone has justified my purchase of the Vive. I seriously can't recommend it highly enough.			"

								Paintball is a blast! Dodgeball can be fun. Disc Golf is ok but doesn't have a whole lot of replay value imo, more courses maybe? ZGTennis is kind of fun when it works, although people just slam the ball in crazy directions and that seems to always score. Charades hasn't worked yet for me.Does anyone know how to get in touch with the Devs? I've discovered an exploit in paintball that I think some of the top players might be cheesing that lets you kill people a few seconds after you're dead. Pretty sure it's an extremely easy fix too.

It's the first VR game I've owned where I sit at work and think ""I would love to just get home and play some paintball right now"".... and this is after 2 weeks of playing it!The devs are awesome. They listen to the community like no other. They are in an interesting position right now owning this piece of software. They may not be making money now, but as soon as they implement any official way of paying (be it in game purchases or whatever they choose) you can bet I'll spend some just out of principale.

								Rec Room is quite the social experience.  You get to hang out in the waiting room with other people, play some casual ping pong, even pick up a camera and record gifs.  Then you get to move into gaming areas.  By far my favorite game was paintball.  The teleport function has a cool down so you're not zipping across the map, and the shooting has a really good feel to it.  It's quite the experience getting to the edge of a wall and blind firing around the corner at the other team.  Considering this is free, I would have gladly paid for the experience it offers.			"

								Free! Fun to mess around in and even chat with a few random people. I can guarantee when you first load up the game, someone is going to come over and dump some water on you, or put a bucket on your head. So far people have actually been surprisingly nice and talkative (for the internet). Paintball is probably the best game and is pretty fun. Its like an arena shooter using teleport (which leaves a trail for enemies to see) where aim and strategy actually have some impact. Its good for some casual fun and has a lot more depth than most minigames do.Graphics are functional and clean, and the game runs smoothly, but it doesn't have much style. Very basic visually.			"

								Rec Room is easily one of my favorite experiences to date.The multiplayer functionality is unmatched so far in VR, as well as the breadth of options and games to play. All for free!The humor that emerges is fantastic, albeit sometimes dark and adult, is my favorite part about it. The interaction with others in a virtual space as if we're in the same room really takes me out of reality.I highly recommend this game. I've made 3 videos on this game if you care to check them out!https://youtu.be/cEcF0BP50WY?list=PLZqFOPcnRD2JMkvPuatP_ASJHLaUR8vcXhttps://youtu.be/lEfSK9oblFM?list=PLZqFOPcnRD2JMkvPuatP_ASJHLaUR8vcXhttps://youtu.be/K7UvPeRgNbc?list=PLZqFOPcnRD2JMkvPuatP_ASJHLaUR8vcX "

								Rec Room is one of the top VR experiences right now.  The mini sports games are certainly fun in their own right.  But what differentiates Rec Room from the countless other VR games out there?  Rec Room has truly created an excellent environment to interact & play games with other online players!  As such, the extent of your fun will vary depending on those players around you.  But with a great lobby system, customization & various games to play, there is plenty to do & ways to be entertained.  Kudos to the developer for making online playing incredibly fun in VR and I look forward to seeing what they will add in the future!			"

								This is rapidly becoming my favourite thing on Vive. The graphics style reminds me of Wii Sports. Which once again proves that immersive gameplay doesn't need photo realistic graphics. 6 games, of which Paintball is the most popular. They've already added a second game zone (Homestead). I can't help wondering How could something this awesome be FREE?! There no ads, no in-game purchases. Just great fun with people from all over the world, with whom we have something in common - the Vive.			"

Figuring out you can toss your gun in the air and then catch it made me giggle.It seems like the devs are updating it pretty constantly, which is great, but honestly for a free game the paintball alone is blinding.

								The best multiplayer experience for Vive, so far. That's a bold statement, what with Hover Junkers floating around (no pun intended), but this game is not only free, it ups the insanity to 11, and provides so many enjoyable things to do.My personal favourite is trying to throw long-shots through the hoop, though instead of using balls, I use whatever items I can find lying around the lobby. The best part? There are others in the lobby as well, and they'll see what you've done and often laugh and cheer.You can customize your character's appearance, all looks being pretty entertaining and ridiculous, then you can jump into the lobby and from there choose an actual game to take part in. The lobby has all sorts of fun little activities, but there are actual fields for each competition, from paintball to dodgeball, there's a little something for everyone. And for those who just want to raise a little hell, you can even throw darts in your own face and walk around with a face full of darts. Rec Room is pure magic.			"

								Without question this is the most fun I've had in VR.  I'm addicted to Paintball!To the Devs:  Turning the world (driving the bus motion) is EXTREMELY difficult.  It's either too sensitive and spins about uncontrollably, or hardly moves at all.  When you do finally get it where you want it, the mere motion of lifting your finger off the pad is too much motion to keep it in place!I recommend making it less sensative, or perhaps scrapping the technique altogether.Also, it would be helpful to be able to spin the world in-place, without the possiblity of accidentally teleporting. Many times I've been in a comfortable shielded spot, tried to spin the world, and ended up away from that spot out in the open--where I was promptly ghosted.Great game guys, keep up the good work!

I figured out the issue with my system not allowing me to join the servers.  A firewall issue was occuring and, of course, while in the vive it wasn't showing up. So after 30 seconds the firewall would automatically close the game.  I finally saw the issue and accepted the program and now i'm in the game with no issues.			"

								This game is probably the most fun ive had with my vive since it was released. I can't beleive it is FREE. Their are so many different things to do,  and it is one of the best social games on the vive as well. The paontball is an absolute blast to play!                I can see myself getting many more hours into this game. Its pretty rare to want to play something for 2 hours straight in vr the first time with no breaks.			"

								Alright....after last two updates the Homesteed area for Paintball usually doesn't load for the first time at all.I am left with cca 30 seconds of black world and then throwed back in the dorm room.And I don't know if it is a bug or some idiot with invisibility hack, but some  player  is playing completely invisible thus being almost impossible to hit and therefor ruining the game for all other players.Fix it immediately or maybe permanent ban for such players would be very nice.....EDIT: alright, I'm sorry to the invisible player....it is a bug, because today I went to play paintball and this time I was invisible!WTF! Fix it please!			"

								I saw this was one of the most popular VR games but put it off thinking that the multiplayer would ruin it and it would not be fun. Despite not having any friends to play VR with I managed to meet a lot of new, cool and interesting people who I made friends with and play with on a daily basis. This is a really great place to chill, the only con is the fact that you have to deal with a damn wire tripping you up which isn't even the games problem.PROS:EverythingCONS:Nothing			"

								This game wins out in the social VR gaming space! Fun customisation, solid physics, and regular updates makes this a must play. A key highlight is the way the devs try and allow you to do everything without using a menu - I can party up by fistbumping, mute myself by covering my mouth with my hand, and record my favourite moments by picking up a camera in game.There's a few early games to play, including Dodgeball, Disc Golf, Paddleball. Real highlight is Charades, which is basically 3D pictionary. I don't think I've laughed that hard in a long time.Do yourself a favour - download this game and just start making friends. Vive kits are few and far between, so this is a great place to meet other Vivers to then party up with for other games!			"

								Some games are better than others, and some games are way better than others. This is one of those games that is way better than others. First off, this game is amazing. I cant say enough good things about it. It is so well put together and everything just clicks. so far in my 7.5 hours of playing this I have nit run into any glitches or crashes. (except for when my friend unplugged my Vive) I can tell that every part of this game has been thought out and created with percision. And for me one of my favorite part is just hanging out talk with otehr players. So in all I definetly recommend this game.p.s.   i nominated this game for the ""just 5 more minutes""  award.			"

								Rec Room is probbaly my favorite VR game so far. First of all this is a social experience. You're thrown into a rec center on a random server with other players. It's an incredbile experience almost every time. I love meeting new people and playing games with them. It is a game for everyone.Most games I've played online I don't really enjoy the voice chat feature. Usually it's a bunch of little kids that are really annoying and people who are just outright rude and mean. Everyone who plays Rec Room is so nice and freindly, I have not encounted any situations where people were being trolls or ruining the experience for others. BUT if that were to happen, there are very quick and easy ways to seperate yourself and your friends from those people. It still shocks me that this game is offered for free. It's so polished and continues to get better and better. The developers update this game on a very regular basis. They are constantly adding new things to the game such as game modes, activities, clothing options, settings, graphic updates, etc. It's amazing how devoted to the game the developers are and at the moment it's a very small team that isn't getting any income from the game. It's just a breath of fresh air from other developers and games. They listen to player feedback and communicate a lot with us. They listen to ideas and they impliment the ones they think will work. Big thanks to these guys for all the hard work they put into it every day.Get the game, it's free and you'll come back to over and over again. It's a new experience every time you play and there's no reason to pass it up when it's free. This is one of the best Vive games so far and really makes the price of the Vive worth it imo.TL;DR: Best game on Vive and its free. Also paintball is a blast. 5/5, 10/10, 100/100.			"

								Rec Room is quite the social experience.  You get to hang out in the waiting room with other people, play some casual ping pong, even pick up a camera and record gifs.  Then you get to move into gaming areas.  By far my favorite game was paintball.  The teleport function has a cool down so you're not zipping across the map, and the shooting has a really good feel to it.  It's quite the experience getting to the edge of a wall and blind firing around the corner at the other team.  Considering this is free, I would have gladly paid for the experience it offers.			"

They listen to the community like no other. They are in an interesting position right now owning this piece of software. They may not be making money now, but as soon as they implement any official way of paying (be it in game purchases or whatever they choose) you can bet I'll spend some just out of principale.

								The videos and screenshots didn't appeal to me, but I decided to give it a shot. As soon as I was in the first room where you customize your avatar, I already heard voices and at first I thought it's pre-recorded stuff. Turned out it's real people. So you get into the ""public social experience"" aspect of this head on, there's no tutorial, and I think it's great that you jump straight into it. The other people immediately taught me everything that I didn't figure out myself. The whole multiplayer experience was seamless and instantaneous for me. I quickly found my way to the paintball area and played a few matches of capture the flag. Again, you just jump right in, and learn as you go. I quickly stopped noticing the simplicity of the graphics and was just playing paintball. You teleport around a lot, but it still felt like regular paintball tactics worked. The ""gun"" could use more vibration for immersion, but otherwise I can't see any obvious flaws. Great experience so far!			"

Early Access Review
								The fact that this VR game is free, is beyond me. THIS IS THE FUTURE OF VR.It may be unpolished and thrown into the mess of early VR gaming, but don't judge too quickly, this game has the most potential of anything available. The following game mechanics are listed in the following order from 'perfect' to 'needs work':Frisbee - Needs no work, feels super realistic!Boxing - This is mostly due to the collision detection with the dummy, feels perfect! Now just needs a boxing match game with friends!Ping Pong - Collision detection is mostly true, some false hits/game breaks ever-so-rarely.Paintball - Hitbox is great, paintball needs more velocity, a reload function is a need with too many people spamming paintballs, esentially, ""making it rain"". I also have had been hit before without it counting as a hit. Pisses off other players and myself. Ball - Ball feels too heavy, gravity is pretty strong on it, low bounce. Dodgeball needs these improvements.Overall-Graphics: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Multiplayer: 9/10Side note: It may be just me (my connection or my tracking?), but players seem to drift and float away every 5-10 seconds then return to normal. Happens in-game and lobby. Difficult to play a game of VR paddleball and paintball can be frustrating.  "

								Rec Room is an essential experience for anyone who wants to experience social VR. Rev Room allows users to play paintball, soccer, pictionary, paddleball, disc golf or just hang out in the lobby. Personally, I love to just hang out in the lobby and talk to other users or just mess around. From my experience the community is made up of awesome, interesting, and mature people (although more and more kids are beginning to play which is IMO ruining the experience). Overall, Rec Room is great for sports, paintball, hanging out or just messing around in general. (PS: Also, I forgot to mention the awesome Devs who constantly fix issues, add new features, interact with the community and are just all around awesome. If I could pay for this game just to support you guys I would! Thank you for your hard work!)			"

Great voice interaction and simple mechanics make it fun to pick up right away. Easy to mute or ignore people who are rude as well - and pleased to say that almost everyone was very friendly and fun.A few suggestions would be better positional audio and audio cues such as squeaks when the dodgeball bounces or a noise when people teleport near you.

								If you own a compatible HMD get in there, It's Free and it's a lot of Fun!! It is still early days and it does need some tweaking, I had to enable reprojection as soon as i went in as my old i7 950@ 3.7 and gtx1070 had a lot of frame loss with all the people around the punching dummy,  but from what I have read there are Lots of updates on the way and I am really looking forward to them. I would really recommend you have your chaperone turned on full or you may well end up with some thing broken as the games can make you get a bit carried away ;=} I am really impressed with AltSpaces sound setup and would love to see the Dev's implement some thing similar here, I am past my prime and hearing is not as good as it used to be ;( so  being able to hear those close to you as opposed to those across the room is really a nice feature.This is the first multi-user experience I have been in that comes close to being a possible Altspace killer in the future.Great job Dev's keep up the good work.

								I was pretty nervous when I heard about this game.I expected it to be wrought with social anxiety and violations of personal space, but VR Multiplayer is a dream and the community in this game is pretty fantastic.All of the games in here are uniformly great, and the paintball is one of the best free shooting games I have ever played in my entire life. I cannot wait to see what they do with the close-combat minigame they have in the works.There are occasionally a few idiots here and there who harass people or violate your personal space, but you can kick them or ghost them. I have only met one such person in my time spent playing this game. A report feature would be much appreciated, but I understand that would mean dedication of hours of time on the part of the staff to validate each report, and with such a small team for a free to play game I don't know if that's feasable.

								Great game. Everyone who has tried VR loves paintball. The sports and social interactions are amazing. Not for complexity, but everything in this game just works, which shows polish. A lot of vr games lack polish and social interaction and this game does both to a high degree so it really shows anyone who tries it what the future of polished VR gaming could look like.			"

								I am really enjoying Rec Room mostly for the Paintball rooms. Moving around is smooth, so you can play for a long time without getting sick. It was free when I downloaded it, so definitely worth the download. It's the best multiplayer space I've encountered so far. I met a lot of people!			"

								To be honest, at first it felt a little strange and awkward to virtually be near people of who you could see their head and hand movements so clearly. But after some getting used to I started to see how awesome it is to play games in virtual reality with and against other people. It feels awesome when you shoot a blob of paint in someone's face and he/she laughs and waves at you. It's really an experience.			"

Doesn't require roomscale to play either but I would suggest having some swinging room or else you will probably get caught up in one of the games and knock something over. Overall a really great game and I would highly reccomend it to anyone!			"

								The past hour in this game was genuinely the most fun I have ever had. That either says a lot about this game, little about how exciting my life is, or a little bit of both. Either way, Muting my mic and being the child/pet/toy of the room and having objects stacked on my head with everybody around me laughing and having fun fealt beyond a game or VR. Even for that one hour, it was like a closed group of stranger-friends that you are with for an hour and then you leave.And I don't even have to interect with humans in the real world!The future is now.

								Downloaded this game on a whim bc brookhaven stressed me the f--- out:). But im glad i did. Loads of fun even tho this is still early access. Physics with some things are off but im sure itll get better. Frisbee golf is amazing hope we get more than 4 holes. Dodgeball is great altho somewhat dangerous. Also love the freedom u have. 1st time i played someone asked me to play hide and go seek. 2nd time i played we put buckets on the pingpong table and played beer pong. As long as the devs give us more real games and more toys/props to make our own fun this will be THE app to get. 1 request to the devs-maybe make it easier to add friends u met in recroom to ur steam friends? A fist bump/hi-5 would be so much easier than searching for names on steam😬			"

The most surprising element was that its one of the only multiplayer games where the community is not toxic.High fives, fist bumps and waving to complete strangers really gives a breath of fresh air to modern day gaming.The only downside is getting the rest of the family off it so I can have another go xDWhilst the game is free I cannot recommend it enough, hopefully it will stay this way to help keep the community active.

								I'm not much for the free games on steam. Especially one like this that seems to be marketed towards kids. But the game is wildly entertaining. It's as if a bunch of my friends and I broke into the school and took it completely over. There's a whole mix of age in there. I've played with people that I swear could be 4 years old and others that are middle aged. So it was weird to join a game where it was more ""adult"" humor. Then join the same game 5 min later with nothing but children. The game is free and there's quite a bit of games and nonsense going on. It's worth a try. If you don't like it, at least you didn't spend money on it.			"

I played for 3 1/2 hours straight my first time in and had an absolute blast! Met some great people, played all kinds of sports, and had some hilarious experiences and interactions that had nearly everyone in the room bent over or rolling on the floor laughing uncontrollably.

								I was pretty nervous when I heard about this game.I expected it to be wrought with social anxiety and violations of personal space, but VR Multiplayer is a dream and the community in this game is pretty fantastic.All of the games in here are uniformly great, and the paintball is one of the best free shooting games I have ever played in my entire life. I cannot wait to see what they do with the close-combat minigame they have in the works.There are occasionally a few idiots here and there who harass people or violate your personal space, but you can kick them or ghost them. I have only met one such person in my time spent playing this game. A report feature would be much appreciated, but I understand that would mean dedication of hours of time on the part of the staff to validate each report, and with such a small team for a free to play game I don't know if that's feasable.

								So far, So great. The social aspect is amazing. It's like, walking in to a recreational sports area, like in Apartments, or fancy hotels. You just enjoy time with friends and strangers, but without the potential stabbings! I would have to recomend, as it really shows that multiplayer VR will be amazing when pefected. All it's missing is a way to stop people from phasing through walls.			"

								It's free. It's already better than AltSpace. It's thoughtful. Rec Room gives you a bunch of virtual reality mini-games to play with your friends and strangers, all accessible from a central hub (or lobby). This game allows you to customize your character extensively, hold your hand over your mouth to mute if needed, take photos and video to record moments and even play charades. Dodgeball, disc golf, paddleball, paintball and more will both give you a workout and a ride.			"

								This is my favorite game for VR.  I was not expecting the social aspect to be so much fun and engaging, especially with charades.  I could stand in the lobby upstairs throwing the discs into the basketball goal downstairs all day long. I cannot wait to see what they have in store for the future... and this is a free game!EDIT 7/20 Okay so this is now the best game on VR hands down.  Paintball came out today and it is team based capture the flag with pistol paintball guns.  The physics of the paintballs falling work so well and when you hit someone it makes a ""ding"" noise and they reset.  All the controls work the same as the rest of the game as far a sholding and grabbing.Dont forget charades, I have had some hilarious experiences with that.  It is so much fun hanging out with a group of randos playing charades and one of them pulls the card jellyfish but draws a giant weiner first and then draws an elegant jellyfish off the tip of it.  Try this game.			"

Despite not having any friends to play VR with I managed to meet a lot of new, cool and interesting people who I made friends with and play with on a daily basis. This is a really great place to chill, the only con is the fact that you have to deal with a damn wire tripping you up which isn't even the games problem.PROS:EverythingCONS:Nothing			"

								Downloaded this game on a whim bc brookhaven stressed me the f--- out:). But im glad i did. Loads of fun even tho this is still early access. Physics with some things are off but im sure itll get better. Frisbee golf is amazing hope we get more than 4 holes. Dodgeball is great altho somewhat dangerous. Also love the freedom u have. 1st time i played someone asked me to play hide and go seek. 2nd time i played we put buckets on the pingpong table and played beer pong. As long as the devs give us more real games and more toys/props to make our own fun this will be THE app to get. 1 request to the devs-maybe make it easier to add friends u met in recroom to ur steam friends? A fist bump/hi-5 would be so much easier than searching for names on steam😬			"

								This game wins out in the social VR gaming space! Fun customisation, solid physics, and regular updates makes this a must play. A key highlight is the way the devs try and allow you to do everything without using a menu - I can party up by fistbumping, mute myself by covering my mouth with my hand, and record my favourite moments by picking up a camera in game.There's a few early games to play, including Dodgeball, Disc Golf, Paddleball. Real highlight is Charades, which is basically 3D pictionary. I don't think I've laughed that hard in a long time.Do yourself a favour - download this game and just start making friends. Vive kits are few and far between, so this is a great place to meet other Vivers to then party up with for other games!			"

								Fantastic. This should be worth _at least_ 5$ just for the paintball. This game is basically Wii Sports: VR:, and thats a ton more fun than it sounds. You can play paintball and other games you will try and never play again, because paintball is so good. Its fun, tactical, and has a great community (for the most part) of adults and children alike having a blast. The game is a perfect fit for VR: Grabbing guns, balls, and cameras with your Vive or Oculus hand controllers (Wands and Touch respectivly) feels very responsive and intuitive. Items are also importance-sensitive: Meaning, you either need to constantly hold down the grab button (balls, markers, etc.) or just press once and let it stick (guns), which is a fantastic way to do things. The dorm room and leveling systems are icing on the painball-flavored cake: Its a cool personal space to relax before heading off. Even the menu is awesome: Just look to your left hand as if checking ones watch, and there you go. Menu, always at the ready. In short, this game is an absolute steal for the low, low price of nothing, and a true VR must have. A note, though: The default Oculus touch setup is insufficent here: You can turn with the thumbsticks, but you often get too caught up in the action to remember to turn. The 2 camera 360 or 3 camera roomscale is strongly advised.			"
