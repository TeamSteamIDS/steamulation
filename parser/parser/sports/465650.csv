												As in years past, the OOTP team have added tremendous value with this year's game.  One of the most improved aspects has been a much improved in-game, 3D system that gives you a much better idea of what is happening in the game you are managing.  Coupled with the already fantastic text-based play by play, the game is super easy to follow.  However, my favorite part is not actually playing out the games but watching the brand new 3D highlights of a game after it has been completed.  It is almost like watching the game recap on the MLB Network as you can follow along and go through the whole game in just a few minutes.  There is an option to turn off the scores on the game sim screen.  I like turning them off, simming the day out and going back and watching the highlights.  It keeps all of the suspense of playing out the game myself without the time committment of doing so.			"

												I have to be honest, the features from this year's version vs. last years version might not be worth the full price of admission. That said, if you really like the idea of being able to compete with others via the Challenge mode, or if you've always wanted to sim the Negro Leagues, grab it.If, however you've not played this but are thinking about it. Or, if you've not gotten a new version in a couple of years, seriously, don't wait. Grab this now! It's one of the deepest and most challenging strategy games on Steam, and it does this while still capturing the highs and lows of the emotional roller coaster that is a Major League Baseball season.

												I've been playing the OOTP series since OOTP 14, and each year the developers make the game better in ways I didn't even consider. Small things, big things, everything comes together to create the greatest simulation game of all time. Not just baseball simulation either. I've never played a sim with such attention to detail, the kind that shows the developers do this out of a love for baseball and management. When I was growing up, listening to my Dad tell stories about Hank Aaron and Jackie Robinson and all those other iconic players are some of my fondest memories. Playing this game is like being 12 years old again sitting next to my dad during the 7th inning stretch. Everything just makes sense, and for a moment the only thing in the world is baseball. And that's a beautiful thing.			"

												Having grown up on MicroLeague Baseball in the mid-to-late 80's, I was always waiting for the next ""pure"" baseball sim to come along that would rival the managerial joy of that first classic. The 90's and 2000's were filled with some great baseball games, but they were dependent upon you being able to hit ""X"" at the right time.  OOTP's early offerings were the first in decades to take the MicroLeague Baseball approach, giving you full control over both existing historical teams and leagues as well as the creation of your own fantasy teams and leagues from any era.  Better yet, they're completely stat driven, with the most ""in game"" influence (if you want) being your job as manager.OOTP 18 has taken the baseball sim to incredible heights.  They've built upon a core that was already strong and have refined the interface without making it unfamiliar.  Earlier versions had some quirks but they've done a great job of streamlining things in '18.  I especially love the option for animations, as this really brings back great memories of the original MicroLeague Baseball.  While I doubt we'll be able to predict an inside-the-park home run by watching how fast the batter comes out of the box, where the ball is headed, and how fast different fielders are moving to their positions (a MicroLeague classic), the animations should be a nice touch.TL;DR ... After 30 years I am finally ready to admit that MicroLeague Baseball is the 2nd best baseball simulator ever.  Buy this game.101/10(102/10 if I can make a team of only Samoan-born players)			"

												Simple review:I was introduced to OOTP17 last year, and enjoyed it heartily over the past 12 months.So if you're familiar with the best baseball sim (in manager mode or as GM) on the planet, with as many options as can be imagined...and you haven't purchased OOTP yet...what are you waiting for?Improvements from OOTP17:-The Negro Leagues are an incredible addition to this year's iteration of the game.-The improvements in the 3D modeling for every current ballpark were worth the wait. Great job,dev staff! Even the crowd movements, while somewhat rudimentary, are a nice improvement over OOTP17. Additionally, in 3D mode, the player sprites are a decent improvement over the chesspiece-like sprites in OOTP17.My only ""con"" would be that,after a few hundred managed games with OOTP17, and now a dozen or so in OOTP18...still NO FOUL OUTS ever! I think this is wierd and supposedly the staff is looking into this. That's IT. That's my only ""con.""-The MOD folks do a great job modding the 3D stadium advertising, the player facegens and adding player photos,etc. So what the game doesn't have (and frankly the player facegens are pretty darn good), you can easily download!-Here's THE BIGGEST ""PRO"" for me, a long-time baseball PC-simmer: where ELSE can you get EVERY HISTORICAL SEASON EVER PLAYED...included in the game? Look, I LOVE APBA; I still do; along with APBA Baseball for WIndwos v 5.75, and still visit that game from time to time. I always will; it's been a part of my life for 40 years. But having to purchase each season seperately and not having a 3D option is their biggest drawback. THIS game, OOTP, has every season, current or past, all the current ballparks, and if I want past ballparks I just have to d-load them from a MOD site. And did I mention you can manage, GM, or just watch games with current majors AND minors, with real rosters? Manage a game overseas...yours for the taking. Even weather patterns.NOTHING is left out.---The learning curve in OOTP admittedly is slightly steep, but not much. It's only because there are SO many options.If you haven't purchased OOTP ever, for goodness' sake BUY THIS NOW if you're a baseball sim lover like me. And as mentioned I bought OOTP this year and the updates are worth it. Especially through Steam so the updates are automatically done.You will NOT be sorry. And you won't be able to stop playing. I had to take time away from the game to write this review!			"

												First thing I'm going to say is that I'm not a huge baseball fan but I love stats. I really haven't paid attention to baseball since the 90's so I really have no idea who the players are but I still enjoy playing the game.I'll start the game with a movie or TV show playing in the background and suddenly 2 or 3 hours has passed.I love starting a season and seeing player improve or seeing players that other teams gave up on and I give them a chance only for them to be one of my best players.The amount of feedback you get from your fans or management is staggering and really helps with your day to day GM'ing. I love reading the little news blurbs about a game your team just played.I haven't experienced any issues running or playing the game. No crashes or other things.That being said if you love stats but aren't a big fan of baseball I still think you'll get hooked.			"

												I'm going to be honest - this game is not much different than OOTP 17.That being said, this game is much different than OOTP 17.Some minor additions, such as AFL, and small changes make the game much more enjoyable. Also, I haven't yet had a problem with over-talented players. OOTP 17 had problems where players would consistently be in the 60's, 70's, and 80's, yet I haven't run into this problem in 18.If you haven't played 17, be aware that you don't play baseball in these games - rather, you are the General Manager. You are the head of the franchise, and you decide the ultimate path that your team goes down.There are small issues - such as player contracts. I know that it displays the, ""Player contracts are not current"" screen at the beginning, but playing as the Nationals, for example, those contracts can be an absolute pain. Strasburg gets paid 15 million per year, then gets bumped to 45 million for a year, then back down to 15 million, then back upto 35 million, rather than 25 million flat. This is fine for normal mode, but challenge mode really turns into challenge mode with that contract.10/10 overall rating. If you want a sports simulator, this is your best option.			"

												I've been an OOTP Baseball player since the 2009 edition, faithfully upgrading each and every year, much in the way you might upgrade your NHL, MADDEN or FIFA games - is OOTP 18 radically different from 17? Not specifically, but it does add enough improvements, UI updates, and small improvements that it's worth the upgrade - so much so that I wouldn't want ot play a previous version without said improvements.It's worth taking the time to install player pictures, logos and other fan developed add-ons through the workshop, if you're looking for a more realistic looking sim, and its definitely the best baseball game out there.

												Having played since OOTP 15, I can say the game has consistently gotten better each year. Though I mostly play fictional, the improvements to historical have been nice as well. The updates to UI and everything like that are good, the team chemistry being shown on your team's screen is welcome for seeing how your team is feeling, and other small things like that definitely make it worth it.Without a doubt if you enjoyed the previous games or love baseball, or even text simulation games as a whole, this is worthwhile to get.

												Almost every baseball fan dreams of taking control of their favorite team and steering them to greatness ""the right way"".  Now you have your chance to with very indepth detail.  Budgets, scouting variables, prospect growth and collapse, owner demands, you name it.Pros:- Infinite simulation.  You can play for as many seasons in the future as you want (until you get fired!).  Draft and international prospects randomized each year.   - Very few bugs.  There are a few text issues, but nothing major.  Very refined series.  (Funny bug in my game had Don Mattingly coaching the Marlins and Mets at the same time.  Amusing)- The new trading AI is a step forward from the previous versions.  Its actually swung a bit too far as far as the AI valuing its prospects, but its better than before where you could load up constantly.Cons:Nothing major.  Just nitpicking or looking for a different game than what you have here.Highly recommend for any baseball fan!			"

												If you're the kind of baseball fan who likes looking at box scores or reading about baseball history, then you'll like OOTP Baseball 18.  IIf you're old enough to have enjoyed stats-oriented baseball boardgames like Strat-O-Matic Baseball, then you owe it to yourself to check out OOTP Baseball 18.  OOTP is the best baseball sim ever made -- full stop. OOTP puts you in charge of any franchise or league from 1871 to the present.  You can play as GM or Manager or both, or you can play as the Commissioner.   The game allows you to create fictional leagues, to rename your fictional players, to create crazy fictional leagues.  If you want to play out the 2017 season as your favorite team, go for it.  If you want to follow that team into the 2020s and 2030s, no problem.  New features to this year's edition include a better injury system, improved 3D play-by-play graphics (featuring little sprites and baseballs arrayed on a representation of your stadium), and Challenge Mode -- an online leaderboard that tracks your achievements against those of other players using a similar ruleset.  I love this game!  No baseball fan should be without it.			"

												While I'm still waiting for a PC-based baseball game to replace MVP Baseball 2005 (EA Sports), OOTP Baseball has more than satisfied my craving to simulate the dynasty-building experience that I crave in a baseball game. Semi-frequent updates to the game reflect real-world rosters and player abilities, and every facet of the game is very well thought out to simulate real-life results, daring you to make conservative decisions for marginal team improvement, or risky moves which could result in acquiring a superstar or a lemon.The best part about the game, however, is how totally customizeable it is. Whether you want barely any involvement in managing a team in a single league, or want total control over every single facet of your team's franchise (pitch count for your rookie league starter, or how often your 3rd string right fielder starts against Left Hander's when there's a DH), the game can be absolutely adapted to fit your current appetite. This is bar none the only baseball game that has satisfied my PC baseball appetite in the last 12 years (and I've been looking pretty hard), and I'm already thinking that OOTP baseball 2019 will be worth my money money as well.

The game never crashes, loads quickly, runs smoothly, and most importantly is fun. It is the most in depth game I've ever played with thousands of real players dating over a hundred years back. There is no game like OOTP on the market, and even if there was it wouldn't be nearly as astonishing as this series. I have absolutely no complaints (except for the fact that OOTP doesn't make basketball and football games too!) Absolutely GREAT game.			"

Includes Major and all Minor Leagues, Mexican League, Cuban League, Australian, Japan, and others with real players.  You can simulate entire seasons (or decades), play what-if games or series.  What if the 1919 White Sox played the 2016 Cubs in a series without the ""dead ball""?  You can simulate it.  You can take control of any team in any league, real or made-up, as GM, Manager, or both.  The amount of control and detail you take on is up to you.  Very highly recommended.			"

												I NEVER buy games like this on release date, but I was so fired up about promotion/relegation baseball leagues that I bought OOTP18 as soon as I could. Like I feared, it was a mistake. Promotion/Relegation looks doable, but it requires a lot of manual work on your part to set it up. It could use some default settings when you select this type of league regarding league levels, finances, minors, drafts, and so on. But I'm not mad about that. Promotion/Relegation is harder than it sounds, and I wasn't expecting it to be simple right off the bat.The problem is that OOTP18 at this point crashes fairly often. Do you see the paragraph above about configuring a league being a lot of work? I had spent something like 2 hours configuring my new Promotion/Relegation league with minors, etc, got a crash to desktop completely out of the blue, and lost all of it.I love the franchise, been playing it for 15 years, and would recommend OOTP17 to any new player. And I'm sure I'm going to like OOTP18, too, after a few patches (OOTP developments always comes through with the patches eventually). But this review is based on what I have right this minute, and until those patches are done I would not recommend this game.			"

												This is a ""shut up and take my money"", no doubt, worth every penny spent product for baseball fans. It is simply the best baseball game on the planet and will be scoring reviews in the 90s over the next several weeks- because it is THAT GOOD.Keep in mind, it is a text-based baseball management sim with an improving 3D game mode. You don't control players just team rosters, signing free agents and managing your team's entire minor league system to build winning teams over multiple seasons. As a GM/Manager you develop talent through your system, scout talent- not control an individual player or players in regards to swinging the bat or pitching as found in console games. Historical database allowing you to start anywhere in MLB history, a dynamic world covering domestic minor leagues and international leagues, solid AI, incredible depth, immersive play that will draw you in, FACEGEN technology, 3D ballparks.... all that and so much more.The level of detail and depth is amazing.NOTE: I was on the beta team and have over 70 hrs to date with the product. I've been playing OOTP since v.2 and every year the franchise gets better and better- this year was no exception.			"

												I have been playing Out of the Park Baseball for 15 years.  This is the BEST sports management game out there!  The depth and realism is amazing.  The development team is responsive and very often will implement suggested features by the next patch.  I have had direct responses from the lead developer from the forum.  Speaking of the forum, it has an excellent community.  Also, there is great customization.  I play a 24 team ficitional league, which I designed from scratech (uniforms, playing field dimensions, player awards, playoff structure, schedule, etc.).  If you just want to jump in without customization, you can do that too.  I enjoy playing this game more than actually watching live baseball.  In fact, I wasn't really much of a baseball fan until I found this game.  As I enjoyed the game and got into the management aspect of baseball, I realized the strategy and nuances of the game, which in-turn, helped me to appreciate the game and history of baseball.  By the way, that's another fun aspect of the game - you can keep a tremendous amount of history, including detailed player stats, Hall of Fame metrics, scounting reports, box scores, records, and on and on.Finally, I want to mention that I haven't reviewed a game before - except this one.  I have played game for over 20 years and have spent hundred of dollars on all types of games, especially sport simulation and strategy games.  I mention this becuase this game is so good, I felt compelled to do a review.  You won't be disappointed.			"

												My love/hate relationship continues. It's been a while since I played the baseball side of the OOTP franchise. And in truth, that's not why you buy or play this game. But it is a part of it. Not an insignificant part for me. So ok, let me say - if you want a pure sim/stat experience buy this game right this $*@&ing minute. Enjoy. They do that part very, very, very well. 90s out of 100 territory. Now. I haven't played the baseball side of it since '16. Which was the first one I really got into. I've bought them all since 15. Trying to play it like a microleague baseball revival is why I couldn't play 15. Took the next version for me to get into the sim side of it. My problem? I want both. My review for 16 stands, for the most part. I haven't had owners die like addicts during a posioning epidemic nor have I had anyone retire due to a carrer ending calf strain either. However, either play this like a management sim and never play the baseball side of the game or do not buy this game.  They've touched up the cosmetics of it, but the workings are still complete mashugana. I just don't think that for the 40 bucks each and every year, this game is worth it for me anymore. The rosters/players/etc could just be sold as DLC (as could the 3D stadiums, etc)  or (GASP) just updated by modders for free at this point. So if you want me to buy 19, make it worth my while (and I really want you to - my childhood was filled with Microleague leagues with friends and brothers) OR go the way of Paradox with an endless stream of DLC rather than going the way of EA with minor tweaks and updates for mega bucks. I've had enough. Really. Best of luck to you guys.			"

												I've owned many of the previous versions of OOTP and love the series. I was excited to play this latest version and setup a world baseball league with a 2nd league underneath it in order to use their new relegation feature. After drafting players, I've started to sim each day and I can't get past the first couple of weeks of January without the game crashing repeatedly. The game also crashed twice while just choosing setup features in the game. It looks like the game was rushed to be ready for MLB's opening day. My advice is to wait a few months before buying the game for the developers to finish working out the bugs...and if you can't wait to buy and play the game, then save often...like very few minutes. Even with saving often however, the game is unplayable for me as I can't even get to opening day.			"

												This version finally brings to life several features that have been asked for over the last four or five versions...at least that many.  Negro Leagues!  Now we can have Satchel and all the rest in our game and get to play with all the greats of that league that never got to play in the show at that time.  They've also tweaked contract demands which already show a big difference from what I've experienced before so liking that. Look, this is like Madden Football.  A new version every year.  I typically get the new version every other year unless the new version has something that I just have to have.  Or, more likely, the online league I'm in decides to update versions.  So I had 15 and 16, we were going to wait for 18 but decided to go with 17 and now 18 is out and under discussion.  But with the contract changes (that have gotten me in 17) and the Negro Leagues I had to get this one.  Very happy so far.  I haven't experienced any bugginess or crashing but if that does happen the OOTP guys are good about getting fixes out.  Heck they were at 18.1.30 upon release which is at least four or five updates just in beta and I even noticed that Steam has it queued right now for another update.  If you've never played the game, give it a shot.  It you love stats and the control of running a team and making the decisions then this game has all the numbers you'll ever what.			"

												Call me a noob... but shame on me for thinking this was a game you could actually play. Don't get me wrong, the managerial aspect is fine, but the rest of it sucks. You can't pitch, you can't hit, it's basically picking a bunch of T-1000's to simulate a game you have very little control over. Not a fan, especially for the price.			"

												OOTP 18 is the best baseball world simulation I have ever played.  The game just keeps getting better and better each year and the customer service is top notch.  The community is fantastic with many mods that add way more immersion.  Any season from the beginning of baseball is possible and most ways you can think of.My new favorite addition this year is promotion/relegation ala English Premier League!  If you don't win, your team may be demoted!  So many options and great things to say about the game and the company.  This year 3D was added and it looks great, have fun and enjoy some baseball.

												Another year, another great version of Out of the Park Baseball. The improvements to the 3d game mode alone are enough to recommend this game. With the inclusion of historical Negro Leagues, the ability to create relegation leagues, and the inclusion of baseball tournaments, along with many other improvements, I highly recommend this game to any baseball fan.

												This version finally brings to life several features that have been asked for over the last four or five versions...at least that many.  Negro Leagues!

												This game is amazing and it just keeps getting better and better every year. To let you all know, I'm solely a current MLB player. I've not tried doing anything beyond that, so I'm not the one to talk to about the countless other options, leagues, and time periods in the game. However, if you're looking for the most accurate MLB simulator on the market, I think you will be more than pleased with OOTP.  The options are ridiculous. All of the micro-managing that you can do is beyond anything I've seen in any other sports sim. If you don't like micro-managing, that's fine too. OOTP is great because you can customize and tailor make your own experience with a variety of options and settings. This year's game also brings challenge mode, which is a great way to compare how you do with other people, while knowing that they did not cheat. I can't recommend this game enough. Great job to the devs. Great game in general. Here's to the new baseball season!			"

												I've spent almost 500 hours each in OOTP 16 and OOTP 17. And OOTP 18 is better in several ways and in no way inferior that I've noticed.My favorite change so far is the way International Free Agents are signed. There used to be a weird soft cap system that gave you an incentive to binge every 2nd year and hire everyone you could. Now it is much simpler with a hard cap of 5M, but you can spend it every year, and that is much more fair to the AI. Sometimes you have to pay the whole amount on one free agent.10/10 would waste my life playing this series again.			"

												After a few hours of playtime, I can safely say, this game is far and away the  best sports simulation game of all time. Fun, strategic, and incredibly deep, OOTP 18 is a step above all previous entries in the series.But that doesn't mean there aren't misteps.A major one is how there is still no major tutorial mode. While at first this game seems like a ""Point and Click simulator"" the reality is that this is a deep and complex series of menus, some of which are incredibly cluttered and hard to understand without expirementing or prior knowledge. If there was an optional mode or at least a ""How to play"" menu, I think it would reduce the pain of newer players settling in.Challenge mode is new to OOTP 18, and it is awesome. Removing any chances of cheating, making you use all your knowledge of the game to build up a championchip contender. However, with this mode, some things are made heavily abundant. The major one being that TRADE A.I. IS HOT GARBAGE. In challenge mode, the A.I. is set to the hardest settings, which is natural, givne the name. However, what results is a trade market hreavily dominated by weaker players, with those players being offered for your best. (I.E. Boston Trading Babe to the Yankees for prospects) It's silly, and made worse by the fact that you can't pull that back on them. Want to run a Braves franchice? Good luck with the heavy contracts of Bartolo Colon, Nick Markaksis, R.A. Dickey, and Matt Kemp, which take up over half the total payroll, and are at maximum, 3 STARS OUT OF FIVE! That is bullcrap.Besides those misteps though? Everything else is excellent. 3D mode is improved to feature small little animations to represent players doing things, and even minor quality of life things like celebrations of walk off hits have been added. It's nice to see the devs putting in the extra effort. Most everything else is either kept from past versions, or slightly updated, but I'm not a huge technical guy. I'll leave it at these Devs clearly love the game of baseball and the fans, so I highly reccomend OOTP Baseball 18 to any fan of the game, or even the occasional statistician.			"

												In many ways, OOTP18 is a minor improvement on last year's version. On the other hand, last year's version was great, as was the one the year before, and so on. I'm sure the next one will be great as well, and I'm sure I'll buy it. One feature that is a surprisingly big deal (at least to me) is the inclusion of players who never reached the majors in historical league drafts. I tend to play decades-long sims with the same team, starting from decades ago and reaching into the modern day and beyond. This year, for example, my first game is with the 1962 New York Mets. I've reached 1966, and my Mets have become quite a respectable squad, getting good production from the likes of Bob Veale, Tony Conigliaro, Rico Petrocelli and a 17-year-old Larry Dierker. But I also have a functioning minor league system -- something that was hard to develop in historical leagues past. This adds a sense of realism to roster management, and introduces variety to replays, as some of the minor-leaguers inevitably develop into major league players. I would probably buy the game every year anyway to support the developers, but it's changes like this -- plus the ability for teams to retain partial responsibility for traded players' contracts, plus many more -- that make it easy to justify that decision and hard to imagine going back.

												I've been playing this series for a few years, and this year seems to have an extra ""polish"" to it.  Main thoughts:While I do not typically play the in game mode, the 3d adds some extra fun to it when I want to go and see the post game highlights from previous games.  AI trading is much improved; no more manipulating the AI.Challenge mode is fun and adds a lot of incentive to progress.  I was initially skeptical.This is also the first year I've done online leagues.  If you've never done this before - highly recommend!  The online community is great and a lot of time and passion is evident in many of these leagues.   "
