												This game is fun. Good graphics and nice things to do. I love the levels where you need to jump arround. Multiplayer would be better if there are more players but i think it will come by time.			"

												Gives me terrible vertigo due to the movement system. You don't teleport yourself places, it's a bit too sensitive of a touchpad movement system that sends you zooming in whatever direction you choose. That being said, the games themselves are mostly fun. The bugs, such as randomly dropping the bow and struggling to pick it up (holding, then not), take away from the fun.			"

												Great Job! beautiful Graphics and an awesome movement experience. i read that some players wrote about the touchpad movement and them don't like it, but in my opinion it is the first time i feel free and realistic moving.-The minigames are nice but not the important part of the game.-The jumping puzzles are amazing! please more content- The Idea of the multiplayer is okay but it needs more player to have fun. But nowhere you find a VR multiplayer shooter with Movement freedom like this game!If anybody want play the game and also the multiplayershooter add me or send me a PM			"
