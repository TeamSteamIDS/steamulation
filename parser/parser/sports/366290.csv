Early Access Review
								This dev is extremely sketchy and already seems to be running into money issues.  He launched his game with the asking price of 20$ in early May.  I purchased it for this price on May 7 2015.  Within a week he dropped the price by 33% permanently to 13$.  I made a post asking him about it and not liking the fact something I purchased in early access was already seemingly running into money problems and having to drop the cost so much.  Now I see less than a month after that he is already offering a 75% off sale on steam, so early after release and in early access.  I have never seen such price drops.  Be very wary of this dev and his apparent ability to manage finances with all these price drops so early into release.  I commented on my original post regarding this and showing another price drop to potential new buyers of the game and the dev banned me and deleted my post his ban message did not contain a reason.As for the game itself, it currently feels very clunky, there is no reeling animations or things of that nature.  There is no mouse or controller support. I would stay far away from this until the dev proves he can support the game and provide regular updates.  Censoring supporters of the game on the steam forums to try to block others from seeing what he has already done with the price by banning them from the forums is definitely a red flag and I would advise my friends and everyone else to stay far away from the game.

								Carp Fishing Simulator mentions it's the most advanced authentic fishing sim on the market. They were not wrong. After playing recent games like Dovetail Fishing which seemed very arcade focused, I was pleasantly surprised at just how much of a simulation this game is. Time of day, weather and peg selection all play a huge role. Don't expect to catch a fish every time you cast, patience is required and if you want to hook the big ones some knowledge of bait, line and rig setups is huge plus.

			Carp Fishing Simulator PC Gameplay [Early Access] [60FPS] http://store.steampowered.com/app/366290/ Steam Review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/366290/ Focus on steam games, indies...		

With that said you don't need to be a professional either. Amateurs can  randomly select bait, have a little patience and enjoy a relaxing day catching fish. I'm the first to admit many of the options went well over my own head as we catch mostly bream, barra and coastal fish in australia. Was still able to land a few 25 odd kilo carp, sizable catfish and plenty of smaller stuff which brought a smile to the dial. Far more then just carp fishing as well. At the moment the game contains several species of carp, catfish, bream, perch and tench with plans to add more species in future. Fish AI was a real highlight, all placed into the lake with no pre-scripted movements or behaviors. Releasing fish could use some tweaking but the catching part itself feels quite good.Graphically speaking it's reasonable for a sim. Setting up your tent and lines around the nearest snag point on the lake while watching the sun slowly drop behind the hills can really help on those stressful days. Would like to see more detail added to the surrounds but it's passable. Fish all seem to be the one size, reeling animations and a few other things need work but nothing missing that's gamebreaking. One nice feature is the leaderboard which shows all the catches around the world and how you match up, in recent patches it now stores all these for future bragging rights to friends.Other plans that I'm aware of is adding online multiplayer, different ways of fishing, new locations and character creation, along with tweaking and refining the whole experience of course. Carp Fishing Simulator can only get better from here and it's a game I can highly recommend keeping your eye on to any fishing or simulator enthusiast. Cheers folks and happy gaming/fishing. :)			"

								Great game in my opinion. If you can't get out in the real world; At least you can get out virtually ! It has awesome graphics and no doubt it will only get better. The first fun part is the Leader Boards, You are at war with this haha to catch the biggest species on each Species Leader Board. When multiplayer gets released, It will be so GOOD ! The current species in the game look so real. Another thing is, When there will be more lakes in the game; It will only make the game more enjoyable !! So if you can't get out on the bank in the real world, Then this is the game for you, HAVE FUN AND TIGHT LINES !			"

								well i purchased the game because it has a.i fish and not a rendered line going in the water which a magical fish bites it 2mins later and you reel in a randomly generated fish, i understand its a early access game but the reviews on here paint a more complete picture than the games state is currently in, those reviews made me buy the game.   1 map and thats it,  real time so if you can only play at night or day your only gonna see it at those times,  no matter what time of year you choose the lake looks the same,  there are glitches with the line,  i cast out a marker rod then spodded the area, when i removed the marker the line was still there with no rod, when this happens 3 times and your swim looks like spagetty junction is kills the immersion, while this game seems like a cut above the rest its actually a small game and doesnt have that many features, it shows promise and im hoping the end product will be along the lines of what they advertised, this was not the game i was hoping for.  currently this game is along the lines of a playstation 2 game that has no beta testing what so ever. its worth £5 not £10, but this is my individual view and should be taken with a pinch of salt, do some reviewing and watch some videos before you buy this in its current state			"

								Carp Fishing Simulator  in my opinion is not only the best out there but what us Anglers have been missing for years!I have had many fishing games like Fish Sim 1 & 2 and also Dovetails Fishing (Which just feels like Sega Bass)None of them come close to this.Early access so there is loads more to come and with what I have seen so far, Its a winner to the point that I now have this not only on Steam but also on IOS.This is exactly what it says, A Simulator. And i will stress on that because if you want to cast in and catch loads. You wont do well, and could possibly tarnish your thoughts on this Simulator.Everything you do from choosing the peg you want, tackle you want and Bait, affects your chances. Just like real Life!With the news of added features which Ive seen via youtube, It is going to be simply - The only Fishing Simulator we will ever need.I love this game. There are little things not ready or completed, but we all get that with Early Access.I will also add, The way you can customise what tackle and rigs you use is quite good.The bait selection is good, and you can also download the Bait Creator so giving you even more rewards when you catch. I feel great when I catch a Fish on a Bait I created.The 25 Pegs is more than enough to start with. The Graphics are Beautiful. I run this game in 1080 on Fantastic, I find I take more screenshots of the scenery than the fish I land lolThe 3 Bait Alarms work well, and are easy to tell which is going, either by the different tones or the different colors.Im enjoying my time on this Simulator, and I now know I will get in trouble from the wife for staying up all night !!All in all, I think it is really good value so far, We will have to wait for the addition updates, Progress etc, but if we are going off by whats already here... Its going to be fantastic!If you love fishing, you will fall in love with this.A must buy for any Angler!			"

Early Access Review
								Just a few quick impressions, and quirks a potential purchaser should be aware of:1. Early Access or not, no game should ship without a Pause or Save Game feature. Too many interruptions in the modern world. The awkwardness means I'll play less than I'd planned. If these features exist, they are not mentioned. Anyone?2. Can't choose your month to fish. I choose September, I get July at night. I choose May, I get.. July at night. Really? Another turn off. This is a must fix. Why have good graphics(See, something nice), if you can't see them? New fish are nice, but the basics are, or should be, the priority.3. The rod positioning could use some polishing, at least eventually. No line or rod in real life could stand up to the sharp angles, especially when  the fish gets within 20m feet or so.4. I hope that eventually, some fish sign will be added, like swirls and tail splashes, and a variety of fish shapes and shadows as the fish is brought into play. A bit bare right now. Save and pause and date choice are priorities.5. A few nice things. I've watched The Great Rod Race 2, and this game has the potential to bring that style of fishing to life for me. Hope the devs can make a go of it. I chose this game over the competition as it seemed better supported.    My first fish was a 20 lb carp. Lost a 30-40+ lber when the net wouldn't sit right. Got to move the fisherman forward to hit the right spot to place the net. Casting is next to impossible on higher resolutuions, the bar moves faster than the response. LIttle tricks to learn, and that's ok. Bream and tench and various carp are kinda fun. *** This is too good. Caught a 40lb plus carp, made the top 50. Ok, but when I went to photograph it(flash camera, anyone?), it was not there. Couldn't break back to the fishing either, until I hit ""Y"" to reset camp. Instead, that command led me back to fishing, where the description of my big fish and the overall list remained. A fish hit another bait, and, upon setting the hook, I noted that the line and rod tip were no longer connected and only the rod could move, not the now disconnected line. A magic rod! I landed the fish, believe it or not, by noting where the movement of the screen made it logical to find the fish with the net. You can't make this stuff up, its too good.Overall, what will make or break this game for me will be how convenient it is to play. I want to fish when I want to fish, not when the game says I can. Saves and pause features are  a must for continued play, and soonest. I was a beta tester for VR Sportfishing, an almost great game which fell by the wayside despite many advantages over other fishing games. Hope this one does better. More later, unless a better fishing game comes along. Fisherman can be as picky and fickle as the fish they strive to catch. Remember that, devs. Can't recommend it yet. Lots of potential here, like a new found pond that might hold a good fish. Good luck!			"

								I wanted to like this game.When I realized the casting sounded like a terd falling in a toilet bowl I knew something was wrong. I was hoping for a cool underwater camera so you can see the fish underwater. It is rather boring staring at water as solid as stone in a world that looks like it was built with minecraft.			"

								Like the Carp you catch in the game (well use to catch that is since the new version is just broken), the developer is also a bottom feeder.A little harsh?  Maybe...but for good reason.  He's all but abandoned the Steam community and the PC version, and using that money to work on the phone android version.  Oh, and of course working on a virtual version of the WWII Lancaster Bomber.So, to me, that is just unacceptable.  A bottom feeder if I ever seen one.			"

								Don""t you need FISHING RODS, to go fishing. Dowload one, bugs, did the update few hours later. Graphic not as good, it did go with better flow. Even set up multi, had  no problems, which would be cool if you had A FISHING ROD!   This game has the future of  being good, mult players for fishing is good idea and differant. Don""t know, if i should consider this game a joke being creates by somebody is doiing the CRIME of fraud.(your going to take MONEY, give something or risk being investing Fed, in US and England.) or somebody who does not know how to write computer code(I don't) and pulling a fast one on Steam.(good outfit and have my trust).

Carp Fishing Simulator gives us an authentic fishing experience and presents us with some very good graphics that doesn't require you to put the game on the highest quality settings to enjoy. The day and night cycle settings in the game makes the game feel more realistic. In comparison to fishing in real life, obviously, the game is not as great, but it definitely recreates the experience. Despite the fact that this game is still an Early Access game, overall, the game is still very enjoyable to play in its current version. I am very hopeful that this game will be further developed to make it increasingly amusing.			"

								I got this game as part of a bundle deal. It looks like a good game, shame it crashes everytime I try to play it (This is clearly an issue with the devs beta early access, as opposed to my computer since I have more than met the specs needed to run this game. As a follow developer, I need to say I will never think it is okay to set up the bare bones of a game and then release it early access and charge people for the ""privilege"" of being a glorified unpaid beta tester. When are other developers going to learn and understand that early access can ruin their reputation, something that can also ruin their careers. I'll stick to releasing a game when it is finished.) Glad this one was in the bundle, just feel let down by the fact I can not play it. This is a shame that the game is in this state at this point and at this point I wouldn't give it my recommendation at this point. I will play this game when the devs are finished making it.Early Access Review Score - 2/10Why 2/10?1. Game launches then crashes past menus2. Nice menu layout3. Not ready for gamers to test let alone play4. Graphics (in screenshots on store page) look good			"

								Carp Fishing Simulator ReviewThe fact is u CAN actually catch nice carp as the game is now. There is 1 active venue where u can fish on many different pegs, u can see and hear carps coming through the surface of the water ( might be an idea to fish in that area ;) ) although it might be tricky to cast on the exact spot u want if u play the first time. ( there is a vid in the community-hub that explains how to cast). But well, did u throw that accurate in RL, the first time u cast a rod?Very nice, realistic fishing game. If u like carp fishing this is your game.This game however is in development!! which is why there are some negative reviews around.I can't say they are wrong, but there is nothing that can't be helped by the active developer.Game works fine on my laptop, no crashes. (12gb ram) I see a lot of potential in this game, single-player and multiplayer wise. Earning money for catching fish, upgrading your equipment ( u start with 1 rod ), choosing complete bait and rig setups.(these elements are not active in the game yet, but they are planned)plse dont buy this game, just to thrash it in the review cause you had wrong expectations. This game is the best in its kind, even in its current state. but yes there are still bugs and limited playablity for now.If u want this game to be perfect, come play with us and make it better and as good as it can be.( i realize i might sound like someone involved in this game, I am not, im just a fan of this game, hoping to see this game bloom to its full glory)			"

								Currently (and I hope this will change soon, or the developer will provide an update), the game is un-playable completely, unless you choose the old version which also has major issues (the mouse pointer is un-aligned in the old version).At present, you can walk around a baron lake filled with graphical glitches and no vegetation, cast it with a single rod(but get snagged every time), and that's it.I know its beta. But for £10, I would expect a playable experience, which needs work on.Im hoping there's an update for when the game might be playable very soon as I have been following this game for a couple of years and if it ever actually looks anything like some of the pictures being shown (currently looks nothing at all like the pictures), then it could be great.So at the moment, the game cannot be recommended im afraid.

 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers. Carp Fishing Simulator reviewI know I only have a few hours in CFS, but this game doesn't have much to offer at the moment. Graphics:  CFS has some pretty graphics that don't need you to turn it on the highest settings to enjoy. Although it does require quite a tough computer to run CSF on maxinum graphics which is quite dissapointing. The water looks better than in most games, the trees look quite realistic, the Carps are absolutely amazing but the only things that needs improving are the fishing rods and baits. There are a few camera effects in the game which adds some points to the final score and also give me a sign of hope for the future of Simulation games. There's a ton of baits that look fantastic for a game this early in development since almost everyone of them is different to eachother. Gameplay: In CFS you can fish. However it is not as easy as you might think. You'll need to custiomize your fishing loadout with new baits, different hooks, different lengths and so much more. Then you will need to find a spot to try your luck for a fish in, wait some time, then check what Carp you (hopefully) found! It is very exciting once you found your first few fish, but once you found a strategy that works for you, it feels as if you've just cheated. The customization is absolutely amazing, you can change nearly everything in your setup including where your camping spot is. There's not much fish that you can try and catch (this is  Carp  fishing simulator) since there's only a few species in this game. Sadly enough, this simulator doesn't have all that much game to it apart from fishing and customizing, so I'm afraid CFS will need to lose some marks for that. However, it is fun to play in short bursts to just play around in the loadout section. You also can't try and escape from the game by drowing yourself or using a car. Map  There's currently only one, small and quite depressing map that consists of pools of water, some trees, some bases, a dock (plus a boat), a car park and a very creepy building with photos of Carps being held by random people. This isn't the best quality for a pricey game. So if you like some impressive maps, this isn't the best choice for you. Pros vs Cons Pros:Graphics are very niceIt has fishLots of customizationSoundsCons:Boring after longer periods of timeHard to understand how to fishPriceyOnly 1 mapControls are hard to understandWaiting for quite some time just for a single fish isn't fun Is it worth the money? This game is not worth the money just yet, but it does have some potential. So unless you're a giant fan of catching fish, this is just a game to watch out for as it grows. However you can grab this game once it will have a discount or gets released. Overall 6.5/10 - Has good potential for being an Early Access***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow  Original Curators Group Check out the Original Network Groups.

								If your looking for a realistic fishing experience then this it i dunno if you have ever been fishing in the real world or if your just interested in the sport but either way this sim is for you. Il get this outta the way nice and early the title is ""Carp Fishing Simulator"" the sim focuses on Carp so dont expect to reel in some big bass or a beasty Tiger Shark or something because that aint gunna happen, its not just carp though there is other species you can target such as Catfish. Pike and Perch. You start out with 3 rods you can setup each one using a variety of stuff like hooks,rigs,line etc its completely up to you. Theres plenty of baits to choose from and an optional bait creator tool you can download (For Free) theres a bait boat and spod rod (for feeding the fish) and theres also real world weather effects and time of day. Once you reel a fish in and admire its beauty you can then put it back and i dont mean press a button screen goes black and the fish just disappears i mean you actually get to put it back in the water and watch it swim away. Its really satisfying and is one of my favourite features, if you have ever been fishing in real life you will no what im talking about. You dont need to be an expert to play this sim but having a little knowledge will help you catch and thanks to the Internet that informations only a click away.  Now this is early access so itsgot bugs that need to b squashed but its very enjoyable and worth supporting its development.Multiplayer - In developmentCharacter creation - In developmentcons (Just the 1)No controller support - Im not a mouse and keyboard gamer thats the only reason i havent put more tym into this game, controller support is being worked on for v2 though see the forum for a video of it.My 1st Review on steam!

								So after playing carp simulator i have found alot of great things about it i love the way the wether changes.i also love the day and night settings in the game it makes it feel more real. The fish look real and they fight like real fish when they are big they fight hard when there small they dont bend ur rod rown as fast. I have played lots of fishing games and for the most part there all the same fake graphics and the fish are so easy to catch its not even funny i love the challenge that this game gives.You almost and really have to have an idea of fishing to play i love haveing the create a bait software it gives u a whole nother way to fish u can make stuff and try it if it worksshare it with your friends. Now as far as what i dont like the create a bait software is a little touchy when i make a bait and close out it will no longer save my baits anymore i dont know why but i have to uninstall it and then install itmake a bunch of baits and then close and do it all over again.All and all tho its a great game with little wrong it will make it great when it has more lakes. It wouldnt hurt if u had to earn your way i would really injoy that i llike a gamethat i like to work at it gives me a reason to play. To earn money and buy new tackle and poles instead of it being all open to you.I also love the fact u can save pictures of your fish to your computer it lets u make your own kinda trophycase.  "

								Very enjoyable game for a tenner, there are very few fishing games out there. And even fewer that try to get a ""realistic"" take on the sport. If you have even a small interest in fishing then i recommend this game. There is nothing that even comes close to this at providing an ""authentic"" fishing expierience.   Yes, at this stage the game has bugs, what games don't these days?, any game you buy can and will have bugs. However the positives of the game far outweigh the negatives, and as long as development continues and new features are added, for the price of a pizza and some wings you cant really go wrong. A lot of the features and improvements have already been shown in videos and are looking like a massive improvement, really looking foreward to seeing this title thrive.			"

								Very early review but will change if i have too considering i have not played to much. After having a little while on it and catching a couple of fish i can say its good fun, Yes it could do with some improvements but hopefully in later updates it will get sorted. Main one is your person randomly jumping into the air sometimes when walking over a peg. Graphics are also quite nice and i do like the fact that it is real time ( For example if its 5:00pm when playing it will be that time in the game too. Nice little buy and i cannot wait for some more to be added			"

								I have bought early access before and they have been far more developed than this, its very frustrating to play, its clunky and feels very dated, you do not appear to be able to save the game and come back to it.I play games at night so with this game I am always night fishing because you cannot change the time of day, which also means I am playing in a drab grey world all of the time.So am still waiting for that great Carp fishing experience on my PC, this ceratinly isn't it.

								This game has the start of a great simulator. There are so discrepencies that I have found in Logic and issues with the interface I have found. Logic Cons: Fish sizes. There is an issue (I myself as a fishermen) see with the size and weight of the fish caught.         The fish seem to always be large and so there is no realism to the logic. Most fishermen release lots of smaller fish before they hook into the larger ones. This also has to do with Location as well.Logic Pros: The array of fish makes it much more realistic in terms of fish caught. Many times while Catfishing I have caught a Striper or Bass instead. Drum even though a junk fish should be considered as well. They tend to latch onto anything here in the Ozarks.UI CONS: The UI is inconsistant and laggy, There is no exit button and the interface often gets confused over Controller and mouse/keyboard. This gets very frustrating as we have to use Ctrl & Esc to exit the game and restart the game just to adjust settings. I have tested this on Nvidia and Intel HD graphics cards a=on several compatabilities. UI PROS: Clean, Easy to understand interface makes it user friendly when the above issues are fixed with the UI. CONRTOLS: The controls are akward and complex. If using a control often to can have 3 or 4 armes out all at once so activating one item does not rlease the other active item. A reconfiguration is a must to adhere to the gamer better. Outside of that the UI glitches out greatly on the game pad. Over all: I think this has the foundation to be a solid runner. But step away from the add ons and focus soly on the glitches and better code clean up on enf functions. :)			"

								Well, where do i start?This game is made to bring to life the sport of carp fishing. You have to use your knowledge to the best of your ability as the game is deifinitely well thought through. The game has various species, definitely bringing the scene to life as youll be catching your target fish, also some pescy little nuisance fish, but that is something that happens in real life carp fishing. The team creating CFS are a very small group but are devoted to making a game suitable to anglers experienced or new. The game seems to be moving along nicely and v2 beta is proposed to release very soon within the week hopefully. The game at the moment is a little buggy but has plenty of content to keep you engaged. In conclusion i fully believe its worth the money! Go ahead and buy it! Thank you and TIGHT LINES			"

								This is a really awesome fishing simulator. Good graphics, good fish, good everything. It really feels like you're outside, hunting for the biggest fish in the lake. Now I know this is Early Access and there's gonna be all sorts of glitches and whatever, but there's one thing that's quite irritating and that's the fact that the smaller fish fight too hard. I know how big it is because of how slow the rod bends but when it actually comes to fighting the fish, it feels like I'm fighting a 30 pounder. And when it comes into the net it turns out it's a 2 pound perch or something. Still, this game is really good and it looks to be one of the best fishing simulators of all time. My biggest fish is a 49lb 8oz mirror carp, it's the 3rd biggest mirror ever caught so far. :) But yeah I definitely, DEFINITELY recommend this game to fishermen who can't go outside all the time. :)			"

								Do you like fishing? The patience, setting up the perfect rod/line/hook/bait combo? Then Carp Fishing Simulator is for you.If you don't like those things then it's going to be boring. Like watching paint dry boring. This isn't an arcade styled fishing game.Here's my first look - I catch two fish...in about 40 minutes. (Still uploading)

 Now, This game isn't for me. However, I can see the work the developer has put into it. The graphics are nice, and the ambiance they set up is relaxing. It gives you a real sense that you are fishing around a lake. I wasn't a fan of the actual catching of the fish though, maybe it was realistic and I'm just use to arcade style fishing games. I'd like a little more tactile feel of fighting the fish I'm catching.There are what seems to be 100's(if not thousands) of line/hook/bait combinations. So for the enthusiast this is going to be what you have been looking for in a fishing game.For more reviews and bi-weekly podcast about Early Access and Indie games check out EarlyAccessPodcast.com and youtube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast "

								bought this game for my phone and i found a major bug in it. so i said to myself that the pc version should be better well nope it has the exact same issue. When you catch a fish you dont have to do anything the fish will guide itself into the net so no need for reeling, drag adgusting ect and with being a fisherman well not doing them to things kind of defeat the purpose. Do not buy			"
