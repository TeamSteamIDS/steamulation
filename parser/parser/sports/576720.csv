												A virtual disco is such a great idea but this really needs some art direction. At the moment all environements look the same and are a flickering and overloaded mess. And it is not much fun dancing alone.			"

												This app is REALLY BASIC at this point, you may wish to wait until there are more features.It seems like a fun idea!			"

												Pretty good for a VR Audio Visualiser, not much else. It really needs online multiplayer.			"

												For this price, I don't expect online multiplayer mode. Just like Old Friend and Lucid SpaceDream, a must-have with weed!!!			"

												best vr music visualizer currently available... not that there are a lot of others to compare to, of course, but its still pretty good all the same. i would like to see more variety in the scenes available though, and some more 'geometric' visualizations, instead of what amounts to flat scenes wrapped around a cylindrical or cubic space... id love to see some stuff like morphyre, but fully 3d and all around me...the visualizer responds to whatever is playing on your pc, so you can use google play music, or vlc, or pandora, or whatever you like and the software will respond to the music... however, there are no controls mapped to the next/previous track media events, so youll have to fumble around for the buttons on your keyboard if you want to control the playback... its a minor thing, but something to be aware of...big kudos to the dev for working closely with me to get all my oculus touch control problems resolved, everything works perfectly for me now...
