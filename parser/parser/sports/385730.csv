												Assuming you have the same issues as me, once you get the optimisation/launch issues sorted (yes, not ideal - took me about 45 mins) the game runs really well.When you get into it, it's great fun.Positive:- Limited reversals: brilliant idea- Roster size: *huge*- Match types: lots- Moves: lots- Create a...: extremely in-depth. Haven't explored it much yet, but it looks good- New Day: just because New Day ROCKS.- You can beat up Nikki Bella with a sledgehammer.- Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens are pretty much spot on (they're the first match I played - Sami's entrance is brilliant)Negative:- No four horsewomen: Yes, another person saying it. The three women in the triple threat at 'Mania, and the NXT women's champion aren't included, and won't be included. Community creations may well cover it - but they shouldn't have to. WWE should be embarrassed about this.- Some things are a little outdated. Paige is the NXT women's champion, for example. But I guess, with no Bayley... and Emma isn't Evil Emma.- Amore and Cassady are included, but no Carmella. Same applies to Blake and Murphy - no Alexa. Again, a little bit lacking, considering the depth in other areas.- I tried to play online, but it couldn't find a match. Whether that's the game's fault, or just that no one's online, I don't know. But I couldn't play against anyone. So I have to give it a negative mark.			"

												100% better than 2k15, I love the new limited reversal system, it makes the game fun and challenging and it can be turned off if you don't like it. I'm actually able to use strike in this game more than once before it is reversed which is a milestone for me! This is the first WWE video game where I actually have lost a few matches, the previous versions were all way too easy for me even on highest difficulty. The gameplay is very similar to real matches, They finally nailed the realism and pacing. If you are looking for arcade wrestling or No Mercy (or even HCTP), this may not be it for you, but if you want a realistic wrestling game, this is a must have! Some of my matches have been classic back and forth, mutiple finishers, mutiple close pins, just the overall feeling of at any point the momentum can change, and it will, very true to life wrestling. I've laid the smacketh down on AI at times, only for it to come back and beat me. Again, I enjoy the challenge!      I also enjoy the ability to interrupt entrances or if you are the 2nd person coming to the ring, you can ""Break Out"" and control your own entrance (including attacking the person in the ring before the bell sounds). VERY COOL and much sought after feature for me. Now if we could only get a feature to attack after the match is over...But overall, I highly recommend 2K16 to anyone who enjoyed the previous installments. This may be the best one yet for me. The Roster size alone gives it a few points!Restart steam if you are having issues starting, or choose run as admin on the .exe file of the game, ignore the bad reviews about game not running, it runs perfect for me. No issues whatsoever. If there is some sort of issue affecting a lot of computers, then wait for a patch and actually try patience. My framerate, except for entrances (they are locked at 30fps), is a steady 60fps. Only one time did I notice a drop in fps, one time for a second.Also, a tip for people complaining about targeting, choose manual in the options menu, you'll thank me later. I suggest looking at options for other ""issues"" as well. Don't like the chain wrestling? Turn it off. Several options and choices to alter gameplay.			"

												Do you want one of the most accurate simulations of wrestling money can buy?Do you want (mostly) outstanding graphics and smooth gameplay?Do you want a relatively robust amount of unlocks customization options?Do you want a ridiculous (and I mean ridiculous) roster size?Do you want to play a plethora of matches from wrestling history?Do you want a satisfying amount of well-made community content?Do you want to talk about Tyler Breeze? This is the game for you	Are you like me and more or less simply want a career mode akin to the old SvR games, with a never ending cycle, branching paths and voice acting?Do you want a large variety of match types, again akin to the SvR games? Nooooope	Basically If all you want is a great wrestling sim with plenty of unlocks and historical matches, look no further. You will get hours of fun from this game. But if you want a satisfying career mode or unique match types, you will be often frustrated by this game. The career mode is repetetive and dull and you CAN'T use your character in any mode other than career, even after you retire. And beyond 2k showcase, don't expect to see buried alive matches and really any niche match types. 6.5/10 for me, 9/10 if my negatives don't matter to you	 "

												Pros:- You can make Daniel Bryan vs Cesaro vs Rollins vs Cena vs Orton vs Sting 6 man elimination chamber match for Wrestlemania 32 and pretend everything is alright.- Roman looks strong.- My Career mode offers unprecedented realism: regulary put on 5 star matches to get stuck in the midcard.- JBL is on the game's commentary now. Haha, I love it!- Customization options allow for masterpieces like this one[i.imgur.com] - WWE Universe mode perfectly emulates WWE writing team: enjoy feuds and storylines as random and incoherent as tv product.Cons:- No trombone mode.- Old glitches still persist, can't see Cena at times, RKOs come out of nowhere.- No Byron Saxton on commentary. Oh wait, that's not a Pros list. This one's on me. My bad.In other news, PC port seems to be somewhat better than 2k15. Except it doesn't launch for some people (upd: I believe these issues have been patched by now). Multiplayer, for the first time in the series history, doesn't lag for me, which is a huge improvement. Customization is improved from 2k15, but still not quite on par with older entries: no custom music, no custom crowd signs for whatever reason. Limited number of reversals appears to be an interesting change, adding a bit of a tactical layer to the matches.This review gets rewritten into something more useful as soon as Neville gets a push. And by that I absolutely mean replacing all the text with New Day gifs.Update: now that Neville is injured, I don't even know, this review got sad.Update: not as sad Wrestlemania 32 booking though.

												So far - a BIG step compared to wwe 2k15pros so far- the new grappling mechanics work better and make more fun to play- creating a wrestler has now a lot more items- big rooster- interviews to change attitude- attitude in general- choose a Title you run for- Rivalrys (including inteferences before/while Matches)- choose a Tag Team Partner- Portrait Scan of your own Face- limited reversalscons so far- Submissions: Low Health / Endurance has no effect on the Submission minigame, means: your foe is low on both, but still has the same big circle and speed to counter your submission) (monitoring this - so far starting as a submission wrestler is not recommended, probably later when you got higher skills)- Loading Times can be a bit sometimes (especially in the character creation)- cant deactivate match styles you dont like / dont want to play in career- no own custom entrance themesBUGS so far:- has some trouble if 2 Monitors are connectet- has some trouble if Teamviewer is running! (Game starts in Windowed mode and cant be changed, deactivate Teamviewer - runs as it should)- Tapping out sometimes crashes the game (needed to enter the codes in webbrowser for uploading, better use the steam-overlay)leaving typos for your enjoyment, have fun.

												Spent almost 6 hours trying to beat Titus O'Neil i.e. to learn the basics the game. I can't even describe how happy I was in the moment he surrended to my submission attempt. I never expected such a deep fight simulation system from a WWE game, it made me respect wrestling evern more. MyCareer mode is fun, but I'm not yet aware of all its features, so my character is 65-overall trying to beat 85-overalls superstars. To make it brief, I strongly recommend WWE 2K16 to everyone, but be aware that the game may be ridiculously hard during first hours.			"

 Joke Review > MyCareer as heel> 1v1 against Cena> Manager distracts Cena goes face to face> I dropkick him in the back> He falls onto my manager> He gets DQed and I win.10/10""I LOVE IT MAGGLE!"" Honest Review I've had fun with the game, even though I still prefer the fast paced nature in the older wwe games this is still a solid wwe game. I mostly just play the MyCareer mode, since it's the main selling point for me in the 2K games, and I'm still playing with a face run and a heel run.Is it fun?At times.Is MyCareer repetitive?Yes it is!How's the creator suite?Meh, not as expansive as 2K14. I enjoy making non-human characters and highly unlikely creatures that happen to wrestle. The good things I can say is the logo uploader, but somehow they make it really complicated to do. Entrance is the best so far, but it still needs more and use the PC to its advantage like custom videos, music and images. How's Online?Laggy, even worse when playing with more than 2 people.How's the roster?The biggest roster in a wwe game to date, but is still missing some great ones. I can name a few of my personal faves that are gone, but the majority of everyone's faves are in it regardless.How's the fighting?It's good if you want a sort of realistic wrestling gameplay, but playing isn't as fun as I had in 2K14. Everything feels too advanced such as the stats, skills, etc. I much prefer the basics and general options when making a character. The reversal meter is the best addition though.Verdict?If you want an online wrestling game to play, don't get it.If you want to make wacky characters, you can, but very limited.If you want a singleplayer experience, absolutely get it.

Recommended (no longer with Caution!) WWE 2K16 is a clear improvement over 2K15. The fighting in this game is some of the most fluid combat in any wrestling game, and the character creator is significantly quicker and smoother than others (at least the two I've played, 2K13 and 2K15). Honestly, I only play wrestling games for its character creator feature. I am a little disappointed that there are fewer customizable features than in 2K13 (where is was easy to create a massive-headed, tiny-limbed monstrosity), but I am willing to sacrifice some creativity for not having to wait 15 seconds for an item to load its preview as I'm scrolling through the menu. EDIT!Initially, when I wrote this review, there were a few issues I had to deal with. I have solved the issues by verifying the game cache. If you are suffering from any of the problems below, try that; It may fix them.But there is a warning; this game crashes very frequently. Currently, I've experienced three consistent crashes:- The game crashes when I attempt to preview a lot of the boots and footwear (the first two boot choices are okay, but the third and the next two rows are volitile).- Previewing any of Mr. Perfect's music, entrance animation, and/or absolutely anything crashes the game.- Starting a career with a created character has crashed the game.After I verified my game cache, the game ran perfectly! So far, this is the best wrestling game on PC! If you're a fan, you'll love this game.			"

												2k15 is the first wrestling game on PC since RAW 1, yet this one excites me far more because of the insane roster size - 120 wrestlers. You can have dream matchups and play as The Rock n Sock, Hart Foundation, British Bulldog, Ministry Undertaker with his own entrance, Badass Undertaker with bike entrance and 2 attires, Ken Shamrock, The Outsiders, Sting, Lex Luger (Even make nWo Wolfpack). All the wrestlers are fully detailed and have a complete moveset with signatures and finishers.Better performance than 2k15 at max settings.

												This is a bizarre mix of great and awful elements. The Showcase mode is stellar, the editor is remarkably detailed, there is an exceptional amount of content and it all runs beautifully.Unfortunately, this is let down by other aspects of the game. The commentary is so far short of the NBA series as to be embarassing. It's buggy (incorrect lines are often spoken, and sometimes the same line is repeated several times in a row) and there are times when the commentator is clearly reading from a script (particularly Cole). Some lines are recorded at a different volume, and sound like they were literally phoned in.The AI is wonky at best, and when combined with the awkward hit detection and inconsistent ability to interrupt animations, multi-man matches become an absolute trainwreck where AI teammates constantly interfere with each other. Several of the achievements do not trigger properly.Game concepts are explained poorly, no effort is made for a manual or tutorial. Not ideal when the series is new to PC.The career mode is built around grinding; even though this version comes with DLC to at least boost your character (albeit buried away in a menu - I wasted plenty of time before noticing it), it is still a painful slog through match after match against the same opponent - aggravated by the nonsense Authority objectives, some of which are rendered impossible by circumstances out of your control. Oh, and on career mode, it baffles me how an otherwise great-looking game reduced Renee Young to a plastic, Uncanny Valley resident.It's frustrating because this could be a great game, and elements of it are outstanding, but it's just let down by so many needless flaws.Oh, and I didn't miss 2K's continued gouging of Australians, either - a 30% mark-up is a disgrace.

												As a PC gamer, it's been an incredibly long time since I have played a WWE game. Although I've played just an hour of game play, I will edit the review when more hours have gone into playing it. First off, I'm pretty impressed with the visuals on some of the superstar models, especially Randy Orton, however I do feel there is some inconsistences amongst the models, some looking like they're from the PS3 (Jericho being a prime example of this) and not next gen. The game is not the best optimized, I have a beast of a laptop running games like Witcher 3, The Division, Rise of the Tomb Raider on ultra, hitting 60 fps with WWE2k16 on maximum I'm hitting on average 50, but patches will more than likely fix this in the future, after all it's not even been out a full 24 hours yet. Started the showcase and it's fun living out my childhood memories of Stone Cold. The roster is ridiculous, the amount of superstars to choose from is huge. The Divas however are lacking. It's pretty sad seeing Layla or Cameron in the game and not a single member of the ""4 horsewoman"". The creation mod looks good and glad they've put back a lot that was meant to be taken out the previous game. I've only briefly touched on the Universe mode, which I have enjoyed so far. Overall I think this is decent game, with future patches having the possibility of making it a really good game, once fps is smoother. It's worth a buy to any wrestling fan.EDITED REVIEWSo after spending more time on the game I feel there are one or two things I should add to my review. I still stand by the showcase being great and is arguably the best feature in this game. Althought the Hall of Fame showcase is not as good as the Stone Cold showcase, it is still good to play classic matches such as Macho Man v my favourite wrestler of all time, Jake ""the snake"" Roberts. The Universe mode is ok, but I feel it's missing one or two things to make the mode go from ok to great. The Career Mode is enjoyable, it's pretty darn fun using my created superstar in a semi-story mode. The interviews with Renee get repetitive quickly though. There seems to be an odd bug here and there that seems to make the game crash however this has only happened to me once luckly, but I have seen on other reviews/fourms it happens frequently to others.Pros:The showcase modeMy Career ModeThe insanely large roster (including a decent range of NXT stars to pick from and legends)Creation mode is back, bring back things they took out in the previous yearsUniverse mode is enjoyableGame looks good and has the presentation of a TV broadcastCons:The lack of divas (having Layla and Cameron but not any of the 4 horsewoman)Optimization (as mentioned hitting 50fps on max with a machine that smashes the recommended requirements)inconsistences with character modelsThe odd crash (happened once in my game, but seen it happens frequently in others)The ridiculous lip sync and the fact the mouths are so big when speaking, it looks like you can shove Neptune in there.Overall 7.5/10			"

The game itself is addictive (note: I'm a huge wwe fan anyway) it has that 'hmm maybe one more match' feel about it.

												I'm writing this negative review in the hopes that it will assist the others who have similar problems in gaining attention to fix this issue.After putting so much time in making many creations and downloading many more, I ran into a save data corruption issue. This needs to be addressed, and the game doesn't deserve a positive review until it is mended.This has been the first wrestling game I've decided to buy in 10 years (since Smackdown vs Raw 2006 on PS2 ...It was also a very careful decision after reading up and following the games made the last decade.) and would hate to see my experience of it, along with many others on here, end this way.In short: Fix the game breaking issues, and I'll turn the thumb up. Cool? Cool.			"

												LOVE IT!I have not owned a WWE game since PS2's Here Comes The Pain. These games have evolved so much, and have addressed a ton of little things that were lacking in the old games. The rosters are huge, and not just limited to the current one. So if you are not a fan of the newer guys, there are a ton of guys from the old school and attitude era. I love that you can create your own TV show, and customize the roster for different shows. I've created a ""Legends show"" with the roster filled with the old wrestlers. Story mode is an entirely new experience for me, and i think it's awsome. It follows the career of Stone Cold Steve Austin and it has you play a lot of his memorable matches accompanied by old clips. It is really well done.Overall I am very happy to have access to wrestling games once again (They weren't on PC for a really long time). It is everything i wanted from the old games. You are no longer limited to just one finisher for a wrestler or even just one outfit. The customization and amount of content is amazing. I hear players experiences issues. I have encountered some random crashes, and a constant crash during the WWE showcase mode, during Stone Cold vs Shawn Michaels. It crashes every single time after it requires you to irish whip Shawn inside the ring. I just end up beating him without completing the objective and am able to proceed through story mode and finished it without any further incidents.I'd rate it a 8/10. Looking forward to 2K17 and might go back and get 2K15.			"

EDIT 03/06/16: The game has been patched and all of the issues I had have been fixed. Now I absolutely recommend this game without hesitation! (Original review)[pastebin.com]Last year we finally got a WWE licensed wrestling game on PC in over a decade, but it was a fairly mediocore game. 2K16 is a huge step up from that - It reintroduces many features that were missing, has a much larger roster and online is greatly improved.In fact this is one of my all time favourite pro wrestling games. If you're a fan of the old school Smackdown or N64 games then beware that this is a much more simulation focused game. It's a lot more slow paced and more unforgiving but that allows for more strategic gameplay. With stamina you can't endlessly run away, and you may have to decide to rest a little following a big move rather than hitting another with no stamina left for a quick pin. There's also limited reversals this time and THANK GOD. FINALLY matches aren't just an endless chain of reversals anymore.If you dislike any of that then everything can be customised; turn off stamina, reversal slots, adjust finisher damage etc. Also this year's game brings back features like Create An Arena and a much improved Create a Wrestler. (You can create females again! Yay!) The roster is massive and includes past and current wrestlers including some from NXT. Entrances are the best I have ever seen and are now completely seemless which allows you to interfere during your opponent's entrance! Awesome!It still suffers from Yearly Franchise Syndrome™ which includes plenty of minor bugs and glitches and some strange roster ommisions like Sasha Banks and Charlotte even though Blake and Murphy are somehow in the game. And for some reason you can't use your own entrance music even though you could do it in the last gen console games. Commentary is also as bland as ever and feels like it hasn't improved since Smackdown Vs Raw 2006.However it is entirely modabble! There was tons of great mods last year from updating wrestler's attire and entrances to entirely new arenas, and this year is no exception. Check out Smacktalks[smacktalks.org] for tons of great mods including tutorials on how to mod the game to use your own custom entrance music.[smacktalks.org] "

												Currently, this is THE wrestling game to buy on steam. 2K16 is a MASSIVE upgrade from 2K15, with tons of more features such as Create a Show, Create a Diva, and Create an Arena as well as having the largest roster EVER with tons of arenas and over 100 spots of your created wrestlers. If you're looking for a stacked roster and tons of creation then I would gladly recommend 2K16.			"

												Good game but... the ""My Career"" title shot system needs to be fixed. Here is what I mean. In order to get a title shot you have to be the #1 thru 3 contender to the title. That is fine. (Even though it is a bit grindy to get enough popularity to move up the ranks). Then, you need to be in a ""rivalry"" with the current champion. This is the part that is annoying. I ended up winning the title after about a calendar years (about 120 matches - two to three matches a calendar week in game) worth of time climing the rankings and getting my title shot finally. I won the belt and in my first title defense... I had ""cut scene magic"" occur to take the title from me. (You can't control it, it just happens). First issue - the guy who took the title from me isn't the Champion... It defaults to going back to Seth Rollins for some reason. (The guy who I took it from originally). THEN I tried to get back into a rivalry with Seth Rollins (since I am the #1 contender still) and either A) he didn't wrestle - so I couldn't attack him to force the rivalry, or B) I had to wrestle against him, and no matter how badly I beat him, he was ""fine"" with it and didn't get angry at my wrestler - so again - no ""Rivalry"" is initiated. Now I am at the next pay per view - and have another match against Seth Rollins - this makes about 15 matches against Seth Rollins in a row... but NO title shot because I don't have the magic ""rivalry"" engaged.I am due for at least another 15-20 matches with Seth Rollins (despite winning every one of them) before I can contend for the title shot again.This needs to be fixed. I would recommend NOT buying this game until that feature is fixed, unless you enjoy spending a LOT of time grinding matches against the same opponent over and over.			"

												WWE 2K16 is awesome, simply awesome as a PC wrestling sim. Runs A LOT better than WWE 2K15, solid 60FPS in game at High settings with 8X MSAA. Gameplay is a little sluggish compared to the previous WWE games, but it helps control the pacing and makes it feel like a true WWE broadcast. Graphics are also improved a lot over 2K15, from the hair not clipping as much, to the sweat effects.Very big roster, it has a Superstar or Diva for everyone . It has the obvious choices like John Cena, Randy Orton, and Stone Cold Steve Austin, but they even added the more obscure Superstars, Divas, and tag teams like Enzo Amore and Big Cass, Alundra Blayze, and Harlem Heat.2K Showcase follows Stone Cold Steve Austin, but I haven't touched it very much as I am not interested in the story, but for what it has it's great.MyCareer is also a major improvement over WWE 2K15. Instead of having you embroiled in meaningless rivalries (""B! Blade! anyone?), you get to pick your path into the WWE and what you want to do with your career. Absolutely amazing, worth the money by itself.I would say if you have the money OR have not played WWE 2K16 on PS4 or Xbox One, definitely pick this up.			"

												It's not No Mercy, but it's probably the best wrestling game since then.  Combines a comparable control scheme, with an almost Fire Pro-depth moveset, strategizing on your reversals and stamina, and creative character design.  Matches can go long or short, and like actual pro wres, your match scores can still be strong if you lose in an entertaining fashion that puts both wrestlers over.  A fun little jaunt.8.5/10			"

												I have no idea why they got rid of the lobby system from the old games, where you could search for games to join manually. This literally makes no sense. The only matches I can find consistently are just plain, old 1v1 matches. I was hoping Elimination Chamber matches wouldn't be too hard to find because they were usually plentiful last time I played online (WWE 2k14), but apparently no one does play them. Even 2v2 matches are extremely difficult for me to find people for. I don't know why 2k decided to re-invent the wheel with online and get rid of the ranked and player lobbies for ""hey choose random match type and cross your fingers that someone in the world wants to play the same thing at the same time"".

												To keep this short and sweet, WWE 2k16 is the wrestling game that fans deserve, it is a massive improvement over 2k15 which lacked so much customization, had a lack luster career mode, terrible soundtrack and the worst matchmaking system of all time in a video game.                   Pros: Game run really well, no crashes for me during my 105 Hour playthrough, and the game ran at a                             constant 60FPS at 1080P (Expect for the entrances which are capped at 30FPS).                             The entrances now don't have a loading screen, it just goes from one entrance to the next straight away                             which adds realism to the game.                            Arnold's T1 Entrance and Overall design is incredible.                            Having the ability to choose what championship you want in to go after in Career Mode, as well                             as choices like joining the Authority or Rebelling against them.                            Soundtrack is so much better this year, and you can also use WWE Entrance Themes from the game for                            Menu music as well.                            Customization: You can create Divas, Arenas, Championships, Shows etc...                            Stone Cold Steve Austin's Showcase Mode is just awesome.                    Cons: Online matchmaking is still terrible and there is no leaderboards at all.                             Renee Young's Career Interview's are repetitive, random at times with no link to your current storyline                           what so ever, and she look's terrible too in the game.                           No choice of Voice in Career Mode, and no Diva's Career Mode.Overall I enjoyed WWE 2K16 way more then 2K15, If you are thinking about picking it up then you will definitely get your money's worth compared to last year, plus you get an extra 6 matches for Macho Man Randy Savage's showcase mode because you get all the game's DLC for free. 2K you are going in the right direction, keep it up.

												This game is an awesome wrestling simulator. I've only played one other wrestling game before this and that was WWE All Stars on the Xbox so when I began playing this I noticed it was completely different and people will eithr love it or hate it. So i'll tell you my experience with this game and you can be the judge whether it's worth a try. Initially my first week with this game was frustrating as I couldn't pick up the controls because there is literally no tutorial in this game; you have to pick it up and learn it for yourself. I found myself looking online to be able to use certain moves and certain grappling techniques. However after spending enough time on this game (as you can see from my hours) I would highly recommend it. After the learning curve I found this game to be extremely enjoyable, granted it can be a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ at first (have fun mastering the reversals) it is a fun and enjoyable wrestling game. There are 100+ wrestlers to play as (male AND female) and also the option to download custom made wrestlers by the community who didn't make it into the game eg; AJ Styles, CM Punk, Shinsuke Nakamura, Batman (i'm not even kidding)There are five different types of play modes available in this game.Play - Allows you to setup any match and play it in whatever ring with any of the wrestlers eg; Kofi Kingston vs The Rock at Raw with Hell in a Cell. This mode is fun as it allows you to make any match and is quite fun.My Career - Allows you to import a custom made wrestler or make a new one to play your own WWE career (WARNING: MAKE YOUR WRESTLER IN CREATIONS RATHER THAN MAKING IT IN MY CAREER - YOU CAN'T PLAY YOUR WRESTLER OUTSIDE OF MY CAREER IF YOU MAKE IT THERE RATHER THAN IMPORTING IT) This mode although fun at first can become boring and repetitve fast. After completing NXT you have the option for any of the main titles (Titles before the brand split). I found myself facing the same people over and over again which became boring after a while. The Career Mode is extremely basic and is not where this game shines. You can make your own rivalries and create a tag team with another wretler as well as having a manager if that takes your liking. Oh and you can't play as a woman wrestler.Showcase Mode - Basically allows you to play through Stone Cold Steve Austin's career. This mode is fun as it gives you objectives to do during the match (eg; attack opponent by ringside) which allows you to unlock extra characters. (although with the PC version you can just unlock everything anyway) It's fun but nothing i've sunk hours into.Universe Mode - Create your own shows, PPV's, Championships for shows, rivalries, tag teams. All that stuff. It's fun I guess but I often found myself skipping the shows and playing the PPV's only.Online Play - Buggy and laggy as hell - avoid it.As mentioned before you can download your own wrestlers from the creations tab and play as them in the ""Play"" and ""Universe Mode"". This is where the game is most fun. Although the game features a lot of wrestlers to play off the bat I enjoy getting the custom ring gear for wrestlers and play as them in the ""Play"" and ""Universe Mode"".So if you're willing to learn the controls and want a fun wrestling simulator i'd recommend this game. If you're not willing to spent the time to learn what this game has to offer and want a game you can learn in five minutes then this isn't for you.			"

The first one is the commutity creations. Everytime i try to download a character/arena it wont show up in my game and apparenty everyone is having this issue too, so if they can fix that in a patch that would be great. The second one is the ""create a arena"" its a fun mode but you cant actually have battles in the arena you built. Which would have been good to know before wasting an hour building my arena (like i said a good way to kill time).

												It's so much better then 2K15. I've had 0 performance issues, so I'm not sure what all these negative reviews are on about.EDIT: Alright, now that I've played a decent bit of this game I can expand a bit. The gameplay is a lot better then 2K15 in practically every way. The new submission system is neat, but the real star of the show are the new reversals. The graphics are nice although some player models look like complete ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥. I'm not too deep into MyCareer, but it has been fun so far. Also the creation suite is much more refined in this game. With a lot more options and some nice new features in there too. Overall I'd say it's a really solid game and you should go buy it. Also free dlc is pretty gr8. My only gripe is that as of now the game does not support 21:9 resolution, whilst 2K15 did.EDIT 2: So apparently people are having their save files corrupted.

												Short version: This is no different to last year. The only change is now you have a set amount of reversals (that you regain over time) to avoid the ridiculous amont of reversals of yesteryear. Unless you REALLY love Showcase or somehow weren't bored of the Career or Universe mode's repetition, you won't miss this. It's probably better than what THQ would still be producing, but 2K are just like WWE - phoning it in now they have no competition. Why try?Long version:Exactly as I said in my review of last year's game, there are moments of huge potential hidden in here.The movement is so fluid nowadays that things look a notch more realistic (like playing a tag match as The Outsiders, and Hall slips out of a move and pushes the guy in your direction as you run up and deliver Nash's Big Boot finisher, beautiful).The tech is advanced enough to have physics for satisfying impacts on weapons and through tables now too (X-Pac's Super X-Factor onto a ladder or table you conveniently laid below is a bit more satisfying now, but not as much as setting up a table next to a ladder, fighting on top of the ladder, and powerbombing the guy off it in exactly the right place where you laid out the table, which you may or may not have set on fire beforehand.But it still needs a lot of tweaking. They're clearly aiming for the more thought-provoking game we once had around 2007, with stamina and limb damage and how it affected your moves, but they're still not there yet. Even when they do add things, there's no tutorial and no real manual so people are tasked to find out themselves what icons mean or how to do things.Another notable thing is finisher spamming and no-selling. Spamming finishers and kicking out of them has become cool. This has been replicated in the game, and it's just as ridiculous. Your matches can go 10 minutes too long because Rusev kicked out of his 10th F-5. It makes the health bars meaningless.Unfortunately the graphics have always been a generation behind. There's been no major graphical overhaul in this version, it's still cartoony, and the Divas are still creepy as hell and have ♥♥♥♥ed up Joker smiles. Funnily enough, Steph finally looks a lot like Steph now - she seems to have a face that's been impossible to recreate in digital form thus far.And how's the commentary? Well Cole, King and JBL are annoying as ever. They're all good guys ('faces') now, so they brown-nose everyone in the ring and spout hyperbole like how Kane and Daniel Bryan was ""one of the most famous tag teams in history"". They have conversations about the guys in the ring... then repeat THE SAME CONVERSATION a minute later. So kudos to 2K for accurately recreating their horrible, repetitive chatty commentary. Well King, if wishes were fishes...While the roster is large (mainly because of the Austin showcase adding random guys like Savio Vega and Mikey Whipwreck), #GiveDivasAChance didn't reach WWE 2K16 so women didn't get the same treatment. Basically the only women are Trish, Lita and all the usual names. No one new like Sasha Banks, Bayley or Charlotte nor the female legends like Victoria, Molly, Ivory or dare I say Chyna. And for some reason Emma has her cool heel theme but is still dancing like an idiot and her face looks like a puffy kawaii interpretation rather than her actual self. With added sunburn to her face.This year's Showcase has you play through an abridged version of Austin's WWE career (with a few bonus WCW and ECW matches). Haven't you done a bit of that before? Yes! You'll be replaying some of the matches you did in WWE 13's Attitude Era showcase!There's no big extra bonus showcase this time around either, just one where you play one match each as the Hall of Fame class of 2015. Relive those historic and proud moments like when Jake the Snake beat the everloving ♥♥♥♥ out of inductee Randy Savage while Miss Elizabeth screamed for him to stop, or the time Alundra Blayze faced Paige at WrestleMania 31, or you can relive Kevin Nash's career- and industry-changing moment when he and Scott Hall... faced Harlem Heat in a tag match.I always enjoyed Showcase mode (and it s predecessor Legends of WrestleMania), but it's not very interactive now. Here's how it goes now:1) You start a match2) 5-minute cutscene of entrances and opening moments of match, very slow-paced.3) Get given an objective as you start the match (e.g. irish whip your opponent, do your finisher, throw them out the ring), this can take anything from 3 seconds to a minute or two.4) Very slow-paced cutscene plays of what happened next in the match, this can be a few minutes, because they've got to show every second! You've now been sat here 10 minutes and only played for 2 of those minutes at most.4b) Sometimes there's a QTE, which means you spend 20 seconds watching the buttons waiting to see which flashes, so now you're not even watching the cutscenes!5) Go back to 3 until match is over.This is combined with the familiar half-♥♥♥♥♥ unemotional commentary from J.R. He and King are slightly more believable, but now just sound mildly interested. I picture them sitting on the sofa, feet up in front of the TV and commentating on the match to each other.My Career mode is where you create a guy and climb the ranks. In the last game it was just a load of meaningless matches, and it's not any different this time around. Again there's huge potential here. When I reached rank #1 for Kevin Owen's NXT title, I made sure my bosses (the game) gave me my shot by taking out Owens. He was having a match, so as he was doing his title pose during his entrance, I appeared into camera shot behind him, the crowd went mental, and I laid him out.When I got promoted to Raw, I needed to fast track myself to the title, so I made a statement by going after the #1 contender for the world title: Brock Lesnar! He was having a match, so as he was doing his little pose during his entance, I appeared into camera shot...Ah, you see where I'm going. That's the problem. You can go after people, make statements, do your thing, but there's only one way to do it, it's the same old ♥♥♥♥, and there's no intricate storylines. Just as in Universe Mode, two guys beat each other up each week then have a PPV match. Same every month. Even if something major happens, like joining The Authority, it's like nothing happened, just a random cutscene that played.The unintentional highlight of this mode is the promos, delivered awfully and eerily similar to one of the Family Guy voices. ""Nothing but net.""Every week you're very awkwardly interviewed by Renee Young. She asks you about a guy, you stare silently at each other for 10 seconds, then you get a choice of reply. A lot of the time these choices are vague, or it's a meaningless choice. You'll randomly turn heel for not trashing your bosses (The Authority) in your first month in the job as an NXT jobber, or you'll pick a harmless looking response and your guy will insult the fans or something.There's nothing sophisticated though. All you're doing is saying if you want to feud with a guy and if you want to be heel or face. Every ♥♥♥♥ing week. Then do random matches and see random cutscenes, the same ones you've seen every month.Universe Mode is completely unchanged. It and My Career are pretty much the same now. I've seen a lot of people say they stopped playing Career when they realised it was the same as Universe.On its own as a game it's alright, but this is pretty much exactly the same game as last year, if not worse. I don't feel like I've wasted my time, but it's definitely wasted potential.			"

This is a strange game for me to review - well outside my wheel-house of usual choices here on Steam, BUT, in my youth I played a-many wrastling games starting with the glorious Nintendo 64. And yeah, I love wrestling games. Passerby's generally get them all wrong - they are in-fact NOT button mashers, but very strategic timed chess-like matches of skill.As soon as I loaded up WWE 2K16, a flood of memories came back - and man this title didn't dissapoint. The tried-and-true formula that is the backbone of nearly all wrestling games is still present, with a few new additions. Some good. Some not so good.I like everything about this title, except maybe I could do without some of the 'mini-game' additions to the fights. These shouldn't even really be called mini-games, but that is what 2K dubbed them. It is just little joystick battles that resolve a grab, etc. I think they are unnecessarily overly complicated, but hey, thats just my opinon.Pros:+Graphics are beautiful+Controller support is great+Comentation is excellent and hasn't gotten old yet+Workshop support, a huge roster of wrestlers, plus a deep create-a-wrestler (standard affair) ensures things don't get stale+Metric tons of modesCons:-I mean it's AAA, so it is expensive and there was originally DLC - what else can I expect, right? I wouldn't recommend paying full price, but I would get it on at least a half-price sale no questions asked-'Mini-games' to resolve parts of the battle are unnecessarily overly complicated IMOIf you are new to this genre, watch some videos or buy an older version first, but if you are familiar, you should own this!Peace,			"

												I'm terrible at reviews, but I really want to leave a positive mark to help this game out. I loved wrestling games as a kid and I just spent 4 hours making a group of superstars, a couple arenas, nailing their entrances, and getting everything the way I liked it. Somewhere in those 4 hours I realized that I was having a very good time. I decided to give a match a go and it feels similar to the arcade like mashing of games like Just Bring It, but had so much more depth. It took me a match or two to get used to it, but after that that feeling came back. This is a fun game. Not just the next big thing that you feel obligated to play to be included in the hype, but a video game that just feels right. I know this is opinion based, and it could be nostalgia forcing a bias, but I want more games like this on pc. The positive review is my small effort in showing developers that when they do good work, it's appreciated and more importantly, purchased.			"

 WWE 2K16 for PCOne of the best WWE games of all timeAfter putting 50+ hours into this game on the Xbox, I'm going to review the PC version. So I came back to WWE games with 2k15. I enjoyed 2k15 because I didnt realize how good a wrestling game can be.But 2K16 is way better than 15.They improved so many flaws that 2K15 had. Now you can't spam counters anymore, you actually have to think if you want to take the hit, or use up one stock of your counter-meter. The PC performance improved aswell! Positive:   Biggest roster ever. The career mode improved by 100% You can play the best Stone Cold matches in the 2k showcase CAW(Create a wrestler) is great again.  Customizing the entrance can lead to some funny moments. Creation of custom titles. All DLCs included. The gameplay improved overall. A lot of things to unlock. A lot of gamemodes Online and local multiplayer. Upload and download user created wrestlers. Tons of moves Neutral:   Facial animations can look weird. Decent, but not great graphics. Especially the audience. Negative:   Sometimes it takes a long time to start the game.  VERDICT:   WWE 2K16 is an amazing game. If you like wrestling you will love this game.  It improved A LOT after 2K15. My final score is a 85/100 Thanks for reading. Feel free to comment.			"

												It's better than 2k15 by miles, proving that the last release was probably worth skipping a release to get to this point. Although that's not as big of a compliment as I made it sound, It's a very mixed bag.The customisation options are all back and are utterly outstanding, at the moment the hours of gameplay I've had two matches and spent the rest of it customising and completing the WWE Universe mode to my liking. This is where i have most of my fun, nothing better than being the show runner and having the shows run how i want.The wrestling in the matches i have had are still very poor, messy and so, so glitchy. Little mechanic faults and immersion breaking animation trips. Is the character trying to pick another up but he's slightly out of reach? Watch him slide into place as if on ice... Is a wreslter next to an object or even on top of it? Sit back and watch the animation freak out before either giving up or just ignoring you did any button press. It's the 2016 version, how is it still so bad?The ropes seem to be a bug bear of the character models who spin around near them like they are electric. Getting in and out of the ring is still limited to the middle section or they freak out at lifes hard choice of weather you meant cclimb the turnbuckle, go to the apron or exit entireley, 2K need to have a little button reallocating. Even lifting an opponent from the floor can take some work as the character model struggles to comprehend what it is you've instucted it to do, often just looking down then stepping back.Everything in ring feels slower, not in a pacing way just a doddering way to keep the gameplay more 'realistic'. Sure it's realistic if you want to watch the Old age pensioner divison. Running around makes it seem like the players swapped their kneecaps for sponges and they are wearing moon boots. It's one of the ugliest movement animations I've seen in a game aiming for realisim. It's ugly, janky and cheap looking and pretty embarrasing, it's WWE it's already hard to explain to the missus why i still buy the games and still watch it... I've sweated with anger when the prompts of 'too fast' and 'too slow' pop on screen after reversing, I've sat emulating a Rocky montage trying to train my fingers to hit it right. I;'m convinced there is no real pattern, it's just what ever the game needs it to be at that moment.They've capped the amount of reversals you can do at once, which is a nice feature though i feel they would of been better served actually having to play the game once they release is so they can see just how pants the system is and always has been.It's 2016, as I'm reminded by said missus who once again asks why I like this soap opera... Why, why in the day sof 'Realistic action' can't i stop a taunt? Some of these dudes have entire dance routines as taunts which lead to your character helplessly doing the funky shuffle while a large fighter barrels towards you. In short the wrestling aspect of this game is it's worst feature, it's poor mechanics hindered by worse colision detection, AI and movement. 2K definately have not figured out how to do this type of action.Slightly less poo yet still on the scale of ""ew what's on my shoe"" it's the 'Showcase'. Which is still pretty much the laziest, most uninspired useless game mode. ""Hey, remember all those great memories of when WWE was good? Here, play this and remind yourself why you didn't just subscribe to the Network instead"" QTE moments which are epicly pointless, the QTE is not so much a 'Quick Time Event' but a 'watch this clip and press the button after a few minutes of an animation playing out' And you can't enjoy the animation of an event being recreated because have to focus on the button wheel at the bottom of the screen to catch the QTE. So what's the point?I know what they are doing, they want us to go back into our memories of when the product didn't feature Roman Reigns, and by having it fleshed out so poorly it will trick us into thinking we were just remembering it wrong and it did all suck. How many objectives per Showcase match do we have to meet? It's like a job i didn't apply for. 7 for the Bret Hart match alone, and some of the descriptions for the objectives are hilariously appauling.The roster is the biggest we've seen yet the oddest ommisions are glaring, the womens division gets clearly the worst treatment as the best names get dropped in favour of 2 types of sting and 4 Triple H's. He's definately going over.Customisation is amazing, the graphics are good for most of the character models although 2K still can't figure out long hair. However the actual wrestling is disgusting by and large.Here's a quote for the next poster, slap it right on Goldbergs forehead 'Best bought on sale'			"

You can literally beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of your opponent and still manage to get pinned easily and lose. The mini games ruin the game, they're not fun or challenging at all.I just had a game as my custom character where I pinned the opponent, he grabbed the rope and both wrestles just froze in the pin position. I had to quit the match.Lucky I got my game off a 3rd party site and saved some money, still, wish I didn't bother.			"

The issue I took with the game was stability. Innitially the game worked great. After about 15 hours of playtime, the game started crashing on the load of any match. I tried various troubleshooting steps to resolve, and I just couldn't clear it up. Too bad. Like American football, pro wrestling is a neglected genre on PC. I was whole heartedly excited to have the chance to pop in play from time to time, and go through and unlock everything. You'll notice a lot of other people had stability/save/crash issues.

												In over 20 years of gaming I have never had a game crash as many times as this. I read the reviews and thought to myself ""it's fine, that won't happen to me"". I was wrong, I am very disappointed with this purchase. 14 hours played and my motivation to continue playing is null. Massive waste of £40.The 14 hours I have played have been slow, repetitive and honestly tedious. My Career: Number 1 contender for many many weeks, keep getting standard single matches, no title shot, getting very boring very quickly, I will say that the customization is pretty good if that's something that interests you. Couple this slow build up with frequent crashes and the game becomes uplayable.Stone Cold/Hall of Fame mode (whatever it is): If you want to unlock everything you are going to have to through 100s of matches doing X, Y, and Z. 'Do damage outside the ring', 'do damage with the chair', 'irish whip the opponent', 'COMPLETE QUICK TIME EVENT'. Jesus H. Spare me from this ****, every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ match is exactly the same, the same stringent criteria to unlock a little bit of kit.My honest advice is to save your money and do not buy this, play some of the older games. I'm not the hugest of wrestling fans these days, but I have enjoyed the games in the past and was a huge fan of the Attitude era, I thought this game might be portal back into WWE but it has left a very sour taste in my mouth.

												When I was a little kid, I would always look forward to the new WWE game. Whenever Christmastime would roll around, my grandma would let me open one gift before Christmas, and it was always my wrestling game. I've stuck with the brand since at least 2000, playing all the WWE games for Playstation 1, Nintendo Gamecube, XBOX Original, nearly all of the earlier generation consoles.Now, as an adult, I couldn't be more disappointed in these games. Character creation, my favorite feature, I used to be able to fill up all the character slots with creations, has simply been flushed down the toilet like a dead goldfish, with no hope of ever coming back or being great again. I've had better load times on the old  Smackdown vs. Raw  series for Playstation 2, this game refuses to let me preview what clothing and hairstyles look like on my superstar because it's too much trouble to render.I don't want to get into this. The old games were just so much better. This game isn't worth the $20 sale I bought it for. 2K is a disgrace on the entire WWE/WWF videogame chronology, my childhood memories, and my grandmother.

The big issue with this game is that the control system is simply awful and makes it nigh-on unplayable. The use of right stick in circular movements to sustain or progress grapples is unresponsive and just doesn't work well. The old system of button combinations may well have resulted in repettitive moves and easy finishers but at least it was playable. This, at least after an hour or so of continuous play, is not. Even diehard fans should avoid this unless they can pick it up for next to nothing in a sale or bundle. I wanted to like it and I'll give it a better shot but right now I'm just extremely disappointed. If you chance it the odds are that you will be shouting more than you fair share of Steve Austin ""what?"" in pure frustration. For once the bulk of negative reviews seem to be accurate.*edit* perseverance unmasks an okay game. I'd still leave it to big wrestling fans only.			"

												While I do wish Career Mode had more diversity (different opponents, match types, ect.), the game is immensly fun to play overall.  Whether it be making my own storylines in Universe Mode or just battling it out with my 2 favorite superstars in a custom match, I fully enjoy the game.  Super Cena is a pain though.  It seems the devs coded Cena to be just about unbeatable on Legend difficulty.  The community creations are a huge plus as well.  There are so many custimazation options to make titles, superstars, or entrances and it really makes it feel like it is your universe to control.			"

												Fairly mediocre port of a fantastic game.Had troubles getting to full screen but these are easily fixed in the .ini file.Controls with keyboard are intuitive, but not ideal (this is to be expected)Roster is filed to the rafters with both legends, and current wrestlers, however many characters that would've been great for DLC like AJ Styles, Shinsuke Nakamura, No Way Jose etc are missing.Overally, for what we get, it's damn fun, could be improved but I still recommend it.

												Bugs aside, the gameplay is solid, last WWE game I played prior to this was 2011, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but now they've got a decent physics engine, a massive roster, even better CAW's than previous years, and the presentation is phenomenal. Gotta love all the new things since the last title I played, such as being able to pin when still on the ground by crawling over and pinning, limited reversals so you have to think about when to use them and can't abuse them, tons of game modes at offer here... Definitely recommend and hope they patch up the crashes/bugs soon.			"

												I love wrestling. I love the WWE. I wanted to love this game but it's incredibly frustrating. It has the least intuitive control scheme I've ever seen. The game has no tutorial so if you're like me and never played a WWE game before you're going to have no idea what you're doing. The one aspect I really enjoyed was getting to see all of the wrestlers entrances before fights and the MyCareer mode is an awesome promise but the clunkiness of the game and having to wrestle with things like unclear timing for reversals, make this game hard to recommend to anyone who isn't willing to put up with hours of getting destroyed by AI in early matches in order to teach yourself how to properly enjoy the game.

												It's not the best WWE game, but I've certainly been having fun with it. I enjoy the touches to the A.I of the make it so that Heel characters will actually get frustrated and sometimes just start leaving and let themselves get counted out or they'll go out and get a weapon and try to get themselves disqualified. I appreciate the physics they have implemented to objects even if they end up looking goofy. As for gameplay, it hasn't really changed that much aside from a couple of mechanics like the submission mini-game or the visual indicators for how to kick out of a pinfall. The last game I played before this one was WWE 2K14 and i'm surprised to see just how similiarly this game plays to that one. So, if you've played any of the recent WWE games then you'll have a pretty good idea of how to play this game. If you can get it while it's on sale (my friend bought himself a copy and another copy for me as a gift for a grand total of $30) then I def reccommend, it's worth a pretty good time.			"

												this game is a mixed bag. there's plenty of good like the customization and the match pacing but there are sevewral iussues. the first of these is both the ebst and worst aspect. of the game. the arenas look great, usually the character models look pretty solid, and the lighting is fantastic, but there's also the bad about the graphics like renee young's shark face and the disparity in quality between character models. john cena looks photorealistic while kevin owens looks like the console port of the sims 2 level of bad. the second prominent issue is the audio, it all feels like it was recorded ina dusty janitors closet, quite frankly. the audio isnt just bad in the deliveries of lines or the overall quality, it's also the lines themselves. i know it's hard to replicate live, genuine commentary on a game but jbl and lawler will go on about cena learning kantonese, like who actually cares? it's better than earlier years, however. you'd have a royal rumble where kane and let's say rey msyterio were in there and theyd blab about randy orton anyways i'm off topic tl;dr the commentary is still a hot steaming pile. the third and final (i'm too lazy to list any more) issue is that career mode is still a chore. you'd expect it to be like a decent narrative but it boils down to a neutered universe mode. i could go on but you get the point. ps: if you like dramatic 2 counts, you'll love the nxt portion.now onto some fo the goodthe first apparent plus to the game are the graphics even if they're also the weakest part in some areas. i mean the characters may not all look perfect but they atleast resemble their real life counterparts, which has honestly been an issue since svr 2011. barring renee yong and kevin owens the roster just looks nice.another positive is the vast customization. i'm pretty sure i spent more time customizing than playing the game. you can edit everything from what stable a character is in to what tatoos they have on their ♥♥♥♥. this is amplified by the gargantuan roster in the game, although it'd be better if half the roster wasn't taken up by OL STONE COLD.the last of the positives i care enough to mention is the realism. nothing quite accurately represents wwe's modern product quite like having roman reignsa take 17  finishers to the face to win off a spearoverall: pretty good gam buy it on a sale or something if you really like fighting tyler breeze			"

												Pluses+Animations added to make it feel more authentic, IE: surprised animation after hard kickouts, grapple and can push to the ropes and decide to give a clean break or give a dirty strike, certain animations added like sitting upright after escaping a pin to setup for the next move you can do if you'd like strike to the back. Little things like that to add a better flow.+Limited reversals improves the incredibly easy difficulty level of last year (though it still regenerates faster than I'd like)+Career mode post interview after matches adds a lot of life+Graphics and roster continue to get better. Sure is a lifetime away from the 2k14 graphics engine now.+Pretty good customizatin suiteNeutral/ Showcase mode is not as exciting because it's only Austin and a couple matches for hall of famers. Last year they had a better idea with it. But I can't put this under the minus section because it is technically still good./ Changed mini games, I could see hating the new submission system, I'm ok with it. I'm also ok with the new pinning.Minuses-CRASHING ISSUES - this is bad enough to warrant a non recommendation but luckily it's happened very rarely for me and only with entrances. I suspect an issue they'll fix, but even so I can understand this causing you to think twice about getting it now.-Online improved but still takes time to find matches and can have a lot of lag. For twitch reactions like reversal and fighting games in general where you're paying attention to the frame this can be really rough.- One thing about the pinning I would qualify as a negative is they still haven't gotten it to a point where doing things like multiple match ending moves don't end matches and that's partly due to the kick outs not getting harder sooner-Commentary is still garbage-Misc audio like strikes and throws into barriers still the same archaic sounds from years ago-Career and universe mode aren't very different from the past year, they could still use more branching storyline optionsSome improvements, some is the same crap. The technical issues still make me consider giving it a thumbs down, but I'm enough of a fan and enjoy it enough to push through. If you're not maybe this isn't for you right now. Otherwise I am having a good time.			"

The worst issue I have has is with corrupted save files, which seems to happen to everyone if you read the forums.   2K for some reason doesn't want to patch this issue, and I have personally had a support ticket open for weeks with them with no resolution in sight. Without the ability for the game to save properly, all you can really do is play one-off matches.   The whole MyCareer and Creations section is unplayable because if the corrupt save file issue.

												Disliked this game, very much so! Bought because I enjoyed playing the game back on the 32bit consoles and even on the original xbox. Since then they've introduced un-needed mini games which over complicate the game (from what I can see you can't turn them off) and this makes playing the game more of a chore. My number 1 hate for this game though is the size it takes up on the hard drive. It's obviously been build on top of older versions leaving alot of redundant/ not used/ not needed information that will just take up hard drive space (and I mean alot +50GB). RAW on the xbox was and still is a better game and that runs off a DVD (5-7GB).			"

+ Massive roster.
+ Decent graphics.

- Horrendous optimization. FPS tanks HARD outside of fights on a rig capable of running modern AAA releases on the best graphics settings at 60 FPS.
- Gameplay mechanics and animations are clunky and leave a lot to be desired.
- QTE-fest. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. These new WWE games are a major step back from the old WWF/WCW games by THQ on the Nintendo 64. I can't believe major titles with production values as low as this are still being made. I thought we were passed this. Almost as bad as the Acclaim games from the 90s.			"

												I used to spend Saturday morning watching WWF cartoons, will always remember the classic moments I once thought were real like... Rowdy Roddy Piper smashing pies in Jimmy Snukas face humiliating him and taunting his child, Big John Stud stringing up Lord Alfred Hayes and ""basting"" his face with BBQ sauce....where have those days gone...theyre gone....but, you can relive your childhood more through this game than any of 2K's previous efforts.

												What a miserable experience. The quicktime-event based wrestling becomes boring very quickly, and the frustrating aspect of trying to switch between the handful of ""minigames"" that every move requires you to perform just to succeed at a move doesn't help. Ultimately the game feels extremely unresponsive (compared to the classics on PS2 and N64) where it was all about fun and not about slow-paced ""realism"".The customization is the best part of this game, have fun making a character and then prepare to sluggishly stumble around a ring until an opponent hits you and then you just sit there waiting for them to stop slowly slapping you and putting you in pins and submissions so you can actually play the game a little. It's kind of like a WWE-watching simulator, you spend 95% of the game just watching the character you make either try to catch their breath or just lying on the ground while you wait for him to maybe stand up at some point.

												Review is specifically on the MyCareer part of the game.Cons- Not allowed to hold multiple titles (singles/tag-team) at the same time.- Sluggish mechanics. (not a stamina issue) Control pathing from running to picking up grounded opponents can sometimes get caught by the environment. Inability to get out of the ring while the player is near the turnbuckles etc. Problematic controling due to simplistic nature of the game's intended layout.   - Unresponsive controls. (again, not a stamina issue) Submission, chain wrestling minigame mechanics are sloppy, and slippery. Pressing a button a second too fast causes the action not to register at all. This happens during striking, grappling, and reversals. - Match rating system is a poor attempt at prolonging matches. Game only registers one grappling, striking, and running move per match. Players will have to utilize about 3-4 signature and finishing moves to gain a five star match rating. 6-8 special moves per match counteracts the game's intentions to make the game realistic.- MyCareer match booking system will often pit the same wrestlers against players even when no rivarly is in place.- Rivarly system feels stale at times. Not varied enough to provide storyline tension.- No create-a-move option- No mycareer rematch option. - Manager relationship system not explained. Pros- Decent variety of wrestling moves to choose from. This should always be improved. Score: 4/10Wait a couple years before buying another 2K wrestling game. 2K Games needs to refine their mechanics. Too many unexplained features ruin the gaming experience.			"

												This game is pretty good, still has that fun in it like all the others have and excitement.. however there is a few of what to me is some MAJOR downfalls. Back before 2k bought the game all submissions/pins was based on how injured the player/opponent is ..the more you ♥♥♥♥ them up the more likely they were submit..however that isn't what its like anymore. it's more based on how well you're timing is..there is a mini game you have to play to get out of a submission or even during a pin. what they do is make you press A (for xbox 360 controller) when you feel the time is right. if you are correct on your timing this blue bar that you are suppose to stop with said button will supposealy go into the highlighted area in a bar making you escape. Pretty much this whole game is based on how well your timing is..even reversing ..if you CANNOT reverse you are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed the whole match. for me i am not good at this minigame..i will get suplexed pinned and lose and im not kidding, i literally never got to hit my opponent because im so bad at the timing. ALWAYS too late or too soon i mean just ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ yo lol. They also make your guy a total ♥♥♥♥♥ at first (which is understandable to build your character from the bottom to the top) however it's very much irritating when you lose a entire match (ANY MATCH) over something so stupid especially when you are being ranked on it. This shows it is not based on your skill of the game but more if you got great timing. It's a pathetic way to go in a game like this in my opinion.. i keep playing and playing because like i said its a fun game, so suspenful and exciting..yet VERY ANNOYING for the reasons i have potrayed. You have to be really quick on responding which adds more realisim but none the less its VERY easy to mistime a reversal or a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing mini game. Do i recomend this? Yeah but watch out if you suck at timing.i only got 5 hours so far in this specific one , but its no different then the past 2k ones..they still got the mini games. as far as the reversing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, like i said its based on how well you can predict there moves and the timing before they can sucessfuly use it. I think it sucks but in there defence ...what other system are you gonna do to reverse a move?Your skills on timing is the outcome of this game.. NO LIE. ♥♥♥♥ this gamei still recommend it.UPDATE: i assume the devlopers know of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t as they give you the options to boost your character overall to 90 (thats pretty good) and unlock everything by a push of a button at any time. lol			"

												WWE2K16 is a massive improvement over the last year title.Game works better, unlike last year I did not need to mess with settings much to make everything run smooth.It has way more content (all the dlc`s on day one) and things for community to create. Create a Diva is back baby!The AI is way more fast and aggressive thanks to this matches feel more real.The animations are little better and the guys move really good and realistic.The new limited reversal system is a welcome change (no more reversals spamming).New circle submission system is challenging and I prefer it over the constant button smash.Sadly the graphics are stuck in the same place. The game does look good but we still far behind EA sport game as far as characters look.I also miss some excellent songs from the last year WWE game.I was coming to this game with high expectations, bought it on the launch day and I'm not disappointed.

												Hell yes, I recommend WWE 2K16.  The only thing better than a good wrestling match is a good wrestling game, and 2K16 is such.  My biggest gripe is no mixed matches.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I have.  I thought at best, it'd be a fun little game to spend a few hours in.  I've put in more consecutive time here than I have Fallout 4.  At the time of writing this, I am still not burned out on it.PRO's:+Graphics are mostly terrific.  Some Superstars/Divas are spot on.  Others don't seem to have had as much attention to detail put into them (not that they're ugly, just that they aren't as good as the really good ones).  +Create modes. Holy isht, create modes.  Create Superstars, Divas, Entrances, Arenas, Shows, Titles... the CAW was always the draw to these games, and it has been greatly expanded upon here.  Face uploads make for creating anyone you can imagine without much effort, and with logo/texture uploads, you're really only limited by your imagination.+Sharing these creations is so easy now.  If you've used the Community Creations of The Sims 4, you'll feel right at home here.  Anything you create (even move-sets) can be uploaded and easily downloaded.  WWF CAW vets will appreciate this - no more writing down CAW parts!  Just share that sucker!+Match types.  Plenty of must-have matches have made a return.  TLC, Elimination Chamber, Hell in a Cell, Steel Cage, Royal Rumble, Last Man Standing, Submission, Battle Royal.  That's not to say they're perfect, which I'll get into in the Con's.+The Roster.  Largest roster to date in any WWE game, and arguably the best.  It reaches back into WWE history and presents dozens of favorites and familiars.  Some of these even have alternate attires or versions.  Add CAW's to the list, and you're looking at 200+ fighters.  <-Holy Strawberries, Batman, is that a jam!+Mechanics.  I spent time playing No Mercy and Day of Reckoning waiting for this release, and I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the leap from arcade to simulation.  It's not as bad as people say it is, and I usually hate QTE-type things, but I find them enjoyable here.  It's nice to have control over how you place and evade grapples/holds, and I feel missing the kick out of a pin because of poor timing adds to that ""Oh, come on WWE, how could that happen?"" feel you get watching the actual program sometimes.  And like No Mercy, the grapple system is multi-layered.  If you've played No Mercy, you know what I'm talking about.  It literally feels like they mashed No Mercy, Day of Reckoning, and Here Comes the Pain into one big, beautiful baby.+Customization.  This is the best part of the game.  In Universe mode, you can control who's in what show, who they face, and who their rivals are.  It's like a very hands-on Exhibition mode.  Outside of Universe, you can control how the game plays by toning down (or pumping up) the new simulation systems.  You can control what music plays in the main menu.  You can even tweak the individual Superstar/Diva stats, both in Exhibition and in Universe. CON's:-Some matches are not included as team sets.  For instance, I haven't seen any tag team TLC's.  Such a shame, as tag-team TLC was usually among me and mine's favorite match types.  It's a bit odd see it in singles, but not to see the beloved team version.  -Royal Rumble is gender-restricted.  2K16 does not feature a Diva Royal Rumble.  Surely there are enough Divas in the vanilla version to do a 10-woman rumble, but adding CAD's to it, and I see no reason the women couldn't have one.  At least they can do the other matches.-No mixed matches.  I get it, I understand it, there is nothing that can be said I haven't seen/heard on the issue.  I do not want to be a man hitting a woman.  I want to be a woman hitting a man.  Specifically, Stephanie McMahon.   Beating Brock Lesner.  What's your problem?  The point of WWE video games is to create (or re-create) your dream matches with your favorite WWE characters, and Stephanie McMahon happens to be my favorite.  I can set males to be her enemies, but nothing ever comes of it.  We have Super Mario CAW's fighting Freddy Krueger CAW's.  It's not practical, it's not probable, it certainly isn't representative of WWE, but damn, is it enjoyable.  That's what made the classic games so great - you could have your serious recreations, or you could have totally insane stuff... or, you could be like me, and just want to have your favorite/created Diva be the face of your WWE game.  To ignore mixed matches does very little to protect women... in fact, it makes them appear more fragile.  Not including mixed matches as a possiblity speaks to the WWE's confidence in their current Diva's - both that their personalities are not strong enough to clash with their male counterparts in a digital space, and that their fanbase isn't large enough to want to do so.  Add to the fact that I have to hear Jerry ""The King"" Lawler spew his sexist comments during a Diva's match (""I may be too old for her, but she certainly isn't too young for me..."") as a ring-side announcer, and I roll my eyes at the ""respect women"" excuse for no mixed matches.  I hate to make this such a political statement when I'm not really seeking equality on a grand scale, just a better game.  Ah, well, hopefully mods will fix this.-Universe can be redundant.  I'm okay with this, but I list it for those that may be curious.  I figure, Exhibition will be redundant eventually.  At least with Universe, there's a chance of seeing some good random match-ups.-Lack of notable faces.  No Charlotte Flair, no Dudley Boyz, no Sasha Banks, no Alberto Del Rio (so, no official League of Nations team).  Easily remedied through creation mode, but the over abundance of Triple H's and Undertakers makes you kinda wish these stars were included instead.-Undertaker from his Fred Durst years is the strongest 'Taker without tweaking him yourself.All in all, this is a terrific game, and you can make any Superstar/Diva you want the center of your Universe, albeit with a few warts.  It's been a good minute since I've felt this freedom in a WWE game (pre-SvR and DoR titles), and I've never felt it to the extent I have in 2K16.  Couple this with the gameplay, and I can see myself playing this for years to come... unless 2K17 greatly expands on it (fingers crossed... 2K15->2K16 was a considerable leap).			"

												WWE 2K16 is way more better than 2K15, i was dissappointed by 2K15 but 2K16 is really awesome.I will list out the good things added / removed and the bad ones:Pros:Huge Roster including lots of NXT & newly promoted superstars.Okay Divas Roster with awesome DLC that adds Lita & Trish StratusThe limited reversals system is actually cool, i liked it, but if you dislike it, it can be turned off.Even more match types. More match types like steel cages for tag team & triple threats, Ladder, Hell in a cell matches for triple threat & Fatal 4 Way.Improved reversals animationsMomentum reduces when illegal men in a tag team do mischiefs so thats good.CREATE A DIVA : We needed this feature.Creation Suite, now with the face texture, there is a 100x variety to create a superstar/divaCreate a Arena, Championship, Show (FEATURE NOT IN 2K15Way better online matchmaking system than the 2K15 oneSteve Austin's ShowcaseDLC Superstars like Samoa Joe, Blake & Murphy, etc.Finn Balor & Demon KingWay better Career, choose what title you want to fight forA NEW REFEREEE YAYNew abilities like Dirty Pin, Rope Break & ResilencyThe new submission system, Yes many people might dislike it even i did for the first 60 hours or so trying to figure out how it works but this system is really innovative than the older button mashing. It does needs tweaks to balance out in the future games because at the moment its easier for the defender to save himself.cons:Cant see CenaNo CM Punk (Thank god move set exists)My Universe has no updates, still the same.My Career gets boring and repetitive after a while.My Career - Champions never change by itself, no simulation at all.Online matchmaking is nice but connections still terrible.The kick out gauge synced with the counts (I personally didnt like this)Only One showcase on Austin which is disappointing compared to 2K15's Five different Showcases****BIG CON******XBOX CONTROLLER NO COLORFULL BUTTONS ON SCREEN***SO overall Its WAY WAY better than 2K15, also its price is lower than 2K15 (atleast in my country)RECOMMENDED GO GET IT if WWE Fan.

												Having spent around 30 hours on the game before this review I can say I've explored most of the game features now. Without a doubt this is a big leap forward on last years edition, graphically it's about the same, but FIFA get away with that every year too :P The real star in this years edition is the large roster and much improved creation tools, and gameplay tweaks to the controls (some such as the submission system are a bit of a faff but in fairness it's better than button mashing to win) , and revesals are vastly improved upon (you can see the shock as you power out on the other players face... hilarious). A lot more expressive animations and better cutscenes and comebacks this time around.Pros - Big Roster full of classic WWE era charcters, All DLCs and unlocks included free, better creation options, smoother gameplay, expanded and improved controls, loading times are massively faster than 2k15 at the price of a bigger 40gb install size, replays are much better now (in last years game they often showed no relivant action), career mode now has more things to do. Entry cutscenes are still poorly optimised and cause terrible frame drop... even though once the match starts it's fantastically smooth.Cons - Still no Diva career mode, Diva roster is improved but still missing many big names like Chyna (Thankfully there are plenty on custom downloadable area), some of the controls are still a bit sluggish and faffy to use (Submissions for example), Custom photo importing is still very poorly supported.Overall - Must have for Wrestling fans.

Edited to add more : I'm adding to this because I've played it a bit more... Well the showcase isn't like 2k15 they make up for it in my career mode theres alot more focus and alot more in it than 2k15... don't forget the rooster in the game is the biggest I've ever seen.... but the showcase is rather short... where career mode is made better hope that helps			"

												I love this game so much that I cry every time I leave my house because I'm not playing it then.And don't you dare buy WWE 2K15 over this game. Don't you dare. This game is everything 2K15 should've been. It fixes a lot of the faults that 2K15 had, plus it is way better optimized for the PC than than 2K15 was. If you decide to buy 2K15 but not this I will punch you in the face!Also, if you are getting stuttering during entrances like I was, I (sort of) found a fix. Go to your documents folder (under C:\Users\[insert name here]\Documents\WWE2K16) and go into the config.ini file. Once in it, change simple_lighting to on and then change audience_tessellation to off. It's not perfect because it will turn (current day) Sting and Luke Harper into black silhouettes during their entrances. However, if you go to into ""advanced creation"" for Luke and Sting's entrances, change the lighting to whatever lighting you want and it'll make the character models look normal again. For Luke I changed it to Undertaker's lighting and for Sting I used no lighting at all. Hopefully 2K will fix the stuttering in an upcoming patch. However, I never had any frame rate drops during matches.			"

												Submission system is broken, 2K still hasn't fixed it. The controls don't feel fluid and there isn't a decent tutorial or guide on how to play. The manuel that comes with the game doesn't give players a good idea of how to win their first match much less progress through the game. Want to create a custom character with your face or some celebrity? It's a complicated process that kinda works. The worst though is the AI... I've had the computer crawling on the ground yet it still finds a way to counter my attacks. I have had the computer down to virtually zero health and STILL lost the match because SOMEHOW it was able to get me into a submission hold. The counter system is also broken, with the player becoming frustrated at hitting the R trigger too fast or too slow and getting steamrolled by the computer AI. I had really high hopes for this title but not being able to progress from my first match because of the broken AI has left me requesting a refund for this title. I grew up playing Wrestlemania and WWE on N64... This is just a halfway decent title that would be better if 2K would take the time to fix these issues.			"

												So far from what I've seen, the game is entirely in working order, it runs just fine, and every single piece of content is here, unlike last time. So, as far as the port goes, it's safe to buy. As for the game itself, it sports a massive roster, more customization than you could ask for (except maybe create-a-finisher,) and the trademark Universe, My Career, and 2K Showcase modes. If you're a fan of WWE, or even just the games, this one is definitely one to pick up. My only real complaint I have with the game so far is that it's missing some of the old gimmick matches, such as the Inferno match, Casket match, and even the locker room and backstage brawls, however, this can easily be looked past by some. As I put more time into the game, I will update this revew with more problems or gripes I have with the game.			"

												Well after playing this game for a little while I can say that I can only recommend it if:•	You have a high end PC to actually run this port. (I have an i7 6700K, GTX970, 16 GB RAM)•	You have a controller •	You have a second, spare controller. The submission system might make you break the original controller•	You do not mind learning the new submission system, which most people on the consoles either liked or despised.•	You do not mind staring at Stone Cold Steve Austin’s armpits for at least 5 to 10 minutes. For some reason the game gets stuck on that splash screen when you run it for the first time (or after computer rebooted)•	You already know that you will like the game. For example you played it on a console before and did not think that it is a complete rubbish. Or if you played WWE 2K15 on PC and only thought that the game could do with a bit more content (like more customisation, more in-depth MyCareer, more match types, more playable characters) and a bit more fluid movement, animations.•	You read the reviews for the PS4, Xbox One versions of the game and still thought that you want to play this game. •	You really do not mind the new submission system.Otherwise I cannot recommend this game to you.

I never really intended to play this, and then got kind of addicted to it,,,There is absolutely loads to do - any number of match types, a ton of wrestlers, career mode and so on. That alone is enough for me to give the thumbs-up, but it's not without its issues - gameplay is a bit stiff, the commentary desperately needs more variety (and to actually pay attention to what's happening on screen!), and career mode is, sadly, a bit of a grind. As someone who doesn't normally play games like this, maybe I have unrealistic expectations, but it all felt a bit 'samey' after a while. Also, if they really want to get on side with me, make the women's stuff equal to the men's!! I want to create an awesome female wrestler who I can own a Royal Rumble with!Nevertheless, watching Sting suplex the living daylights out of...Sting (because some of the wrestlers have multiple versions) amused me enormously.It is worth getting on sale (I think I only paid about £8) if you are not a huge wrestling fan. If you are a huge wrestling fan, probably worth the asking price.			"

												First of all it's not a bad game neither it is a very good one.Pros-Amazing Character Design. Seriously numerious customization options are available.-WWE universe moments, although it kinda gets repetitive after some point.-HUUUGE amount of move-set options. And ability to mix and match your moves.Cons-Bad gameplay, just worst. I am not against Quick Time Events, but not only they have been used excessively, they are also buggy and make the fight just not look right.-Matches are slow paced. It doesn't give you the feel of fight.-Reversal mechanic is just awful. You've got 3-5 bars, if they fill up you can do reversals. Enemy AI seems to be so accurate. And once you passed your queue on that bars, oh it's downfall from there. You do reversal, ai does reversal but in the end he beats you up and pins you. OH PINS!-MOST ANNOYING THING IN THE GAME IS PIN MECHANIC, It's plain stupid. It's just the worst game design of all.You might be winning the fight but just because you passed on that small spot, All that time will be for nothing. Who makes pin mechanic an accuracy action. Why not mashing, why not something else. :(-Most minigames are stupid. Takes your eyes away from the fight. You can't even watch the move you are doing while doing those minigames.-The career mod; you have to do 600 matches or so to get to fighting rating 84 or so. That slow progress frustrates you.Well i kinda regret buying this game. I thought i would find action and badassery in this one. But all i find was minigames and character creation.

												Its alot Better than 2K15 i got to Admit- Bigger Roster- Good Steve Austin Story and Bonus Objective- Godlike Animation that makes the Wrestler look more alive- All ECW Titles (Okay the Tage Team Title misses)But why can´t i not recommend it ? You might askWell.....- AI can Counter the Most Ridicoulus Moves ever (Even when their Counter Bar is empty they can still Counter your Finisher)- Stamina Systeme is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t AI can Kick out after many Finishers when they have Enough Stamina ""Purple Bar"" (I gave Ryback 6 DDTs and he could still kick out even tougth his HEad was Bleeding and his Damage Meter on his Head was Red)- My Career locks Items that i can use in Universe Mode and Normal Matches (Why ?)- Universe Mode is Buggy as Hell, i was 1# Contender for the NXT Title but i didnt earn a Single Titlematch or could fight against the Champ (even Tough im his Nr. 1 Rival). I knwo that you can Edit the Matches and can start Rivalries but still i doesn`t make sense at all- Games crahses sometimes for No Reason at allI will change my ""Not recommend"" to ""Recommend"" If 2K fixes some of these Problems but for now stay away from the Game			"

The sound and graphics are lackluster and the control scheme is just ♥♥♥♥ poor. I can't be more completely underwhelmed with this game.

												The game revolves around the reversal....it is just wait for right trigger.  You can turn the reversal all the way down for the AI and all the way up for you, and still it is just a game of reversal....Game play is trash.  FPS is trash, good luck finding a fix online.  Career mode is a joke.  The voice acting for your char, is limited to a miz sounding character.  The questions you are asked are annoyingly simple, and your answer are even more.  Buy this game if you enjoy beating your head against the wall, that's all this piece of crap is.			"

												Awful game do not buy.I decided against my better judgement to give wrestling games a try again, what a mistake that was. The port is very poor, the game always launches in windowed mode regardless of what you have it set to, there's tonnes of screen tearing even with v-sync on and entrances can very often tank the fps. While the roster is very large there are some glaring omissions like Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Rob Van Dam and Hulk Hogan, however Hogan is a more complicated issue. many of the characters are not in career mode and are mostly just there for free play. The In ring gameplay is ok some of the new systems like the submission mechanic are downright awful but for the most part it's ok.Career mode is where i spent most of my time. You start out in NXT and slowly climb the ranks till you face Finn Balor for the NXT title and then you are moved up to the main roster and can choose a belt to go after, The ambitious man that i am i went for the WWE title. For a while career mode was good i had a storyline since I'd come up from NXT which basically boiled down to the authority thinking i wasn't good enough. on the way to my first pay per view i had lots of cutscenes and interviews that helped develop the storyline which culminated in a ppv match against big show and kane. After that the story continues and advances to Triple H attacking me himself and running in on my matches, again lots of cutscenes and interviews to advance the storyline which ended with a hell in a cell match against Triple H where i pedigreed Triple H through the cell ceiling. This is where career mode took a turn for the worse, by this point i was pretty happy with career mode I'd had a good storyline and good matches but that all ended here. After the hell in a cell match i had no more storylines no more cutscenes nothing i was 4th in ranking for the title at this point and i was just playing matches against the likes of Ryback and Mark Henry over and over. Sometimes a wrestler would run in on my match and it would start a feud but after the run in it's back to the same old random matches and then i got a normal match at the ppv with a rival I'd have had no buildup for. Then the next night on raw the same wrestler i just ended a rivalry with comes out and starts it again so it's another month of the same match over and over to end in a ppv with no storyline or buildup.By this point i was getting pretty bored of career mode and was considering uninstalling the game when i saw the next PPV was the royal rumble and i thought there's a storyline to be made there, then i got in a rivalry and thought ok i can eliminate this guy at the rumble and get the title shot this might be ok. Then the royal rumble came along and i saw i wasn't in the rumble even though i was the number 3 contender for the title, after some frantic googling to find out why it turns out if you are in a rivalry you can't do any special matches at a ppv so no money in the bank no royal rumble which is the dumbest thing I've ever seen if you made it so no one in a feud could be in the rumble then there would be like 3 people.By this point i thought well ok I'll get in a feud with the rumble winner and make the title match a triple threat, well you can't do that either because the game doesn't tell you who won the rumble. After some more googling i found out it doesn't matter anyway because apparently the AI doesn't cash in money in the bank and doesn't take the rumble title shot so i thought I'll play till mania and get in a feud with the title holder then it happens... the message you are locked in a rivalry with a mystery opponent pops up I'm thinking ok another actual storyline this might be ok. Well as it turns out it was Triple H, i started getting the exact same cutscenes as when i started the game so i was playing through the single storyline this game has twice instead of getting the title shot at mania. After that i decided to just skip all my matches until money in the bank and go that route. I remembered not to get in a rivalry with anyone before it so i could be in the ladder match and on the day of the ppv I'm in a normal match with Kane even though i'm the number 1 contender.The reason I'm telling this story is because anyone buying this game should know what they are in for a grind fest playing the same matches every week, no storylines, broken mechanics, and the game ♥♥♥♥ing you every time you try to make a storyline yourself.The career mode was very obviously rushed out the door and not play tested because anyone who is even a casual fan of wrestling would pick up on some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this mode like the fact that once you turn heel it's impossible to turn face, it considers hitting someone with a chair in the Tables Ladders and Chairs match a heel move, if you get thrown out of the ring the game acts like you ran out the ring and it's counted as a heel move however there's nothing the game considers a face action to counteract this. The pay per views are laughable most of the ppvs in the game none of the titles are defended and at night of champions the one where all titles are defended one is defended. You have to be very lucky to be in a special match 99% of the time you will be in a normal 1v1 match regardless of whether it's mania, extreme rules, hell in a cell or the rumble.The custom wrestler creator is decent not great and once you've made your wrestler be prepared to shell out money for the skill boost or start out unable to wrestle.The only really good thing about this game is the entrance maker and even then you have to get a 3rd party program to get custom music for your entrance. Avoid this game at all costs unless you want Maggle Cole telling you how great it is to be on monday night raw even more than he already does.  "

												Alright what do I have to say about WWE 2K16? Well to start off, this is a pretty good upgrade from the previous installment(s). It adds quite a bit, but also removes some features from the past games. So far in the 60 hours I've put in the game is solid and plays well. Granted some of the animations and storylines in MyCareer can be clunky and overdone. Like how you get the same interviews over and over again. But other than that the game is pretty good and Universe mode and CAW are great modes. Showcase is good aswell. The only thing that I have trouble with is some minor things in MyCareer mode. Other than that its a good solid experience. Would recommend to any wrestling fans. 7/10			"

												Is this game buggy and terrible? Yes.Is this games My Career very WWE feeling? Yes, it attempts to have very silly story lines that make no sense just like you would expect from wrestling.Is this game enjoyable? Very much so, but if you want to win expect to play more like a rythm game rather then a button masher, it is very timing based to not screw up.This game is buggy but the bugs actually make the game feel more WWE because it adds to the stupid that is the WWE. But with that said if you want to get far in the my career your success will be very much based on what you level up and your move set, you can screw up a build making it very hard to win even on easier difficulties.All in all the game is much like some bad movies, its one of those its terrible which makes it great. Would I spend $50 on it? No, but you can always find a discount code at GMG or wait for a Steam sale and it is pretty enjoyable to play. I picked it up for $36 and am not disapointed, specially since 2K15 is still $50 as well.			"

												The game has crashed on me a handful of times. I got to a good point in the story and the game crashed and wiped my saves. It's a crashing mess. I had to reinstall it once already and I can't delete the corrupted file that is causing my game to crash as certain points. I'm not going to continue to play a game that wipes my saves everytime it crashes, which is rather often. This is a horribly optimized game.Well, after I couldn't get a refund, I decided to get back into the game and see if I could fix the issue. Hilariously enough, the game crashed again and wiped all my CAW's, so the corrupted CAW that was crashing my game was now wiped so the crashes stopped! I then decided to redo the MyCareer mode and almost came close to capturing the NXT title....only for my game to tell me the save file was corrupted after a recent match. For no reason whatsoever.♥♥♥♥ this game. DO NOT BUY IT. Until 2K learns to port their wrestling games to PC, I'd suggest not getting this game. It's a good waste of money.			"

												A good PC port, if lacking in graphics options such as model, object and environment detail, but is a much better improvement over the previous game. I'm not a wrestling fan, but even I love this game, with its vast customisation, game modes, character roster and sheer amount of replay value is incredible.Running at a locked 60 fps, WWE 2K16 sees the return of many favourite game modes, like create-an-arena, create-a-diva, match types, a whole new career mode and much more. The graphics seem better than WWE 2K15, especially with the character models and costume textures. Gameplay wise, I'm loving all the match types and going into the options menu to change rules, game hints, blood on/off and so forth. And speaking of, I also love the new mini-game-like QTEs that happen when actions like a pin, or grapple, occur. It adds a simple layer of 'fun' on-top of what is already a fun, meaty game. I love making my own movesets with my characters, making an entrance for them, and an arena for them to battle in. It's just incredibly fun and you'll be here for triple digit hours with it all!I haven't tried online, so this is an offline review. Having said that, a couple of things I want to see added in for the inevitable sequel is better audio design. What I mean is - I want to hear the occasional character scream or grunt as they pull off certain moves; giving it immersion by proportioning realism onto what is already a realistic game. Also minor, yet near-essential things like hearing footstep noises, climbing the ladder/cages, more variety in 'punch' sounds beyond the generic slap noise. And finally, better flowing commentary: it's quite jarring hearing the commentary suddenly cut-out to talk about something else I'm doing without finishing the previous sentence.Overall, as I said, I'm not a wrestling fan at all and I doubt this game will turn me to one, but I'm very much enjoying my time with this game. Perhaps a little more violence wouldn't hurt with enhanced persistent character damage, floors being scuffed and whatnot as per real wrestling. Having said that, this is a much better, improved, real letter to the fans that were left disappointed by the previous iteration or like me, just lost interest after so many features were dropped.Recommend to people who enjoy sports, brawlers, RPGs, simulators and action. Worth the £35 asking price? Definitely!			"

Now to the review, I want to say this game is far way better than wwe2k15 way more options and such more to do with new gamemodes and mycareer being way better and feels like you control your guy the way you want. Unlike wwe2k15 which was very limited and storylines were short and boring. More customizable stuff and create a diva is back. The gameplay is smoothed runs great on a AMD R9 380 my final verdict is a 9-10(list of pros and cons down below)Pros- Lots of create features 
- Many gamemodes to choose from
- Over 100 superstars to play and choose from
- Gameplay is smoothed as butter

												TL;DR Holy ♥♥♥♥ is this game a good surprise! Just picked it up at 2016's steam summersale, and I am hooked. Im really awful at fighting games and normally don't have any interest for them but this game is different being noob friendly (if ur a hardcore guy u can ramp up all the difficulty options). Buy this game if you want a fun sandbox fighting experience making matchups between the terminator and hitler.Now for the guys that want the full review:The big selection of superstars is amazing since the old timers like randy savage to john cena! You can even play as the terminator.The career mode is way better then people believe it to be. In my example I created Adolf Hitler, a Heel wrestler, who will gain all of the popularity of the WWE. The character creation is amazing (if you want you can look at my wwe hitler screenshots) and the entrance creator is too! Going around about 2 hours I finally chose Mr.Perfect's theme and mixed movements with Colin Cassady and Paul Wight (wierd mix IKR). And after that I spent one more hour making my choice of movements that I think Hitler would fight with. As you can see you have insane customization oppurtunities with these but also with the skills atributes and abilities of the character. You will have to manage points into upgrading your character being many upgrades important from stamina strength and speed. If you are lazy like me you can use a boost to rise some atributes to the max until your overall is 90 but if you like a challenge do not rise this as it will make the game faster and easier. Another plus about the career is that you will have many hours of playtime if you are a completionist like me.The showcase mode is also very interesting, specially if you are a WWE enthusiast. My favorite ""campaign"" is certanly the hall of fame one, as it goes around some of the best wrestlers and most interesting feuds like the rikishi vs the rock and randy savage vs jake the snake. The online is really fun but bewary, in singleplayer the bots play fair but in online I have had myself several times thrown out of the ring incapacitated before the count of 10 and then disqualified. Most of the online players want to WIN and not have a fun match. If you want a more fun multiplayer experience get a friend to play with you locally, if you have a xbox controller you can play one the controler and your friend can play in your keyboard!The community created items are also a really fun adition as they bring new content to your WWE experience, since new fun created characters like mario and luigi, to new logos and anything you can imagine. You can also create your own and upload them, and if you want to see yourself as a wrestling abomination you can upload a photo of you or anybody else to morph it into the face of a wrestler that you create.The universe mode isn't something I really enjoy but if you want a more extense sandbox experience then single matches or the career then by all means dive into this and enjoy it.Concluding my review I think that anyone that enjoys a good fighting game or is a WWE fan should buy this game. It is fun in almost everyway and most criticisms you see in the reviews are nitpicking because this game is a fairly well optimized game and there are almost no glitches or bugs. So what are you waiting for BUY IT.			"

												Looks good, plays ok. sort of un-responsive feeling at times.more than once i've pressed the finisher button only to have it do nothing, then the opponant will do a move [and yes this is whith the finisher available & in the right possition] It seems harder than ever to be sure what move you are about to do also. I've played every Smackdown / Raw / WWE game since smackdown 2 & this one is the biggest offender for that. In the career mode i chose 'he's not worth my time' after assaulting someone from behind...this turned me 'Face' somehow. So far, I rate this game 7/10. A good wrestling sim-game with issues but well worth grabbing on sale. i'll modify this as i play more.[Edit 1] 6 hours in this game has stalled / frozen three times. one of which loading the career save & one of them in the pause menu.

												Before I start this review i want to say that I am a big wrestling fan as my first wwe game was HCTP and been playing wrestling games sense. Now to the review, I want to say this game is far way better than wwe2k15 way more options and such more to do with new gamemodes and mycareer being way better and feels like you control your guy the way you want. Unlike wwe2k15 which was very limited and storylines were short and boring. More customizable stuff and create a diva is back. The gameplay is smoothed runs great on a AMD R9 380 my final verdict is a 9-10(list of pros and cons down below)Pros- Lots of create features 
- Many gamemodes to choose from
- Over 100 superstars to play and choose from
- Gameplay is smoothed as butter
- Great optimization 

Cons-Loading time takes around 3-4 minutes "

												I'm a bit mixed on this game. The biggest issues I run into are performance issues, although I have done a few tweaks to fix it about 75%. I spent a lot of time in Universe Mode as I found the Career Mode to be overly scripted, and that interviewer just looks SO creepy in this game.... like she belongs a figure in a horror house. The submission system is the biggest complaint from other players, and I do agree it is a bit unbalanced. It is easy to avoid a submission but nearly impossible to force one. Also I found that adjusting the AI settings from default made it a much more satisfying experience. I'd give this game 50/50 for being a solid, but underwhelming and shallow at times game... but due to the online creations, which really do help to enhance the experience if you like customizing your own fed.... That bumps it up to a 6/10, and I would recommend it if 2k17 wasn't being released on PC soon. If you got the money to throw away, go for it to hold you over.			"

												I only had the ability to play this game for half an hour, which is a real shame because I really enjoyed it. It seemd like a ton of fun, but in that thirty minute window the game crashed twice. Obviously I didn't have the time to really dig into the meat of the game, but I think it's definitely worth a shot. With patches this would be an A+ in my book from what I played, but it's risky. If you're at all into Wrestling, give it a shot, see if it works on your system. If not, return it and call it a day. Hopefully the developers will learn.			"

												First Impressions Review:I think WWE 2K16 is an improvement over WWE 2K15 but it still has a lot of issues.What's Better:1) Create-A-Diva: '15 left out Diva creation '16 brought it in. Nice to know that 2K stopped being sexist.2) In-match optimization better: I no longer have the stuttering and performance issues during the match as I did with '15.3) Story Mode: They added a LOT to story mode, including rivalries, allies, picking which championship you want to go for, who you want to invade, all sorts of stuff! It's still got a grind factor, but there's a lot more depth in '16 than there was in '15.4) Match depth: There's a little more in-depth match mechanics like the various grappling mechanics which involve a back-and-forth mini-game of who can find the ""sweet spot"" first. But the game doesn't really tell you how to set that up...What's The Same:1) Graphics: Virtually the same engine. The audience is slightly improved. Superstars and the scenery are pretty much the same. Maybe some minor improvements...2) Overall fighting mechanics: Same huge sets of moves that are hard to perfect and rememberWhat's Worse:1) Submission: The submission mechanic is horrible. The system works like this: The defender has a blue bar, the aggressor has a red bar. The aggressor wants to have their red bar inside the defender's blue bar to fill up the circle in the center. If the circle is filled, the defender taps out. If it becomes completely blue, then the defender kicks out. Sounds fair, right? WRONG! If the body part is undamaged or fully damaged there's no real adjustment to how the mechanic works. It's all skill-based. I can understand that the bars should initially be based off of the wrestler's skills. But as the match goes on, there should be an equalizer. If you damage a body part, the aggressor should have an equalizer to help them get the submission win. What's the point of damaging a body part if you can't even take advantage of it...2) AI Kick-Outs: The AI kicks out ALL THE F*CKING TIME! An opponent I was against had no health, no stamina, just got Finishered, but STILL KICKED OUT BEFORE 3! This wasn't even the first time I had done the Special/Finisher combo. How are you supposed to win a match when the AI just magically kicks out ALL DAY LONG???? Then when the AI pins you, I don't even get a chance to kick out on the 1st count, have a tiny little zone for the 2nd and 3rd counts... The imba is real...3) Match Rating: The match rating was an issue with '15 and it's even worse in '16. They provide you with a meter in the HUD so you can see how ""well"" you're doing. Unfortunately, if you do a move once, it can no longer give you points for ""variety."" This game punishes you for using a move twice... Seriously? It should at least be diminishing returns instead of ""you can use a move once, after that, too bad!"" I guess the game really wants you to focus on ALL of those moves you picked in the character creation screen...For the $25 I paid for it, it's worth it so far. I hope '17 can address some of the issues that '16 has and finally get rid of those nagging issues leftover. Seriously, get rid of the match rating or make it actually worth having as a mechanic. I could get 4 and 5 star matches on '15 and I can't get above 3.5 stars in '16.			"

												This is the best strategic wrestling game of all time thus far, as someone who has been around for a while and played them all that is my personal opinion.  For the first time there is a real tension and back and forth feel to online play just like the kind of tense moments you get in a Wrestle Mania main event in WWE PPV. I am going to give the game a recommendation and thumbs up because of the above thoughts about this game however there is a big con for me with the online experience.1 on 1 normals matchs is the only match type you're able to play online in this game unless you have a heap of friends with the game who want to play with you. I enjoy the normal matches very much but it should be so much better than this. As with all large corperate game companies nowdays, you make a great game but you have no clue how to make a compelling online exerience or more likely just do not care. The system for match making is one of the worst matchmaking systems in history.  Multiplayer has been carelessly tacked on at the end and to hell with your playerbase that enjoys online competition. I don't even see leaderboards this year which makes it a downgrade from 2k15 in that aspect.  I want to be able to get into a 1 on 1 Hell in a cell match at the very least and I want to be able to at least comunicate GG at the end of a great match without having to say it through a always turned on mic. Is that too much to ask from a modern wrestling game? I think not.Easy Fix imo - Remove all the unnessassry match options from the selection screen, which are false advertising since no one can find a match in any of them. Implement 4 options instead which will be 2 players - 4 players - 6 players.All the players get put into the same lobby and pick one of these three options. Once the players are all in we enter a vote for which match type it will me and bang .. done. We dont bother with caws online, we only care about fast effiecient matchmaking.You done ****ed it up			"

												I would definitely give this game a ""mediocre"" instead of just yes or no.  It has redeeming qualities.  But I bought the game because of the MyCareer mode, and it's not got even 1/10th of the story that WWE games did going as far back as twelve-thirteen years ago.  It's just run to the ring while someone's having a match, now I'm in a rivalry with them, now I fight them a few times, a couple times where they ambush me even though I'm the heel.  And then I win.MyCareer customization is all surface level, all appearance based and nothing to do with your character.  There's a pretty good amount of options, but it almost makes you feel like there could've been more.  You can sort of Frankenstein a personal entrance out of portions of the entrances of other superstars combined together, but it looks a bit odd if the transitions are off.  There's a lot more customization options which I won't be doing myself like uploading stuff to the game, so I can't talk about it really, but it seems rather robust.But customization ends at the appearance of your wrestler.  Obviously a WWE game won't cover the spectrum of possible character archetypes a person could make their wrestler, like anything from a fake police officer to a gorilla to a legitimate martial artist, but nonetheless, the personality they give you is so tame and boring that it's kind of pathetic.  You get 2-4 choices to answer questions, and only maybe 3 words to describe a sentence or two, so I would often choose an option and say something that I didn't want to.  It's a bad system, and reminds me of the problems with Fallout 4's dialog system.  That only occurs in post-match interviews, which are about the only amount of story after nearly 10 hours of play in career mode.  There's the ""Authority"" option which I've yet to unlock so hopefully that changes things, but it's a very long grind to get to what might end up being a disappointment anyway.The gameplay is....okay.  Not good, not bad.  It's fine.  It runs pretty well on my machine.  There's some kind of save game issue which I've not run into but I think has something to do with the amount of saved information you have.  The actual back and forth of wrestling feels much less smooth than I'd have liked, there's some instances when I don't know why I did a particular move vs. another, but in general it's okay.  There's some really bad systems, like the rock-paper-scissors grapple system that I can't really understand and only comes up maybe once every four matches.  There's the submission system which is insanely broken and gives PC a huge advantage.  There's the holds system which is a little too easy, shouldn't even exist because of it.Overall I'd say skip this one.  It's headed on a decent track, but it feels like it'll be three games before this series is where it should've been five years ago.  There's really good ideas and some awful execution.			"

												TL;DR --> From an objective point of view, it isn't that good and the pricetag really doesn't justify the content it offers, even if all the DLC is free on the PC version. That being said, if you want a more in-depth analysis, please keep reading.I've been a wrestling fan for around 10 years. I remember switching channels through my TV late in the night and finding a show that caught my interest: Smackdown! The main event that day was Bobby Lashley vs Batista vs Finlay and I won't forget that match easily.After that, I tried my first wrestling game by renting it from a local Blockbuster (does anyone stil remember those?). It was Smackdown vs Raw 2006 for the PS2. The controls felt a little bit clunky because it tried to be something it was not: a grappling simulator. However, I enjoyed every single moment I spent on that game just because I could recreate what I saw on the show and fight with my favourite wrestlers.Fast forward to 2016 and I'm still playing the same damn game with an updated roster and a graphic mod.The main problem with WWE 2K16 is exactly that, they've been doing almost the same game for 10 years. Sure, they've added more game modes, characters and other stuff. They have even improved the grappling and striking system to make it more fair when playing with friends (oh the times when you had infinite reversals and they were performed just by smashing a button).If you're a hardcore wrestling fan like me, you will probably enjoy this game, even if it has really strong weaknesses as a a PC port (fps drops, physics crashing, animations glitching...) and even if it adds nothing at all to previous WWE games but a wider roster that doesn't involve repeating the same superstar in different time periods (I'm looking at you WWE 13 and your 3-4 versions of Triple H).However, if you're looking for a fun sports/fighting game this probably isn't the correct choice for you.

												WWE 2K16 is amazing...ly bad. Every time I find something to like about this game there's something else that is just horrible. Basic gameplay is solid but submissions, chain grappling and the new pin system are all complete nonsense. It looks beautiful but runs like chunky crap for a lot of people. There are awesome custom downloads for characters, logos, title belts and arenas but you can only download 20 total per day and the servers are constantly having issues. It goes on and on. 2K simply have no idea how to keep themselves from screwing up wrestling games. They seem to think that they need to reinvent the wheel but at the same time have no idea what the wheel is. At best WWE 2K16 is a fun distraction but you are just as likely hate it 3 minutes later. I just can't recommend anyone pay money for this unless you are desperate for a WWE game to play.			"

												Very great and funny game but corrupted save files.. I would really like to play this again but my saves are broken every time after a short period.I have little hopes for a fix but maybe 2K is not a ♥♥♥♥ery this time.Don't buy this game, cannot recommend it at this moment.In advance, ♥♥♥♥ 2K nonetheless plus their NBA2K PC ports are also mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Shame on them.			"

												Haven't regularly played a wrestling game since Smackdown! 2 on the Playstation. Saw a good deal on WWE2k16, figured what the heck, I'll try it. There's a lot to like in the game, but matches can often go from fun to absolutely infuriating based on the dumbest things. I get that handicap matches are supposed to put the player at a disadvantage, but there should not be the *added* disadvantage of having the game ignore you when you're trying to target a specific opponent. For example, in the Showcase, there's a Stone Cold vs. Vince and Shane McMahon ladder match. I can't even count how many times I would turn Austin towards Shane and try to strike or grapple, only to have Austin magically spin around and flail in Vince's direction. The game's decision for when you can or can't target someone seems completely arbitrary.Similarly, attempting to grapple an opponent standing right in front of me works 90% of the time, but 10% of the time, inexplicably, my character just sits there doing nothing, allowing the opponent to recover, often costing me the match. This is inexcusable.On top of that is the counter system, which basically turns every match into a game of chicken to see who's going to blink first. If I have four counters, and my opponent has four counters, the first one to use a counter is at an *immediate* disadvantage for the remainder of the match. For example, let's say Austin vs. Rock, each with four counters. If I'm Austin and I counterattack to get out of a bad situation, Rock has 4, and I have 3. That means my BEST CASE SCENARIO is Rock counters (3,3), I counter (2,3), Rock counters (2,2), I counter (1,2), Rock counters, (1,1), I counter (0,1), Rock counters (0,0). We're now both empty, but because he got the last counter, he has absolute control of the match, and I can basically just put my controller down and walk away for a minute or two, because I can't do ANYTHING. Counters recharge over time, but as soon as I've regenerated one, he's regenerated one too, and he's still controlling the match, which means I HAVE to use mine first, but as soon as I do, he'll use his, and he's back in control again. There's actually some strategy into how this can work in a tag team match or triple threat (though those come with the targeting/nonsense mentioned above), but in a singles match, the counter system effectively punishes whoever uses it first. On top of all that, the game either has no real tutorial, or has hidden it well. The NXT career and Showcase modes offer some tips, but leave others out, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to what is and isn't taught. For example, the game teaches you the submission minigame, but never teaches you how to actually start a submission on an opponent. It teaches you the collar-and-elbow tie-up minigame, but never teaches you how to initiate a collar-and-elbow tie-up. Never tells you how to climb ladders or cages. Never tells you how to target another opponent.It's frustrating, because when the game isn't being super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying, it can actually be fun! But the moment your character randomly decides not to grapple when you're telling him to, or decides to target someone outside the ring instead of the opponent standing next to him in the ring, the fun instantly stops; all that's left is yelling at your monitor.

												Once you get past the fact that you've lost 3 Steam Friends since starting the game, and that the announcers seem to have the memories of Goldfish in terms of what they say, you'll discover that this is a really solid game. Especially coming from someone who has not played a WWE game since WWE '12 and not watched a second of it since 2008... I'm really enjoying the experience as somewhat of a nostalgic one, and for that reason, I very much recommend this game. I do, however have a few problems with it:- The Jukebox is annoying, with only a few songs on it (by default), that just repeat over and over again, this, however can be fixed by allowing the Jukebox to play Superstar's songs, but, again, as I only know about 1/3 of the roster, I still hear repeats very often, especially as the songs that play are not the full songs, they only run for the time it takes for a SuperStar to perform an entrance.- As mentioned previously, the announcers are repetative, and, frankly, frustrating to listen to for more than a few matches, however, due to the massive number of Superstars (~160), this is forgiveable, as voicing multiple lines for every Superstar takes up large amounts of time and space.- The post-match interviews are cool, however, the dialogue options given do not highlight exactly what is going to be said, there has been a few times where I've pressed an option with the intention of being a ""good guy"" but ending up basically smashing the interviewer's head with a chair.- The lack of ""CREATE A FINISHER"". As a person who used to do this in the Smackdown Vs. Raw era, it slightly angered me that I didn't have the ability to fully create my character exactly as I wanted.Concluding, this game has some problems, and some things that will definitely be worked on before the next installment, however, after playing it, I can happily say that I very much enjoy the experience of it, and will be tempted to buy 2k17.P.S. Just one more match.			"

												Wanted some good ole wrestling nostalgia. Not impressed by the game play overall.Creativeness of CAWS? 8/10. Graphics? 9/10.Time to mess with mechanics. Even when messing with game sliders, the AI has a rediculous reversals and timing. If the game doesn't want you to reverse something, it will always tell you ""TOO EARLY"". Doesn't matter how great you are at timing reversals. The AI needs a lot of work. I hope 2k17 has some improvements.Edit: 20+ hours into Career, I gave it more of shot. Got into a Rivalry with John Cena. You cannot land a finisher. Period. He reverses everything. Even if it's set to the easiest possible setting...YouCannotWinUnlessYouCheatNice busted game play. I'll never buy another wrestling game as long as i live so long as they keep making it.			"

												The last WWE game I played was Smackdown vs Raw 2010, so compared to the other 2K games I have no idea, but this game is nowhere near as good as SvR.That being said, 2K16 is actually pretty good in its own right. It has a huge cast of wrestlers (RIP Hogan), graphics and animations are good and fluid, commentary is actually much better than it previously was, and the gameplay is pretty fun and impactful although you will need some time to learn it. Customization is very poor and that's probably the worst part of the game. Lack of music for entrances and overall entrance motions, almost every hat is entrance only, and there is just a lack of good clothing options so I hope you like using the logo upload manager.In terms of the port it's acceptable. The entrances are all locked at 30fps and the game has serious audio and frame rate issues most notable during the after match replays and the 30-man Royal Rumble.Despite this, It is still a damn fun game to play and there is just so much other content to enjoy that makes it worth getting.

												I bought the game from Humble Bundle (It's currently cheap.) All of my play time has been me TRYING to get the game to run past the splash screen. It crashes every single time, I haven't installed any mods or even played a single match. I know my computer can handle the game as I pirated it before I bought it to see if it would play well. I've tried the fix everyone praises fixed their game, it worked one time and got me to the main menu, but I had to restart due to a scrolling issue; I haven't seen the menu since..... Here's my suggestion:If you really want to play the game, either buy it on console or pirate the game without the update, at least it will work that way...EDIT: The issue was with the WIndows 10 Anniversary Update, so after a clean install of Windows 10 and a re-update to the Anniversary Update the game now launches, but will not go fullscreen without a Borderless Window app. It plays well, but I feel highly inconvinienced (I know W10 isn't officially supported, but it's still bothersome when compatibility doesn't work). So if you have Windows 10 build 1607, pass on this.I brought the issue to 2K support, so hopefully it doesn't happen with 2K17.			"

												I enjoy the game mainly for the creative modes, but the gameplay can be very irritating. I've never seen a game dominated by a single stat/mechanic such as this one. The reversal system is frustrating. While fun to watch on screen, having fewer max reversals than your opponnent immediately put you at a large disadvantage, which makes the MyCareer mode that much more difficult. When you're out of reversals, you're basically helpless to defend against the opponent. It's a basic system of wrestling, so of course reversals need to be in the game, but it feels like the game is dominated by the system so much that you might as well just put your controller down until your reversal bar fills.

												WCW/NWO Revenge for the N64 is what I want in a wrestling game, this is not that type of game. I wouldn't even classify this as a game, more like a very slow, drawn out rhyhthm game. I have yet to even come close to winning a match. Here's how a typical match for me goes. Throw a punch, throw a move or two, get reversed. CPU on offense now, try to reverse, too fast, wait for CPU to finish move, try to reverse, too slow, wait for move to finish, try to reverse, too fast, wait for move to finish, try to reverse, too slow.......and so on until it comes to the submissions, oh lord the submissions are terrible. Rotate the thumbsticks to avoid your opponent, sounds easy enough. Get put in a submission, move up, it's not moving up, try to go left, WTF it went right, get submitted..you lose. The game does look good though and I like where after the match I get interviewed by Rene Young, though I'm not sure how serious I am taken when I'm 0-20 and talking about being the greatest living legend in WWE.

												Well, we all love wrestling and we all want to be wrestlers ourselves, right? With this game you get a chance to be a wrestler yourself. But honestly, if real wrestling is just half as exhausting and frustrating than this game I don't want to be a wrestler.TL/DR at the end. ;)The game is really nice with all it's possibilities to create a unique superstar and the career mode. What killed the game for me was only the bad coding.The loading times are way too long, it feels like you have to wait forever before the editor/match/whatever has laoded.I could live with that if the ingame-perormance was okay. Well, it isn't. I don't have a high-end gaming machine but it's decent enough for most games (specs on the end of this review). The problem is that the FPS drop massively during the entrance (in the entrance-editor too) as well as when more than 2 wrestlers are in the ring. I've set anything in the graphics options as low as possible except the resolution but the framerate didn't increase much.Besides this issues the game is actually very fun to play. You have a lot of possibilities to customize your superstar as well as you may customize already existing superstars. The graphics look nice (not really up to date but still fine).The gameplay itself is more complex than I first expected but really easy to learn (yet quite difficult to master IMO). Summary:I really wanted to like this game but I just can't. The technical issues just outweigh the rest of the game. I bought the game when it was on sale for about 13€.I would recommend this game to you if you were a huge wrestling fan and if this game was on sale. For the regular price, I definately would not recommend to buy this game.System-Specs:CPU: AMD PhenomII 1055T (6x 2.8GHz)RAM: 8Gb DDR3 @ 1333MHzSSD: OCZ Agility3 128GbGPU: EVGA Nvidia GTX 560tiOS:  Win 10 Pro 64bit			"

												This is probobly the best wrestling game you can get on a pc.Lots of fun features and customisation.You can interupt your openents entrance,i like that there are no loading screens between entrances and the start of the match.MyCareer mode is fun in the begining but after a while it becomes realy dull and repetitive.Anouncers are quite buged aswell, sometimes they repeat the same line twice or the call a reversal when a wrestler didnt reverse,a few times anouncers even called a male wrestler ""she"".The customisation is also not too bad.You can change practicly everything, but that is also the downside of this game.I've spent some time making a few arenas, custom championships and i edited a few superstars to create my own show in a universe mode.It worked fine for some time.But recently for no reason at all the game just started crashing after almost every match.I have also expierienced quite a few crashes during wrestlers entrances.Sometimes the game even crashed while performing an OMG moment on the anuncer's table.It just seems that the game can't handle all the customisation it lets you do.Overall it's not a bad game but all the crashes and model glitches that i encountered makes me say that i dont recomend this game if you like customisation since it will just make you feel frustrated after having to edit things because the game could not handle a wrestler or arena etc.			"

												I bought WWE 2K16 hoping to be take advantage of the excellent community creations feature so I could make my own custom rosters and shows in the WWE Universe mode. However, there is an issue with the game where all community creation downloads are corrupt once you have too many custom creation files associated with your save. Many users have also reported bugs that completely corrupt game saves, meaning they have had to delete hundreds of hours of progress. Aside from these issues, the general performance of the game is unimpressive. Yuke's PC ports of WWE 2K15/16 have been subpar and have not been adequately supported with patches. It is extremely unlikely that I will buy another WWE game for PC, having been ripped off for two consecutive releases. If you want a WWE game and own a PS4 or Xbox One, buy it for that platform instead.			"

This is my first wrestling game since 2002.It was on sale for 75% off so i thought why not.I had looked at all the negative reviews,but seeing as i just wanted abit of fun like the old days i decided it would be ok.WRONG!The controls are atrocious,back on the old games in the 1990s to early 2000s the controls seemed more action oriented.More fluid, The amount of fun me and a friend used to have playing TLC matches was staggering.Constant on your seat intense jumping around excitement. Technology is the culprit here, now they can do more advanced motion capture,they try to make it as real as possible,and that's where i see the problem.For me it needs to be more fluid, more action oriented. With this game it seems like your a walking pile of concrete, so slow. everything is so slow.Slow to move,slow to get up,slow to climb.That's just not fun.Seeing as ive not played one of these games for 14 years i have no idea when this started to happen but these games used to be alot of fun to play.The grappling system is one of the stupidest things ive seen in a game,completely doesn't work,reversals don't seem to work either,either your too fast or too slow.They don't give you enough time to time it right,same goes with being pinned and submissions.  Im old school, track and field old school, button bashing is the way to go when trying to get out of a hold.The graphics are also not as good as they could be.I love realism,but a game like this can only add realism if it can keep things fluid and exciting. They are unable to do that which results in slow and monotonous gameplay. Overall id say if your a hardcore fan and you like things to be slow and have more realism sacrificing action and silly gameplay then you will probably enjoy it.But for me and anyone wanting what i wanted don't buy this even if its 99% off. I spent 12 hours downloading this, Wasting time i could of used downloading my other games and taking up 40 gig. Im going to try and play abit more but i doubt it will stay on my drive for long. "

												I can't speak for the campaign or anything because who actually buys these games for playing as the actual wrestlers? The true greatness of this game lies within the ability to create your own wrestlers and have them fight each other. I mean, it what other game can you make a super ripped version of yourself, then dress him up as a dictator, and have him ride in on a motor-cycle to the ring for his fight against DIO and The World from Jojo. 10/10 instantly.Go buy this game, the time is now!

												I had heaps of fun playing this game on Xbox One... well, until the DLC updates completely ♥♥♥♥ed my Universe Mode up time and time again. Then it continuously froze only on the Universe Mode screen. So I thought I'd re-purchase it on PC instead to do some modding for it, but despite having better than the recommended settings for this game, it still runs quite poorly. Even while not in full screen and the audience density or texture turned down, the game consitently provides a B performance rating. I get lag spikes throughout matches, but the worst part for lag is during the entrances. No matter how low I turn the graphics or how small the window is, the superstar entrances are slow and laggy, especially when stuff like pyro is used. This pretty much ruins the main thing I'm modding in the game.I'm just hoping I don't get the data corruption that most people (modders in particular) seem to be getting with this.I'll continue playing, but I'm not happy with this.

												If you think the fact that 2k makes us PC owners wait 6 months after everyone else gets the game is bad enough you havent seen nothing yet.Normally this is where someone would list the negatives or positives for the game. For this review you only need to know two things.1-If you plan on downloading ANYTHING expect the game at some point to randomly erase all your hard work and enjoy starting all over.2-At some point the game will literally just decide not to work anymore and no amount of reinstalls/reboots/exorcisms will fix it. The game WILL NEVER WORK AGAINOne would think they would throw out some fixes for this, well they haven't and they won't and why should they?In the end we will continue plunking down our hard earned cash to a game that always arrives late without a reason ever given and will be plagued with bugs and those bugs will never ever be addressed.

												I'm not going to lie, I enjoy this game, but there's negatives about it...Pros:-No frameskipping when below 60FPS.-Custom Divas.-Fatique is realistic.-All DLCs included.-Local Co-ops.Cons:-I press RT on exact time to reverse, the announcer says ""Nice reversal"" but the character doesn't reverse.-Reversals can be pain in the ♥♥♥.-No create a finisher.-Hardly any patches.-Sometimes the player/character looks like he's/she's growling at the other character when attempting to pick them up.-Sometimes wrong moves get inputted. -Controls aren't good, I still prefer 2011 controls over '12 and above.-Camera effects can really decrease FPS heavily.-Xbox One has constant 60FPS whereas my GTX 750 Ti OCed only achieved 45fps minimum.This game would've been nice if more work was put into it but sadly it seems like there's only one patch. I still play this game only for entertainment purposes but when it comes to reversals, ALT + F4 comes in handy. Other than that, it's not recommended, I hope to see this game removed from steam store since it's like MKX (In terms of abandonded game).Overall score: 2/10			"

												At nearly 50GB of full on half naked men, this is the most amount of male skin textures I've ever got.  Hall of Fame mode was pretty fun and am enjoying the Stone Cold showcase.  There is some strange bleeping out of words etc. and blood is off by default.  Online also still seems to work well for a match online with friends.  Some fun glitches, pretty decent deliberate wrestling - a lot of characters feel different so you get slightly differently styled fights - it's a lot faster than 2K15 too.  Look forward to 2K17 in about a year when it's cheap.			"

												I haven't come across any bugs yet and it's been working just fine with my PS4 Controller.What I can say though is that I don't like the loading times when wanting to switch hair and clothing options, it should just be an instant click instead of click and wait a few seconds to load, that and there isn't a preview option. Instead of being able to preview whatever you're trying to put on your CAW it'll just send you to the next set of options instead. Creating a CAW takes x4 times as long then it used to like on the older SVR games where everything was instantaneous and had preview options.Don't really like the 'reversal slots', I know it's an attempt at trying to counter players being able to infinitly counter reversals like in previous titles, but I don't think it was the best choice, it's pretty much a stamina system for reversals.As with all the other WWE 2K titles much like the SVR games before them, there really isn't an actual tutorial though at this point if you've played previous WWE games, then you won't really need the tutorial other than to learn some new features.This game is pretty loaded with content and I bought it during the weekend sale for just $12 so I know I'll be getting my money's worth. But at the same time, this game does indeed feel much more complete than WWE 2K14. Though it's missing some older themes like Cenas Thugamonics theme as well as his Thuganomics gimmick in general. No Eddie Guerrero either unless he was part of a preorder bonus for the game or something, but either way it's disappointing that he isn't in the game.			"

												I used to play wrestling games on the N64 and I haven't liked any of the newer ones I had tried, but I heard 2k16 was supposed to go back to the roots and try to make a better experience.  I personally didn't have any good experiences with it. First, when it is in full screen I still have a bar visible on the top and one side of the screen, it is annoying, but not a big deal.  For me the worst part of the game is the wrestling. It feels like the entire combat is based on reversals. The reversal system requires you to press a button at exactly the right time to reverse the move. It sounds ok, but by the time the indicator shows up to press the button it is too late if you try to anticipate it coming up it will say you pressed it too early.  This makes it very hard to successfully get a reversal and can mean you spend the entire fight trying to get a reversal or lose. My first match I only got one or two hits in the entire fight. Which, leads me to another issue there is no tutorial or training mode. Well, there is a tutorial, but you need to use a create a wrestler to do it, and there is no way (that I know of) to go through it again other than creating another new campaign. While you can make your own matches to practice with there is no dedicated training room like other fighting games have.  The pinning system is also very annoying. A wheel will pop up and start filling up you have to press a button to stop it while it is in a specific zone to kick out it sounds easy, but it goes so fast it is very hard. Now I've read a lot about the reversal and pinning issues online and most people seem to think you just need to keep playing to get used to the timing, well I didn't get to that point when I had a (for me) game breaking bug. I made a create a hero started doing the campaign and very shortly after I had an issue where it failed to save or let me load a save.  I tried every suggestion I found online except completely reinstalling (because if it happened once whats to stop it from happening again?) with no luck.  While looking online I saw someone lost a save with over a hundred hours on it. Fortunately, I only lost about an hour or so, but if this is happening to other people and with far more time invested than me, why should I or anyone else put time into it when we could lose it all to a bug that there is no known way to fix or prevent? Even if I could get adjusted to the reversal and pin system I cannot recommend a game that can randomly corrupt a save that people have put hours into.			"

												This game has improved leaps & bounds over WWE 2K15. However it is not without it's flaws.Pros: Improved graphics, but still not the best.Better creation suite.A ton of wrestlers.all the DLC included.Hall of Fame Showcase.Cons:Steve Autisn Showcase. Don't get me wrong it's decent, but way too many QTE's, and some objectives are very hard causing frustration, and that's on the normal setting. Not to mention didn't we just have something similar a few years back with WWE 2K13? It's time to add some new flavor don't you think? Plus due to licensing issues some stuff is cut such as the enforcer at WM 14 is known only as the ""Enforcer"", and not Mike Tyson, and the model dosn't even look like him. Add to that there is no DX music when Shawn Michaels comes out during the same match.Adding your face to create a wrestler is a bit tricky.The soundtrack, whle improved still is pretty bad.Some of the graphics, yes I placed the graphics as a pro, bu they are also a con because while overall they have improved, some models look nothing like the real wrestlers, or look like puffed up marshmellow men.All things considered it's still a rather enjoyable, and fun game. Certainly worth it to purchase.			"

												I've had a bittersweet experience with this game. I first bought it directly from steam, and despite having a more than optimal hardware configuration for playing it, an error would appear every time I tried to launch the game. After trying all possible methods, I got annoyed, uninstalled it, and asked for a refund.After almost a year, I happened to win a key for the game in a giveaway. I decided to give it a try once again, only to find the exact same error whenever I tried to launch the game. This time I decided to read the threads in the game's dicussion forum, almost one by one, until I found a solution I've not tried before (apparently it was a new solution). To my own surprise, IT WORKED! And so, I was finally able to play the game to my heart's content.I'm really happy with this game! Sometimes the FPS drop drastically while loading some of the entrances, but besides that it works like a charm. Sure, it may take an entire minute to load at first, but it's worth it. IF the developers had not abandoned this release in order to work on the newest version, things would've been different, and users wouldn't be rating the game as badly as they're doing now. Nonetheless, if you manage to ""skip"" the errors it throws at you while launching the game (the ALT+tab during Steven Austin's splash screen saves lives), you'll find it's an enjoyable experience. It has really good graphics, nice animations, a challenging AI, and an impressive roster!So, I give this game a thumbs-up.			"

The new reversal, submission and working hold systems combined with the fantastic graphics  (never had any issues with framerate by the way, and I ""only"" have a gtx 660)  and better physics means that 2k16 is an incredibly fresh game to play.

												When I heard 2k was taking over the series, I was excitied. But they've made the gameplay extremely plodding and boring. Everything is so slow. Wrestling games weren't really meant to be a sim. I prefer the play style of the 13 and 14 installments over the more recent versions. The experiment didn't work 2k. It's time to get back to making fun wrestling games instead of these dull, wooden snore fests.			"

												If you actually enjoy wrestling games, then maybe you'd like this.But if you watched Jermania on Youtube, don't buy this game. For absolutely no reason whatsoever, in this version of the game and the 2017 version you can't use regular clothing in matches. So no wacky characters, no funny nonsense. No. This is a SERIOUS game for SERIOUS Wrestling fans. Wrestling's fake as ♥♥♥♥ anyways, so I don't see why they would make it even less entertaining with this ♥♥♥♥. Get the 2015 version, when it's seriously on sale, because these games are discgustingly overpriced.			"

I even own' the PS4 version and it's no better than the PC port only reason I bought this was just mod it and pla}|?y as the NPCs that should have been playable to begin with.The reversal system is just garbage sometimes it will say you reversed it when you didn't or it will not when you did reverse. Trying to irish whip someone back into the ring feels like a choir because most times it will always wanna aim at an angle and just smack them againts the apron.2k Showcase mode is mostly reused content from WWE'13 and Legends of wrestlemania matches for stone cold so not and the My career mode just no fun at all.....Lets talk about how garbage the AI is... I'm getting pinned in a tag team match after a finish and hal the time the AI just sits there and doesn't do anything to help costing the match so it's basically a 2 on 1. With how crappy the reversal system is you will be missing all the time while AI is constantly reversing nothing wrong with a challenge but when it completely favors the AI on normal difficulty then you've messed up....What's with all the removed stuff from CAW mode hardly anything to work with anymore can't even make a backwards hat anymore everything is so limited you be better of playing WWF WARZONE on psx. I haven't fully enjoyed a WWE game since Smackdown vs RAW 2007.....Don't buy this if you're expecting a playable game only buy it for the mods nothing else there is nothing redeemable about this game besides the mods			"

												It's a broken piece of ♥♥♥♥, that's all you need to knowThe menu is a mess, controller integration is a joke, the game won't even let me play against an AI opponent, it just makes me fight against me so all the moves from both fighters happen at the same time. Playing with a controller makes the menu go ♥♥♥♥ing crazy and glitch out.Absolute joke of a game.			"

												EDITED: The controls are still pretty bad. Took a while to get ""used"" to them. Much of the time it feels like you are not in control at all. The submission wheel thing is just horrible. I really wish they had an option to change it. The CPU is a bit unfair. But I suppose that makes the game more challenging.the CAW is alright. You can make all kinds of things, but the body types are pretty bog standard. I would only recommend if you buy it on sale.			"

												I love wwe, and I love playing wwe games. HOWEVER, this game is riddled with bad programming and a complete lack of upkeep in terms of patching and fixing said bugs. It is BAD. They know about the issues and do nothing, while already trying to sell us 2k17. Game will shut down in career mode, refuse to upload items. Those are the more irritating bugs to me. I like career mode a lot before that crap. I really wanted to upload my face and make myself. Nope. That wont work either. I am an IT professional. This stuff is not fixable through settings, etc. This game...I am done buying wwe products until they prove themselves again. Absolutely Horrible.			"

												What can I say about the game other than it's a disappointment? Before I downloaded the game and spent the $50, I double checked to make sure my system was able to run it. It was. I like that there's a variety of superstars and a variety of different match types and I personally don't mind that you have to unlock things because after all game wouldn't be fun if you didn't have things to earn. The problem is I can't play any of the matches as this thing crashes more than a driver playing GTA. I was able to create a superstar but the minute I go to edit? Crash. The minute I try anything other than character creation? Crash. And I'm a female so I expected that you can't really do much of anything but go for the Diva's championship but seriously, I felt so left out about the story mode (which I couldn't do anyway because it kept crashing).I hadn't played any WWE games since the Playstation 1 and I was really looking forward to it. Honestly? Not worth the $50			"

												First game I've played in this series since 2008. It is hands down the worst game i've ever bought and this game has convinced me to never play another wresting game again. And I've given this game multiple chances, thinking maybe I just need to get the hang of it. But no. You can attempt to polish excrament but all your going to get is a soiled towel. The submission system is stupid and unresponsive. I've lost a game 30 seconds into the match because the cat and mouse system of you moving your right analog away from theirs is horrible. Try tapping out to a basic submission move with full health 30 seconds into the match. The pin system is horrible, even with a yellow chest if you get pinned you can still miss the kick out chance. No custom music, no changable controls. The story mode is boring, let this superstar run out on you. Go run out on that superstar, face said superstar 4 times before the PPV inwhich you guessed it, you face them again. This is 2016. Please learn how to make a decent game. "

												Most likely the worst WWE game so far. This game tried to get too techinical with it, and ended up actually making it LESS fun to play, with things like telling you to press F to counter, and when you press it tells you ""Too Fast!"" or ""Too Slow!"" when you try to forget your reaction time and postpone hitting it for a second, and an odd kick out move. I have never been able to tag in a partner while playing, because while near them, instead of tagging my character will climb the ropes. Defintely regretting this purchase.			"

												WWE 2K16 is pretty much the same as the previous WWE game with just different and more charakter and some few more gamemodes. The controlls are the same hard ones as before. nothing really new. Honestly it feels like the development isn't trying to create a good game, they litterly copied and pasted in as the previous games and named it different. The controlls are crap, the combat is mostly bad not really fluid what so ever. And it is hard to hold up with combos. Those who start with this game will have a hard time figuring out how to play consider there is no tutorials, atleast not what I have seen.Really not worth the money to be honest unless you truly are a fan of WWE. To be honest wait for WWE 2K17. Hopefully they have more fluid fighting system			"

												My review is based on MyCareer. I don't play the other modes:1) A lot more customization than last year. 2) The submission system somehow got worse than last year. 3) Easy mode is fighting ragdolls who forgot they have arms. 4) Normal mode is highly over-turned as far as reversals go. 5) The mini-pin game works well, if you are the PC. 6) The same constant interview with the creepy lady over and over and over. 7) The Authority seems like piece mail, and thier directives only make sense about 15% of the time whether you roll with them or against them. 8) The lack of interesting matches you get to participate in. 9) The same constant run in to start rivalries over and over. Overall, it's way better than last year, but that doesn't say a great deal. The developers are simply very lazy and anything resembling stories is non-existent. However, WWE 2K16 would be impressive if PS3 was still on top of the market.  I've bought this the last two years hoping for a decent my career mod as I grew up watching wrestling that doesn't exist anymore: Mid-South, NWA on TBS, AWA, etc.  While 2K16 is better, it's like claiming that eating a mud sandwich tastes better than dirt. Yeah, it's a little more complex, but it's still malnourising.In short, I'd hold off on buying this one because of the WWE Universe save corrupt issue and MyCareer is a repetitive, grindfest with the same runs-ins and interview, not interviews, over and over.

												A lot better than some of their previous ones. However, it still belongs in a pile of garbage. The moves have no clear indicators to when they are gonna happen so you can't properly reverse them. I'm not talking about moves just being hard to reverse, I'm saying that the characters just teleport to certain spots when they do a move and the reversal indicator is never properly timed. The submission system can either work or just spaz out sometimes. The game has very little in the way of proper introduction to some of the newer mechanics if you haven't played any recent WWE 2k games and that can really affect a match. In MyCareer mode you constantly get asked questions by a monster(mouth and eyes like to freak out) and the answers are very bland. The character creator is once again a couple steps forward and then a couple back. It takes forever for certain parts to load and sometimes they don't load until you have completely set them up. The game can still be fun if your a WWE fan, but I can't recommend it as a game. 2K has had so many chances to make a good WWE game, but it's just dissapointing that this one isn't as good as it should be. As I mentioned though, the game can still be fun if your a fan of WWE.			"

To start:5820k @ stock16GB ddr4390x @ stock3x ssd raid 0 & samsung 950 nvme (tried installing on both)I first tried to load this up using my steam link. I thought ""oh the feed is really choppy"", which is weird as everything is wired. I shut the link down, and came upstairs to play. My fears were realized when I re-launched the game and the stutter remained. The game has a stutter that makes it completley unplayable. Every 1 second, the game locks for 1/2 sec. In the splash screen, in menu's, In benchmarks, in quick matches. 0I've checked the pc usage whilst running the benchmark.Cpu stays at a solid 15% usage. Memory @ 25%, vram at 30%. Gpu doesn't know what it wants to do. Shooting between 0-100%, but not in time with the stutters. I've got the latest crimson drivers, have tried all the .ini 'fixes', have tried changing literally every single graphics option, and it still chokes. I've reinstalled twice, to seperate drives 'just incase....'. Literally the only game I have ever played on this rig with this issue.A good pc port is one that gives a console like ""launch and play"" experience. This is not one of those ports. Thank god I got it in a humble bundle. Was thinking about buying the cd key solo, glad I didn't bother.If your thinking of buying this, I can only say this is my experience. I hope yours is better.

												I'm going to give the game a 4.5/10The graphics are pretty and there are elements of the gameplay that are fun however the gameplay feels very much simulator as opposed to arcade, which does have it's benefits however it makes the entire game slow, also doing the same move 5 mins later marks you down for points which is stupid. The create a character season seems really really dry, there is the option to have an enemy and a friend and that's about it, after a match you get asked a question by a blonde chick whos mouth is slighty too wide? You can then respond in 4 different ways and the characters voice sounds like it was done by a person imitating the generic male voice on Family Guy. It's worse voice acting than the original Resident Evil. I'm almost certain they done it on purpose as a poor joke that's totally failed to land.I miss the days of WWF Westlemaina 2000 / No Mercy / ps1/ps2 Smackdown games. These games by comparison were a lot more fun, they felt like they had a lot more to do in the career mode with so many alternating storylines and random events, the combat although straight up arcade was great fun.I guess this games saving grace (if you coudl call it that) is the ability to replay old matches or events throughout WWF history, I think they've been doing this for quite sometime now anyway so this isn't exactly new.When you're designing your charcter be sure to press X (on xbox360 controller) so you can preview items on a dummy charcter. Absolutely no idea why you can't preview them on your actual character as they're alreaded loaded on the screen. I assume this was a mistake as it makes no sense. Overall it's just ok, if you're lookin for a fun game then this isn't it. It's very dry and the combat relies on stamina management, stone scissors paper and other weak minigames to make it seem different, all you get is a slowed down game with a lot of the story stripped back.Once again the voice acting on the male create a character is absolutely shocking and whoever got paid to do it should spend that money on voice acting lessons.

												To be honest I haven't played the game much since I have been busy with other things. I will tell you that this game is definately a big improvment over WWE2K15.Mycareer has been improved way better and showcase mode is pretty good.The gameplay is way better than WWE2K15. The matches feel realistic like how it would look in a WWE programming.So 2K I see that you have improved alot since you took over back in 2013.Anyways I hope you add more match modes like parking a lot, 3 stages of hell and a match creator.Mods are working perfect without zero lags.I haven't liked a WWE game this much since WWF No Mercy, Smackdown 2!, Smackdown Shut your mouth!, Smackdown Here comes the pain and WWE Smackdown vs Raw.The only cons this game has is it's lacking story mode creator otherwise a great game and I recommend every Wrestling fan of Wrestling in general.All around I give WWE2K16 8/10 i'm quite happy with this game.

Thumbs down for that lazy stupid idiot of a developer.Seems like that savegame corruption bug still exists. The first time i encoutered that bug was in WWE 2k13 and 2k still doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about this problem. Lost my save files after 112 hours this time. Means I wasted 112 hours of my life again this year which I spend creating superstars, shows, arenas, title belts and playing MyCarreer mode. The game itself is great, the best WWE game so far in my opinion. Everyone who claims the WWE SvR (Smackdown Vs Raw) games are better says it because of nostalgia reasons. But the problem is that it's not reliable. 2k also promised to update the content on a regular basis. Well, I haven't seen any update for this game at all, no bug fixes, nothing. That's why I can't recommend this game for the full price even if it's one of my favorite games. After 145 hours, the game somehow is complete trash by now. I uploaded a backup of two of my CAWs and every time the save files get corrupted i just download them again. I also made 12 custom logos for my own show's PPVs. But every time I try to download them or something else from the community creations, all other logos, CAWs etc are getting erased. Makes the game unplayable for me. The game doesn't even inform me now the the save files are corrupted...Fix the mentioned bug(s) already you stupid idiot morons. In reality, guys like me who buy these games every single year hoping this bug will ever be fixed are the only stupid idiots. Try to resist guys and don't buy it next year.			"

												I wanted to give a negative review, I really wanted to, but the only thing that kept me holding off is the content and the price. The career mode has taken a leap from 2k15, However, it still needs a lot of work. The career mode is repetitive and the game just loses its track. Events happen once in a blue moon, you cannot even start a career match without someone running in your match, the rivalry that follows that is very repetitive. The roster is a huge YES! However, please consider that if you are a fan of WWE games for their Career mode like me, please look elsewhere, the career mode is one boring ride but the only good content other than Showcase!

												TL;DR: My save corrupted with no reason behind it, and the game is a general buggy mess. Purchase at your own cost!I really want to like this game, but in my 5 hours of play its become apparent that I don't want to continue this game.I downloaded it last night, spent an hour or so creating a wrestler, did a match, and then went to sleep.  I wake up, all ready to get into the career mode... and then learnt about how buggy the game is. I found the for some reason, every time I launch the game the ring appears completly pitch black, making it difficult to fight since the ropes are also black. There is a fix, but you have to do it every time you launch.  So I figured I could live with it, and kept going. I finished the tutorial, took a break, reopened the game.... and my save file suddenly corrupted for no concievable reason! I have had saves corrupt before, and they can be pretty depressing, but having read how common these corruptions are, I really don't want to have to face any more!Buy this game if you want a WWE game on PC, but any game that corrupts the save that quickly is a big no for me!

												The game is great. Improvement from WWE 2k15, better optimization, better mechanics, career mode and 2k mode has improved. Once I played the game for a few hours, I wanted to play the Online, as expected, the game is pretty dead. Playing WWE games online were great fun, teaming up with a buddy and doing a tag team match against some other randoms, you would never know what to expect, how the match would turn out. If you do come across players, they are from a different country (US), as I live in Europe, this causes a lot of lag delay, It would be nice if we didn't share the same servers, but would the game be completely dead then? Anyways I have made a group to hopefully grab some Europeans/UK fans attention, Hopefully we can build up this group with a decent amount of players. You're able to plan a match in the group and hopefully enjoy the multiplayer without lag or delay.  Group -> http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WWE2k16EUOverall rating 8/10  "

												The game is great on PS4.  However i also purchased on PC off of steam.  The save file isnt working for Universe mode.  I contacted 2k forums and they were not helpful as they pointed me to read the forums?  REALLY?  Nice customer service.  I tried a full uninstall and re install.  Universe still isnt saving.   I dont know if they will patch this or if I am just out $50 bucks.  I also tweeted WWE stating to have YUKE and 2k fix this issue.  It doesnt appear to happen to everyone and Im sure it is something minor but i have literally tried over 10 different things on the forums and nothing has worked.  Do not get this on PC in my opinion.  I am hoping a patch comes out to fix it and if it does I will definatley update my review.  Until than 1/10 as I only play Universe mode and know other modes.

												I haven't played any WWE game since SvR 2011 for PS2, and decided to give it a try for this one. Not bad game, huge roster, but I wish that there were more iconic superstars from Attitude or Ruthless Aggression era. Too bad that you can't turn off DQ mode, or that there is no more one on two/three handicap match, now it has one on tag/trio. Customization option are really improved. Still my two favourite wrestling games are Smackdown! for PS1 and Smackdown: Shut your Mouth for PS2.			"

												This is a very nice game and has beautiful graphics and feels great.  It is nice just to watch a computer match of some of the superstars I made or downloaded, which is probably all I will be doing for now, the campaign or whatever its called doesn't seem very good, but I don't think it has to be.  A few things I don't like about the game are the controls and the way the logos and downloads work.  Controls are good enough for PC but they are very hard to get used to at first.  I just haven't played enough to get down the basic controls.  The custimizable logos are a pain to get into game becuase you have to go through a long process to get them to show up, almost like this game was meant for a console (Thats a joke, I know it was on console first).  but after they do finally show, then you have to download them, which is frustrating because you only get 20 downloads per day, wtf.  I never heard of a game restricting the amount of custom content and characters that can be downloaded.  Maybe that is in a lot of games, I don't know though.  The only other complaint I could give is that it feels way to much like a console port, which it is, but I would like to see mouse control instead of strictly keyboard controls in the game.  Actually, I don't think you even ever use your mouse at all, but hey, I could be wrong.  A little clunky with the port, but still controlable.  The graphics are impressive and the custimizability is great (besides the downloadable stuff), and also I love how it comes with all DLC!  This game is great to get into WWE and would recommend to anyone.  Also it was on sale very cheap, 14.99 I believe so great game and price.  8/10 "

												First of all let me start by saying that they have definitely made improvements from 2K15, You can feel that in the overall gameplay, You can see that in the added improvement to animations, reversals and general flow to the game.HOWEVER I have read that there has been a fair amount of criticism levelled at this game since its release, and unfortunately I find it all to be fairly well accurate.- first and foremost nine times out of 10 the game doesn't load past the Austin screen without fiddling around Ctl, Alt, Dlt, however that will be easily fixed come bug release time.And then there's the little nitpicking, The games FPS could be better, I'm playing on a GTX 980Ti and sometimes during entrances the frame rate drops dramatically, so that's definitely the game not me.And then we get to the criticisms levelled towards the game's highly anticipated 'my career mode'- The post match interview questions are far too vague, oh and it's a constant cycle of three, Yes, The creators of this game only put in a cycle of three different interview questions you can be asked...Evan NBA 2K got it better.And then there is the My career wrestlers voice, what happens if you are someone with dark skin?You're forced to have the most whitest sounding voice and it can't be changed.Yes they made a lot of improvements, and yes I probably would recommend it to a friend, but this game is still far from perfect, and there are quite a lot of bugs that need fixing.6/10 IGN			"

												Horrible balancing and difficulty in career mode - no way to play it on a casual basis no matter which options are set. May be all right if played regularly but not for some fun in between. To go some more on detail: Submissions are nearly not playable, KI constantly reversing your moves, pinning only possible after dozens of finishing moves and KI regenerating extremely fast - they can be completely crashed, stand up and kill you the next moment.Already played WWE2k13 and 2k14, those are much better in this regard.

												7/10 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟In my opinion, despite negitive reviews this game is pretty good for the price. True, the lags like a brick sometimes, even though I have much better than reccomended specs. As for career, I have experianced glitches, like the time when I was champion and the weeks before Wrestlemania and there was this storyline with me,Daniel Bryan,Seth Rollins and John Cena where you have to choose who to face at Wrestlemania. I chose Cena, as I find him the easiest to win agaisnt, however when Wrestlemania rolled around I faced Daniel Bryan, which I thought was weird as I chose Cena in the storyline. Then Daniel Bryan managed to beat me but after Wrestlemania Brock Lesnar was the champion and he wasn't even in the storyline in the first place. And now we have online,WWE2K16 features possibly the worst online I've ever seen. It is literally impossible to find a match, even for a normal 1v1 match. I've tried many times since I got the game back in February and have only found a match once. Despite these negitive facts,however, the graphics are good,aswell as the special effect animations for pay-per-views and championship matches, the gameplay is good,although it's a bit repetitive on career, and one of the biggest selling points for this game is the customization. The amount of things that you can change to suit how you want is probably the best of a game in the fighting genre, anything from apperance, to enterances, to custom championship belts and areas, you can do it all. Overall the game has its ups and downs. Is it worth the £35? I think so, if you can get past the fact of multiplayer being nonexistent,the odd glitch and sometimes having major frame drops, it is a good game, that I've had hundreds of hours playing.I also thought I should add that even though many people have had save data curruptions, I haven't experianced it, if I had have done, this review would be a very different one ;P			"

												This game is just wow... Über frustrating. I used to play the smackdown 1 & 2 games on ps1, smackdown vs raw and others of the franchise...Compared to them there are more options in terms of moves, yes. The graphics are nice, the showcase is nice, the unlocks are nice...And what about the rest? Well...Career: repetitive, sometimes you fight the same guy 4 to 5 times in 4 weeks.Matches: you can almost talk with the commentators if you fought the same guy a few times.Reversal system: I've had my game saying I was too late pressing the counter button when I didn't press it, I've had it saying too fast when I didn't press it, I've had it saying too late AND too fast at the same time! So that needs (some ...(really? Some???)) work.TLC match: briefcase hangs up, I own the guy, he's all red, I want to give him one last beating through a table to finish it off and get the briefcase. I get out the ring, pick up the table, jerk it like a retard and put it back down. Yes, I pressed the right button... I had this 3 times in a row, he was just like scrubbing the table with his armpit or whatever. Meanwhile in the ring: opponent gets up, picks up ladder that is in the ring, gets on the ladder. I noticed, but I had all the time right? Nobody had been pulling the briefcase during this match. I get in the ring, go near the ladder and start climbing it and briefcase falls down. A year before that I also played the TLC event and was pulling at the briefcase over a minute.I had high hopes when I bought this game after years of wrestling-games break. Next break: here I come!

												TLDR, dont waste your money on this trash.   This is my first review.   I have bought over 100 games through Steam, and this is by the far the worst.   I paid 50 dollars for glorified PC port.   And most PC ports are all trash.   First, there isnt any mouse support.   You have you hit space, return, esc to navigate the menus.   Second, the controls while wrestling are stupidly nonsensical.   Almost to the point of being absurd.    Games like Elite Dangerous ( a space sim) use a ton of controls.  Were every keystroke helps you pilot your ship.    But there is absolutely no reason to have a wrestling game need all the keys to control your character.   Its almost like they took the all the different combinations of movements & controls possible from a game controller and then mapped them to indivual keys.   That is ridiculously stupid.   3rd, there is no tutorial to help you learn the game.  Nothing, no instructions, no warm up matches - nothing.   You get dropped into it, and you have to figure it out.   4th, there are 2 ""mini games"" - and they are not fun.   1 mini game for submissions, and 1 mini game for kicking out of a pin.   But, there is no way to practice or learn either of these, until you are in a match.   And you will quickly lose the match, if you can't figure out the mini game fast enough.   Kind of important to have a tutorial on these things.  Last but not least, this simply isn't fun.   With a terrible control system 2k games took a potentially fun game and made a frustratingly bad game.   Almost forgot.   I had a friend come over and try the game.   The guy is a wrestling fan, and played a bunch of the console games.   He played all the older n64 wce and wwf games back in the day.   I let him play this game, and tried to talk him through how to play it, and he was completely shocked and how bad the control system was.   If nothing else, he saved 50 dollars.   Its games like this that explain Steam's game return policy.   But I want to take it a step further.   I want to be able to blacklist 2k Games from my Steam store.   I literally never want to see another game made by 2k games every again.   I never want to potentially buy another game from this developer.   Steam, can you make that happen?			"

												First of all let me start by saying that they have definitely made improvements from 2K15, You can feel that in the overall gameplay, You can see that in the added improvement to animations, reversals and general flow to the game.HOWEVER I have read that there has been a fair amount of criticism levelled at this game since its release, and unfortunately I find it all to be fairly well accurate.- first and foremost nine times out of 10 the game doesn't load past the Austin screen without fiddling around Ctl, Alt, Dlt, however that will be easily fixed come bug release time.And then there's the little nitpicking, The games FPS could be better, I'm playing on a GTX 980Ti and sometimes during entrances the frame rate drops dramatically, so that's definitely the game not me.And then we get to the criticisms levelled towards the game's highly anticipated 'my career mode'- The post match interview questions are far too vague, oh and it's a constant cycle of three, Yes, The creators of this game only put in a cycle of three different interview questions you can be asked...Evan NBA 2K got it better.And then there is the My career wrestlers voice, what happens if you are someone with dark skin?You're forced to have the most whitest sounding voice and it can't be changed.Yes they made a lot of improvements, and yes I probably would recommend it to a friend, but this game is still far from perfect, and there are quite a lot of bugs that need fixing.6/10 IGN			"

												I love the game it is ""AWESOME"". I would recommend it to others because it is really fun.There is just one thing that bothers me it is the new submition mode. The fact that you must use the joystick. I like the WWE 2K15 mode better because you only have too press the circle button. I hope that 2K17 will be better.			"

												The game is filled with crashes and many bugs. This is mainly evident when playing career or universe mode (The cutscenes in universe are a mess). Had to reinstall the game multiple times due to the game not starting. I would not recommend this game. There is no hope of fixing the issues with the game because support from developers ended a long time ago and they are no longer releasing patches to fix the current problems. The only positives I can think of is the large roster (I believe it is the largest in wwe games history) and the first few times you play it can be fun and challenging. But after a while, even legend difficulty is not enough to give you a challenge in matches since you have mastered the game's techniques			"

												TLDR, dont waste your money on this trash.   This is my first review.   I have bought over 100 games through Steam, and this is by the far the worst.   I paid 50 dollars for glorified PC port.   And most PC ports are all trash.   First, there isnt any mouse support.   You have you hit space, return, esc to navigate the menus.   Second, the controls while wrestling are stupidly nonsensical.   Almost to the point of being absurd.    Games like Elite Dangerous ( a space sim) use a ton of controls.  Were every keystroke helps you pilot your ship.    But there is absolutely no reason to have a wrestling game need all the keys to control your character.   Its almost like they took the all the different combinations of movements & controls possible from a game controller and then mapped them to indivual keys.   That is ridiculously stupid.   3rd, there is no tutorial to help you learn the game.  Nothing, no instructions, no warm up matches - nothing.   You get dropped into it, and you have to figure it out.   4th, there are 2 ""mini games"" - and they are not fun.   1 mini game for submissions, and 1 mini game for kicking out of a pin.   But, there is no way to practice or learn either of these, until you are in a match.   And you will quickly lose the match, if you can't figure out the mini game fast enough.   Kind of important to have a tutorial on these things.  Last but not least, this simply isn't fun.   With a terrible control system 2k games took a potentially fun game and made a frustratingly bad game.   Almost forgot.   I had a friend come over and try the game.   The guy is a wrestling fan, and played a bunch of the console games.   He played all the older n64 wce and wwf games back in the day.   I let him play this game, and tried to talk him through how to play it, and he was completely shocked and how bad the control system was.   If nothing else, he saved 50 dollars.   Its games like this that explain Steam's game return policy.   But I want to take it a step further.   I want to be able to blacklist 2k Games from my Steam store.   I literally never want to see another game made by 2k games every again.   I never want to potentially buy another game from this developer.   Steam, can you make that happen?			"

												7/10 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟In my opinion, despite negitive reviews this game is pretty good for the price. True, the lags like a brick sometimes, even though I have much better than reccomended specs. As for career, I have experianced glitches, like the time when I was champion and the weeks before Wrestlemania and there was this storyline with me,Daniel Bryan,Seth Rollins and John Cena where you have to choose who to face at Wrestlemania. I chose Cena, as I find him the easiest to win agaisnt, however when Wrestlemania rolled around I faced Daniel Bryan, which I thought was weird as I chose Cena in the storyline. Then Daniel Bryan managed to beat me but after Wrestlemania Brock Lesnar was the champion and he wasn't even in the storyline in the first place. And now we have online,WWE2K16 features possibly the worst online I've ever seen. It is literally impossible to find a match, even for a normal 1v1 match. I've tried many times since I got the game back in February and have only found a match once. Despite these negitive facts,however, the graphics are good,aswell as the special effect animations for pay-per-views and championship matches, the gameplay is good,although it's a bit repetitive on career, and one of the biggest selling points for this game is the customization. The amount of things that you can change to suit how you want is probably the best of a game in the fighting genre, anything from apperance, to enterances, to custom championship belts and areas, you can do it all. Overall the game has its ups and downs. Is it worth the £35? I think so, if you can get past the fact of multiplayer being nonexistent,the odd glitch and sometimes having major frame drops, it is a good game, that I've had hundreds of hours playing.I also thought I should add that even though many people have had save data curruptions, I haven't experianced it, if I had have done, this review would be a very different one ;P			"

												If you played wwe 2k15 and hated it you will hate this game..infact if you hate 2k wwe series you will hate this game.The match pacing is slow and uninteresting the graphics never seem to improve and have not kept up with todays realistic look the hairs look the worst. This whole gameplay is based on mini games and  restrictions they spent soo much time trying to simulate a match that they take the entire fun out. If you played wrestling games before 2k you would know  it used to bring in more than just casual wrestling fans. This series is starting to become the CoD of a franchise nothing improved just added content and recycled formula with a few tweaks that make the game better and worse.			"

												It's buggy but mostly fun. It's not amazing. I'm not really sure it's worth the 50 bucks even with all the DLC that puts it over 100 on other platforms, but it's fun if you want a good laugh. The controls are awkward and the collision handling is pretty terrible. If you want to climb the turn buckle, it's the same button to do so as it is to tag your partner in a tag-team match, so sometimes if you want to tag out, you'll climb the ropes instead. And speaking of climbing the ropes... in a battle royal? Wanna jump off the top rope onto somebody, but there's somebody pinning somebody else, no worries, it'll just slide them across the ring and out of your way as you hit them on your way down. Yup.Further issues include the targeting/locking system or whatever. Multiple people in the ring? Wanna switch targets? Well, by default, 'smart' targeting is on, which is hilarious as it basically means you can't switch targets. So you decide to turn it on manual switching... awesome, do it mid match, that's cool. Next match, however, it's back to default. So you change it outside battle, that's a pretty obvious fix, right? Only if you actually think that the targeting switching actually works. Guess what, half the time it doesn't. Woo!Then there's the graphics, oh man, they're interesting. It's very very obvious which ""superstars"" (still cracks me the hell up that WWE insists that all it's wrestlers, oh wait, can't call them that, are superstars), they spent the most time on. Most of the models for the incredibly lacking NXT roster are outright garbage. On top of that, any mid-carder, jobber, or female wrestler also look like they were made in a weekend. And that's not even mentioning what they did to poor Rene Young and her teeth. Good god almighty, she should sue.However, this is the biggest budget WWE game of all time supposedly, which isn't really a surprise, it just points to the fact that 2K games and the WWE don't take their fans or customers very seriously, and that the annual release schedule is untenable and leaves everybody with an unfinished/unpolished product. Hence why I said it's not worth the 50 bucks. I'm still going to give a 'yes' as to whether or not I'd recommend this game, but with a few caveats:1). Buy it on sale, preferably at 50% or more off.2). You need to like buggy games. Some of us find the bugs funny, so yes, that's a legit bullet point, if you don't like them, don't buy it.3). You probably need to like the WWE, a lot. Even if you liked the old WWF and WCW games that were actually great back in the day, and you want to play a modern version, this isn't it. Those games are still more fun, I just wish they had an updated roster and graphics.4). You need to have a high tolerance for repetitive and awful dialog. Michael Cole and JBL are involved so... yeah, and Renee Young's entire voice part is pretty much to say ""and there you have it, back to you Michael Cole"".			"

												I tried liking this, as I got it in a Humble Monthy Bundle, but it's just not fun. I enjoy/enjoyed wrestling when I was younger, and I remember the crazy and fun days of N64 and Gamecube wrestling games (both WCW and WWF/E). The fights there were simple and enjoyable; they were fast-paced and actually fun.If this is your first time trying a newer WWE wrestling game, this might not be what you're looking for if you're longing for the games of your past.The things I dislike about this aren't really the characters, graphics, or the fact that the audience still looks like creepy dolls, it's that the game isn't simple at all. There are mini-games for almost everything that suck the fun out of it very quickly--and they're not fun, chaotic mini-games, like mashing a button. The game is all about timing, and you can lose in under a minute if you're not perfect at it.Also, the load times are bad, especially in Create-A-Character, but I can look past that.Sure, some people like the game, but to me, it's too unnecessarily like a giant Quick Time Event.

												WWE 2K16 is playing much better than 2K15 when it came out. Gameplay is more of less similar with a few meaningful tweaks like limiting reversals, button spamming when performing a hold. All these tweaks have improved the gaming experience. I did face FPS drop to 10-15 about 2-3 times during my 5+ hours of gameplay. But considering it's just released. I can expect it to fixed in a future fix. You also get all DLCs since day one, unlike 2K15 where they were released as an update after some time.			"

												Bought this game for couch coop with friends. Got 2 xbox controllers (can attach 2 more if you have), and it works great... However, some key wrestlers were missing such as Bret Hart Hitman, Shawn Michaels, Hulk Hogan and a few such oldies. But the game is so much fun. I've played Smackdown vs Raw on the ps2 back then (Here Comes the Pain, SvR 2006, 2007), but I find this to be more fun as this feels slower and more simulation like (not in a ♥♥♥♥♥ it's tough kinda way)... The way you break pinfalls, and a few core game mechanic differences from Smackdown vs Raw actually benefit Wwe2k16. The game isn't Goty material, sure, as on first look the game looks sorta low budget, but doesn't look bad by any means, the skin detail is quite good. While some wrestlers look slightly funny such as Batista, the game's physics and gameplay feel nice and realistic (well as realistic as wwe can get). The inclusion of stamina bars, and the reversal system help in making it realistic, but don't mistake this sort of ""realistic simulation"" with racing simulation games and such. Racing simulation games are hard for the newbie gamer, while this is just easy to pick up. I still don't know if this game has a high skill cap as it mostly comes down to mind games as to when you expect your enemy not to reverse your attacks (button mashing doesn't help in this game, you have to time it right). But still I don't know if it would appeal to a highly skill obsessed gamer but if you want some good casual coop fun with friends, you have plenty for that.... Game modes are plenty, and awesome for coop, including Battle Royale for 10,20 and 30 players, Elimination Chamber, Ladder, TLC etc. And there are a bunch of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 , triple threat, fatal fourway game modes (you can choose to play with or against your friends) and also a story mode, which I can't comment on yet as I haven't played it.Short version, a must buy for any Wwe fan, especially if you see this on discount.. There's a lot of casual fun to be had with friends.... (ps I'm not a Wwe fan anymore but I can always live in nostalgia playing this game with all the older characters I know and love).			"

												WWE 2K16 is playing much better than 2K15 when it came out. Gameplay is more of less similar with a few meaningful tweaks like limiting reversals, button spamming when performing a hold. All these tweaks have improved the gaming experience. I did face FPS drop to 10-15 about 2-3 times during my 5+ hours of gameplay. But considering it's just released. I can expect it to fixed in a future fix. You also get all DLCs since day one, unlike 2K15 where they were released as an update after some time.			"

												real review goes herei grew up on wwf wrestlemania 2000, and to a lesser degree wwf no mercy 64.  then i discovered the joy of the Gamecube WWE games where collision detection was added and a giant swing in a 4+ man match meant everyone got their asses knocked over.then i did smackdown vs raw 2008, 2009, 2010, and they were terrible.  wwe 13 was the last good game i did.  WWE 2k16 is basically that, but with more stuff, and that's pretty good.it's got probably the most diverse roster of any game i ever played.  i told a friend about it who is not a current wrestling fan, and they basically asked me ""is insert-obscure-80s/90s-wrestler-name in it?"" expecting me to say no, and I ended up saying Yes to every single one (names like iron sheik, though as colonel mustafa, dude love, randy savage, x-pac)they even have a large number of NXT roster in it so even almost a year after the game is out, it's current with stupidstars like enzo and cass, the vaudevillains, binn falor, samoan yusuf, KENTAAAAAAA, baron von chickenpants, killsteenkill, and so on.  this is the first double-e game where i've actually wanted to play as almost everyone in it.the new campaign mode is also something remarkable despite being a rehash of the exact same thing almost every we game has had fantasizing over the attitude era and bone cold beave austin.  this time you play as him throughout several matches in his career, following objectives to advance the matches as they historically unfolded,  with exact in-game recreations of events, movement, and motion from the matches, as well as clips of the original audio and audience noise.  even lets you play as STUNNING STEVE AUSTIN where you can marvel that wcw also had jerry lawler and jr on commentary wowthe steam-included DLC contains individual missionmatches in teh same vein for the wwe 2015 hall of famers, allowing you to unlock a bunch of excessive skins, variations of wrestlers, etc, from The Rock, to The Rock 97, to The Rock 00, even to The Rock 03.the in-game handling of grapples and strikes feels much smoother than before, though there's basically no information on the controls for certain grapples, leaving you to figure it out yourself or look it up online.  to counter boring counter-fests, counters are now limited and have to recharge over time, so if a cheating computer is countering everything you do, they can only do it up to 5 times in a short period of time before they can't counter anymore, although even then sometimes the cheating computer will cheat and be able to counter despite having no counter.the MyCareer mode has some fun and innovative bits like starting out in NXt, choosing which titles to pursue and earning your way to title shots, having story interactions where you can make bad decisions and give horribly generic interviews which can turn you face or heel.  the problem with MyCareer is that this is pretty much all it has for all the championships and it costs stat points and VIRTUAL CURRENCY to upgrade your stats, and you gain very little of those at first, and even when you start earning more after each match, everything starts costing more, so you end up going year after year in MyCareer mode grinding for points unless you cheat using CheatEngine and give yourself more.MyUNIVERSE mode is basically the same but you don't play as one custom superstar.  you don't even have to play as a superstar, but just arrange shows, set up rivalries, and see greater in-world interaction with stuff like injuries and women wrestlers.  little icons appear after each match showing some trait loss or gain, but there's no explanation anywhere as to what these icons even represent so i have no idea what any of them even mean, one of them is literally like a pyramid or something.there's also great deal of customization of arenas, i made one that looks like paint and puke, and is atrocious and has a Turkish flag on the side of the ring beneath an LED board for no reason at all.the wrestler customizations are limited, as it seems every year they completely pick at random what things to include or disclude from the games in terms of features and customization options.  the new facial morphing system allows for greater freedom of movement, but at the cost of being excessively difficult to manipulate, and having some seemingly arbitrary limits which leave you with such oddities as being able to smooth down the right jaw, but not the left jaw ever.  it's all very dependent on the new photo-face capture feature, where you have to take a very precise photograph of someone's face, then messily staple it onto the CAW's face.  some of these looks surprisingly good, but none of it even matters because the CAW facial animations end up making every face-morphed CAW look the same.some other things i really like are the little details in the game.  por ejemplo, iffin when you play as Bray Wyatt and you do a taunt, youll hear his voice shouting ""follow the buzzards!"" or ""i'm the eater of worlds!"" like real.  Paige also shouts and says ""this is my house"" and cass loudly spells out ""S"" ""A"" ""W"" ""F"" ""T"" with his siganature or finisher thing.this was prolbably the greatest wrestle game i've played since DAY OF RECKONIN♥♥♥♥nd just about as it came out on Steam and was on sale, they announce Double-E 2k17 with Goldenberg.  not cool			"

												Running on a 4790k 16gb w GTX1080 running Win10 64 bit 1080p@60fps  (2k dsr).Not 100% stable, but for the price I got it for I accept the occational CTD (2x in 8hrs).The 30fps scenes are no issue to me.Although never a true fan I remember watching WWF back in the day and enjoying the over the top entertainment - must have been mid to late eighties, early nineties. That over the top extravaganza made a lasting impression. Now I can reenact many of those fights playing (against) these old wrestlemania stars! The later generations of fighters are also great.To be honest I think this got me hooked and waiting on 2k17, but I am very much still learning the controls - not too intuitive, but the controle mini games are a nice challenge.This game is GREAT for local coop, my two boys and me mixing it up.Highly recommended, especially if you can get it at a sale!!

												Another decent WWE 2K game.My Pros: Huge roster, you can now add new ring attires, showcase mode, new animations and modes.My Cons: Boring commentators, showcase mode can be boring if you don't like Stone Cold, it's slower than 2k15. "

												This game has major problems, knowing the history of the developer ""Yukes"" you'll never see these issues go away. As bugs and glitches from 2003-2004 still persist today.First off they are still using an Outdated 15 year old engine. The third party havok physics etc. are added on top of it. It explains why when you create a wrestler each item takes ages to load. The game has to analyze the layer of clothes etc, it's amatuer and lazy development - considering other developers like iD software's John Carmarck rewrites engines from scratch for optimization.Much of the game does not really reflect the ""WWE"" experience or pro wrestling in general. It's a step above the old arcade button mashing and going in the right direction towards sports entertainment, I'll give it that. But it cannot decide whether it wants to please Wrestling fans, Casuals or ""Multiplayer Annoying Competitive gamers who don't watch wrestling but brought this game to fight people online."" Online play is basically people running around the ring and spamming one move just to win. It's sad, the Multiplayer Non Wrestling players are pathetic. There are less Wrestling fans playing this and more Multiplayer Button Mashers have sadly brought this.Alot of stuff hence becomes confusing to arcade gamers. Since they don't watch the show, they might not understand the significance of OMG moves etc.Showcase mode is Cutscene + QTE-fest. It relies heavily on nostalgia for engrossment.Yukes overlooks the best feature every year. And that is, UNIVERSE MODE. Yep, they still have no idea what to do with it, and instead spend all year focusing on Showcase mode. Universe mode now is more RPG like, but the A.I booking is trash. The realism is a joke, so much that you can call it amatuer and lazy development. Teams and stables are useless, no managers are possible in rivalries. And yeah simulate enough and your Wrestlemania main event is Darren Young vs Erick Rowan. Money in the Bank is thrown in half baked, you cannot play the match before cashing in.Custom titles have a glitch which doesn't allow the weeks to be counted.Rivalries are simply beatdowns.Stories have been removed.The personality and RPG Statpoints are so underdeveloped and pointless.5 chairshots will make the opponent instantly get up, thats the most realismn breaking feature. In universe mode they could have added realismn, not Mortal Kombat.Don't bother with career mode, it's a grindfest and half baked with a demonic looking Renne Young interviewing you.Create a wrestler is slow and painful to use. Create an Arena is fine and works okay. Create an enterance is pointless as you cannot change camera angles anymore, whats the point of having pyros if you can't allow the camera to zoom out? LAZY DEVS! Lets not forget the lack of good or usuable enterance themes.Another thing is that this game gives less custom stuff for you to use in creating shows, wrestlers etc. Transistion animations, enterances, music, titanatron are so limited. If people create stuff they don't want to use stuff that already exists.Largest roster superficially, 1/4th of the roster are duplications of Stone Cold, Undertaker and Rock.Lets remember, the guys who had the attention to detail in Yukes are long gone. This series is just a yearly cash grab, The graphics and engine are really showing it's age. Just see how stupid Paige, Seth Rollins etc. looks in the game.It's sadly the only good WWE game on the store, till it's 60$ addon comes out. "

												Stupid submission minigames completely ruin the game for me. Dominating a match? Prepare for a submission move that you can't defend against while trying to make a blue bar run in a circle from a red one while your controller spazzes out and screws it up for you. Congratulations, you lost. But wait, you won this time, this time you got it! Maybe now you can win consisten...no, it doesn't work anymore. It did, but now it doesn't, because the bar doesn't respond to your input consistently, it just does whatever.I could go on about the game, talk about the atrociously long loading times with the classic loading bar that is merely the prelude to another loading of indeterminate lenght. Or of the nightmare inducing facial animations (that post fight interviewer will haunt me forever), the boring and irrelevant commentary, the stupidity of the stamina system, the rest of the controls that work whenever they feel like it.I'm glad I bought this game on sale, I would be upset at the waste of money otherwise.

												Four hours in, I've had to to turn down the graphics to low to run at 60 FPS, even though I have a custom built PC that can run The Witcher 3 and other great games on full graphics at 60 FPS. The first time WWE2k16 didn't install correctly, had to uninstall and reinstall. Takes two minutes or so to start after double clicking the shortcut on the desktop, and it has now crashed on me three times.			"

												I'd really like to give this a good score, but from what I saw the game runs horrible. 30(sometimes even 14) fps at some parts. I basically have to run the game on moderate settings when I really shouldn't be doing that at all. If this game gets fixed, if ever, I'll like it. But as of now the game is not optimized well and don't recommend it. Shame because it's much better than 2k15 and I would have recommended it a lot, just by looking at the content and all you can do.			"

												This game is one of the worst I've ever played. Grappling, Timing and Reversal suck big time. If this game weren't wrestling, I would ♥♥♥♥ing uninstall it right now. The AIs are as stupid as a rock. Timing is everything. When you press the button to reverse - Even though it state reverse now - you'll get ♥♥♥♥ed over by either getting, ""TOO EARLY!"" or, ""TOO LATE!"". Overall, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game by 2K. But hey, since when does 2K make good games? ♥♥♥♥ you 2k.			"

												After seeing and playing WWE 2k14 on xbox 360 which was quiet some time ago, I see that 2k is a really promising company when it comes to games. NBA 2k11 is the best sports game ever created and the whole Nba2k series as a whole is the best sports series ever created, NBA2k16 is also an amazing game. WWE2k14 was the best wrestling game I had played ever since Here comes the pain, for the first time 100 custom supestar slots and everything just improved.2k15 was a dissapointment but here is 2k16. The first thing I noticed playing this game is that the graphics are amazing, a really good looking game and the crowds are really realistic except when they are throwing their arms around like idiots but it just puts in some anticipation in the game. The gameplay is really good and is way better, they really improved it and it feels like Here comes the pain, fast and responsive. But the issues with 2k16 comes to the online modes because 2k doesn't seem to give a ♥♥♥♥ about the servers especially the PC versions of 2k games like NBA as well I'm expericing slow load times on the internet modes. For me my main focus on a wwe wrestling game is the customization because you will never be able to have Barrack Obama fight Chuck Norris while Snoop dogg inturups out of nowhere.Unfortantley the customization is limited, a lot of the clothing features are gone in create a wrestler and that to me is like getting a piece of chocolate cake and someome takes a knife, cuts it in half and tells you to ♥♥♥♥ yourself. Why did they get rid of so many clothing features? it's very limited. Other than the apperance options, the editing of the face and everything about the wrestler is very enhanced and powerful. I also like the photo scanner, using a photo to make a person is the best way to go and even players of The sims 2 can agree on this. The photo scanner has led to many accurate creations.The community creations centre is ♥♥♥♥ed at the moment because 2K doesn't seem to care about it's online modes, for some reason in this game we have to search via hashtags which is just dumb, you get three hash tag slots to search I mean what the ♥♥♥♥ just search normally what's the point. But the community creations search feautre is broken beyond belief. I tried searching for the hashtag Tupac Shakur and it didn't give me anything related to Tupac, I tried another search for Bruce Lee and still nothing relevant to Bruce Lee. If 2k17 is like this then we will have a big problem.Something I also realized is that the comunity creations is just small overall, 2k needs to consider merging the creations on PS4 Xbox one and PC into one because I've watched youtube videos of really impressive creations only to be dissapointed because they aren't for PC. What a dam shame. Another feature that needs to be added is inter-gender matches which have been absent since Smackdown vs Raw 2007. Without inter-gender matches the diva's are pointless, this is also another issue that happened with FIFA 16, you can't have Barcelona play against the US women's national team. Who ever is stopping the fun, ♥♥♥♥ yourself and add it in. In The sims you can have a woman fight a man and have them insult each other and just mess each other up as a whole. Other than that, WWE2k16 is a really good game and a step forward. The gameplay is astonishing and the detail they've added in is spectacular and I can't wait to see WWE2k17EDIT: I'm realizing that the game is recieving backlash because it is ""Too slow"" or ""I'm having performance issues"" ignore these people that's pretty much BS, you get those reviews on GTA V as well becasue some people aren't checking their hardware correctley. I have an nvidia gtx 950 2 gb and I can play this and GTA V on ultra settings with no problems			"

												TL;DR - You know how sometimes garbage can still be fun? Well this game is absolute garbage that can still be fun. Why are you even bothering with reviews? You have no other choice, either buy this piece of crap or give up wrestling gaming. 2K have us by the balls and they know it, exploit it and love it.Okay, first of all, let's be fair here. Recommendations are absolutely useless when it comes to the only game brand offering a solution (or at least a sad excuse for one) to us wrestling fans in the past two years. So of course I would say you should wait for the lowest price possible and get it. However, under absolutely no circumstances am I able to in good conscience mark this as “recommended”.True, it is awesome to finally be able to play wrestling on PC after having to make do with the holy work of Rawmodders and their constant releases of mods for the 1995 RAW game. Nice of you to remember PC exists after 20 years, 2K! The graphics are spectacular, the audio quality as well. You are able to recreate your favorite WWE moments, or create your own new ones as you choose. Very nice.Besides that? It is obvious that everything besides graphics has been given the absolute minimal possible attention, without any QA or beta testing (even though I’m sure thousands of you, just like me, would have happily done it for free). The controllers are the most atrocious I have EVER experienced in my life as a 31 year old gamer. Don’t believe me? Try playing a Triple Threat or Fatal 4-Way, I dare you. An opponent could be outside the ring 70 ft. away from you, and still when you try to break the pin count the game will for some reason think you wish to kick the air in hopes of hitting said opponent (what, you aren't a Jedi?). Nothing is more fun then having one of your oponents pinning another one right under your nose while you desperately pray that hitting the required button will actually have the meant effect. ""Smack your TV"", huh? More like smack your keyboard. The referee also works in a 1.5-2 seconds delay regardless to your specs, meaning you only have to the count of 8-9 to get back in the ring, causing a lot of frustration and turning skills like “relentless force” (extra damage outside of the ring) and the best OMG moments (like smashing you opponent through the table) irrelevant, as they WILL cause you to get counted out. In summary, you will do everything right and the less than amateur controllers will still make sure you lose. Yeah, I know, it could have been easily fixed, but why should they when so many of us will still buy the game having no alternatives? I know what you might think, I'm probably just not that good. Fair enough. As I've said, try it. Apology accepted. Now let’s talk about My Career. Hooray, I get to create my own superstar with his own appearance, move set, entrance and what not! Great, right? Wrong. Why can’t we use custom music or titantron movies? Because it would have taken some work. Why will 95% of your matches be regular mundane 1 on 1 regardless to occurrences? Because anything else would have actually taken some programing effort. Why will the game decide that you are a Heel after about 20 hours of game time in complete contrary to your actions thus far, and won’t let you change it even though the crowd loves you and you are a Face in all ways possible? Because taking care of bugs and actually offering customer service is beneath 2k. Try it, write to them about that bug (or any bug). I wouldn't hold my breath though.Let us continue. Oh, I see these two superstars are scheduled to be in a 1 on 1 title match on this weekend’s pay per view. What would be the most realistic and logical thing to do? Wait! I got it! Let’s put them in a 1 on 1 match in both programs this week, nothing draws the crowd more than watching the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ match three times in a row! (said no GM ever). Seriously, what dim witted never-watched-an-episode-in-my-life degenerate now lives with the shame of being responsible for this?! And another thing. Is this a game, or a cellular app pay2win? Because the SP awarded for 5 star matches make you wonder where you buy more in order to actually upgrade your superstar before WWE 2K35 is released. The amounts of useless redundant boring grinding is embarrassing, maxing-out your created superstar should be challenging, not invoke suicidal thoughts. Many say this year’s My Career is a lot better than last year’s, to which I say hogwash. Last year was terrible for its reasons, and this year’s terrible for it’s reasons. Narrators no longer use the name you chose, the entire match is the same dialogue about your opponent (they know our move set, can’t they say anything about that? What, Cole, King and JBL were too busy to record?). The highlights are complete garbage, showing every reversal done by your opponent but hardly ever your OMG moments or hard grapples. Also, remember how last year we got extra SP for being in the pay per view? Well now your superstar is in every single pay per view without getting squat. Keep grinding, don’t worry about getting bored, the extra sophisticated game engine will make sure to give you the same match over and over and over (and over) again. How exciting! And of course, the reversal engine! Nothing could have been more terrible, I have no idea what bunch of 5 year olds decided on that system. I get it, they had to do something, but this? Disgusting. Last year you simply had to hit F at the exact micro-second, as your opponent dominates you while you attempt to figure out how. Now superstars have a limited number of reversals (which get replenished according to your Reversal stat, just as long as your opponent's get replenished faster). Not to mention the system is buggy as hell, and your opponent WILL use magically conjured reversals without them being removed from his current reversal counter. Why? Because f*** you, that’s why. In addition, you can create a superheavyweight and he will still be tossed around and dropped by the tiniest of wrestlers. Makes perfect sense, right? Just like the fact that every time you are down on the floor outside the ring ANY AND ALL opponents will run to the ring and wait for you to be counted out (as you helplessly push the button to enter the ring, which only works on occasion). Just the way John Cena and The Undertaker like to win matches, right? Let the other guy get counted out! Superstars don’t drag the opponent back to the ring on RAW and Smackdown in order to beat them honorably, right? Right.Forgive me, but I’m tired of this. I am furious with myself for actually spending money on this piece of garbage instead of getting a torrent. I’m disgusted by every cent 2K has made for this half-a**ed work, exploiting their monopoly. The game is quite fun at times, until one of the infinite number of problems occur and make you want to smash your keyboard through the jaw of whoever’s in charge of those 2K idiots. I don’t know, wait till the end of the year when Humble Bundle offers this game and 10 others for like 15$. I’m at a loss for other solutions.			"

												This game has some of the worst controls that I've ever experienced in any game ever. Every match devolves into playing a series of horrible flash games. When I play a wrestling game, the last thing I expect to do is play a game of ""line up the circles"".I've played a lot of wrestling games dating back to Pro Wrestling on the NES. Every single one of them -- even the bad ones -- had some semblance of fun to them. Thanks for breaking the streak WWE 2K16. You somehow made wrestling games ""un-fun"".			"

												Easily the worst WWE game of all time. Usually when you beat the living day lights out of your opponent they are suppose to get weaker. Not in this game!! Just the usually reversal fest and completely unrealistic game play. I only paid £6.99 for this game and I feel physically sick. This will 100% be the last WWE game I will ever buy. Honestly words can't describe how truly awful this game is.Can't see WWE2K17 being any different so I would just save your money. Or if you really want to spend that £40 then I suggest getting it in change and putting it all down one of those coin vortex donation boxes. At least the vortex box will give you at least 30 minutes of entertainment...			"

												Ok. My review on this game this time will be more seriouse my last one ill admit was childish and i apoligise for that. So, This game is alot of fun when your playing with friends but this game can get difficult. The reason im saying this is because that you will be stuck against 2 guys at one point and you will get rekt. Like for example the stone cold story. You have to go up against mr. mcmahn and his son shane mcmahn. Its difficult to play the game when your being pounded on by 2 guys that hate you. I just find that a little unfair thats all.			"

												The game has so many improvements, but there are so many flaws... well, lets begin.-No Hulk Hogan (is like Street Fighter without Ruy, c'mon!)-The menus are terrible, very confused and polluted-The submission system is beyond terrible, the CPU will ALWAYS reach your indicator with extreme precision-The new reversal system broke the game, CPU will have the advantage everytime-The game needs an extreme powerful PC to run smoothly-2K15 character creation was more friendly. Try to make a character in 2k16 and you will see how painful is-Doesn't matter how powerful your system is, the presentations will always be in 30FPS-No option to import your 2K15 character-The soundtrack is much better than 2K15, but need to have more songs-Wait for a patch if you have an AMD card			"

												People compare this game to WWE 2K15 a lot. Well 2K15 was garbage so I will compare this game to the last decent one, WWE 2K14.-No Custom Music-Logo system is overly complicated and public, from using a logo sizing code on a website to downloading your own images from their community creations in order to use them yourself.-Cannot setup your own title matches in universe mode.-Many people reporting crashes, especially during entrances.-Many people reporting low fps, just read through the discussions page.-SOOOOOOO many items and parts are missing from the Create-a-Wrestler, I'm talking TONS!-New disfiguration system, what I call their morphing system, has dropped the sliders and is now using a complicated image interface where you move points of the facial image to morph the face. I'm having a hard time just explaining whatever this new limited system is! Oh yeah and you have to edit the front THEN the side of the face, this includes, for example, editing the mouth under two subsections instead of one, making it far less convenient.-It takes FOREVER to launch / load, and some are even unable to get the game to load at all.-The new submission system is just weird, I haven't fully grasped it yet so I won't comment about it too much.Now to be fair, here is a few things I like about the game;-Giant roster size and they actually have more divas this time. Divas tend to get sidelined, a major failing in 2K14 imo.-Can create 100 wrestlers (that all look the same because of limited CAW, i know i know, it just bugs me!)-Much better graphics (but poor optimization for some)-Of the clothing parts they actually DO have, there is more volume and detail to them making them look more real.-You can choose a matieral such as metallic, satin, cotton, ect to give your outfits different sheens.Overall I do not recommend this game because I myself am regretting buying it. If anything, follow it and wait for 2K to address the problems many are having or just wait until it goes on sale / down in price. Its a mainstream game for a mainstream audience that cares more about graphic quality rather than content quality, action over story, stock play over customization, money over innovation. So your typical modern day corporate charged grab bag full of hot air in order to make it look full. Buyer beware!			"

												The only reason why this game is complemented so much is because the previous wwe game was the biggest piece of trash ever. I'll admit this one's a lot better, but it's still not a good game.Pros: More roster, more creations, photo scan, better myCareerCons: Horrible Universe Mode. Literally, nothing got better. If anything, it's now worse since you can't seperate it brands. They still didn't fix the bug where if you change the participants in MITB and Royal Rumble, then winner loses his privellage. And of all that, they still didn't add custom music for PC. Really? It's really not a hard feature to add. The lack of features in Universe Mode makes the whole large roster more pointless.And why is it that I get numerous CTD's when I go through some superstar's entrances in MyCareer Mode?And the Submission system of course.  It's hard to control, and hard to get used to. Luckily, defensive side of submission isn't so bad, but the offense? Whoever decided to come up with this system should not be allowed to come up with ideas anymore			"

												This game is pathetically awful. I had a stroke several years ago and playing this was far worse. The controls make no sense. Outside of one button to strike everything the rest was useless. I played ""Pro Wrestling"" on an emulator a while back and it had more logical controls than this piece of garbage. What pisses me off is that I could have spent this money on a charity, or burned it, or wiped my ♥♥♥ with it. Any way would have been more useful than playing this testament to uselessness. WWE should just create a card game like Hearthstone. It would be easier to do and wouldn't create the animosity towards the base product.Make it up to me by having Brie or Nikki return my money. It would make for a great E! episode.			"

UPDATED REVIEW - 04/10Now that I invested (or wasted?) more time with this game I can give you guys a better review of WWE 2k16.The game got patched but I still CANNOT recommend it. I am still playing it though, because all I do in this game is create characters, play Royal Rumbles with said creations and I have fun simulating my WWE Universe too.Anyway, let's break it down in Pros and Cons so it's easier to get my points straight. PROS  Amazing Graphics; The roster is pretty packed with a bunch of DIFFERENT wrestlers. What I mean is - there's not many variations of the exact same character like in the previous versions. Just Steve Austin, but he's awesome so SWIG O' WATER FOR THE WORKING MAN.  MyCareer isn't a joke now. Oh wait, it still is because there's a great chance to CORRUPT YOUR DATA! I'm going to talk more about this in the CONS section; You can create your own show, your own arena, championship and of course, many characters and WOMEN (suck it, 2k15) with their own move-sets and entrances; The move-set list is excellent! It takes a while to get the hang of the game, but after some practice you're gonna tear the house apart with a large variety of movements, like Springboard attacks and OMG moments; Every DLC is available right from the bat, like it says on the thumbnail. I've seen some people asking, so I thought I should add this piece of information in this review as well just in case; You can remove the Chain Wrestling stuff by going into the Options menu and setting both Chain Wrestling bars to the lowest of the low; The AI can be challenging if you raise the difficulty bar up enough; I may be biased because Steve Austin is my favorite wrestler, but the 2k Showcase is awesome. 2k Showcase can also corrupt your file too, by the way.  CONS  Although the Create-a-Wrestler Mode is very well done, there's not many options to choose from designs, tattoos, body shapes and a couple other things that really bothers me, because in the older games we had hundreds of designs to choose from and in this one we have twenty or so.Yeah, you can download custom logos and upload some of your own, but in my opinion it should have more vanilla designs for us to choose. Also, if you use too many designs in your creation, your character gets 'infected' with some weird green particules all over his body, and you can fix that by changing his skin colour just a little bit and saving right after you change it; Importing faces can be kinda buggy too, and also weird as heck; Editing faces is weird, but that is just me. I prefer the old way with all the sliders. I have a problem making asian characters as well, but that is just me again I think, lol; The submission system can be very, very random with a controller. I had no problems playing with a keyboard, but with a controller I feel it's just luck based. Just wear down your opponent and keep doing a submission move until you get it right; Lilian Garcia can sometimes glitch up her lines and say something like - AND THE CHALLENGER, THE MONEY IN THE BANK LADDER MATCH AND THE WWE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION, FROM DAVENPORT, IOWA. It kinda ruins the immersion, but it is funny when it happens; Be careful when downloading stuff from the Community Creations, because sometimes the game can simply NOT SAVE and corrupt your data;And the main reasons I cannot recommend the game right now is: FPS problems. I have a kinda outdated graphic card (Radeon R7 200 Series) but this graphic card runs any other recent game well in medium settings. However, I tried to play a 30-man Royal Rumble match with medium settings, and after a while the game started to lag a lot. I had to close the match because there was no way I could keep playing in slow motion. Some people do not have this problem with lesser graphic cards, but I and many others do, especially AMD users; The game still crashes a bit during entrances like Bray Wyatt's or Undertaker's and during at any point in MyCareer mode. This latest patch fixed a couple random crashes during entrances, but it still happens from time to time.Also, songs do not suddenly stop playing after playing the game for a while anymore; Sometimes the game decides to corrupt your data. So please, I cannot stress this enough BACKUP YOUR SAVE GAME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE! BEFORE ANYTHING BAD HAPPENS, go to Steam\userdata\[YourID] and copy the whole 385730 folder, and I mean the WHOLE FOLDER, not just the remote stuff. After you do that, paste that save in a safe place, like your porn folder. Now if you get your files corrupted by just playing MyCareer like I did, at least you have your progress saved. If that ever happens, don't panic - Shut Steam down and go to the Steam folder. Delete the ENTIRE CORRUPTED 385730 SAVE FILE inside the Steam\userdata\[YourID]\ folder and paste the one you had saved before. Now, double-click the save you just pasted and DELETE the remotecache.vdf, so Steam Cloud doesn't eff up your save. Start Steam and start your game. Steam is going to ask you what file you want to use - choose the LOCAL FILE option. You SHOULD be good to go with this method, but sometimes Steam just doesn't upload your entire save to the Cloud. If that happens, turn off Steam Cloud. It sucks, we shouldn't care about this, but this is such a messy port that if you want to buy this crap and have fun with it, it's a sacrifice you have to make; Also, JBL sucks. The commentary is golden because JBL is just 'there', and the majority of the dialogue is between Cole and Jerry. Sometimes JBL says something like OH THERE'S THE FINISHER and that's pretty much it.Besides the obvious Cons, I can safely say that this game is great IF YOU DON'T MIND BEING EXTRA CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROGRESS. However, my love for wrestling, my patience and my graphic card doesn't overcome FPS issues. I'll keep myself from playing MyCareer, 2k Showcase and a 6-man Hell in a Cell  - or any sort of a 6-man kind of match, even though is my favorite match type to play. Royal Rumble is fine now for me, but it still lags a bit.If you have a low-end PC or an AMD graphic card - you should avoid this game for now, or at least until/if 2k releases another patch or something regarding us AMD users.TL;DR - It is a fun wrestling game, lots of stuff to do but 75% of the game can corrupt your save at any given point, and it lags quite a bit for AMD users.

												Really was looking forward to this game.  Had several issues with it.  If you have a mutiscreen setup the game loads in some crazy resolution spanning 2 monitors.  CTRL+ALT+DELETE sort of fixed it after the screen refreshes itself a few times..............?    Had to run in admin mode or it wouldnt launch.  Crashed a few times during intros.  i was done.  Never refunded a game on steam before until now.  And ive bought a 100+ games over the years.  After the pitiful CAW mode from 2k15 i wasnt even going to deal with it.  Refunded until they fix it  all.  $50.00 isnt just play money.  Might just get the PS4 version.			"

												After ""playing"" for 1.7 hours, i have to use my refund choice now. Even though i was looking forward to WWE 2k16 on PC.Let me dive deeper into my decision though:I still own a PS3, so i can't have the shiny Next-Gen Versions of the WWE games nowadays. Then 2K decided: ""Hey, let's port our games to PC aswell"". 2k15 was an ok port (FOR ME it was ok. I know alot of people hated the port and rightfully so. Thanks ""Humroy"" for pointing that out), but it lacked in gameplay. Then 2k16 came out on consoles and it looks like a vast improvement, which made me pre-order it in February, when they announced the PC Version.Well after a 12 hour download (yeah blaming my ISP there), i got into ""playing"" 2k16. Unlike others i have no performance issues, but the port is seriously lacking in stability right now. Once you start, you are greeted by a splash screen on Stone Cold Steve Austin for a few minutes, until the game decides to load (same happens when running as administrator).Then you get into a game, you look forward to butting heads with the likes of Randy Orton or John Cena, and new workers like Sami Zayn (Olé!) and Finn ""Don't call him Prince Devitt"" Balor. And that's where it starts. During Balor's entrance i was greeted by a crash to desktop. Oh well, i said, that happens in other games aswell, let's try again. Played a match between Samoa Joe and Balor. No crash this time.Then it was time to start up MyCareer which got alot of praise for the improvements over 2k15s career mode. And it looked great. I created a snobby Hollywood Heel Character, created his entrance, created his move-set.....oh wait. No i didn't. While creating the moveset, the game died twice with a ""WWE2k16 is not responding anymore"". At this point i said ""♥♥♥♥ it, that's the final straw"" and chose my refund option. Now some people will say: ""Uggggghhhh, but it runs fine for me, maybe try this or that. Must be your system!"" No, i'm done with that. All i wanted was a great PC port after 2k15s port wasn't that great. Because, hell, 2k16 deserves a great port. The improvements to the gameplay are there (except the submission system, which is straight up garbage), now work on the stability of your port.			"

												As much as I would love to like this game, I really can't.  The counter system seems even worse than last years, which is saying something (how the ♥♥♥♥ is it possible to counter an attack ""too soon""?)  The targeting system doesn't work most of the time (I kept on trying to attack my RIVAL and the game kept on hitting my tag partner instead!)  When you start a career the game is stacked against you unless you pay to get rid of grinding (I know WWE isn't about winning but come the ♥♥♥♥ on, I'm 60 and they're 90+!!!)  Pins never ♥♥♥♥ing work when it's against the AI but will finish me off staight away even when EVERY bar I have is greater than theirs (I couldn't pin someone who was at NO HEALTH and NO STAMINA but he could pin me after when I had almost full health and half my stamina bar (And by he could pin me I mean the bar to hit was smaller than a gnats ♥♥♥♥)) And don't get me ♥♥♥♥ing started on the pisspoor submission system, it makes it impossible to beat someone if the have any stamina and you aren't at max.  The graphics haven't been upgraded in several years and tyhe created characters face has holes in it (especially around the mouth area, the inside of the wrestlers mouth isn't connected to his lips)  They've added a limited number of counters in this one too, they still drain stamina as well though, so if you're opponent is spaming attacks, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck mate.  There are SOME possitives to the game, but they are too far and inbetween for me to even think about recommending this game to someone. The MyCareer mode is pretty good though, if not for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fighting system.			"

												From what i managed to play the games is 100x better then any other WWE game so far (even without GM Mode). Sadly though as soon as i try do anything other then a 1vs1 the game goes into super slow motion and is basically unplayable. Now this could be due to my graphics card being a bit shoddy but i cant give a positive review to a game that wont work for me.The game also takes a long time to load past the splash screen.Pros:+Brilliant Reversal system that makes the match an actual fight and not just a reverse fetish.+Good Graphics ''for a WWE game''.+Way better reverse animations, and just animations in general.+Fluid gameplay (sometimes a bit slow).+Ability to use manual targeting systems and also being able to turn off certain features you dont like, like chain grappling and other stuff.+Career mode has been revamp and is actually good.Cons:-Changing graphic settings from the highest to the lowest will change your FPS for 30-34 ect.-Some animations take a while and everything goes completly silent whilst ur doing it.

SEE NORMALLY WHEN YOU GO ONE ON ONE WITH ANOTHER WWE GAME, YOU GOT A 50/50 CHANCE OF WINNING. BUT HERE COMES THE PAIN'S A BINARY FREAK, AND NOT NORMAL! SO WWE 2K16'S GOT A 25%, AT BEST, AT BEAT ME. THEN YOU ADD NO MERCY TO THE MIX, YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING DRASTIC GO DOWN. SEE THE 3 WAY, AT SACKERFICE, YOU GOT A 33 1/3 CHANCE OF WINNING BUT HERE COMES THE PAIN'S GOT A 66 AND 2/3 CHANCE OF WINNING, BECAUSE NO MERCY KNOWS HE CAN'T BEAT ME AND HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA TRY!SO WWE 2K16, YOU TAKE YOUR 33 1/3 CHANCE, MINUS MY 25% CHANCE AND YOU GOT AN 8 AND A THIRD CHANCE OF WINNING AT SACKERFICE. BUT THEN YOU TAKE HERE COMES THE PAIN'S 75% CHANCE OF WINNING, IF YOU WAS TO GO ONE ON ONE, AND THEN AND 66 AND 2/3 PER CENTS, HERE COMES THE PAIN'S GOT 141 AND 2/3 CHANCE OF WINNING AT SACKERFICE.

												Better than 2K15.  Another sluggish port.  Still find characters waiting for animations to trigger.  If you find a bundle with all the DLC then you'll have a decent roster.  If you are inclined to play the Hall of Fame mode to play actual scripted matches to unlock more characters then you'll have an even better roster.  Still not fun to play though.

												I haven't had an opertunity to play this game, because the game will not allow me to play the storyline with a female character. Now I realize that wrestling has a history that has always been pretty sexist. However in 2016 there is no excuse for a gender to be discriminated against in a video game. There's also no purpose, men play female characters just as much as women do. So restricting a gender really restricts everyone.			"

												- Can't have mixed matches with male and diva superstars cause PG era- Can't import your own music- Game still has corruptions - No diverse voice acting like old Raw vs Smackdown games for your own superstar, you have one generic voice. Deal with it.- Can't even play as a superstar for story, you HAVE to be a male CAW with one voice cause budget cuts.- Countering and kicking out a pin fall is all a quicktime event mini game. I'm ""too early"" to dodge that chair about to cripple my legs? WHAT?!- Can't even create your own storyline like in 2k12. I don't care if its text only, why can't you let me have my own fun? Oh right. This is WWE 2k16- Compared to Here comes the pain and Raw vs Smackdown 2006-2009's storyline with allusions to the attitude era, the story is just so crap. I don't feel like I make an impact in the company like in the old games. Counter argument is ""B-but muh-r-realisms for being a wrestler!"" If I wanted to know what it's like to be rejected and constantly deal with John Cena being the poster boy and not me I would try to run for the real WWE and not play a video game.Other than that, this is the only PC Wrestling game I can play cause the other ones aren't supported anymore when it comes to online communities. I can have a bit of fun here and there since the game at least has Steve Austin and community created wrestlers (which can corrupt your save).If you haven't played any recent WWE games that are worse than this since you come from the old PS2 ones and stopped watching wrestling ever since, you won't recognize most of the roster and will realize how bad WWE is now. I can still have some fun because of custom creations and the WWE Legends to remind me of the old days.There's still more for me to unlock, hopefully unlocking everything will make the game better. I'll update the review then. Behind all of the complaints, there's a fun game waiting to be played. The combat mechanics aren't honestly all that bad but the quicktime events just kills it for me especially when ""Press button within split second or lose the match"" is what summarizes every match.*Update 28/05/2016* - Game won't even start now, crashes on startup.

												The server is already on a countdown for turning off, buying this game with both the creation system for caws and the online gaming tied into the server makes it not worth buying.The game works well on my Windows 7 mid range games machine, it seems to have lot of problems for some windows 10 users, It isn't a mistake that they didn't list windows 10 on the supported O/S list.

												This game is a high contrast picture. It has some AWESOME game design marred by shitawful implementation that makes the experience on the whole very unenjoyable.The pros:- The graphics look quite frankly amazing even on lower settings.- The roster is humongous.- The customization options were largely improved over WWE2k15, including the inclusion of custom divas.- Career mode is fun, but...The cons:- The lnput lags. And i don't mean a bit. I mean that a game where your winning or losing a match (escaping a pin) is based on a timing minigame, has a solid half second of input delay. That is unplayable. You can still win if you get used to it, but it's terrible for a company like 2K to not even be able to code a decent input manager.- Reversals are ♥♥♥♥ing impossible. Let's be real here: nobody knows ALL the moves to this game. There's just too many. Even if they did, they'd not be able to spot which is being done in time for the reversal window to matter. Hence why the input delay, coupled with the fact that sometimes the reversal prompts just refuse to show, or show too early/late, is again a huge problem that needs addressing ASAP. Considering i've read various sources saying it's been there since 2014, i'd not hold my breath for a fix.- The AI cheats. If you have limited reversals enabled (Don't) the AI will ignore that if you're gaining too much on it. It also kicks out after the second or third finisher in a match. And we're not talking Undertaker versus Sting on PPV here, we're talking jobbers on a normal show night.- Lip synching in the very few dubbed scenes is comedically bad, but nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about that.In summation: The game designers for this game put a lot of effort into building a simulator. The fact that the match is graded on its entertainment value is an awesome idea that makes losing feel like less of a failure, if you at least managed to get a good rating out of the match, the strategic choices when building a moveset and stats combination are as deep as it gets, then whoever programmed the whole thing took a giant steaming ♥♥♥♥ all over the very obvious effort and ruined it with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI and Input.Good job 2K.

												IF you have a hardcore gaming rig and can get this game running to a playable level, you will be met with slow paced gameplay that will entice any Randy Orton VS. John Cena fan. Assuming you can actually have the audience turned on, they are way better than ever before. The creation suite is best suited for fans of American wrestling that want to make all their favorite WWE/WCW wrestlers with the face photo feature. The mask choice is extremely limited, so luchadores and other masked favorites are out of the question. They included the horns for Jyushin Thunder Liger, but left out his mask design. You can forget about WWF/E honoree Tiger Mask, his ears and fur are left out as well.But hey, you can probably get Lilian Garcia to say your name. That's cool right?....right?All the problems from PS4 and XBone are still here, it just runs way worse. You get the newest and hottest hardware, and I'm sure you can make it work the way it was meant to on PC...with 30fps entrances...1/10, would rather get my refund than play again on a mega rig.			"

												Unfortuently I can't recommend this game, it is great and fun. However in my career mode I won the rumble, entered 14th and elimated about 12 or more people (i think). It was one of the most butt clenching moments of my time in this game. It was my first PPV after NXT so I was very happy that I was getting this push. However at WrestleMania I was entered in a triple threat against two jobbers instead of challenging Seth Rollins for the WWE Championship. So get the game if you love wrerstling, its fun and has many good points, but the fact that I didn't get my title shot is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I was ranked 9th in the standings but I won the Rumble so I should of been gaurenteed a shot. Hopefully this gets sorted for 2K17!			"

												Purchased this for my brother for his birthday, watched him play it and even played it myself..worst game in the series BY FAR.  Both me and my brother have played nearly all of these games since Raw is War, this is the worst one.  The gameplay is horrible, the lag (even with a 4 gig video card) is horrid, the mini-games are extremely frustrating, and the targeting is so bad as to almost be unusable, especially with auto-targeting.  If anyone reading this is intelligent, you will not even consider purchasing this game.   2k interactive, you butchered yet another game, congratulations..I wasted my money on a gift that turned out to be JUNK.

												Managed to somehow get into the game once. Plays alright, looks great, and since it's a wrestling game with just an arena and audience, you don't really need a super computer to play it. BUT.... Exited out of the game for something, and tried to play again later. Was stuck staring at Steve Austin's armpits for 10 minutes. Tried to tab out to exit out of the game, and had an even bigger picture of Steve Austin's armpits as my back drop of windows for some reason. (I'm not joking) ctrl alt deleted to try and close the program, and task manager is minimized to make room for Steve Austin's armpits. Gave up and went to take a ♥♥♥♥, and saw Steve Austin's armpits when I lifted the toilet lid. Landlord knocked on the door to collect rent dressed as Steve Austin with arms raised showing off epic pits. Do not buy this game unless you have maschalagnia.			"

												A massive word of warning if you're interested in creation. Though I've long stopped watching wrestling, I've always had a soft spot for the games. In particular, the creating of wrestlers has always been a rather large attraction and major selling point. However, despite 2K16 having a seemingly very robust creator wrestler, it is let down by one, fatal flaw. You can no longer import or have any sort of custom soundtrack. The music that is already in the game is what you have to use.Let me repeat that. YOU. CANNOT. HAVE. CUSTOM. ENTRANCE. THEMES.If you wanted to try and create Alex Wright and have him come out with his WCW theme, forget about it. Wanted to create a character from another game and have them walk out to their theme, nope. Frankly, this is disgraceful and removes a large element of fun from the game. It might seem like a silly thing to rage about, but I'd wager for a fair few people, this is a big turnoff. Honestly, had I known this, I would have never, EVER, bought the game. Sadly, I can't even refund it. So I can only look on in sour malcontent as this piece of software squats on my hard drive. Hopefully, some kind soul will create a mod which enable this a critical feature. And the fact I even had to type that sentence is rather obnoxious.Shame on you, 2K. Shame on you!  *Extended*This is my first wrestling game since 2K14. I had no idea they'd removed this feature from 2K15, as I avoided that game given all the negative reports. Again, it seems like a silly thing to gripe about, but once you've had the option to have a creation walk out to a certain type of song (be it serious or silly) you don't want to go back. It just help establish an identity for your creation.I mean, honestly, if I can't have wrestlers walking out looking all serious and moody to the Pokemon tv theme - what is the point? No long can I have Nintendo vs. Capcom vs. Sega vs. Sony wrestling abominations walking out to their respective themes - le sigh -I'm sure the game play and mechanics are fine once you've got used to them. But unless they're a return or a massive improvement on the wrestling games from the N64 (No Mercy, Revenge, 2000) then I don't have too much interest in playing the actual game - expect for drunken throwdowns with friends (again, where the entrance's are a major part of the fun). No, the creation options are what I'm interested in these days and though I'm disappointed that there is no create a story, I can still create a fictional promotion and characters and mess around every now and then (See above). This isn't a serious game for me, I have no interest in the Online. This is purely for me and my friends. The purpose of this review is for people who are in the same boat as me. If the tools are released for modding (as I'm sure they will be) then by all means, come and have another look and then judge for yourself. Until such a time, however, beware.			"

												I wish I could give this game a ""neutral"" review.There's a lot to like here, but the biggest is simple: it's at least a relatively good wrestling game with an appreciable number of WWE wrestlers in it, and this is basically the only place you're going to find it. If that's what you want, this game has it, and you will probably find a way to be happy with it, if you want it badly enough.The game has got flaws, however. It's a console port, and I don't mean that in a good way. Some console ports are well done, but this one seems very cut-and-pasted into Windows. If you were expecting ANY part of this to take advantage of being on Windows, forget it. Their posted system requirements are laughable, unless you're playing with all the settings turned off in 720p at 60Hz refresh (and you probably aren't). A 750 Ti didn't get me to 60 fps at 1080p; only an upgrade to a 1060 could do that.You still can't use your own music for your created wrestler. You still can't use your own video for your created wrestler. Understandable (barely) on a console, but how was this overlooked on PC (see ""not a great port,"" above).However, as stated, if you want a good wrestling game with WWE wrestlers, and you want it on PC? This will get you there. But you'll wonder why more couldn't have been done.			"

Οι επιλογές είναι ατελείωτες, όπως και οι ώρες ενασχόλησης που προσφέρει, διαθέτει πρωτοφανούς βάθους gameplay, είναι φροντισμένο και καλογυαλισμένο σχεδόν μέχρι τελευταίας λεπτομέρειας, συνεπώς δε μπορώ να φανταστώ τί άλλο θα μπορούσε να ζητήσει ένας φανατικός fan του WWE.It includes a huge roster and many gaming modes, such as the hours of joy it delivers are.

If it says display settings does not show then see if your HDMI cord is plugged in to the dedicated graphics card on your CPU, worked for me. The game is all right, career mode is fun.

												Much improved to last year's 2k15.  Pretty much most of last year's complaints were addressed and fixed.  Larger roster, faster load times, double the CAW slots and most important, better optimization.  Last year's ran like a slug and crashed often in all but high end PCs.  2k16 runs much better.  I can actually run the Royal Rumble now with my middle spec PC.  There is still occasional slow down and random crashes, But so much less frequent  than 2k15.   With the community mods adding in custom Wrestlers, arenas, music & menus, this will be the definitive Wrestling game on the PC.			"

It takes me nearly 3 hours to create a ♥♥♥♥ing character because it constantly crashes. I have to save every single time I make even a minute change to the character and even then it constantly crashes ESPECIALLY AT THE MENU SCREEN!!!!!!!!! If you never use custom content, buy it! More power to you. For those of us that consider personalization a critical part of the gaming experience I'd wait until they actually bother to fix this ♥♥♥♥.

												So, people complaining about it not working aside. As someone who has 0 issues running or playing the game, I have one or two things that hang me up.1) I can't turn off the announcers without silencing the refferee's 10 count. The announcers have to be the worst thing in 2k16 (Which is a good thing in some ways). They're beyond annoying and most of the time their lines are lazy.2) I wish it would put you into a fued with the champion automatically upon becoming #1 contender. People seem to miss that as the qualification for a title match, and will often go months of matches without their title shot.3) I wish you could have the whole roster be present in My Career mode. Maybe enable an option disabling realism for roster? It'd be cool to have more people to fight. Unless you can and I haven't gotten that far. Otherwise, 2k16 delivers big and is easily the best thing to happen to WWE games in awhile.(GM mode pls 2k? pls?)			"

												Lightyears above 2K15.  There are only a few of the characters this time around that look like muppets, which is a good thing.  Lex Luger looks... like he was carved out of foam rubber and someone is working his mouth hole with a hand slid up to the elbow.The only thing I dislike is the new, worse ""mini-game"" you have while kicking out of a pin.  It seems like you HAVE to do it, even if it's a pin off a clothesline 3 seconds into the match.  Otherwise you're Jeff Jarrett waiting for Hogan to pin you.Speaking of, Hogan's not there.  His leg drop isn't there.  Any Hulkamania isn't there.  And I'm fine with that.  For me it's not about racisim and a terrible sex tape... It's that I'm over him.  What bugs me is 5 itterations of a man who held up two title matches (Warrior) but only one version of old, wrinkly, moobie Space Mountian (Flair).  I mean give me a Clash of the Titan's version of Ric.  Give me a 90's short hair cut WCW Ric.  Give me long hair 80's Ric.  Why devote so much effort into a 3 move body builder who's blown after 5 min's, which INCLUDES the 3 min it takes to run down, shake the ropes, and get into the ring proper.Sorry, went on a tangent.  The models look excelent, the gameplay is smooth, and I can't wait to keep going on my road to Wrestlemania.  Great game, highly recommend it to folks that love wrestling.			"

												Gameplay is solid and challenging. The career mode characters and story seem really flat in comparison to the Showcase mode which is the best part of this game for me. Reliving moments from Stone Colds career in amazingingly accurate detail is a lot of fun to watch at least once. That novelty will inevitably wear off, but I am having a lot of fun on this.Entrances are locked at 30fps and gameplay is 60fps, but IMHO its not a limiting factor when you are just watching the entrances and not playing them. 980 Ti maxes this out at 4K, no sweat 60fps.

												The incredible presentation and amazing roster of characters are somewhat tarnished by the new game mechanics used for pinning and submissions.  Computer opponents will kick out of most pins no matter how battered and bruised they are unless you hit them with a finisher.  This can make matches a grind to build up your momentum bar often more than twice in order to win.  The new submission system is clumsily implemented and caused controller breaking frustration at first.  At least 50% of gamers seem to be having problems with this new system for submissions.  I researched online and found some helpful advice from gamers who understood how to use it successfuly, so persevere if you're having trouble with it!  Overall however the pros far outweigh the cons in my opinion.  The insanely huge roster spans decades of professional wrestling and includes a lot of exciting big names.  Improvements to the 'My Career' mode make it even more exciting and involving than before, in many ways this is the best wrestling sim ever made.  It's a huge improvement over WWE 2K15 and if you forgive the two new clumsy game mechanics you'll enjoy some of the rawest, most realistic and well paced wrestling action ever devised for a computer game.

												Flawed... but okay...After last year's WWE 2K15, I was excited but cautiously optimistic to see a larger scale game coming to the PC... and while it looks great and has similiar requirements to last years version, there are some random slow down in game play moments that occur that once they happen basically requires a game relaunch, much in the same way the black ring of death last year. The 'Benchmark' tool is pretty much useless as fudging with the settings is how to find your computer's happy zone to run things steady,Anyway... I figure a patch similiar to what was given to last years edition would solve this these minor issues.That said, the roster is all there so no waiting a few weeks for the DLC like last year, there are some control commands that don't make sense to me (the new submission circle system is frustrating as all hell), and the manager on the outside causing distractions can get a bit old before they are eventually tossed from the ringside area.

												I'm already in my 40+ hours of gameplay and I have to say I love WWE 2k16. It has more playable characters than 2K15, More variations for CAW and better gameplay.Unfortunately I have found the achilles heel of the game. The longer you play it, the bugs and glitches show up more frequently than the last time. In my case, the game crashes for no reason at all, Ref sometimes do not count pin falls, Weapons getting stuck in your character's hand and worst of all - Tables not breaking even though you had put your opponent there, ready to be elbow dropped. Most of the glitches are funny though, but it's getting annoying. I hope they'll fix these things soon.Despite the bugs and the glitches, I highly recommend this game for WWE fans =)			"

												If you have ever wanted a good WCW wrestling game, this is as close as you can get.  The nostalgia of playing early 90s characters is unmatched. The gameplay and lack of interference and match customization is a drawback for some, but when you are playing and the mannerisms and actions the wrestlers make during the match make it a realistic pro wrestling presentation that has much more of a life to it than 2k15.Is it perfect? NoIs it worth a wrestling fans time? Absolutely			"

												Overall. a much more improved game compared to the previous installments. I enjoyed the MYCAREER mode but somehow, I miss the storyline elements that make the feature more in depth and fun instead of the current one. Nonetheless, the game mode is alright.My only problems are that for the first few years in NXT, it becomes really a hassle and repetitive to keep fighting in matches that are of no significance to the storyline (for example WWE Superstars) and how tremendously long it takes to get to the main roster. For the WWE UNIVERSE mode, also known as a sandbox style mode, I enjoy making my own franchises and matchups but once again, feud storylines and cutscenes are repetitive and bringing back to old style of storyline rivalries in MYGM mode back in its glorious SvR days can make things much more interesting ( for example, make a handicap 3 on 1 rivalry with proper storyline cutscenes).Another problem I have with WWE games since WWE SvR2008. PLEASE BRING BACK GENERAL MANAGER MODE!Especially now with the roster brand split, bringing back the GM Mode will make more sense. I still remember as a kid playing SvR on my PSP and spending HOURS and HOURS on that game mode, so imagine how I felt when it got removed after SvR2008. Furthermore, with the inclusion of WWE Universe, it made customisation available which expands the possibilities of a GM mode.The showcast mode was fine, brings back memories relived in video games (which essentially is what WWE tries to bring every year), the only thing that I did not like was how oriented this mode was towards WWE Legends. I understand the previous year they included WWE Rivalries Showcase and maybe this year they want a different approach. However, we know the COUNTLESS of rivalries in WWE and some barely showcased ever (Cena vs Edge my personal fav IMO) and give them a chance as well.Overall, a great game to pick up and play. I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this game if its on 75% off but for its current price, but if u plan to buy this game at full price, hopefully, don't be disappointed with what you get.			"

												Flawed... but okay...After last year's WWE 2K15, I was excited but cautiously optimistic to see a larger scale game coming to the PC... and while it looks great and has similiar requirements to last years version, there are some random slow down in game play moments that occur that once they happen basically requires a game relaunch, much in the same way the black ring of death last year. The 'Benchmark' tool is pretty much useless as fudging with the settings is how to find your computer's happy zone to run things steady,Anyway... I figure a patch similiar to what was given to last years edition would solve this these minor issues.That said, the roster is all there so no waiting a few weeks for the DLC like last year, there are some control commands that don't make sense to me (the new submission circle system is frustrating as all hell), and the manager on the outside causing distractions can get a bit old before they are eventually tossed from the ringside area.

												Laughably badI already owned this game on PS4, and once it went on sale on Steam I figured I'd give it another try.Do not expect any enjoyment during online play, the lag renders the game virtually unplayable.Creation suite is a joke, and takes twice as long as it should to load anything, and dont even try to get your face into the game first try.The gameplay itself on single player is okay, but nothing great, and is far less fluid than WWE games over 10 years old.There are visual glitches seemingly every match, and any time a wrestler is wearing a championship belt it seems to float around their body, genuinely pathetic looking for this series.My career mode is also a waste of time and the showcase mode is halted as soon as you face Bret ""I'll reverse everything"" Hart.Overall, this game really isn't up to much, it's fun in certain circumstances, but not because it's good.3/10			"

												It's pretty fun. Universe Mode in particular is a ton of fun with a bit of imagination (since using the Rivalries function will just basically give you the rivals fighting each other every week, and then again at the PPV). Booking things on your own will get you a ton more enjoyment out of it. Showcase is fun as well, depending on if you're into reliving the past or seeing/hearing about the past for the first time. MyCareer is kinda lame in my opinion. It reminds me of the Career Mode from like, SvR2009. Which was basically just a series of matches. Overall though, it's the most fun I've had with a wrestling game since No Mercy on the N64, so I highly recommend it.			"

												I really wanted to recommend this game to others & actually even with all the minor bugs/glitches such as long splash screen/loading time to even start the game, crashes during certain entrances (which I was actually able to fix with a few tweaks in Nvidia control panel) just to name a few, I was still going to recommend this game to others because after all there is bound to be some bugs/glitches with a game when initially released on a new platform & other then the few minor bugs/glitches I was having, the game itself as far as graphics etc is amazing plus the huge roster & the unbelievable community creations this year compared to last year is awesome (other then the 20 downloads per day limit which imo is just lame). But after what happened the past 2 days I can not recommend it now. First yesterday I get the error message when downloading caws that the file is damaged & can not be downloaded (This has happened since yesterday EVERY TIME I try downloading caws. On top of that now today all my save files some how are coming up as corrupt & I have lost every single 1 of my caws that I made as well as others that I had downloaded from the CC which still were working  as well as I lost my Career saved game. So basically over 140+ hours worth of progress in the game since release all gone (playing my career, Uni & uploading caws to the CC as well as downloading caws & I had to uninstall & am now reinstalling game & having to start all over again  which is complete crap!

One thing they could of done for mycareer is where you could make a diva character and wrestle all the divas. (FYI I dont watch WWE so yea) Another thing is make the wrestlers a bit harder overtime depending how many times you wrestle against them. I've been wrestling with the same like maybe 3 different wrestlers in a game year every other ppv I might wrestle like the rock or john cena.  Every so often the game crashes before a fight or after or w/e its very annoying.  The submission controls are stupid/laggy.  Sadly the only wrestling game I've played recently has been TNA and compairing this to that I recommend TNA in all catagories.

												At first the controls were a bit sketchy but takes some time to get used to i guess(i say that as a past player of THQs Smackdown vs Raw games). On the other hand, Some superstars dont even look like what they are like Edge barely resemmbles himself. He looks splotchy and weird. Anyways 2k16 has a pretty big roster of wrestlers and legends but its missing the ECW superstars like the Hardy Bros (personal favorite) and RvD (two i know off the bat). Like what happend ECW had some of the best stars in there. Overall once you get past the weird graphics and the occasional weird bugs and glitches its a pretty fun game.			"

If it says display settings does not show then see if your HDMI cord is plugged in to the dedicated graphics card on your CPU, worked for me. The game is all right, career mode is fun.

												Gr8 Game marred by controlsCons: 1. Stupid Controls spoil the game.... For eg: U cannot counter offences & submissions require u to rotate a stupid circle by pressing WASD & Space. 2. Could have added more Divas like China (only 1 who superplexed HHH), Cherolyn, etc. Stars like RVD, Curt Angle, Hardy Boyz also missing probably because they have gone to TNA I think.3. No option to skip interviews which seems like a drag in career mode.Pros: 1. Grt Graphics2. Huge Roster3. Career Mode is exciting.4. Lots of match options.5. Fully customisable. Create ur own show, arena, superstar or diva.6. Weight balancing means cruiser weight cannot lift heavy weights giants. But it needs some improvement though. "

												I've enjoyed playing this game for sure, but it's one helluva buggy mess with a TON of issues and no update since release. Graphics are almost identical to WWE15K, hardly any new match types, and a ton of new wrestlers which is pretty much the only plus.Many of the characters, models, entrances, commentary, etc is pretty much cut/paste from last year.Entrance music that keeps playing throughout the fight, belts not appearing properly on superstars, crashes (ohmygod, the crashes), glitching through ropes, eliination chamber pretty much unplayable due to graphical glitches. Counter/grapling bugs, bugs, and about an elephant s*** ton more bugs that I don't have time to type/think of now.The create a show/arena is also a big plus, but with so many issues it's a real pain in the behind to play at times, losing titles left and right due to unresponsive gameplay. God...Anyway, it's alright, but I do regret uninstalling my WWE15K game for this one, it's pretty much exactly the same thing with more superstars, dl slots and create a show/arena which is pretty cool. Oh, and DIVAS, a lot of cool ones to download.But, as much as I hate to leave bad reviews, and as much as I love wrestling games and want to support it, I won't support a buggy mess with no intention of being updated anytime soon. F*** that.Buy WWE15K or wait for a 60%+ sale.PC specs, 16gb ram, GTX970, some MSI gaming motherboard, Win 10, blah blah... Not a cheap one let's just say that.			"

The GoodActual match gameplay is kind of fun, submissions are interesting for onceLarge roster Graphics look decentThe BadMatches will get repetive quickly Limited CAW (when compared to some past games)Career mode is also painfully repetive The Ugly Game crashes all the time. Especailly during wrestler entrances and extra especailly during CAW entrances which, for me, is the main reason I play. Without the entrances, most of the storyline stuff in Universe mode becomes just a quick pop up screen since most of the animated action takes place during the entrances. Bugs, glitches, and no custom music... "

												Contrary to what some are saying about performance, I can confirm that you can absolutely melt your GPU off with insane frame count if you're running a higher end system.The game runs fabulous for me but I keep V Sync on to stop 3452 fps coil whine from getting out of control.Pros to this years offering?Improved CAW, though masks and facepaint still leave a lot to be desired.Slightly better visuals than last year on PC.It's a Triple A wrestling game on PC!!!Game mechanics are improved over the b.s. that was 2k15 (even though I liked that title too)Cons?the CAW voice can not be changed and the voiceovers and dialogue leave a LOT to be desired.Rivalries, while pretty cool, are super repetitive especially in the early stages of your career.It takes literally for ever to get to main event status (at least in my experience thus far).Overall the game is really well designed in my opinion, and being able to download smarky ♥♥♥♥ from the 2k creations hub thing is great for any fan of the actual business itself. You can also download and run some pretty well put together CAW's from the hub who look like new WWE additions, or some other indie faves or past wrestlers who did not make it in.If you've got the cash now go for it. I picked up 2k15 last year for $13.99 but had no trouble getting this years offering on release day for PC at full price.  "

												Overall. a much more improved game compared to the previous installments. I enjoyed the MYCAREER mode but somehow, I miss the storyline elements that make the feature more in depth and fun instead of the current one. Nonetheless, the game mode is alright.My only problems are that for the first few years in NXT, it becomes really a hassle and repetitive to keep fighting in matches that are of no significance to the storyline (for example WWE Superstars) and how tremendously long it takes to get to the main roster. For the WWE UNIVERSE mode, also known as a sandbox style mode, I enjoy making my own franchises and matchups but once again, feud storylines and cutscenes are repetitive and bringing back to old style of storyline rivalries in MYGM mode back in its glorious SvR days can make things much more interesting ( for example, make a handicap 3 on 1 rivalry with proper storyline cutscenes).Another problem I have with WWE games since WWE SvR2008. PLEASE BRING BACK GENERAL MANAGER MODE!Especially now with the roster brand split, bringing back the GM Mode will make more sense. I still remember as a kid playing SvR on my PSP and spending HOURS and HOURS on that game mode, so imagine how I felt when it got removed after SvR2008. Furthermore, with the inclusion of WWE Universe, it made customisation available which expands the possibilities of a GM mode.The showcast mode was fine, brings back memories relived in video games (which essentially is what WWE tries to bring every year), the only thing that I did not like was how oriented this mode was towards WWE Legends. I understand the previous year they included WWE Rivalries Showcase and maybe this year they want a different approach. However, we know the COUNTLESS of rivalries in WWE and some barely showcased ever (Cena vs Edge my personal fav IMO) and give them a chance as well.Overall, a great game to pick up and play. I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this game if its on 75% off but for its current price, but if u plan to buy this game at full price, hopefully, don't be disappointed with what you get.			"

												Was hoping to have some fun reliving my PS2 smackdown games. All this game does is test your reflexes to see if you can hit the reversal quickly enough. But if you do it too well, then you run out and can't do anymore. How's that make sense? And pray you don't get in a submission, even with an XBox 1 controller it's impossible.Health doesn't really matter, stamina doesn't really matter, hell, even specials don't really seem to matter, the match will end...eventually.Load times are unbearably long, even with an SSD.The graphics are about the same, though, so there's that.

												It would be great really it would be. But I would much rather play 2k15 over this. Yeah, that POS! Once you start to import content it irreversably corrupts your game. It takes me nearly 3 hours to create a ♥♥♥♥ing character because it constantly crashes. I have to save every single time I make even a minute change to the character and even then it constantly crashes ESPECIALLY AT THE MENU SCREEN!!!!!!!!! If you never use custom content, buy it! More power to you. For those of us that consider personalization a critical part of the gaming experience I'd wait until they actually bother to fix this ♥♥♥♥.

												Gameplay is smooth (The majority of times, there are points where wrestlers teleports up on their feet after laying down), interaction with objects ingame is well made (god, I love spearing people through the chamber glass in Elimination Chamber matches), many little details can be seen and the crowd chanting is more clear than in former games. Arena and show creations!? Sign me up for that!Sadly... I think because of the Arena and Show creations, there is so little customization with created characters in the clothing. Here's hoping they update that in the future.And the submission minigame... I don't want to talk about that since I probably just have to practise it.And more different music please...Good game though.			"

PROSThe gameplay has been improved. It's more fluid and less sluggish.The roster is packed. They even threw Mikey Whipwreck in there.The 2K Showcase this year chronicles Stone Cold Steve Austin's career from WCW to ECW to the WWE.Once again, 2K Showcase tickles my nostalgia bone.Ladder matches are back.Reversals seem a bit less rage-inducing this time around.CONSMini-games. Everything turns into either a mini-game or QTE.Unreasonable limitations. For example, I can't play a six-man Elimination Chamber match unless I select the Elimination Chamber arena. Uh, why? No CM Punk or Hulk Hogan. This isn't 2K's fault however.Lack of attention to detail in ring entrances. Sometimes a wrestler makes his entrance at a certain point in the theme music (see: Kane).OMG! Moments.Although reversals are a bit less rage-inducing this time around, they're still very tedious. I recommend disabling the reversal limit they introduced for this one.I recommend this game as an upgrade to 2K15.			"

												This game is a huge step up from wwe 2k15, the action feels fluid and the gameplay feels more like the near unbeatable fire pro wrestling series than an arcadey brawler like the old games, that’s not say that this game is complicated as the controls are streamlined and work the. AI actually gives you a fun and entertaining match ala fire pro(not on that level but getting there) the graphics are very pleasing to the eye, in most cases the wrestlers look like there real life counterparts, the creation suite is almost back to it's former glory, your caws this year look unique and don’t just look like the same random jobber with a costume change, create an arena is back in this years installment and not a lot has changed, you can create a cool area however it does at time feel limited, career mode is back as well and is still a slog but is also somewhat enjoyable in small doses, universe mode remains pretty much unchanged which is sad as it is one mode that gives the game replayability all in all I’d give wwe 2k16 a 7 out of ten an enjoyable yet flawed experience that should tide you over till the next installment			"
