Early Access Review
								According to Steam I've spent 11 hours with the game so and I think I've gotten a good enough feel for the game to post my (still early) thoughts.First of all - this game is fantastic.  In general, I'm blown away by how well it is done even in it's very early state.  As best I can tell, there's no detail that the dev team hasn't already thought about and most of these are already implemented into the game.  I think this is a game change and it fills a void for sim lovers who either don't have the space or the desire to do a full simulator setup.  Unfortunately this has likely ruined 2D golf for me.  I'm sure I'll still play 2D titles but this has far exceeded my expectations.The game was just recently updated to include ""sticky clubs"" so that you no longer have to hold the trigger in order to hold the club in your hand.  So my thoughts below will be based on this new update since it has improved several things that were causing me some minor issues before.Graphically - I guess it's better than expected given all the warnings I received about how VR graphics aren't great at the moment.  I think there's still some optimization to do but the fact that it's so immersive kinda overcomes any shortfalls on graphical fidelity.  This isn't an HBS issue though - it's more of the current state of this newer technology.Immersion - this is where it's at with this game.  I can't say enough great things about it.  From the watch (which tells you the direction to the pin, wind direction, distance to the pin, stroke count, etc) to the course map in your back pocket to the golf bag it's just SO immersive.  A few cool things here:1 - stepping over to your bag to grab your club is awesome.  There's just something cool about this that never gets old.2 - when you find yourself at the bottom of a hill and you need to see what's up ahead so you can plan your shot, you just teleport ahead (or walk if it's a short enough distance) and take a look around.  Pick out a reference point in the distance as your aiming point, go back to your ball and take your shot.  Very realistic and very well implemented.3 - hills, slopes, etc all work as expected.  If the ball is above my feet I have to adjust my swing both in terms of aim and in terms of club length.4 - overall depth perception and changes in elevation are great.5 - reaching into your bag for a ball when you need to take a drop.  Awesome.  They could've just made this a menu item but I'm glad they went the route that they did.6 - gridless putting is WAY better than you'd think and better than anything in TGC or JNPG.  More on this later.The swing.  The bad news on the swing is that it DOES require some adjustment from your normal real life golf swing.  I'm 98% certain that this is due to the total lack of weight (and proper distribution of weight in particular) when using the controller as your ""club.""  If you've played a lot of golf in real life then it will be an adjustment.  For some it seems to be a pretty wild adjustment and for others not so much.  If you don't play much real life golf then it probably won't matter.  I will say that with the latest update where you are no longer required to hold the trigger to hold your club, it makes for a MUCH more natural swing and has alleviated most of my issues with the swing interface.  Prior to this update I had to address the ball with a massively closed club face in order to ensure that my club face was square on impact.  Now I do not have to do this.  I also had to address the ball with the ball lined up on the toe of the club in order to hit it in the center of the club on my downswing.  This is no longer required.  I think now that I can hold the controller with a normal golf grip things are falling more into line with my normal swing.The act of swinging the club in this game is fantastic!!  Just like in real life I know when I hit a bad shot without even looking at the result.  And just like in real life I have to concentrate to execute a good shot.  I've also learned that, just like in real life, if I take a practice swing (even a shortened version to ensure that my takeaway motion and follow through motions are clean) that I have much better success.  In other words - this is NOT some hokey arcade VR swing.  It's a true swing and it tracks VERY accurately.There is no shot shaper.  You ARE the shot shaper and it works wonderfully.  I can hit any sort of shot that I can hit in real life.  Short game - awesome.  Can't say enough good things here.  From off the green I can use my 7 iron to hit a bump and run or I can use my lob wedge or sand wedge to chip the ball.  On Casual mode (next to easiest difficulty) there is a power boost that's built into the game (this reduces in amateur mode and it goes away all together on Pro mode) and it will be obvious if you try to bump and run with a 7 iron.  But the mechanics are there and it's done VERY well.  The only issue currently is that there is too much spin on the lob wedge.  They know this and are fixing it.  But I can either close the face down a bit and hit a sharp little pitch at the pin or I can open up the face a bit and hit a loftier shot that carries further but bites harder.Putting - awesome.  I think they have NAILED putting.  It can feel odd to putt with little to no weight and this can also cause your club head to move around a bit more (harder to control a straight motion) but once you get used to it, it's awesome.  But where putting REALLY shines is when you turn the grids off.  Holy moly!  The greens are every bit as readable as they are in real life.  I simply teleport to about 3-4 feet behind my ball, crouch down and start reading the greens.  Then, while still squatting down, I teleport up a little to read other areas as needed.  I plan my putt, teleport back to the ball and execute.  And, for me... it's spot on, dead accurate.  Playing without grids in TGC VR is the most immersive thing I've ever experience in a video game.  Drain a 20 footer for par (or better) and you'll be fist pumping like a mofo.Things that aren't so great.1 - Fairway bunkers.  EVERY single time you land in a fairway bunker you are penalized by roughly 50%.  So the best you can do is blast out into the fairway and drop a shot.  The devs are aware and are addressing this.2 - Graphics but this isn't an HBS issue as much as it is a limitation of the hardware.  Although I think there is still some optimization left to be done and I know they are looking into this constantly.3 - The setup.  VR with today's technology simply requires you to jump through a few hoops.  You've got to get your base stations mounted, you've got this huge contraption on your head with a long bundle of chords leading to your PC, etc.  It takes me about 5 minutes to setup and about 5 minutes to clean up afterwards.  With 2D golf, I just grab my controller and take off - no real setup time at all.Things that have blown me away:1 - The dev interaction on the steam forums.  Superb and professional2 - The immersion of the game and the attention to details by the dev team in producing this product3 - Putting and short game accuracy4 - Game interface.  It could've been clunky and awkward.  Nope.  Everything flows and before you hit your 3rd hole of your first ever round you'll be comfortably navigating around without giving it a second thought.5 - The difficulty and the clear fact that this is a sim and not an arcade game.  I haven't broken 90 yet and I'm still on casual level.  I'm a 13 handicap IRL.  Some may say that the game is harder than real life and in some aspects it's true but the more I play the better I'm getting and I expect to see more parity between my real life golf scores and TGC VR scores over time.In general - I couldn't be more pleased.  This is probably the single best video game experience I've ever had and it's just the beginning.  BUY THIS GAME!!			"

								This is a must buy for anyone who plays golf. Had many holy **** moments, feeling like I was on a course. Even bent my knees in anguish on a few missed putts. Super imersive and the locomotion system is crisp and very functional. I love racing my shot to the green, then watching it drop from the sky with some backspin. Nice.The amount of time the ball is in the air makes it feel like you crushed the shot, and often you do. Controling your aim and your distance are very challenging but that's good. You want there to be room for improvement and tweaks to your technique. I tried one-handed and two-handed grips. Each seems to have their place. One-handed on full shots, two handed on chips and putts. Would love to see how people grip their controller and would love to see a some small club accessories that hold the Vive controller. For the devs: Great work, thank you. Here are a few of my wishes:-Driving range, chipping green and putting green so you can learn your distances and practice different swing styles.-A line on the putter head. Would help with alignment.-A camera option that teleports you to the spot where your ball will end up. Watching a shot land never gets old.-Save game feature. Don't always have time for 18.-Online, computer opponent, etc.  Not the highest priority but expected eventually. -Option to not have to hold the trigger while you swing. It got tiresome and limited the ways I could grip the controller.-Show shot distance after each shot, maybe on yardage book, so you can learn your distances better.  Looking forward to the updates. Keep up the great work!   "

								I really like this game, I'm not a golf player but I'm always enjoying these kind of games with gamepad and now I can play a real golf match in VR. The ambience, graphics, ball physics, etc,... are really good, but I have a complaint about the performance of the game. I have a Pc with an i7 6700, GTX 1080 and 16Gb Ram and I can not set the visual graphics in high. If I put the visual graphics in medium sometimes the game starts to judder then I have to change the visual settings to Low. Please devs improve the performance of the game. Another thing is that the player has not any visual help, if you try to find where the green is, the player needs to check the map or teleport around the field, for skilled players this is very good, but for noob players like me, this makes the game be a bit too hard. The same with the clubs, I don't know the average yardage with any of them, then as a sugestion for CASUAL mode, help the noob players with more info please.			"

								This game is a great start, but has some room to improve:Pros:- Imersive environment- decent physics (ball distance is short)- realistic golf feel- putting is very nice- huge growth potentialCons:- must hold trigger to hold club - makes for akward grip- graphics performance is poor (1060, 16gb, i7)- shot distance is about 50% of real life. - accidental ball hits at adress (need on your honor muligans)- no multiplayer support- bag is easily knocked overSuggestions for added features:- multiplayer- various club sets to include hybrids, different putters, etc. - more detailed swing analysis- add driving range and practice area- enter actual club length and player height - a golf cart would actually be really cool!If there was a way to integrate this into a launch monitor like the GC2, Trackman, SkyTrak, etc then the ball flight physics would be improved and this could be more of a simulator quality. adding some hardware options for clubs would be great to increase the feel of the game. All in all this is a great start and I look forward to the growth of this game. Great job Devs!!!			"

								Based on what I see so far, I believe this game has a lot of potential. I’m about a 5 IRL, and I think while visually impressive, the games feel isn’t quite right. The distance off the clubs is all wrong relative to what I see IRL. I get that it’s hard to make the touchy stuff right, but the feel on the greens is wrong. I’ve played on a fair number of tour courses and to be honest the greens in this game are faster than anything I’ve ever seen.  Still, it looks great. I can run the game effectively on Medium Detail with a 1070, and it looks even better maxxed out, but I get the judder some others have mentioned. Hopefully there are some improvements in the efficiency department, but if not it still is very playable. As a video game it’s pretty darn good, but I think they should bring a club pro, or two, onboard to work with the feel of the game. It’s still early in the development of the game, so I believe this stuff will eventually get worked out. One thing I’d like to see is a driving range to work out the distance the clubs are going to go in the game. It’s tough to understand how on the course I hit a driver an average of 100 yards more than can find in this game. Maybe give us the ability to set the club yardages, so we can play how we play.			"

												GOLFVR just left beta and I have to say its pretty amazing. I played live with a friend from Ottawa yesterday 18 holes for 2 hours, Shot a 105! it felt like I was playing on a real course, all I needed was a beer in my hand to sip every 5 shots. GOLFVR has over 130,000 courses and a few from Manitoba too. For $32CAN buckaroos, its an amazing achievement. I am going to open up my VR studio next week to anyone here in Winnipeg who wants to come by and check it out for free. Golfing has never been so much fun! 10/10 Golf Balls.			"

								Great experience so far! The graphics are good for VR, I got a 980Ti and use Medium to get stable 45fps retroprojection framerate. I am sure it will improve over time.I play golf in real life too and I have to say the physics is pretty cool at the moment. My biggest complain is the need to keep the grip button pressed to hit the ball. This is a very poor choice in my opinion as it brings alot of tension in your fingers.I struggle to make powerful shots so far, I just hit a 200 yards drive compared to what I can hit in real life (around 250 yards, I play stiff Titleist irons). The feeling to ""be there"" on the course is very cool!!Now, we just need multiplayer in real time like Pool Nation VR does and it will be a great social experience for sure!So far, this looks promising... let's give these guys a chance :)To summ it up:PROS:-Immersion and the ""be on the course"" feeling-The bag where you can pick your clubs up-Physics seems on the good rails-Seems like we will get a huge library of courses to play onCONS:-No ""social"" multiplayer planned ?! Really ?!-Keeping the grip button pressed to swing is plain horrible-Quite hard to hit powerful shots (I might get used to it)-Bag is too close when you teleport to the ball, I feel like I don't have enough space to hit my ball :)-Performance which will improve I hope			"

								Oculus Rift Review:Pros:   - The closest thing to real golf that I have ever experienced in a video game.- Interface is smart and unobtrusive.  Pull the course map out of your back pocket, look at your wrist to see distance to hole, elevation change, wind direction.- Simulation feel:  Feels like the PC version of The Golf Club only now in virtual reality.  My first couple holes I was swinging very hard and robotic( a problem I have in real life golf) and my shots were all over the place.  Once I slowed down my tempo and started a relax swing I started getting closer to par.- Sinking a ten foot put in the game is just as satisfying as in real life.  -  Really fun to play if you like real life golf.Cons:- performance is a little bad on a 970, but there are so many technologies implemented and cross talking that I am not sure who to blame.  It is hard to judge how all the different technologies will work together, between OculusSDK, ASW, ATW, OpenVR, SteamVR, SteamVR reprojection there are bound to be some issues.  It is playable but it gets a little choppy.- a few minor bugs:  Sometimes the drop zone is too close to the water.  Sometimes the ball is too close to an obstruction to get a swing off(might be user error).  The map bugged after the 6 hole, every hole after that only showed the 6th hole map.- Controls work pretty well but could use some optimization for the rift.  Specifically the button that selects.  In the rift the capacitive button that is mapped to ""select"" picks up a button touch when it should probably only pick up a button push.Overall:If you have a Rift of Vive and like golf, this is a must buy.

								***Oculus Rift / Oculus Touch***This is my first review ever. I'll make it short and sweet....Takes a little getting used to, but man is it compelling. I played a round of real golf earlier today, and although its not true to life golf, it's the next best thing. The Oculus Touch controllers are a litte wonky, due to it being otpimized for Vive, but it's not horrible. The menus and the sensitivity of the buttons on the Touch controllers take some finess. You also have to swing much harder than in real golf. I can drive 280-315 yards IRL, but in game I have to swing my♥♥♥♥♥off to hit 250. Putting and chipping feels satisifying.Can't wait to get more practice.... This will be a daily game for me.P.S. If you are an Oculus user and a golf lover, don't be afraid to pick up this title. I just hope the devs focus on some Rift optimizations.			"

												I play a bit of golf in my spare time and thought I would purchase this game as a way to still play a round or two when the British weather is not so good, which it is a lot of the time.What I didn't bank on was that this game so accurately depicts your swing that it can be used as a training aid for the real game. My real game isn't the greatest, in fact I cannot use drivers or woods because I always hook or slice the ball quite badly. Using the shot analysis in game, I found that my back swing and transition into the forward swing was much too fast and I was losing the club quite a lot resulting in my hooks and slices.I slowed down my back swing considerably and BINGO, I was hitting those drivers down the middle of the fairway.Now, I havn't has a chance to practice the slower backswing on a real golf course yet but when I do I will let you know if it has solved my problem.

								Shaping up to be THE VR golf game. Already extremely playable with a handful of courses and even some putt-putt. Overall the swing mechanics feel good and the game can be just as gut-wrenching and frustrating as playing a real round of golf. Really goes a long way in making good shots feel rewarding instead of just...par for the course.Visually it's a good looking game. That being said I think they need to put in some serious time improving overall performance. As it stands on a 980ti you are going to be playing on the lowest settings to consistently hit 90 frames. Good news is the game still looks reasonably good at that setting. Assuming the developers can continue to improve upon the basic functions and performance as well as delivering new courses...I foresee playing this game well into the future.			"

								This is a really good attempt at a golf sim, if you don't like golf you may not like this game.  If you like golf I see no reason why you would not.  I'm a poor golfer in real life (happy with <100) and it turns out im really bad in VR too, but here I can throw my clubs around and swear without getting disapproving looks!   The game is challenging and requires practice to get better, just like the real thing.  Only thing missing is the 19th hole!Devs are active the community hub and listen to feedback.  I think this game has a great futureWARNING ON SPACE: This is the first game I have been fearful for my monitor and I would suspect the game could be very frustrating if you don't have much space.  I have 2.5x2.5 meters and feel im right on the limit of picking a club from the bag, addressing the ball and hitting it.  You could teleport to the bag/pick up club/teleport back if you dont have enough room			"

								Absolutely incredible. This game is incredibly polished and very well done, with one of the most thorough and helpful tutorials I've ever seen in a VR game.Optimization needs HUGE work. I'm playing on an i7-4930k and GTX 1080 and even going to medium settings will be sacrificing fluid gameplay and framerates. A real shame, becuase high settings look great despite the fact that almost no computer can run it stable right now.The recent update with ghost balls has basically made this multiplayer. You can see your friends ball moving around the map as well as their score, all that's missing is an avatar to represent them as a player.The maps look incredible, but we definitely need a better variety in difficulty levels. I have yet to see a map that's not labeled as ""Hardest Difficulty"". I highly doubt I'm not the only player who can't play worth a damn and ends every course with scores +50 above par. A more straightforward selection of beginner courses would be great for easing into it.Also wouldn't mind perhaps an eventual tutorial or ""trainer"" to teach you posture and how to swing and aim and respond to wind and such. Also, a tutorial to teach you the difference between the different clubs would be great. Just because I know how to hit a ball with a club doesn't mean I know what the different numbers and angles do!tl;dr - Presence is fantastic, simulation is incredible, performance/optimization needs vast improvement, it's basically got multiplayer, learning curve is very steep.

								First review I have ever written because it is much deserved. This game is hands down the best VR game I have played, with Audioshield currently in second. If you are a golf fan like I am, you would absolutely love this and play it for hours and hours. I will admit, I struggled at first to make solid contact with the ball (as have my friends that have played), but once you get the hang of it you will find that you cannot stop playing.The big con on here, however, is green speeds. The greens are just insanely fast on this game for some reason. Approach shots, chipping, and putting can be very frustrating. A perfect approach shot that lands on the front of the green will manage to roll all the way off the back end of the green. The difference in speed from the fringe and green is also unbalanced. Normally, putting from the fringe is the common route in real life. However, I've found that chipping with a loft wedge from the fringe (which most would never do in real life) is the best way to go in this. With that said though, those are the only cons I've experienced in this game. The developers are great on updating the game and improving it. So hopefully green speeds (which I can't imagine being difficult to change) will be reduced at some point. I definitely would recommend this game to VR players, especially golf fans!			"

								Wow.  I'm super impressed with how accurately this game reminds me of how terrible I am at golf.  I have a natural fade that tends to bite me in the♥♥♥♥♥and oh yeah, it's there.  I can hit solid irons and that's pretty much on par, then I 3 putt for a double bogey or worse.  This game demonstrates all of my short comings in frightening realism.  I've played 18 holes twice, both a little rushed as I had other things to do, but this is an undeniably impressive experience so far.  It's super satisfying to finally hit a decent drive or sink a long putt, just like the rare occasions I do so IRL.  I also get to beat the %$# out of the bag and throw my clubs after I shank a shot just like IRL too.  If you have any interest in the game of golf, you have to at least give it a whirl.  It's not the real thing, but it's a heck of a lot closer than I ever expected it to be, even in EA.  The one gripe is the performance.  I have a beefy system with a core i7, 16gb ram, and a gtx1080 and can't bump up from the lowest settings without stutter.  When it comes to graphics it's closer to Euro Truck Simulator than Elite Dangerous so its a tad frustrating to have such performance issues but it's so damn fun to play it's easy to look passed it.  Excuse me while I go hit another 119.			"

								This is really a great game.  I am not a real golfer, so I cannot attest to the realism of the simulation.  But I've been interested in trying out a real golf game in VR, and this one doesn't disappoint.  My only suggestion to the developers would be to add an instructor that can offer tips, suggest which club to use, and help you with your swing.  It is frustrating for somebody who knows nothing about the game to try to pick it up without any assistance.			"

								While it is already exceptional, there is certainly room for additional features.   Driving range would be a great additon. Overall,  a great VR experience which is far more compelling than mini-golf games and with much more replay value.  Better than VR ping-pong.  Better than VR pool.  Great relaxing game when your are sick of getting rolled in FPS.    Skill level requirement feels about right- improving scores can be achieved with each round.  Very Satisfying.  "

												I've had a Vive since they began shipping and while the VR experience in general is undoubtedly something new and very unique, it has been very difficult to find games that are not a 30 minute and done experience.This game hits the balance of fun vs realism nearly perfectly and is so good I am taking the time to write a review for it which is very rare for me to do on any game.PROS:-Overall feel is excellent-Simple controls that allow you to focus on the round of golf-club and ball characteristics are way more realistic than I ever thought possible at this early stage of VR.-FUN!  It is enjoyable like real golf, it is frustrating like real golf and it is replayable.-Courses are nearly infinite and there are so many good ones from user created that you cannot get bored.-Sound is exceptional-Developers care and reply to messages in discussion and reviews to help make the experience better. WISHLIST: -Of course having something that feels more like a club in your hand would be amazing...the Vive handset is a little to thick to make a normal 2 handed swing so you need to do 1 handed.  With that being said, the devs did a phenomenal job of taking what is available and making it as good as possible.-commentary could have been fun-ability to create own courses-ability to set some targets on the range (distance, bullseyes, etc...)-ability to change out the 3i and 4i in favor of hybrids-ability to change the putter style.  The traditional blade has always stunk for me in real life and is true to form here!Honestly, I can't call anything a true con, just the wishlist above.If you are a golfer this is a SLAM DUNK, CLICK BUY RIGHT NOW type of game.

But this is a must buy game for any golf fan, arcade or otherwise.Just buy it, and suck at golf like me.Bonus points: I get to drink a few while playing in any weather, in the comfort of my own home.  May be better than real golf. Just maybe.Negative Points:  Really could use a practice range or driving range. (At the time of this review)Pro-Tip: Turn on sticky clubs in the menu.  Helps when holding the club to simulate a better grip.			"

								I love it! I bought it on sale and had to refund it due to my headset breaking before getting to try it. I bought it at full price now and I am loving it! Well worth the price. Especially if you played the tiger woods games on Wii back in the day. I loved those games and this within VR makes it even better. It is the golf game I was hoping would come out since first trying the VIVE. There are 3 different difficulty teirs. I shot 10-20 over par on the easiest one, so i would say its pretty realistic. I am that bad in RL but love playing nevertheless. Thanks for the VR love Devs! I look forward to see what else is coming up!			"

								By far the best VR golf option available as of today. This has plenty of room for additional features to add immersion (carts please!!! with ball tracker so you can drive and easily find it). Needs performance improvements but when you use Async Reprojection with SteamVR beta it runs pretty well. You can add supersampling to see further clearly and reduce stuttering when looking around. After adjusting that to your system's capabilities it is a nice looking game and a much better experience. Only problem is even though that fixes visual stuttering of the background your club stutters when looking down and to get a reliable/smooth swing you have to use lower graphics settings. Once they get performance optimized and maybe give an option for the friction level of the green (way to glassy imo) I would say this is could soon be an A+ golf game. Right now I'd give it a B.

												There are a lot of great experiences to be had on the Vive, but the majority of them are so very short. The good news is that the mulitiple 18 hole courses on offer in Golf Club VR provide a fair amount of longevity.I am a very occasional golfer, but I am really enjoying the game. It's not perfect (the greens are very fast and the graphics could be optimised a little better) but the dev's are active, and it already looks very pretty even on low. It does take a little time to get used to swinging the clubs, getting the distance right when approaching the green, etc, but the same could be said of golf itself! I, for one, am finding the challenge of lowering my score rewarding.Edit: Great work on the full release. Still a little blurry in the distance, but I think that is more a limitation of the hardware. The game is a lot better optimised than when I initially reviewed it -- I am happily playing on 4xAA on high settings with 1.1 SS now.			"

								Most realistic experience in VR that I have come back to more than any other VR title.  Yes the limitations of current gen hardware dont make it feel like you are totally standing at a real golf course, but you somehow realise that the engine and game IS good enough to actually be able to do that if the hardware could better support it.  I really feel like this game could give you total immersion if these were cordless 4k headsets or something.  If you like golf in any way then this is a no brainer to have in your library.			"

								Almost a great game.  All the flaws in my real life game are back with a vengeance in VR.  The frustration of the real game is there but being able to teleport means you can spend more time striking balls and less time walking.  I am pretty confident mastering this would improve your real life game.So why only ""almost a great game"" then?   At present there are no practise options.  It gets a bit frustraring having to restart a new round just to take another practise swing.  Add a driving range that gives some guidance on improving your swing and this game has nailed it.  With that added it would take a pretty amazing game to knock this off top spot for VR golf simulation.			"

								Wow, I hadn't played this game since I purchased it a few months ago and coming back to it I am amazed at how much they've improved this game.This definitely feels like a triple A game. The game play, graphics, and overall feel of this game is top-notch. I would have paid $40 and still been happy.The only thing I would really like to see is a local player-versus-player option. Hopefully set up like Cloudlands where each player can finish the hole before switching the headset.Just teleporting around the landscape is tons of fun. They could probably build an RPG or FPS using the environment and it would be incredible.The physics and UI are also done very top notch. I'm not a golfer so setting it to easy mode is just like a premium arcade golf simulator. Setting it to a higher difficulty makes it much more realistic though. Anyway, if you are into VR and have a Vive, (not sure how well touch works with it), you owe it to yourself to pick up this game. You will not be disappointed.Oh, and it definitely takes advantage of high end systems and is very demanding. Even my 1080 will only run it on medium quality and 1.3 SS but it still looks beautiful at those settings.			"

												To say nothing of the stunning visuals and a sense of complete immersion, remarkable even for VR, a disturbing number of the things that happen to me on real courses are uncannily reproduced in this frustrating, challenging, but achingly addictive game. Topping, slicing, shanking, numerous air-hits, followed by that manic, overbalanced clubbing which so often results in one being corkscrewed into the ground. Oh, and let's not forget sand-fly fever, contracted from spending so much time in bunkers. It's all here, your lack of skill, indolent posture and flaky swing, all writ large, validated in code and preserved for posterity in your scorecard hall of shame...HOWEVER, in other news, what a game! What a bloody-minded, ♥♥♥♥♥rdly, haughty, flirty, discourteous fish-wife of a game. Those of you with the same dogged persistence and catalogue of ruined Sunday afternoons behind you will know what I mean. The course is there to be beaten of course, it never dangles too far out of reach, it merely requires a better class of player than you will ever be. But, on the right day, with the right club and sufficiently garish flannels, with that crushed drive soaring, arrow-straight, climbing, climbing, climbing into the azure sky... You are familiar, dear aspirant golfer, with the same trouser-tickle of achievement, the same dopamine hit that rivals any amount of luck at the roulette wheel. And, with the same unfailing regularity, the next spin will be a dud and the house wins. But this time it was different and - who knows? - next time may be different too.In other words, this is not a golfing simulacrum that permits one to attain, by a nurturing of benevolent algorithms and digital hand-holding, the handicap of your dreams. It *is* of course possible to choose the easy settings and take the shortcut to wish-fulfilment, but if you are one of those people who can do that and still look at yourself in the clubhouse mirror afterwards, by all means go for it. Be aware though that it will be implicitly understood by the rest of the golfing fraternity that you number among those few laughable, Quixotic golfing mountebanks who routinely drop zeros from their scorecards and kick Titleists from the undergrowth with nary a pang of conscience. Enjoy your victory, Pyrrhic as it may be...For the rest of us, keep the faith and understand the nature of the word 'addiction' in its truest sense, as your correspondent, at this very moment, prepares to slather deep heat on a pulled shoulder and cinch a lumbar support to its tightest setting in order to play another round. Pain is relative, while handicap is absolute. But one thing I know, when stepping up to the tee, full of codeine and misplaced optimism, this time, it's gonna be different... "

								If you're looking for a full on golf experience for the Vive look no further.  The swing mechanics feel good and the haptic feedback does what it can to simulate hitting the ball.   From what I can tell so far the physics are accurate.  I suck at this just as much as I suck in real life so that must be a good sign, right?  The issues I have are purely in performance during certain actions such as teleporting to the ball after hitting it halfway across the course or taking the map out of my pocket.  It tends to blink to the SteamVR loading screen during these instances.  Hopefully this can be worked out during early access.  One feature I'd like to see is a marker on the map indicating where you're standing as it's easy to get disoriented teleporting to the ball and turring around IRL.That being said it's already shaping up to be one of my favorite Vive experiences and I look forward to future updates.

Adjusting the visual settings to medium with 1.3 SS and using the latest beta release the swing speed has been much more relialbe and therefore a lot easier in selecting the right club.  I'm also better at putting, but this is probably due to getting used to the speed and swing mechanic of putting.  The game could definitely use a practice green though.

												If you like golf, here is a VR game that doesn't ever end or get boring. This game lets me play amongst palm trees in March in my Colorado basement in slippers and shirt sleeves. I have no idea if this is going to help my real life golf game, but it is a heck of a lot of fun.I found the mechanics of the game intuitive and simple to master. I love the swing evaluator, course selection, scenery, sounds and physics of the game. Chipping feels like chipping. The driver is hard to use because drivers are hard to use. I played 36 holes yesterday and am a little stiff this morning like I played 36 holes of golf yesterday. It just FEELS real.User submitted courses make the course selection awesome and full of rich, diverse places to play, each with their own weather conditions and challenges. I played one round in winter and I was given yellow golf balls for the snow to add to the realism.Multiplayer might make the game more fun for people who like to play in groups. A golf 'pro' to explain why my swing score was an 'F' on that last swing and of course a 'babe' in a beer cart might add value to the game.On high resolutions I found it best to restart my PC between 18 hole games to prevent graphics glitches and to ensure smooth gameplay in later games. I also found it best to have a play space where the paddles cannot be masked from the sensors by your body and where you have enough room for a real life, full golf swing.This gets two big thumbs up from me. I really only stopped playing long enough to type this. I'm going back to the Sunday Morning course (my favorite so far) and get in another round before breakfast.			"

												I sat on this until Oculus support was released for it, and I can say now that it was well worth the wait.  Having already played many hours in the original game The Golf Club, I knew what to expect - for the most part - but the VR aspect was exciting, particularly as an avid RL golfer myself.So far, the game hasn't disappointed at all.TL&DR - For a quick rundown, the VR game places just like (well, for the most part) the original non-VR TGC.  In addition, the game links up with the main TGC game as well, so all of the courses available in the original TGC you can find, and play, in TGCVR.  The immersion is really good, the gameplay is very good, and it's just all around fun.  What's more, like others have said below, if you play golf IRL, those skills do transfer over - and not just the good skills, but also the bad (I still... STILL... hook the ball off the tee with the driver...).In-Depth Review - For those of you who enjoy golf and have a Vive or Oculus, you simply cannot beat this.  To be able to play a round whenever you like without having to leave the house is great (naturally, however, I'd still prefer to be out playing IRL when possible - but this is such a close second).Graphics - the graphics for the Oculus are really good; I have mine cranked to maximum (2x normal) and it looks really smooth and plays great (I have a rig that can handle that however).Gameplay - I could get very detailed here, but I'm going to focus instead on the VR mechanics specifically.  The interface is a lot different from the original TGC... there is no ""hud,"" etc.  Most of the menu items are there, you just have to navigate to them differently.  When selecting a course to play, it's not quite as easy to find courses as in the original TGC, mostly because the menu doesn't show a ""list"" like the original - instead it shows a picture of the course and it's name (which means there's fewer courses in view).  You can search for a course just like normal, but it's a bit clunky as you use an in-game keypad to type your search criteria.  What I've done is simply favorite all the course I play that I like - easy to find them again.In regard to the standard ""hud"" information, like distance to the pin, the winds, elevation, etc., that can be found on your ""wristwatch.""  You simply hold up your wrist a turn it like you're looking at a watch and the data shows up.  In addition, once you've struck a ball, you can hold up your wrist and click the button on the handle of the Touch to see the distance your shot went - it even grades you on your shot (the grade consists of several factors - impact, distance, and the lie once the ball stops).  It will also show you the speed of your swing, which is nice (apparently my swings hover between the 72-78 mph range).If you hold down the handle button on the Touch while you swing, it will ""record"" your swing so you can turn and see a graphical indication of how the club head traveled on the takeaway all the way through to impact, and it will show you the angle and location of the club at impact as well.  This is really, really helpful, particularly to newer players.Picking clubs is actually rather cool.  To pick up a club, you simply teleport to your bag (or walk, if you're play area is big enough), reach into your bag, hold the Touch over the club you want, and click the trigger.  Options exist to allow you to have to hold the trigger to keep the club in your hand, or just press the trigger once to grab it, and later a second time to drop it.  As an amusing afterthought, you can hit the club bag with what ever club you have in your hand to knock it over, spilling your clubs everywhere if you're on a slope.Taking a shot is just like taking one IRL.  Address the ball, line up and aim, and swing.  The swing mechanics are very touchy, and if you don't swing correctly, you're ball will hook, slice, skip across the grass (if you top the ball), etc. - just like with real golf.After a shot, you use one of the Touch's buttons (B) to teleport to your ball (your clubs automatically follow you).  You can alternatively use A to teleport where ever you want (literally - you can't teleport into water though).  A note on the greens - again, if you have a play area that is big enough, you can walk completely around your putting area and look closely at the path to the cup... it really helps when putting.In addition, you can get a bird's eye view of the hole by reaching behind you in-game and grabbing the yardarge booklet, which will show you a top down view of the hole with yardage notations of 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 yards from the pin.  This is really handy, particularly with holes where the pin is obscured either by trees or a hill in the fairway - unlike TGC, there is no ""zoom"" feature that allows a flyover of the hole out to the distance of the selected club.All these mechanics work very good with the Oculus Touch; as I said above, it's a great experience and a lot of fun to play.Cons - The only cons are what other's have said - just a couple of which I'll reiterate here, touching specifically upon Oculus and the Oculus Touch.The first is the setup of your play area.  For me I had to set my default view 90 degrees to the left (my computer is on the right of my desk) because if I didn't the wire that connects the Oculus to the system got in the way every time I swung.  I don't know if this is the cause of my issues or not (in my case, it means one of my sensors is pointing at my right rear instead of in front of me).  But occasionally when I swing the club simply won't strike the ball - or, it'll strike it ""off"" - for example, occasionally my shots will shoot off about 20 degrees to the left, not with a hook, but straight and clean, as if I was aiming that direction.  To be clear, I don't know if this is a tracking issue or an issue with my setup - so keep that in mind.However, as another user has said, when using the Protee Simulator to practice your swings, the tracking itself does seem off.  I couldn't even get the driver to make contact with the ball... all the other clubs worked okay though, but still suffered occasionally from the same issue I described above.For Oculus users specifically, the Touch is a hit / miss when it comes to ""gripping the club.""  I imagine that Vive users have it better because the Vive controller is longer and it looks like the player can grip it at least somewhat like a club with both hands.  With the Oculus Touch, however, the controller is so small there is no room to grip it with your off-hand.  As a result I end up gripping my right wrist with my left hand (I'm right handed) - which I'm sure contributes some to my off shots.  If there was a controller add-on that could add some length to the Touch for this it would help a lot.Those things being said though, these are not game changers (unless you take your golf REALLY seriously), and annoyances at best in what is still an excellent, fun game.Overall, again, for anyone interested in golf that has a Vive or Oculus, you cannot go wrong with The Golf Club VR.

Brilliant idea!  Love it!Gives you the same frustrations of hitting a bad shot as in RLCONSSometimes it is hard to hit the ball if it is in a crevice or lip of a mound or something...Could do with a little better sound design...  to immerse the player in the VR environment a little better (More SFX or variation therof)only three courses so far, though it is only the first week and I am looking forward to more courses being available next week and into the future...No multiplayer..   I give this game 5 stars because sit is simply fantastic and by far my best sport sim experience I have ever had, but if I could wish for one thing, it would be the ability to join a lobby and play with other golfers.  The course feels hella lonely when your trying to play a solid round..  80% of golf is the socialization, and I think to really give the game the potential it deserves would be to bring in MP..Just my opinions...If you like golf, this game is a MUST have if you own the Vive...  and.. I believe the price is the best value out of any game yet on the Vive..Kudos Devs!Fanboy right here! <3			"

								So updated review from the official launch!to start, I was dabbling in this game the night I got home from some drinks downtown. I couldnt believe I was about to finally have my wish of vr realistic golf. from the start it was mind blowing. I was a little tipsy so I played off the extremely fast pga speed greens for my inebriation. Then poof, an update comes out that fixes the insane green speed almost a week later. Poof! an update comes out that gives you more customization of your club and the stiffness you prefer. (hmmm I wonder if they would take a request for some sort of zoom or distance increase to see the approach shot a little better, POOF A GOD DAMN RANGE FINDER! The support from the devs from day one to Feb 23rd was absolutely world class. they not only responded to almost every single question asked (if it hadnt already been answerd by one of us)but they addedrequested features sometimes almost bi weekly. I watched a very good start of a golf vr sim turn into a full fleged polished simulator in the matter of months, not years. along the way the devs have asked for feedback and even played rounds with you if the time was available. at first optimization was a little rough but it was such an ambitious game that I didnt bat an eye to it. at the time of this review, high end systems are basking in maxed out pure links heaven. My rig can run low with most sliders cranked up (msaa, AA) with no problem. this is the only game I own thats made me want to upgrade to a 1080 just to enjoy at full potential. If you are a golfer at all, and I mean putt-putt, casual, league, or rising star. you will have at least 40 to 50 hours worth of virtual ""safety at home"" golf that we all love but mostly cant really afford. thats for the leather puss's! HA! 11/10 would run the leaderboard again			"

								I made it through a few holes, and I can tell you this game is a lot of fun. I should say, it's fun in that it brings all the frustration I experience in real life golfing into my VR headset! It seems to be very realistic. I need more practice since it is tricky connecting with the ball in the beginning. The golf courses seem very realistic (down to wildlife, including ducks and deer). This is the first review I've done, and even though I've only played for a few minutes, I must say it's been one of the top VR games I've seen so far!			"

								Really looking forward to some updates on this game. A few  things really stand out, the yardages are soo off, 280yards with driver , but  300yds with a 3 wood? , 7 iron= 190yds!!...thats Rory country!. It would be nice if the user can eventually program in their own yardages for each club. I know the Devs want a truly immersive experience but a 'pin seeker' would be a massive help. I'm an experienced golfer and have got lost on the courses after a few wayward shots. A simple driving range would again be a great help to hone in your swing. Right now the only thing you can do is, during the tutorial ,is  dont 'advance' and keep hiting balls towards the island green (202 yards away and can be hit with a 6 iron??). I'm sure the improvements will come.Its a demanding game graphically if you want to run on High,but medium and even low are still enjoyable settings. Looking forward to some great courses as this game grows.			"

								ok, so less than 2 hrs practice with The Golf Club VR, I have the original Glof club and enjoyed it very much.BUT! WOW! Golf, in VR! and not an arcade game either. be warned, there are a few bugs but hey its still early access, and you have to accept that there are going to be ""issues"" to work out, a couple of examples:1: The greens are super fast. 2: the choice of club lengths seems a bit on the short side, I'm only 5""10 and the longest seem a little short (driver seems ok, the irons seem too short).3: some locations on certain courses leave you stranded and no way to get to your ball.all pretty satndard teething problems for early access.the gameplay is amazingly rewarding and fun when you get used to it. easily worth the money and it will only get better.

I really don't mind having to hold the button down to grip the club. It feels very realistic. The moment my golf bag tipped over went tumbling into the drink, I fell in love.It's only downfall that i really hope gets fixed? Performance.

								I have the PS4 version of The Golf Club so when I saw there was a VR version it was a no-brainer. It's a bit fiddly with the Oculus Touch and I did manage to figure most things out and once I did, I couldn't get over the immersion. Getting distance is a challenge with club speed but once you figure out the sweet spot it's a great ""Sim"" that any golf aficionado will truly love.10/10 would throw my clubs in the water hazard againEDIT: Feb 8, 2017 - someone figured out how to change the button callouts for Touch users in this latest update. I'm buying that guy a steak dinner. Previously, to line up at ball or move around you had to push a direction on joystick, then push the joystick in. The controller is pretty much worn out from this seemingly bizaar configuration and my thumb can't take any more. This update is money and a game changer as a Rift owner. I sobbed uncontrollably for several minutes.			"

								Remember this is a golf simulator. If you want an arcade friendly golf game, buy a golf game on console. If you want to feel a golf club and hit a ball into a screen, go to a sports bar. If you are nit picking the overall golf experience, go play the real thing.That being said....this game is amazing. I am a long time golf and video game patron and this is a great blend of both. I constantly remind myself that this is virtual reality and this is an early access game. So I'm not expecting all the bells and whistles, but am confident that when the developers fine tune everything needed...this will be the greatest golf simulation ever. So if you have the computer specs and the Vive, this better be one of the first things purchased. If it isn't, then you're not a fan of golf.			"

												It's a great experience to be on a golf course and suffer the same aggravations you do while playing golf in the really real world. That's how you know it's got something going for it.Seeing the trends in your swing is super cool, though...It's not a real club, it still lets you understand what you're doing through visual representation.Performance can be off at times, but there's options for that. Course selection is huge. This is a great sim.One thing I would like is a crowd watching with proper reactions, and the competition/tournament, pairs, multiplayer aspect ideal. Other than that, this is pretty effin cool! "

								  How well can a golf game be simulated in VR?  That was my primary concern when I was researching this game.  I had played Cloudland Mini Golf and found that at least when it comes to putting the use of the Vive controller is sufficiently convincing.  But how would that translate to a full golf swing without the use of a full club?  As it turns out quite well.  Granted the feel of the weight of the club isn't there but the mechanics of the swing are still the same.  It's extremely enjoyable to be able to play a round of golf without needing to leave my house and without the annoyance of searching for my ball every time it leaves the fairway.  This is especially useful during an Ohio winter when the cold makes golfing outside a bit miserable.  I'm very excited to see how the upcoming Vive Tracker adds to this experience.  Using an actual club will certainly enhance the experience.  The only problem I've run into so far is when I hit the ball off a cliff on the insanely challenging Pacific Jewel course.  The drop zone ended up being the side of a nearly vertical cliff face.  This left me in a bit of a dilemma as no matter where I dropped the ball it would simply fall into the water.  Without being able to figure out any other options I eventually had to abandon that game.  Perhaps a ""skip current hole"" option could be put in place for unpredictable occurrences such as that.

												Swing tracking in the the golf simulator room is borked. Every swing - whiff. On the courses, chipping seems to work well and the smaller woods and irons are pretty comfortable, but you have to swing *way* harder than in real life.Over all game is good, graphics, the feel of the courses, all pretty good. Found it hard to see the pin on a few - because the resolution on the Vive isn't fantastic for small distant objects. Worth a try if you're an avid golfer.			"

								The gameplay itself is very well done. Excellent tutorial, really polished system overall. I play golf regularly, and taking a swing in game felt so natural. The ball flew exactly as far as I suspected it to based on swing speed and club choice. I attempted a slight slice off the tee with great success. I knocked one into the sand and you really get that feel of having to put a little extra into it to chunk it out of there. Putting was nothing short of majestic, and the short game felt like the real thing. Being able to throw the clubs/bag is a nice touch because just like in real golf you'll constantly feel the need to chuck those things into the nearest lake. That being said, the only complaint that I have is the performance of the game. Since we're talking golf, my computer is more the John Daly of the PGA tour as opposed to Tiger Woods, however I've not experienced jutter or frame drops in any game/demo up to this point on my Vive.  Upon firing the game up for the first time the jutter was so bad it would have had lesser men seizing on the floor and vomiting blood. I promptly exited the game, and bumped the setting down to low, and still experienced a pretty significant amount of jutter. At this point it's pretty unplayable for me on my i5 6500 and GTX 1060 even on the low setting, so if you have specs similar to mine you may want to hold off till the frame rate gets lined out.Also as mentioned in some other reviews this is ""tailor made"" for multiplayer, and would be an amazing experience to get a group together and go out and play on the course.Overall if the performance is fixed, this is an absolute must have. Physics are spot on, and it's everything you'd want out of a golf game. It's a surreal feeling to swing in VR and see the ball go exactly as you wanted it, likewise knowing you absolutely duffed one and for that to be reflected as well. Solid 10/10 if the frame rate becomes playable with my setup.			"

												I'm a terrible golfer, and The Golf Club VR allows me to reproduce that ineptitude with incredible accuracy in my very own home. The future is a marvelous place.Actually, what's really nice is being able to see exactly why I'm a terrible golfer. After every shot, you can review and replay every element of your swing. It's made me aware of things I've been doing wrong for years and simply couldn't perceive out in the real world. On top of that, it's a fun experience with an excellent variety of VR-optimized holes.I have a couple of caveats, though. First, current-gen VR hardware doesn't have the resolution necessary for a realistic golf game. Unless you've really cranked the graphics settings, you can't even see the pin at a distance, let alone the contours of the green. Second, if you do want to boost the graphics to a reasonable level, you'd better have a heck of a lot of horsepower in your PC. The detailed visuals are lovely to look at, but your graphics card will pay dearly for them.Also, keep in mind that you spend half the game looking down and that VR headsets aren't liquidproof. In other words, don't play this while sweating. I was playing The Golf Club VR to cool down after an extended, active VR session, and fried my goggles. It's certainly not the fault of this game, but I'm hoping this warning will spare someone else the heartache of a $270.00 repair bill.			"

								Picked this up as the combination of vr and golf just seemed to be right. I have played golf games on PC and xbox with mouse swing and stick swing ( on controller ) but here as you would expect you get to stand badly, hold one vive controller and ""grip"" the stick by holding the trigger, then just like I have done in real life swing wildy at the ball, resulting in a complete miss or slice. For early access it seems quite solid no crashes so far, there is a good tutorial where you are taught the basics by ""a pro"" who chats you through the controls, you can then from the menu screen change settings for game play, graphics, sound etc. and select a course to play, the in-play info is neatly brought up either out of your back pocket, or from turning your wrist to look at your i-golf watch, when you hover over the clubs in your bag they show percentage chance and possible distance.I don't play golf anymore and didn't play much but this is; the only? and so the best so far and definitley not a dissapointment for me.

								I'm a real life golfer, and I was looking forward to this release with tons of anticipation. The verdict? It's fantastic. Sure, it has some things I'd like to see tweaked, but it's buy-worthy even at this early stage of development. It's fun, satisfying, and gives you a good sense of the balance between frustration and fun that makes golf such a great game.First of all, the sounds and haptic feedback are absolutely great. There are lots of little sounds I didn't even know I wanted in a golf VR game before now. The sounds of the grass as you skim it or pat it with your club are really immersive. The watch on your wrist and the distance book are well designed and actually very useful. The swing mechanics seem very accurate, and seem to reflect real life shot styles well. The putting feel is especially well done. I've done a few full rounds now, and my scores are pretty close to my scores in real life. Just put in a few minutes at the tutorial driving range first, and you'll get a good handle on the swing physics pretty quick.Honestly, the only negative in this game so far is the poor performance. I have a GTX1070 and I still have to play it on the lowest graphics setting, but I expect that to change as development continues.I simply cannot wait to play all 130,000+ courses. I'm going to play these 3 courses to death. So, hopefully those come soon. Great job guys.			"

								UPDATE: Dec 7I was wrong about golf not being suitable for VR. However looking down still makes the vive hang over a little which makes the vision blurry, there is no denying that, I pulled the straps as far as possible to the point where it really hurt my face and it still hung over.Sadly most of my other critique points are still valid as well. But let's get to the good stuff first.The devs keep updating the game ato improve it and you can see they're passionate about it, the swinging feels better for me now and I think I forgot that in my initial review but the tutorial is great. It's exactly the type of tutorial you need for games like this.The menu is also well designed and easy to navigate.The courses themselves are great but sadly the graphics are not on the same level..The performance is pretty bad for how the game looks period. There's no arguing there.Also with supersampling (In-game) set to 1 (standard) the aliasing is insanely noticable and very annoying, however truning it up to 1.3 or above makes it a lot better for only a small performance loss.Performance got better but is still not good enough for the visual quality.Also there are a couple reoccuring bugs that impact gameplay a little.In conclusion I would recommend the game to people who enjoy golfing or are interested in it.If you don't really care about the unlit environment then I imagine you'll enjoy these courses.If you just want to casually do some mini golf then this game is not for you.____________________Initial review: This isn't about the game in particular but I think Golf is just not suitable for this generation of VR. In this sport you have to look at the ball when swinging to get it right but with the way the fresnel lenses work the vision is way too blurry when looking down.Maybe this will be good for people with that welding mask mod or something similar but I wouldn't recommend this for anyone with the stock Vive head straps.Also I've never played golf but I doubt that the curves the ball flies on very strong hits are correct.The graphics are standard, water is pretty cool and I really enjoyed the grass but otherwise the game looks pretty plain and boring. The performance is horrible, I'm getting close to reprojection with several dips below 90 on medium with a 980ti.			"

However, you should still add adjustable yardages to the clubs because i'd like to practice hitting the ball like i'd hit it in real life. Please.			"

								This is a great game. I am having no frame rate problems running a GTX 1080 and i7 4790. I suck at Golf here, as in real life, so it's very realistic. The only problem I am having is, sometimes I can't hit the ball. It is really frustrating. Not sure why. It's just un-hittable, if that's a word. Any advice would be appreciated. Others aren't having this problem.			"

												Ok, I'm actually better at gold in real life that in this game, and that's a first but this is still the best VR golf game available and for that you get a thumbs up. It's always a little diffcult to look down at anything with a VR headset unless you strap it extra tight but that's an issue with any game where you need to look down often. Nice looking game, good feel, pretty accurate with the swing mechanics. If you want a VR gold game, this is the one to get for sure. Nice work guys! A+			"

								TGC gives a very good feel of being on a golf course.  Good sound, courses and mechanics.  I don't play golf for real, but I did enjoy some golf video games in the past.  This takes it way past tapping a button for a power meter.  I'm only using amateur difficulty, but it feels like it should for someone not experienced in the real thing.Some really cool things:The scoreboard behind the tee lets you see your progress after each holeThe ""watch"" that comes up when you twist your wrist to give you lots of cool info like distance to hole, direction, and even real time and battery of controller.Pad you can pull out to show you the map of the hole you're on and distances to it.Teleport around anywhere you want to go to see different views of the hole or just look around.  Then one click to return to the ball in perfect position to take your shot.Your bag appears right by the ball to pick your club with pop ups of the type and distance you last hit using it.Performance is fine on Low with my GTX970, jaggies on lots of stuff, but it kind of disappears after a while once you're immersed.  Hopefully they'll be able to optimize more in EA.Definitely recommend picking up.			"

								I am not a massive golf fan but have enjoyed golf games in the past and the graphics looked like at the very least I could enjoy a tranquil virtual stroll :-)So...FORE!!!!... I played two rounds on two different courses before writing this review and can report that I am about as bad at this as I am at real golf, but I bloody loved every single second of it, for me it is as addictively difficult as the real thing...and I am pretty sure that is a good thing.Am running a 980Ti and found the highest quality setting produced a laggy framerate, but all looked good for me on the medium setting.Am really looking forward to continuing to play on other courses and seeing all the tweaks and improvements planned by the developer, I encourage you to support this game and join the community, I think this is a VR keeper you will want to play time and time again.

								Picked this up today as always wanted a golf game for the Vive. Played just over 2 hours so thought I would share my 2 cents.Pro's:They have got the swing and clubs down to a tee. The swing mechanic feels really good and there is a swing review after your shot so you can see your back and forward swing.The menu system works great, good tutorial and set of options.Added lots of nice touches such as watch to show you the direction and distance to the flag. You can pick the club bag up and move it, animals (strange animations), sounds the club makes against the ball tells you if its a good shot or not.Cons:Performance, performance, performance. I am running it on 1080 with i7 4790K and 16Gb and it needs rear projection on low settings. It seems to be course dependant as played all the courses and the third one was able to play on high settings with no stutter (but rear projection was on all the time)The greens are like glass and are far too fast. The first course is really bad for this.The ball physics on the crazy golf section are well off. Difficult to make out objects in the distance such as flag, ball in flight. Should have a different indication system.When the game launches it has a windows menu to select several settings. Means you need to go to desktop each time to set it before the game begins in vr.Improvements:Need to see how far you have hit the ball.Really needs a driving range so you can practice.Multiplayer is a must!! And not the crap they put in the desktop version.Graphics need an improvement. Would prefer not to have trees as the antialising just makes everything shimmer.Final thoughts:The best golf VR experince you can have at the moment.  It is a dream for golfers, it is like the real thing, nothing more kothing less.Very impressed with the vive integration. This game has lots of promise and could be a must have if they iron out the issues before full release. At the moment its a 6 out of 10 for me.			"

								This is good implementation of golf in VR. The tutorial gets you off to a good start and the controls are intuitive.Your golf bag is standing just in front of you and you hover your hand over the clubs to make your selection. Initially, the yardage for a club is blank, but once the game knows how far you personally hit that club, it's remembered for next time. One thing I might like to see added in this aspect of the game is the ability to choose to toggle holding the club or map as opposed to having to hold the trigger the whole time.The map in your back pocket is good for seeing the overall hole and checking distances (the dots are 50 yards apart as a guide). Your watch has handy info, too. Haptic feedback is well-done; you know if you're in the right spot to grab your map and you can feel the ground with the clubhead before you swing.The teleporting system is nice. You can zip straight to a stance in front of your ball, or choose to walk along the course and take in the scenery. Reviewing your swing in 3D afterwards is pretty cool. It's like it draws your swing with TiltBrush and you can see how smooth you were and how far back the backswing was.The graphics look great even on low settings, IMO. I get better performance from this game on higher settings than I do in Pool Nation VR, for example. The golf glove texture on the Vive controller is a nice touch. Recommended.			"

								AWESOME...AWESOME......No More Lost Balls...Want to thank the developer for coming out with this great realistic golf game...I have been a golfer for over 10 years..but don't play as often as I want...but this places me in the middle of the action...and I can play whenever I want...Only thing is I hardly ever miss the ball in my real swing with the golf club in the real golf game..but have managed to miss the ball completely and this happens a lot, really frustrating..I think mostly because unlike the real club, the controller has minimal weight and has no real feel to it.(we need a golf club controller with real weight distribution)....Also I think I got a pretty fast PC i7-6700K 32.0GB RAM GTX1080 (spent over $2K) but when I set the game to High it becomes blurry....Not sure if I need to overclock the graphics card..overall this is a great game...and its what I have been waiting for since the purchase of my VR headset..Awesome Game...updated 1/28/2017My Vive honeymoon is officially over...the only use I have with my Vive headset is to play ""The Golf Club VR""			"

												I don't normally write reviews. But, had to for this. If (like me) you feel like you are lacking long lasting experiences in VR, get this! It will help if you enjoy Golf of course. If you've played IRL, skills actually transfer. But, it really needs a golf grip/vive tracker controller as the standard controllers are obviously the wrong shape and induce club head control issue simply because you can't get your hands where you would normally. But, it doesn't take long to adapt your grip to work around this.I've had this from Early Access, and found myself playing this for several hours each time I loaded it up.And now, with full release, performance issues are not a problem any more (note I'm on a GXT1080 and run steamvr at 2.0 ss, with in game detail at high), swing tracking is definitely better as well.Minor suggestion/gripe:Although I haven't fully inspected the full release, so this may be in there, I would like to be able to choose a ball type to ""tune"" backspin. At one point during the early access changes, backspin was too pronounced and a real pain to keep the ball on the green as it would accelrate back off the surface everytime. Now, I don't seem to be able to induce any backspin at all.You will get your £23 worth out of this if you enjoy golf.Obviously, ensure you have space to make swings, you will hit things in your room hard if you do not and USE THE WRIST STRAP!EDIT TO ADD:i7 4790K 4.4ghz16GB RamASUS GTX 1080 STRIX OC			"

Despite my frustration with how difficult the game was; I concluded that it's the closest simulation to real life golf I've ever played, and its in my own bedroom. Real golf is hard as hell folks, and so is this game.... But we don't play real golf because we honestly expect ourselves to be masters of it, do we? If you like golf, buy it... if you don't like golf, don't. If you've never played golf before or want to learn, buy the game.			"

								I buy a  lot of the new games that come out and unfortunately refund a lot too because most of it isnt worth a free demo download.  This is the first game that gave me back the experience of putting the headset on for the first time and let me really immerse myself.  I did not think I would like golf.  I tired the other game and it was very disappointing for me.   This was outstanding.  Great physics and swing mechanics, great extras like the virtual watch and map (Wish it was a tablet instead of a peice of paper but still great its there).  I would love a replay system or a choice of alternate camera so I can watch the swing from a different angle.   This is the first early access that feels like more effort has been put in than most of the fully released games.  I highly recommend it.   PS if you get a little ADD while playing, i suggest getting openvr desktop display portal.  You can put a screen anywhere and wat whatever angle in the gameworld you want and watch whatever you want from your computer.  Its great since this game sets a predetermined swing direction (GREAT CHOICE) and I put my screen just to the side of the view of the main course so I can watch game of thrones reruns while playing some virtual golf.  I love my new world.  PSS let us lock the damn clubs please DEVS!			"

								A great and very challenging golf simulator, this is intended to be simulative so forget to stay into the par easily, not for casual players. I'm extremely curious to see further additions, but even now (very first early access with 4 courses locked) there are plenty of holes.Many users complains about performances, surely the game need optimizations, but I'm playing with a 970 and it's acceptable with graphics on mid (low and mid on my system runs almost the same). This game absolutely need an in game supersampling slider, it's very aliased on trees (and with antialiasing very blurry on everything distant).I could write more on what could be added or polished, but the truth is than even now Golf Club crush any other golf game for VR. If you're interested in this sport, it's the game to buy.			"

								Ths nne was an instant refund for me. I run most VR games like butter, even with SS up, but this one is a judder-fest from the get go at even the lowest setting. Completely unoptimized at this point. And if the judder wasn't happening it would still look like ****.   Most of the pleasure of golf for me is the escape and these graphics are on par with Minecraft. Another thing that sucked was with the irons there is no sticking point for the length of the club. The more you lean down to get your club head even, the more the handle shortens, so it is practically impossible to get a feel for how to set your club head on those shots and all the clubs feel underpowered for my swing, except the putter. The greens are like glass covered with a very slippery oil.  A hint of breath will send your ball skittering to the netherworld. Choosing clubs was completly unituitive. If you want to give players an option to actually walk to the bag and choose a club instead fo a menu, then give them that choice, but I found the walk to the bag and trying to get the controller to set on one club in a tightly clusteed bundle to be unnecessarily cumbersome. I thought I might be able to get some enjoyment out of the putt putt course but it is a completely unimaginative skid fest as well (see green speed) In short, this one should remain in the sub $5 bargain bin until  a long long process of refinement takes place. Unless you are into frustration and shake induce nausea from a poorly optimized engine stay far away from this one.			"

												I played this game some more and got through the tutorial ok this time, It's a bit of a lonely game and would be much better if you could play multi-player, And it would benefit from a AI player to play against like Pool Nation, In fact it could do with a full tournament of players, to just knock a ball around on my own is not enough for a non golfer, but I look forward to future updates.Previous: This is the first Vive game I have been unable to play, I am not a golf fan but I thought it would be nice to see some nice courses and environments, But the tutorial was really bad and did not work for me, it kept telling me to press advance but the game would not let me do that, once past this I started a game and I kept missing the ball, (not that blind!) It was running very poorly on my 980ti with 24 gigs of ram and a 8 core 8320, I will come back to this at a later date but for now it's a work in progress and wish the devs the best, I know its early access but if you have no real interest in golf then you best stay clear untill full release, having said that I feel I was misled by the positive reviews that were proberbly from fans of the 2d version.lA Golf nuts game, for the time being a casuals left on the shelf.

								Good first attempt at a virtual golf game, but I can't recommend this yet for all your avid golfers out there looking for a decent VR golf experience. For one, the graphical performance is not very optimized yet. Low frame rates hurt the experience a bit (Latest i7 cpu, NVIDIA 1070 GPU). Second, the vive controller is simply not a golf club.. Hitting a ball well in this VR game means you won't use your normal swing, which means it will hurt your real golf game if you play it alot. Until they come out with a good controller that properly simulates a real golf club, I would stay away from this VR golf sims (or any other)			"

								This game is a very interesting idea, however it is pulled off quite poorly. For a physics based game, it has a poor physics engine involving a big half of golf: The clubs. It doesn't help that the few levels that were recommended, even though I picked a lower difficulty level, were all extremely hard. Between the price of VR and this game, you might be better off buying second hand clubs, and pocketing the extra cash. I didn't buy VR for this game alone though, and neither should you. If you want a good golf game, this isn't it. If you want a good mini-golf game, this isn't it either, even though that is a choice.			"

												Dissapointed on the swing tracking. The game has a lot of potential but as of now, it isn't ready. The driver is very difficult for the tracker. No matter my address on the ball, more times than not it swings past the ball....regardless of how far away I address the ball. Something very off on that, the physical limitations of reach didn't make a difference.			"

								A great golf game, however, they need fix stuttering. This game has a lot of performance issues for me and I normally don't have any issues with VR games. Too much stuttering to be enjoyable even on lowest settings.			"

								There is one major flaw with playing this great golf sim in VR  -  It's the fact that when playing golf you spend a lot of time looking straight  down at  the ground at you ball, and a VR headset starts to get very heavy  and   begins to strain your neck. It also needs  to be pretty tight on your head to stop it slipping or falling away from your face. This for me was a major factor( more than any other VR game) in me refunding an otherwise excellent Golf Sim. It's overall  juse too uncomfortable to play with the current generation of VR Headsets (Vive in my case). I think once  VR headsets lose a bit more wieght,  loose the trailing wire and become wireless then a Golf Sim will become infinitely more playable.Well done to the Devs a great Golf game in the making.

												Dear Developers @HB Studios. First to me: I am a real life Golfer with a Single Hcp of 7.7 in Switzerland and South Africa. I really wanted this Game to work for me but somehow it just didn`t. I am not saying it needs to be a bad Game but I would love to get in Contact with the Developers and work with them on the Game. I am by no means a pro but I would say I grasp the game a fair bit. Maybe I didn`t have the patience for the Game but it is just unnecessarily complicated and the Golf Experience really suffers under it. The Movement in the game is a horror and not even talking about addressing the Ball. I relly want this game to work so if you read this developers please write me a pm :) Switzerland can be very wet and cold so again I would love this game. Or maybe just show me the correct settings.			"

												This game is awful.  I can put up with awful graphics.  That's the limitation of gen 1 VR, but gameplay is horrible besides putting.  I'm a scratch golfer and could not for the life of me hit the ball consistently in the game.  Whiff whiff whiff!  There's no depth perception, so it is very difficult to tell how high off the ground the ball is sitting.  The only positive thing I can say about this game is that I did like how it w ould trac your swing in the swing analyzer, so at least you get a rough estimate of the shape of your swing, which can help your real game out a little bit.

								I can't play the game.  All I am getting is a black screen.  I have 4GB memory, largely unused.  What should I do?I can't even return the game as I've already paid for it.  This is so frustrating.			"

								If you own an Oculus Rift steer clear!! The controls for this game are very bugged, the issue is actually simple case of stopping the controls activating on touch and instead as with every other game, upon button press, it could be resolved very quickly but instead the developers would prefer to add new features and ignore the Oculus platform entirely. If you like VR and want to see it have place in the future of gaming, don't support this company, don't buy this game, avoid this at all costs....You have been warned. Game has been refunded, thank god this company did not get to keep my money, goodbye ""The Vive Club VR"".			"

								If you love Golf in real-life (like I do) absolutely a must buy for your Vive!!!!! Gameplay 10/10Graphics 8/10Swing mechanics and physics 9/10Immersion 10/10Total 10/10 (if more courses make it into the final product)If you have never tried Golf, but would like to actually do so, I'm not sure this here is the best idea, as no one will help you, there is no real golf trainer explaining everything to you, so you will get frustrating results, because ""swing mechanics"" and ""physics"" are quite close to reality from my point of view. So  you should already know, which club to play when, how to consider wind and most of all to keep that perfect swing. The Graphics are nice on ""middle setting"", it all looks ok. On ""high settings"" they look fairly good but my 780Ti creates some stuttering then. Mid level is still good enough to absolutely enjoy this game. Whoever owns a 1080 may certainly go to highest settings. If you are a Golfer in real life, this is your favourite past time during winter time!!!I love this game, I was really blown away by the presence feeling it creates. Once my back is not aching anymore, I will definitely be on those VR courses again to hunt the eagles and birdies. "

												I had a lot of fun with this game in early access, and hoped for improvement.  unfortunately...In the most recent version of the game, I frequently get a studder on my club animation while swinging which radically effects the resulting shot - most noticable on finesse chips and putts that will be (again radically) short or long.  With my competative mind set, I feel cheated every time this happens, and makes it very difficult to finish rounds without quitting the game in disgust.  Worth noting I've tried some changes with my VR setup for better results, nothing yet.  Other VR games are running flawlessly.edit: In earlier versions of the game I occasionally ran into this performance issue, but now it happens multiple times per round.  The effect on putts and chips makes this game umplayable for me.Golf Grades (again - my experience - it seems like different people really have different experiences with the motion tracking and club success in this game).Driver:  F- , Yes, F minus - Driver to me is one of the easiest shots in golf (real golf).  not THE easiest, but one of.  It is a single repeatable swing, with a huge faced club, on a ball teed way up.  For the life of my, I can't hit driver in this game.  Half the time I see the club head go right through the ball, the other half I get wildly inconsistent results.  It is a worthless club to me in this game.  I use 3I as my driving club.  How in the world can 3i be so easy to hit off the tee an driver is not?Fairway Woods:  F   I can hit these just slightly better than driver, and so?  though I've tried, and tried, and tried... again, not useful clubs for me to use.Irons:  C   For me, a full swing iron can end up 30 yards short, 20 yards long, sometimes correct... but I have no idea why shots are ending up where they do after 100's (probably 1000's) of swings.Chipping:  D   Ultimatly I ask, does this game provide the finesse around the green with wedges that the pros play with?  The answer is a resounding: NO!  Not even close - and the greens in this game require incredible finesse in order to score.  Chipping (in this game) has this kind of robotic land and predictable release that is unnatural.  Combine this with percentage ranges based on bad lies (like a 60-80% contact in deep rough)?  The result of a chip may have very little to do with your skill, and more to do with a lucky (or unlucky) contact%, and an unnatural rollout.  Can a good chip be hit?  Yes, especially with a good lie - and with the short roll out you always have a chance for a chip to roll in the hole (if your on the correct line).  But I would Way rather have more control of spin options, so that with practice I could roll out, stop the ball, or backspin.  This is the type of control needed to score on some of the very challenging greens in this game.  Chipping has been further harmed (for me) with occasional chips that go way further or way shorter than expected.Putting:  A, when it works.   Occasional random results can have a short putt getting bashed through the hole and 10+ feet on your next putt...  this type of result in a golf game is beyond frustrating - its a game killer.  I feel the hole edge is a bit unforgiving (you really have to get a lot of the hole, and at correct speed to make putts), and putting certain hole locations on fast greens can be unfair (3 and 4 putts with good attepts is not uncommon). Video Game GradesGraphics  C  - while it is impressive how the entire golf course is there in real time, the actual visuals are average.Sound C  - I feel sound could have been a real benefit to this game in terms of building the environment and letting the player know about wind/ wind direction.  Sound is very average, and really adds very little to the overall presentation beyond the necessary swing noises and such.Control  D  -   I'm running into a lot of issues, and have to mark this down accordingly.Fun Factor  F  - Until I can play a clean game with consistency - playing this game is more a test of patience than fun.edit:  my review has done a 180 since early access - because it plays a worse game of golf than it did in earlier versions.  Clubs like driver and fairway woods did not improve in how they are balanced.  My consistency with irons, wedges and putter have gotten worse with extended play.  This is not a ringing endorcement for a game where you  want the ability to find a groove and have fun playing golf.  This final version for me is a disappointment			"

								This game has a lot of potential. It's basically the best VR golf experience you're going to get at this point. When they first released it, I loved it.I do like the improvements they've made since its initial pre-release. I wish the course map had your distance to the hole listed on it. As it is, you have to hold down on the d-pad and bring up the watch to see your distance remaining. The game really needs to add DRIVING RANGE and not that island you hit out to during the tutorial. I would also love a place you could practice your chipping and only putting at...just like at a real course.Lately the stuttering and graphic performance has become dreadful. I have a Intel i7-6700k @4.00Ghz 16GB RAM, 64-bit, running on a Nvidia GTX 1080 FE and high settings with most of the good stuff turned on...brings this game to a screaching halt. There is NO excuse for why my rig shouldn't handle this game without issue. The jutter is headace inducing on the higher visual settings and not playing this on high settings kills all the fun quickly when you know your rig is the top of the line for every other VR title out there. It seems the performance hits are more obvious on the newer courses they've introduced lately. There is no game on VR that can touch my GTX 1080 except this one. The game is really fun otherwise, but the performance is killing it in its pre-full-release state.			"

								Update (9-Feb-2017):The developers have stuck with it and polished this into a very playable state. My main original complaint was of a purely technical nature, but now running on a 1070, there's the occasional slight judder, but nothing that makes it unplayable.Super Pros:Club Throwing simulator with no real world consequences 3000Pros:Essentially this is a really well thought out and playable golf sim in VR, exactly the game you want to use to show your dad VR. Lots of good courses, well thought out mechanics and UI for VR gameplay, and developers that are dedicated to making sure it works well.Cons:Very few at this point. Some graphical glitches can be frustrating (flickering, especially with swing playback), and bringing up swing playback sometimes fail for no obvious reason. Additionally, the greens are made of ice covered with whatever made hover cars go faster in F-Zero, which can make putting something of an exercise in frustration (hey just like real golf!)......Original Review:Could be a lot of fun if it was remotely playable. GTX 1070Pros:Lots of attention to details in room scale interaction, feels like a well thought out effort.A real golf game, not just some VR cash inCons:Performance is absolutely abysmal, rendering the game completely unplayable. I'm seeing some of the worst ghosting I've ever seen if I even move my head a fraction, borderline nausua inducing.Bottom line, I'd love to give this game a shot, and feel like I'd enjoy it, but as things stand it's unplayable.
