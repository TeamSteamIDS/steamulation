It's completely relaxing just to hear pines waving on the wind somwhere over Rotwald area, listening to rain, storm, forest, just close eyes and have that short break on digital nature during day. For real it's best audio-video application for PC and when it comes to give true nature feeling  Call of the Wild is beyond any competition for years. It's great to turn this game on for a few minutes during workday and relax. Not to mention You can easily spend hours and have enormous fun during hunting here.Night hunts or ability to seamless walk/trek/hunt/ in 24 hour cycle is great and going after wounded animal through dark forest is da bong. Especially when you chase wounded 400 kg wild boar in dense forest around midnight...Feelings , presentation and realism are above perfect. If you have ever been on real hunt just buy it. Game have some UI bugs in menu but it will be fixed with 1 or 2 patches. No other problems.Shooting and tracking are real - it works exactly the same in Real life - some hunts are very easy some are long and no outcome - but for real hunter most important is respect for nature and harmony with it - this game as only one in pc gaming history gives that well.

Night hunts are just thrilling - imagine rural field after harvests at midnight , full moon and you on the hunting tower watching pack of wild boars roaming the field after mouses and seeds .Yes You have head lamp and if You miss vitals or hit [like in real life] big boar it can run good hundreds of meters after.Searching for animal at night are just amazing! Check my uploaded screenshots to understand !YES YOU CAN TURN OFF ALL HELPERS [ very detailed and lot of options to  choose from ! ] and act like in RL.To say more i just forget after few minutes that im playing a game [35 years old here] and feel like in archive movie from one of my hunts in real life. All works the same - animals reacts different , depends when bullet hits, etc. Together with video-audio work of art presentation it makes amazing job. No one ever bring so much real poetry in digital gaming presentation of nature than Expansive Worlds did here.

This game have so many features that it will be very hard to describe them all. And all of them are well tested and realized in the game. If You ask yourself ""is that feature is here?"" - answer YES it is. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885844967 If you are looking for ethic game about hunting to interest your kids or friends with hunting it's best title ever released. There is no better PC program that can awake love to the nature than this game [and please all eco terrorists who don't even know what real hunting is about just shut up and keep chains around trees still  as simplest hunter did more to ecosystem and nature than band of ecologist through whole their life] .Details are just breathtaking ! Shoots are dependable by range, wind, position, after unlocking some skills and perks [ great by the way , very good mechanics and very real too ! ] . Someone really knows how to present real hunting!And if you only have occasion just listen to Pines waving on strong wind at Rotwald mountians at first reserve. Did i mention that leaves flying from trees depend on which driection wind is flowing? Good. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885526048 Forget about The Hunter - just sink into this title and beg Devs to develop it further [its just great joy to simply walk in this game] - personally i will pay for all DLC for it , and im sure we get some free dlcs too.You are like on real hunt here in Call of the WIlds , im playing on I5 Haswell, 16gb Ram and 1060 Geforce , all on ultra and high - and trust me - stable FPS around 50-60 , and DAT FEELING along with excellent sounds [you will hear very high range of nature sounds, different for each bush, plants, grass, day and night or even part of day or night ] . There is NO DIFFERENCE in visual or sound presentation with normal, real life hunt.Im completely shocked - Light in this game works like in real life too , you will almost feel wet cold mornings, warm sunsets, scary storms. Just like in real life simple walking through woods [hello no one generic fragment of land, each is handplaced and designed like real life, no boring terrain all over the map].About bugs - i havent noticed any in game about what is essential - hunting , tracking, playing .There are small and very minor buggies with UI but it will be easily solved by small patches so really screw negative reviews. If You are hunting in real life, if You love nature, if You hunted long ago, if You are interested in hunting, if You are looking for best looking game on PC , if You are looking for intelligent and enormous hunting application , if You are looking for enjoyable multiplayer hunts [not so embarassing like in the hunter online - all is really better here ] - JUST GO BUY and THANK Devs for realizing every hunter dream ! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885651194 ABOUT ""BUGS"" : Shortly: Leave bugs to vegans and keep hunting and eating meat instead.Longer:And please stop listening people about shooting - it works exactly like in rl life - not only shooting [wind guess [after perk - eralier by observing nature], magnitude setup [after perk] but a way of the bullet mechanics after the hit.If someone never shoot on real hunt he just simple can't understand that hit which lands on ""soft"" part of the animal only wounds it and make a lot of pain and hunter is obliged to track it even 2 days with dogs. If You want to score animal learn to shoot and read some hunting books. Devs here are one of most dedicated and involved in gaming industry and their fame for long supporting of titles is well known, just look at older brother theHunter Classic.And i bet this wonderfull game, Call of the Wild will become it's successor.There are many ""headshooters"" from stupid fps games around here , who never hold and fire from real gun. Trust me this game is as close to real shooting and hunting as it can be. Not only visually [dat scopes GOD! almost smell rubber near eye] , but what is most important from shooting mechanic. There is Bullet drop, wind , calibre and power incorporated and very smart and real hit system.  SO ALL OF YOU COD/CS SONS GO SCREW YOURSELF KIDOS.See You in the wilds !!!Developers please keep this game supported and developed in next years as it's best and most realistic hunting experience ever created. I will gladly pay for future DLCs, and remember about some freeLC too. Just give us more of eveything in next years and we have a deal!			"

												This is my first review of a game, but I though this game deserved a review as it's been getting a lot of negative reviews that are unwarranted in my opinion. I live in South Africa and have been hunting a couple of times before and it's something I enjoy. What I enjoy about hunting is that you go out into wide open spaces of beautiful nature. You have to patiently stalk your prey, following spoor (tracks), looking at their dung, checking that you're not upwind. It's not easy, and some days you can go the whole day without even getting close to having a shot at your prey.So in context of this game, I never thought I'd ever find or enjoy any hunting game that gives me the same thrill as I get in real life. But I was wrong. This game does really well in making you feel like you're in this beautiful nature reserve with some of the best graphics and sound design I've seen in a game. It really is stunning. I often just stare at a beautiful sunrise or a strong gust of wind blowing leaves off the trees around me. The beautiful world you get to play in alone is worth the asking price for this game.The actual hunting part has been done extremely well. In this game I've felt like it really is quite close to hunting in real life. Patience is key. Checking wind direction, following tracks, listening for your prey's sounds, looking at your prey's dung etc. has been really well thought out and implemented. It can take hours to find and hunt the prey you're looking for, but it feels worth it. I've seen a lot of people complain about bugs in their reviews, and I have seen a couple, but none of them were game breaking in my opinion. If that is what is holding you back from buying this game, then let me assure you, it's not that bad. The bugs aren't that major, and I have to say that it runs extremely well on my machine. My settings are all cranked up and I'm running a GeForce 970, 8GB RAM, Intel i5 2500k processor, and have experienced no lag or crashes.If you want a game to get lost in, that takes time and patience, that is beautiful and realistic, then give this a go. I hope they bring out an African map in a future DLC!			"

												Let's get something straight right off the top here... this is, by far, one of the most graphically beautiful simulations of an outdoor environment currently available.  Period.  I've been gaming for over 30 years, and this game, with it's accurate global illumination and sunlight simulation, is one of the most immersive experiences I've ever seen thanks to their Apex open world engine.  This is the kind of thing that the next Elder Scrolls game NEEDS, and it's almost worth the $30 price just as a walking simulator alone!  Yeah, it's THAT good.  Even the audio is fantastic... realistic bird calls, buzzing insects, breezes blowing through the trees, etc....it feels like I'm actually walking through a woodland setting.  It's awesome!Note: you need a reasonbly good PC to get all the eye candy at anything above 50-ish fps and people with lesser machines have complained about poor performance.  I can max out all details at 2560x1440 and get between 50~60 fps.  (See the bottom of my review for system specs.)But anyway, the graphics and sound goodies are where the list of awesome things about this game ends.  I really WANT to be able to recommend this game, but the rest is a mixed bag of bugs, broken features, and insanely baffling design decisions that leave me not only nearly speechless, but also more than a little♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.  Back on release day, BluesNews.com posted an article that said that this game had been release as Early Access, but the article was in error because it was, in fact, a full release with no mention of Early Access.  However, that's EXACTLY what this game feels like, and if you haven't been to the forums or read a lot of other reviews yet, you'll see that plenty of other players say the same thing.  Normally I'm pretty forgiving of bugs and whatnot, but in this case, I just can't cut this much slack.Some bugs have been fixed with a recent patch, but it's far from enough, and some of the worst bugs still remain.  Some of those most obvious bugs involve the animal AI, which is ironic considering the fact that it's a core element to the entire purpose of the game,  For example, it's common to encounter animals that don't seem to notice the player and will stand completely still as you walk right up to them.  It's like being in a ""West World"" kind of place where the animals are robots and they sometimes malfunction.  They also get stuck in terrain and rocks, causing them to run in place indefinitely.The whole game has a ""console-ish"" feel, like it's made for kids or something, compared to Expansive Worlds' other game, theHunter Classic, which is much more comprehensive, although doesn't look as good.  Pretty much everything in the game has to be unlocked by visiting points on the map or shooting certain animals or whatever.  You have to earn cash to buy lures, ammo, weapons, and everything is laughably expensive.  I suppose this is a viable method of giving the player a reason to keep hunting, but it also lends to an ""arcade-like"" experience.  They claim the game went through beta ""testing"", but if that's true, then their beta testers were far less competent than they needed to be.  Or maybe the testers reported the bugs and the devs chose to ignore them.  Either way, most of the problems this game has are inexcusable and could not possibly have any sort of intelligent explanation as to how they made it into the final release.Other issues that drive me nuts... - Placing a waypoint on the map does NOT put a marker on your HUD or the Hunter Mate device, which requires you to keep opening the map to make sure you're heading in the right direction.  100% useless feature. - The compass is supposed to allow for ""free"" or ""fixed"" rotation, but it's always on ""fixed"" regardless of the setting. - The Hunter Mate randomly stops showing the track directional cones while you are tracking animals. - Keyboard & mouse players cannot move slowly which means you're always making maximum noise.  (You have to use a game controller and the analog movement stick to ""sneak"" successfully.) - Occassionally, a random deer or two will come out of nowhere, running in a perfectly straight line, and hit you at full speed, causing health damage as they continue off on their merry way.  Frightening. - Animal tracks sometimes double back on themselves and then disappear, even though you don't actually see the animal cross your path as the tracks indicate. - Animals often give ""warning calls"" to let you know that your presence has been detected by either sound, scent, or sight, even though you're A.) not making any noise, B.) down wind, and C.) visually obstructed by hundreds of meters of solid earth, otherwise known as a hill or mountain.  There's some debate as to whether or not the animals actually have the ability to detect you or perhaps their behavior is mostly random.  (It seems random to me.) - Even though the visuals are stunning, the water reflections are CRAP.  I mean, absolute garbage.  You'd have to see them to know what I mean, but I find it absurd that so much of the game's engine is so beautiful, and then they totally ♥♥♥♥ up the water reflection shader.  The water looks much better if you just turn off the reflections.  Not as realistic, no, but still acceptable. - Rain sounds rapidly cut off/on while standing near any body of water.  (Sort of sounds like the ""whop whop whop"" of helicopter blades.) That's not an exhaustive list by any means, but if you want to get an idea of the other issues people have discovered, head over to the discussions and check out the Bug Reports section.  Sure, the game is still playable, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get some entertainment out of it despite all the times it has made me cross-eyed with rage, but if your'e the kind of person who expects near perfection from their games and is easily annoyed by really obvious bugs, I would avoid this one, for now at least.  Maybe check back in a few weeks or so and see if the game has been patched up some more, but as it stands right now, I can't recommend this game.Specs:  (no overclocking)i7-6700KGTX 107016 GB RAM500 GB SSDSoundBlaster Z			"

												This is from the perspective of someone who has been a huge fan of theHunter: Classic for many years and have quite a bit of time and money invested in it.Call of the Wild is a beautiful game environment and solid hunting mechanics; which will feel familiar to veteran Classic players and not too daunting for new hunters to the 'series'.I've seen a lot of people ask if this is anything like Cabela's. I would have to say that CotW is FAR superior to Cabela's; but still maintains a 'casual' hunter feel to it. There are still a few launch issues and bugs however, which really should have been ironed out from the Beta before retail release; including some issues that aren't dissimilar to what has or is being experienced in theHunter: Classic (specifically MP issues). Pros: -Gorgeous graphics-Great sound design-Reserves are very well designed and visually interesting.-Dynamic weather system is well implemented.-Smooth animations and weapons feel like they have weight.-Players can jump! This might sound ridiculous to put on a pro's list; but it's one of the biggest features I wanted in Classic.-Stalking animals is MUCH easier. This could also be listed as a Con.-Progression system with XP, Money and Weapon skill, that will keep you striving to improve.-MASSIVE hunting reserves.-Similar game mechanics to Classic, that makes the game familiar for veteran Classic players. -Good tutorial and hint system for new hunters. -Much further render distance for all the long-shot enthusiasts.Cons: -A few UI issues (unable to click some elements, or non-responsive elements)-Experienced a couple of crashes due to entering the System Settings menu. (work-around is to change settings, then restart the game. Another suggestion is to disable cloud-sync in Steam).  -Animals aren't as 'hard' when it comes to Spook range and flee distance from weapon firing. -MP has a few issues. Most noticeably with desync (shooting animals that aren't actually there). -Joining an MP game can spawn you out of bounds, or with 0 health. (This isn't game breaking from my experience as it respawns you near the host. )-Can't quit to Main Menu - only to Desktop.-Can't progress your characters environment/lore/tower unlocks in MP. -No in-depth stats tracking and weapon skill progression compared to Classic. -Progression flow is a bit off (Receiving missions and being advised to use specific callers; which you can't yet unlock due to level or money requirements)-No truRacks system.-Some may find the game too grindy to unlock new weapons and itemsAll in all, I would still recommend this game in spite of its launch issues; if you can tolerate a few bugs. If you are expecting a 100% flawless release, then perhaps give this title a miss until the developers have ironed a few creases out. I'll happily update this review in the near future to accurately reflect any developer changes to anything listed above; or anything new they introduce.I hope this helps!			"

												Ok so, here I am. One of those guys who's going to give the game a positive review. I've read many of the negative reviews and most of them are actually fact based and have legitimate complaints (instead of people who just hate hunting games saying they hated it.  If you're listening, don't play warcraft if you hate elves and dwarves, and stop playing grand theft auto if you hate cars.)   So, yes, the game has many issues which need to be fixed ASAP and many others which we would all like to see dealt with over time. Having said that,  this game was a great way for me and a close friend to spend some time walking through the woods, when we are too far away to do it in real life. (not to mention, regulations on hunting here are a bit more strict than in game where you can bag 6-7 deer in one evening haha)  The scenery is great, its well done, has a ton of variation, and lots of space. Its also pretty simplistic in its design, not a ton of gimmicky stuff that isn't needed... Have you been way out in the woods before? Its a lot like this game shows. The feel of the firearms is good, the sounds (when they work) are good, the animal behavior is above exceptable, the game offers challenge as well, since you don't start playing, and an hour later have every piece of gear available. I like the ""grindy"" aspect of it. Maybe others don't but I call this a bonus. The game is quite relaxing and slow paced, perfect for when you need a break from the typical ADHD shooters of our current time or bucket-of-ice-cold-water to the face pvp most online games throw at you.  I like to put this one on the big screen in the living room with a fire going and an ice cold lager, and take my time looking down those fields and wandering the woods. Definitely a relaxing, low stress title here.  So, what needs fixing? well...Plenty.   I'll write more about it in suggestions, and hopefully some Devs can take a look at what I have to say!TL;DR    Yes its not perfect, but with some work it easily could be one of, or even THE greatest hunting game title (depending on what you're after)  Is it worth the cost?  I'm going to say yes, but only with the stipulation that they continue to work on it, and provide the community with more content and bug fixes without asking for more money.EDIT:   wanted to include what i posted in suggestions.Ok, so I've only played about 10 hours so far, but I thought I should write this while the thoughts are fresh in my mind.  I'll start by saying that I gave this a positive review in steam, and suggested people take a closer look at it.  I spent quite a few hours last night having a lot of fun playing multiplayer with a close friend of mine.  We talked a lot on discord and discussed a few of the issues people are complaining about, as well as some of the bugs and issues we encountered ourselves.  I think this game is really good already and potentially will be amazing.  Having said that, here are a few things I would like to draw some attention to (in no particular order);1. Option of ""exit to main menu/home screen""  I really think this should have been here already, and many agree.  Exiting to desktop is a bit annoying, especially for people on my friends list who see ""mike is playing, mike stopped playing, mike is playing"" lol.  Lets add a ""quit to main menu""?2. In Multiplayer, only the person hosting is able to interact with the (?) on the map. As far as we could tell last night, only the host is able to fast travel as well. This is a huge disadvantage and also makes no sense. It would be nice to say ""hey, lets all meet at the lodge/outpost for a moment and restock and regroup"" or something. It can take a while if you get separated to walk all the way to your friend!  Not to mention, wandering up to a landmark or lookout and not being able to do anything, or being unable to build a blind, etc.  Lets make it so anyone can use these things!3. Money.  So, I have no huge issue with this but I wanted to add a few personal points here. I think the money system should be scaled a bit.  I'm going to use $, so please euro players, etc, bear with me (i'm canadian but I'll use USD).  A box of ammunition doesn't cost 300$ in real life.  and the normal hunting rifles a regular person buys (i'm talking AVERAGE here) are maybe 2000$ or even less.  (I bought a browning for 800 once, and it even came with a scope).  I think charging 30,000$ is a bit high. Perhaps have the money earned cut down a bit, and then scale the cost of things for a bit more realism.  I'd suggest 20 rounds of ammunition for lets say 45-50$4.Sound issues.  Some people don't have this, but a few I've spoken to do. I don't know about you but for me, there is nothing worse than waiting an hour for that perfect tag to show up (deer, etc) and lining up your perfect shot and then ""silence"" when you pull the trigger.  It's quite anticlimactic when that happens. Not to mention the calls sometimes being silent, or rain sounding a bit buggy, etc.  I hope these sound bugs are eliminated soon. Not a deal breaker for me, but should be addressed.5.Here's one I haven't seen anyone mention. Why do female characters run like the flash? Friend of mine literally leaves me in the dust when we're moving together (and yes I triple checked, i'm running, not walking)  She ran about 85% faster than my male character. Is this a bug or intentional? Do male characters get some other bonus like carrying more weight or something? (not being sexist, just asking)  Is there a point in playing as a male when you can essentially speedwalk as a female?6. Wildlife changes.  Bird hunting should be added (and forgive me if it is but I haven't unlocked it)  if you're going to have shotguns in the game, there should be geese, duck, turkey, pheasant...whatever.  As far as I can tell this isn't really a thing. Can anyone confirm? I've not read anything definite so far, but some have told me there is no such gamebirds added. More wildlife would be nice too, but mostly just the bird hunting (a favorite of mine in real life) is something I'd love to see.7.Group activity.  It would be fun in multiplayer to have some quest/challenge that is co-operative. Maybe a party system or something where if 2 people collaborate on a kill, they share the rewards, regardless of who pulled the trigger. 9.I've heard this mentioned before but,  seasons.  Would be kind of interesting if you could make some selections when starting a multiplayer like winter, rain on or off, night only, day only, fall, spring...etc.  Some other maps/terrain variations in general would be nice (sort of goes along with that)  Just vague ideas I'm throwing out here. 10. Firing range, practice. Something like that might be useful for those who have never hunted or shot in real life, or are new to these types of games.   Well, that's all for now, I welcome any comments and bumps.			"

												Updated review after 52 hours in and 4 updates.TL;DR: this game should be marked as an EARLY ACCESS GAMEWhile I can understand the dev's motivation to urge users to report bugs, I cannot fathom how they can release this game as a ""finished product"" but treat their customers as early access testers.Bugs I've encountered:- Animals get stuck and stand still. They cant run away. You can pet them.- Sometimes you get stuck in a bush and then die of falling damage.- Trashiest, clunkiest and buggiest UI ever. Even after the patch you have to (at least) click twice on stuff and pray for it to work.- Apparently not only the wildlife, but also the UI buttons require a hunter's precision. If you don't click on a specific area within the option you want to navigate through, the game won't recognize your click (UI is absolutely buggy and has ""hidden hitboxes"").- Map doesn't center around you when you open it. First few moments upon openning the map have to be spent on zooming in/out and finding where you are.- There seems to be no consistency regarding the ""loudness of the sounds"" you create. Crawling through bush X in this area is silent. Crawling through bush the same bush in another area is suddenly loud. Also wind and rain seem to not have an effect on your (displayed) sound-level.- After playing some time with your Phone (ingame item that helps you tracking) out, your fps start to drop from 50+ to 13. Only happens when the phone is out. Then the next bug kicks in...- Suddenly all tracks vanish and don't ever appear again. Renders tracking impossible. You have to restart the game. Going into the menu and back ingame is not possible, since there is no button to return to the menu.- The scope on the rifle bugs out as soon as you start using a bow. Use a bow and your rilfe's scope will be rendered useless (don't use a bow).- Not receiving skill points all though I get notified I got one (?)- Not receiving perk points all though I get notified I got one (?)+ Many more bugs OTHERS discoveredTechnically not a bug, but simply bad design:) You can't walk through some bushes (which is fine in itself), but in some areas they are placed en masse which turns said area into a maze. You have to navigate your way through hip-tall bushes that in RL you wouldn't even need to bend but here they are WALLS. Try to jump over them and you die of falling damage (that is a bug though).

												Alright guys, so after playing this game for a bit,  I find a lot of good things.  The graphics are outstanding, the hunting is fun,  however I feel like there should be some more content in the game,  its good but could use some trap/skeet ranges or something,  maybe some more guns,  and FISHING,  the devs should add fishing.

												I would say in its current state don’t buy it unless you really like the original thehunter. Right now there are a lot of bugs and glitch’s. This game should have been an early access to be honest. Overall the game is pretty fun, the graphics are fantastic, the side missions are fun yet challenging and the overall realism is pretty good. I would say after 3-6 months this game should be in a good state for a purchase but right now I would say wait a bit. 7/10			"

Tl;dr:This game looks absolutely gorgeous, the performance are great (i5 4590 and a GTX 970, 40/50 FPS at Full HD with Ultra settings) and the gameplay is fun albeit slow paced, suited for both casual and hardcore gamers.There are some bugs to be ironed out but I haven't found anything gamebreaking yet.The most annoying thing is the inability to select the walking speed with mouse and keyboard (it's possible only with a controller) but it's already been worked on. - Fixed with patch 1.2I've also found out that for now some achievements can't be unlocked - Fixed with patch 1.2No crashes on my side but I've read reports of freezes/continuous crashes from Windows 10 users, so if you're not a Win7 user I'd advise caution buying right now Pro: Beautiful graphics and sceneries, really good audio compartmentWell optimized: an i5 4590 and a GTX 970 are enough to play at Full HD with everything maxed Ultra settings* (maxing Shadows causes FPS drops in various places) with 40/50 FPS stableFun (albeit slow) gameplay, suited for both casual gamers and hardcore hunters: the game helps you find tracks, downed animals and even collectibles, and you can tailor your experience by enabling/disabling each option individuallyNo microtransaction or additional fees Con: The UI is pretty buggy and not clear to read, especially the ingame map and manual UPDATE: after patch 1.2 the map is still kind of glitchy but the ""noise/visibility meter"" has been fixed and now works properlyIt's currently impossible to select the walking speed using mouse and keyboard, which means that you'll always make a lot of noise scaring animals. Devs have announced that they're already working on it and should be addressed with the next patch - Thanks to patch 1.2  is now possible to do so even with keyboard and mouseThere are many other generic bugs but the devs are really active and have already released four big patches to address most if not all of the gamebreaking onesWildlife's AI has some flaws but I haven't noticed totally unnatural or crazy behaviour - UPDATE: 15 hours in I've found a single case of animal stuck in place, besides that the AI feels really natural (shot a buck, almost been charged to death by him while the other does of the pack ran away - it was awesome)Around half of the achievement are bugged and can't be unlocked, mainly the trophy-related ones - This is now fixed and every achievement unlocked but not awarded due to the bug has been credited to me as soon as I loaded my savegame "

												This game should have been an early access title.Random crashes, bad multiplayer, bad AI, wonky menus are just a few of the problems I have with this game. With that said, I'm still having fun with this game. But that is primarly because of the people I play with. The game does have a good base, but it needs a lot of polish and expanding.Simply put: This game needs the Early Access tag for me to recommend it.Edit: Removed ""very slow progression"" from my list, since they fixed this in the latest update.

												My review is based on how the game is NOW and not what it COULD be.The game is stunning, i have everything set at max and its awesome id love to see a VR version. The sounds are great infact the whole FEEL of the game is really nice.Im not a hunter, never have been and never will be and at first i had no idea what im supposed to do in the game. There is no TUTORIAL and the basic guide at the start does well in starting you but i needed to watch a few youtube videos to help. I played for around an hour just wondering around in crouch wondering why i cant find any animals. Found a rabbit and killed it, felt awesome but nope rabbits dont count. At that point i was going to quit but i stook with a little longer and i finally found a deer. Boom headshot, but wait it just ran off. Ok so apparently headshots arent the best way to kill an animal. So i followed it and managed to get another shot at it and managed to kill it with one more shot. Went upto its body and harvested it and was presented with a screen which showed an xray of the animal and alsorts of cool info and that was me hooked.The game does have quite a few BUGS, i wouldnt say they were game breaking bugs but they can be pretty annoying. Id have a look in the TECHNICAL ISSUES discussion to see more on bugs but overall ive enjoyed the game.So why am i giving this a NEGATIVE REVIEW. Well its mostly because the game feels like an early access game right now. The DEVS seem to be fixing bugs and hopefully will listen to the public and make a few changes and add a few things. There is also talk on PAID DLC which id prefer them to focus on the main game first but this game does have serious potential and i will change my review accordingly.In short the game is playable and very enjoyable if you can stand a few annoying bugs. If your the kind of person who hates any kind of bugs id suggest adding this to your watchlist and checking back in a few weeks/months. Unfortunately there is no NEUTRAL option on here so i have chosen NEGATIVE.			"

												POST 1.21 PATCH:LOTS OF GAME FREEZES... STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.Post 1.2 patch:None of the big 3 bugs fixed, disappearing tracks, crashes and Zombie slow walking after interrogating lots of tracks.They have managed to 'balance' the cost of ammo (ie now costs 3 times the amount.)Seriously, did anyone other than the 'realism above fun' brigade ask for this?   Animals freezing, getting stuck on terrain and ignoring running players that's what needs fixing, not trying to stop players buying all the gear due to getting ingame currency.Fix the animal AI, that'll add to the realism.  But therein lies the problem, they know how to raise the price of ammo and not a clue what to do with the animal AI, otherwise it would have been fixed in the Hunter...Just thought I'd share my last hunt with you:Killed a coyote for a mission, but it didn't count, found the answer on the forum, you have to hold the .270 whilst harvesting it.  A fixed is promised.Start again, shot a deer with the bow, harvested it.  I found a coyote and tried to use the .270 Huntsman, but the scope wouldn't work, because I'd used a bow first... a known bug .Start again, made sure I looked down the rifle scope first, to stop the  bow bug.  Shot a nice Stag for a mission with the bow, the game locked as soon as I shot it. Had to restart my computer, otherwise it will lock up again.Immersive, Realistic?  I'll leave it up to you to decide.Updated 28 Feb. 108 hours!As Stefan asked to let let him know how I like it after the 1.1 patch, I'll post on what bugs are still extant after 1.1 (along with the new ones it has caused):CONS:1. Game can crash and lock up the pc with loud audio, no 'COTW_F stopped working message'.   This didn't happen for me before 1.1.  The program needs to be stopped with the task manager.This happened to me within a couple of minutes in game and kept happening until the pc was restarted.  Happened yesterday to a friend I was in TS with.2.  The Zombie speed bug is still there after you interrogate a lot of tracks, having to select HM then a weapon, to get around it, is a pain.3.  There seems to be a finite amount of tracks, a few times in a long hunt, animals I have shot and killed have left no tracks, it was pure luck I found the body. (I tried using the light in case it was a day/night problem.)4.  UI still clunky, .270 hollow point ammo still locked even with sufficient rifle skill, unlockable Stands... STILL!5.  Animals stuck in trees, rocks and the animation where the animal freezes and does a slow piroutette is hilarious.6.  Animals reacting to callers, regardless of species, if you don't have a certain caller, use anyone, it'll work.  Both predator callers use the same sound file, but there again a lot of animals use the same warning calls... still not fixed.7.  Animals in groups ignoring shots, allowing the entire herd to be killed. (Not sure whether this should be a pro!)PROS:1.  It is very pretty, which is the main theme of all the positive reviews.2.  Positive reviews make a great deal of how realistic and immersive it is, if you have frozen, 'rotating on the spot' animals where you hunt, then this game might be considered realistic!I'll say it again, this could be a cracking game... I'll post more after the next big patch.Another update, 53 hours in, but first, some quotes from positive reviews:'There are still a few launch issues and bugs however, which really should have been ironed out from the Beta before retail release; including some issues that aren't dissimilar to what has or is being experienced in theHunter: Classic (specifically MP issues).It has some buges, but I believe those will be patched soon.'There's a plethora of <10 hours played positive reviews coming out, it's just a shame the IP addresses aren't displayed ;)Ok, on with the review:A few crashes, but not enough to make me give up on it yet, Ooh I'm stubborn!Today's highlights:Thanks to the posts in discussions about how to change map without restarting (Kudos to the OPs), I went to North America.  I had difficulty walking without treading on animals, so different to Hirsch!  I could see for miles and levelled up so quickly, it made me look as though I knew what I was doing. (Which my TS mates know to be untrue.)Problems with North America:Some buildable items don't appear on the map and aren't buildable.Shot some animals which don't leave tracks (this was just before the game crashed.)Some of the animal audio clues are very slow or looped, actually I rather like this, it made me laugh to hear a 10 times slowed whitetail call, talk about a wet F**t!Thank you to the people who've added me and asked me whether to buy it on the strength of my review.  I'm new to this and I'm trying to do it as honestly as I can.Update after day 2:A positive note!I only had one crash on startup and zero crashes whilst ingame.. I believe in giving credit where credit is due and the hotfixes appear to have lessened the crashes for me. (As they did in the beta hotfixes.. so why weren't they included in the release version?)I am, however, amazed by the state in which this game was released... this is the official workaround for being unable to change key bindings ingame:'Disable cloud saving on Steam (Properties -> Updates -> Untick Steam Cloud Synchronization)Go to Documents\Avalanche Studios\theHunter Call of the Wild\Saves open your save folderOpen “keymap.json” with a text editor of your choice (e.g. Notepad)Manually adjust keybindingsSave file and start the game (keeping cloud save disabled until you have started it once)'Quick question... this is a release version and not early access?  If something as simple as keybindings is screwed up, then it doesn't bode well for the game.Ok, into day 2's review:I played this game a lot today, 30 something hours in (including it's older sibling - the beta!)A few observations, it would be nice if:1. I could go to the map and not have a random view nowhere near where my player is, at a scale where I could see where I am.2. Red Deer, Roe Deer and other animals didn't share the same audio for warning calls. (Reported in Beta)3. The hit boxes worked (even some of the EW affiliated tubers made mention of this).4.  I didn't sink into the ground in open fields at night.5. Squirrels and rabbits didn't sound as though they weighed 20 tonnes ingame, they are the loudest animals when they are running around.6. When you brush against foliage ingame, the sound comes from roughly the same direction of that the foliage is in... otherwise it could be a 20 tonne squirrel.In summary... despite all of the above, this could be a cracking game, what's letting it down at the moment is the shooting side of it.  I had great fun running round and unlocking stuff and doing the odd mission, but as an immersive hunting simulator - forget it.Day 1:It's the Beta, stuck animals, COTW_F crashes and, as an added bonus, if you've been a member of the Hunter for a while, you get the chance to buy, with ingame credits, an extra rifle and ghillie suit... hardly a bonus.I'm so disappointed with myself for falling for it yet again, when will I learn?  Answer... when the first DLC comes out.			"

												I am a fan of thehunter classic and invested a large amount of money into it, so I was eager to play this new game. They have the right idea but honestly it should have never been released in the current state. There are bugs everywhere from clipping through the ground if you go prone, to a graphical glitch with the scope to animals acting in total bizzare ways/ bugging out all together. I regret the purchase. My advice would be don't buy it and wait to see if they actually fix the game. If everyone runs out and buys this it will only encourage the company to release unready games in the future as part of some sort of money grab. If they take pride in their work they will fix these bugs. It looks like the game need another month or two of work on it before it was ready for release. The game may be worth picking up in the future but only if they fix these issues because its unacceptable when I come across several bugs within the first hour of play alone.			"

												In germany we have a saying: ""Der Fisch fängt am Kopf an zu stinken."" which roughly translates to ""the fish rots from the head down"". You can feel that talented and passionate people are working on this game. It´s just a shame that someone decided that the game had to be released in a barely finished state. Overall the gameplay is great but there are quite a lot of litte things and glitches that add up and can be frustrating. From stuck animal herds, to crashes, broken scopes and unresponsive menue buttons you´ll see it all. I really miss a better highscore system or trophy room of some sorts. You have a list with your scores but it´s really basic.   It´s hard to recommend but I still enjoy the game. The two, beautiful maps are huge and the gameplay is for the most part quite solid. The game just feels rough around the edges. Also it is good to see that the developer moved away from the awful free too play model of their previous release.			"

												Okay ... so this are one of those games you want to take your time with and appreciate what this game has to offer.After playing an intense CS GO comp or some COD. You really want to immerse yourself into this game. Like trust me this game is really, really good. The graphics in this game is super gorgeous. If it was a girl.. I'd marry her.The hunting is superb. There is nothing more satisfying then killing a animal after hours of walking and tracking.And I don't mind the walking because I just love to take in the scenery and the rain and the sounds and the rest this game has to offer.The sounds are soooooooooo good. The rain wants to make me sleep. The thunder wants me to grab a blanket and go hidein the cubboard or somewhere. All I want in this game is vehicles. Would be cool to drive around and sometimes when you too lazy to shoot. Just drive over you're deer. EZ PZ ! 0_0 . Some glitches here and there but nothing too intense. Well done the developers!			"

												This one hurts... I was really looking forward to it, but it lets you down hard. It has the potential to be a really good game, but unfortunately it's way too far from finished. For every reason to play, there is, at least for the moment, two not to. I don't even know where to start, but here goes.The bugs... this game is so broken.Disappearing animals, disappearing tracks, the photo missions are a bloody mess (the patch didn't work), sometimes your scope sights work, at other times it just looks like you're looking through a tube on top of your rifle. Over and above that, I've experienced three complete system crashes. Just not good enough. The walking... oh my good gods, the walking.If you're looking for a game that's more of a hiking simulator than anything else, you've come to the right place!Everything is so bloody far away and while you can fast travel between base camps, you still have to discover them. Walking 4km to a mission is not fun - even if you can shoot a few things along the way. This is especially fun when you've walked more than 3km and your game crashes. Giving me an achievement that I've run an ultra marathon doesn't help either. This isn't called The Marathon Runner. Progression... making me work my♥♥♥♥♥off for something that's worseFirst of all, skill points and perks. Their effects are nominal. You don't actually feel like you've progressed at all. The ability to judge an animal's weight doesn't work, because the developers never really got around to sorting out the whole kg/pound conversion thing just yet. Then, of course, you have to choose whether you want to range your sights, or judge the windage of your shot (the windage often differs significantly from the general wind direction, because, you know, deer farts and stuff). Secondly, the progression of firearms. THIS! I worked my way up to the .338 - they don't say whether it's a .338 Lapua or Winchester. Regardless, both of these cartridges are renowned for their accuracy. Not in this game though. 0 accuracy. 0. Nought. You work your way up to the best (and most expensive) rifle in the game and it can't shoot straight.Lack of contentTwo maps, each with their own animals. But it gets old quickly. The missions are all the same, the amount of weapons are ridiculously small and the ""balancing"" (I presume) between damage and accuracy just means that one is slightly less crappy than the other. Having said all of this, it does have a few good points. The hunting is fun and it'll keep you entertained for a few hours. The game is beautiful - the terrain is awesome and the animal models are pretty good. It seems that the developers are pretty keen to improve it, but I'm extremely disappointed that it was released in this state. This game is not finished and letting people buy it so that they can help you pick out the bugs is total BS (even though it is an often too common thing these days). Again, this has the potential to be a really great game, but for the moment, I'd steer clear.			"

												Ok，I am from China. BUT want the developer can see my evaluation , I will write in English .  I think we only experience hunting from this game . BUT the hunters life not only hunter , they will be  tired or hungry .  I think this game can divide  into the survival mode and hunting mode .   Someone may just like hunting and have fun can play hunting mode . The other players want to experience whole hunter life  can play survival  mode .  The  cooking and make clothes from animal fur may give players more sence of achievement .It's a good game , it's make me quiet  by  call of the wild .			"

												EDIT TO REVIEW:So I've been watching this game closly and the devs are very very active in fixing and tweaking the game. They've fixed some issues I've expressed below so I now have high hopes for this game. It's not perfect but the patching makes me hopeful. My experience with this game:-Decide to try stalking a deer-Follow closely behind on although never getting to see it because it can hear me crouch walking through foliage made of old sun chip bags-Crouch walking for an hour at least, get acheivement for tracking 50 tracks for one animal-Another hour later finally see deer glitch humping a rock, I could walk up to it and it would keep glitching-Decide that wasn't rewarding so move onto another deer-20 minutes later hear one mating call-Crouched and moved toward it-Rinse repeat 50 or so tracks later I have a clear shot-Aim scope, a third grader could hold it more steady-Decide to try prone, my guy must of grabbed a handful of foliage and duct taped it to from of scope-Take a shot from crouch, headshot-Deer runs away like nothing happened-Figured ""Well it shouldn't take long to bleed out""-Investigate blood splatter ""flesh wound""-Stayed stationary for 10 or so minutes, had cup of coffee-Track blood trail-50 or so blood splatters later decide to let it bleed more-I go to town, shop at the mall, go on real hunting trip, shoot deer in exact spot as on game, it bleeds out within 15, carry deer back to truck, drive home, gut deer, hang meat up, smoke a good amount of it, go to college for 4 years, get married, have kids and realize I left game running, go back to check it-Track 50 more blood splatters, finally find deer-Take another shot, body hit-10 mote blood splatters later finally find deer body, victory-Rifle skill +1-Can't buy anything useful from shop without genociding all deer-Any real hunting equipment you need 40 hours of gameplay to actually get toActual Review:-Weapons: It takes far too long to level up to the point of unlocking a new weapon, and even longer to get the cash for one. It seems like when I earn enough for one weapon I've unlocked the next one and have to choose to earn enough for that one or buy the lower weapon class one. I realize using different weapon classes provides an integrity bonus, for example using a lower calibur bullet on smaller game gets you more cash. I'm not sure if I understand this entirely not being an avid hunter.-Codex: Very bare bones for information. Doesn't quite explain the most important issues like how to use certain equipment and why the highest calibur rifle has an accuracy of 0. Looked for a wikia and didn't find much. But I shouldn't have to use google to have a base understanding of a game.-Callers: Very very useful, almost to a fault. I've been hunting only a few times in the real world and callers have not worked so well for me. It seems like I just sprint through the forest, hear a warning call, use the correct caller and wait. Seems like the other methods of hunting in this game are much more difficult and I find myself using callers to farm money for hours just to buy a new rifle.-Leveling up: Extremely slow leveling progression. I have 35 hours and about 150-200 animals hunted. I'm a total level of 15. Very few skills I can get and very few perks. I understand hunting is a time consuming activity and a simulation should be as realistic as possible, but it seems like grinding levels takes the fun out of it.-Glitching: I've experienced many glitches. I press ESC and it sends me to another reserve, after taking a shot with the perk to stay scoped it shows me down the barrel of the gun instead of scope, serveral several animals are stuck on rocks and trees, [E] Inspect stays until restart of game, certain items requiring 0/0 skill remain locked through entire game, animals remaining upright after death, after coming out of aim it auto spins me 90-180 degrees instantly and animals shot over ~300m don't take off running.It is a beautiful looking game and has a lot of good aspects to it. But the gameplay seems underdeveloped.			"

												Update after 60+ hours:I decided to quit the game for now, it is simply unfinished, too many issues. For many people, including myself, the game randomly freezes which is equal to crash. Two weeks passed, 4 patches came out, but this issue have never been adressed. I've had enough. Yesterday I  returned to the store GTX1080, which I bought specially for this game. I was hoping to enjoy it as long as the original game. But it is very far from enjoyable. I mean, in 4K it looks stunning, easly the most beautiful game I've seen. However, after the excitement of graphics faded, there was nothing left that would have forced me to play. I'm not even talking unique antlers, leaderboards and competitions, you better forget about it. I mean everything in the game is unfinished or broken. Weapons, callers, animal AI, sounds, menus, descriprions, every aspect of the game works wrong. And this is a very serious obstacle to immersion and fun. A few patches that are released, do not fix anything. I know these developers since classic. You can ask them for months to fix autoreloading... Here is a new game, and again the same problem! 7mm/.338 auto-reloading after each shot, not allowing me to follow wounded animal with sights.  Deer bleat caller has slow-motion behaviour, and is imossible to switch to another item. While jackrabbit caller for some reason can be interrupted instanlty, but the sound continues to play. Map is terrible and slow loading, focusing at random point instead of player. Waypoint doens't work. Even when you need to mark a spot you standing at, it's impossible to do. Weapon and ammo descriptions lie, penetration/expansion is mixed up. Another insult to common sense: 45-70 caliber in this game is so weak, it's the same as .243,  both ammo are class 2. Animals follow calls like a zombies. I made a video shooting deer with an bow, they all come back to call in a minute, even wounded ones! I can go on forever....I know most of this issues will be fixed in a couple of years. But I'm not going to wait this time.EW_Anna, this is all just words, the fact is that you released a poor quality product that should not be allowed to Steam. When the game started to freeze every 5 minutes, I asked for refund, which was declined. You all knew the game is unfinished, full of bugs and not tested properly... I can't respect decisions like this._____________________________________________________________Original review:Extremely bugged and bad optimization(GTX980 1440p 40fps). The game wouldn't save some settings after restart. Have to click 60 times to decrease mouse sensitivity from 80 to 20, why there is no SLIDER?! Still mouse moves too fast, and the game resets setting for me every time! Sometimes it's impossible to exit in-game menu (only to desktop), pressing the button does nothing. Once I lost the progress on the map, and so on.. Considering return because of that.Graphics look good, especially close vegetaion and foliage. But on the distance not very impressive. Reminds me the same old classic hunter, which I have played for more than 1000 hours total..I disabled all arcade elements I could. Still there are signs and pointers flying everywhere. The game is very easy, the main goal is to kill everything that moves(or stuck). In the classic game I enjoyed walking a long distances through beautiful environments, searching for a monster buck, trying to avoid other animals, almost never shot does and small bucks. There was a leaderboard, daily events, personal galleries, trophyshots, and we could discuss our trophies, and so on. For me this was the main point of the game. It was fully focused on quality, not quantity. Here we have another story - kill 'em all, this is how you get xp and money to unlock unlocks, so you can unlock more unlocks even faster. All antlers look the same, there are no unique racks, no scoring system, no trophyshots, no reason to play after everything has been unlocked. I'm not interested in just shooting the same animals over and over again, when there is nothing to discover.Wouldn't recommend at this point, at least because of bugs. As for the gameplay - may be they will improve it later, but I doubt it.			"

												As a hunter that hunts in Louisiana and Mississippi this game does an amazing job at giving off the vibe of hunting, but it needs a lot more things added to it. I was pretty disappointed in seeing that the game did not have the REMINGTON R-15, SAS Rage bow, or the Taurus Raging Bull... Seeing that the devs launched what they call a ""full released game""  instead of an ""early acess game"" i find it hard to believe they will add a lot more new things into the game (PROVE ME WRONG DEVS).. Really enjoying the game but the 30 bucks it needs more things in game. The game sounds are SPOT On and done very well. Some minor bugs, but nothing to gamebreaking. I give it a 7/10 for now. LETS HOPE THEY DONT GO HUNTER PRIMAL ON US AGAIN!Pros-2 Big maps that take place in 2 different PLACES-Single player game follows multiplayer gameplay aswell-Fast travel system -ieach district of the map, you'll have 1 or 2 spots in which has some type of hunting stand in which you can build an assemble.- Little collectibles hiding around the world-Outpost in which you can buy ammo, scents, callers,guns, and clothing-Scoring system for the animal you killCons-Game store does not sell any kind of feed causing you to explore the world to discover a feeding spot that the animals go to.-Cant climb the ladders -Game has no tree stands-cannot deploy your own stands nor buy your own stands  (The game has pre built foundations for you to build in certain parts of the map)-Scents, callers, guns, and clothing are TOO OVERPRICED-No Vehicles???? Atleast give us ATVS-Can only have 1 profile on game-Lack of firearms inlcuding bows, rifles, pistols, and shotguns-NO Crossbows AT all-No turkeys, No Alligator, No Mountain Lions to hunt			"

												I have to say that this is perhaps one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The scenery and the level of detail from terrain to lighting effects is amazing. I am running it on maximum setting. Visuals are absolutely stunning. There are couple of things I'd like to see addressed: 1. Addition of a vehicle would be welcome. The area is expansive and talking simply takes too long to get from one area to another. Of course, the point of the game is to walk the vast terrain, to observe the pray and scout locations. It's a simulator in the true sense of that word. But having a vehicle to quicly reach a hunting area would be great. Yes, there are check points with fast travel, but it's not enough. 2. Walking noise could be improved. You have to move very very slowly to avoid making noise. That's also a very realisting idea but taken a little too far in my opinion. 3. Tracking animals is unreliable. At times the track simply stops as if the animal was abducted by aliens. At other times it reaches a point where it goes in a circle. It's a little frustrating when you track game for a good while only to reach a dead end. 4. Some bugs. Although the developer seems to be very engaged. It's a minor problem at this point. No crashes or anything. Just weird visuals. Once I shot a fox that was standing next to another fox and the second animal didn't even move. Just stood there. I could walk up to it and shoot it point blank. Odd. Unless he ""froze"" on purpose which I doubt. Overall, very unique experience. Visually stunning. First hunting game I bought. It really is great and I would recommend it. Happy Hunting!			"

												Don´t buy it just yet. It has still the same bugs as in the closed Beta and the game runs horrible on an up-to-date highend machine. When your game crashes just because you go into the menu you know the game had no quality control at all and people already reported this stuff in the Beta. I will change this review when those bugs are fixed. But until now safe your money, since this game is not playable at all. There are early access titles on Steam which run better and they claim to be an Alpha while this piece of junk here is a full release.Edit: Managed to play the game with lower resolution. Then it´s not crashing in the menus and runs fine. It seems to have a fundamental problem with 4K. Besides that I encountered several bugs within 10 Minutes of gameplay. Animals who are stuck or have an AI Error seem to be normal. Have a look for yourself, i found those animals who got stuck and I am using the vanilla version of the game without any tweaks. http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/80340029170473272/191B82F70B8DECECE8F02BD5E88E89C6B8F1EFBF/http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/80340029170472927/744691DE65F8235912E1489D4FE6D4A4EA41CB17/This, the broken menu, the tiny content and the simple but broken AI shouldn´t be in a full release like this. It´s not even branded as an early access title but has more bugs than most of them.			"

												The game itself is absoloutely amazing and breathtaking, and if it worked correctly it would definitely be worth $30, however, it is so buggy that its almost impossible for alot of players to play.I have never in my history of playing almost exclusively early access games seen a game so buggy, and this game is considered full release. SLI isnt working properly, and going into 4k causes mem leaks and crashes, that and there isnt a way to go back to main menu from the game that i can see without exiting the game. There are tons of other bugs, wait till they iron them out before you purchase because this developer is kinda notorious for leaving things unfinished (looking at the hunter primal).			"

												Give it a chance, I actually refunded this after 2 hours but something drew me right back.I have played just about every hunting game since the mid 90's and out of all those games, this has the magic of some of the very best. (BTW - you can disable most HUD popups and the ""Deer icons"" are only tutorial, don't be like me and think it was a full time feature!)For an ""Arcadey theHunter"" - as many (included myself) branded it - it certainly does not feel like it when you dig deep. It is not a shooting gallery, dont expect deer to just wander past you - in some aspects its even more realistic than Classic.For example -- View distance is FINALLY increased meaning that looking into the distance is actually important now.- Night hunts - call them unethical all you want, but get out there with your headtorch under the stars, the moonlight glowing on the ground and the beautiful sounds of owls hooting in the distance makes it an unforgetable experience. I actually prefer to hunt during this time.- Animals actually have a more believable routine (Wild boar are rarely seen  out in the open during the day, only venturing out after dusk etc) You also have feeding spots and bedding areas which they return to.- Graphics - wow - honestly I cannot work out how some people have slated the graphics as merely ""OK"" because the visuals are simply mind blowing at 4k on ultra. It is so inviting you actually want to explore the (HUGE) map. Walking speed also feels more realistic and not just a geriatric shuffle.- The little things - bushes actually make noise now so it effects how you stalk your prey. The grass becomed flattened behind you and animals, leaving a very realistic looking path. An IN GAME mission journal. The majority of threatened animals can harm you if cornered. Animal tracks last longer than a few hours. The sounds are beautiful, the animations are fluid and there is ample map to explore and discover.One of the best things is the sense of progression this game gives you. You do not start with all the gear, you have to unlock it with ingame money and levelups so there is an actual goal to play towards. The downsides are - - Generic deer antlers - I can only hope the devs listen to the pleas of fans and change this.- Some optimization issues for some but they said from the start, this is a HIGH QUALITY game - do not expect older machines to max it out.It is far from pefect, needs a bit of polish and bug fixes but my god, its a fun game. Whine all you want about it ""not being a finished game"" - while it may not have the amount of animals or the sophisticated TruRACS system, its certainly giving me alot more enjoyment than classic ever did.

												**This Review has been Updated****Update: Since the update, I have noticed that the small animals(ie, rabbits and squirrels) are no longer wearing rain jackets, and thus no longer sound like they are running through empty bags of Doritos. However, when tracking a moose that I shot, I completely lost the blood trail randomly. I don't know if this is a new feature or what, but the moose circled around in the area of an old trail, and while I found plenty of tracks, I found no more blood trail which is key to finding a wounded animal and keeping on the right track. That could have been an issue on my end, I suppose, and I'll have to look into this a bit more in order to determine if this is some sort of bug. Also, it is obvious that the crouch-walking works better now in this new update, and you get spotted less frequently when you are crouched and moving. On the downside though, you walk painfully slower when traveling this way. But I suppose that's supposed to be realistic, so that's fair.**Is it worth buying at this point? That's for you to decide. There are both positives and negatives about the current state of this game, keep reading. Starting with the Positives about the game: The settings are great. From the visuals in the scenery, to the audio with raindrops and the wind blowing through the leaves, the background really is pretty stunning. You don't have a wide variety of animals to shoot at this point, but those that you can they look very well done. The animals also sound really good, and often behave like wild animals. If you don't get good shot placement, you can very much rely on having to track a wounded animal for some time until you can either finally put it down, or it eventually succumbs to it's injuries. The little stories in singleplayer and missions are also pretty neat. And on to the Negatives: Why do the squirrels and rabbits sound like they are wearing little little rainjackets when they run around? While the game animals sound fairly normal as they walk through the grass and brush, the smaller critters sound like they are wearing plastic as they romp about the trees and meadows. Nothing breaks the immersion as you're sighting in on a large buck as you suddenly hear a pair of squirrels wearing windsuits dashing about the boulder you've perched on to take your shot. And as you suddenly look around to see what is going on around you, your buck notices the movement and shoots off like a rocket into the safety of the forest as you silently curse the creators of these squirrels. Also, at random times, the game suddenly decides that it's done playing nice. And your leisurely stroll through the meadow as you search for a black bear takes a sudden turn as you notice that you are now walking in slow motion. So you switch for your tracker to a rifle so you can walk a bit faster for a bit, but soon you're still forced to a virtual crawl as your walk becomes visibly slower. And so you have to restart the game. Sometimes, you come across an animal that is stuck in some way. Sometimes it is stuck between a tree and a rock, for example. At other times, it's stuck in a loop, walking or running in a sort of circle. And so you fire a shot at the stuck animal. Sometimes you'll kill it. Sometimes you'll just scare it, and it will run faster even though it's still stuck. Now and again, it'll take one hit, but it won't kill it, even though it just runs faster and faster and as you shoot at it over and over again-at times you'll see the shot take effect and it stumbles to the ground-it'll get back up and refuse to die. And you'll have to restart the game because you're never going to kill it. Sometimes you'll shoot a stuck animal, and no matter how point-blank you shoot it, the bullets magically fail to hit their intended target. Other times you'll clearly and visibly hit the animal, and it'll eventually run off. But when you come up to find the blood trail, you'll see that there is no blood. Even though the animal clearly fell the ground and got back up to run away, there's no blood. You may have hit it three or four times, and there's no blood trail. And when you eventually give up, you suddenly notice that you don't see animal tracks anymore, and if you fire a shot at something, it magically misses(although it does expend ammo). Sometimes this can be fixed by fast traveling to an outpost. You might think that the negatives outweigh the positives. Or vice versa. And that's up to you decide. For me, even though the game is currently frustrating at it's present state, I still enjoy it. The visuals are well-done, the animal movements are excellent, etc. But it's also frustrating and a little buggy. The immersion breaks at points(especially when you or a small animal moves through the brush and grass), the game crawls at times, and you sometimes can't hit what your aiming at even if you could literally touch the animal you're shooting at. Would I recommend this game? Yes, with the caveats that this game is currently buggy, but I do believe that the developers will get it fixed. The makers of this game have done well with other games in the theHunter line, and there's no reason to think they won't get these problems fixed. For that reason, I do recommend this game.			"

												tl;dr  I like it, but it is a $30 USD Open Beta at the moment.The things that work in the game are good.  It feels a lot like theHunter Classic from several years back, but without subscription fees. That's the best thing about the game.  There's more here at launch than the Classic game had at launch, which is also a plus.The problem is that it is absolutely riddled with bugs, poor design decisions, and a lack of certain features which made the Classic game fun to play for so many years.  It easily could have used another 6 months to a year of development before release. Or at the very least, released it as an Early Access game, because that's essentially what it is at this point in time. The Good:  1. The hunting is great.  Aside from a few bugs and other minor annoyances.2. Graphics are really nice.  Easy to immerse yourself in the world. 3. No subscription fee. I've been waiting for a subscription-less Hunter ever since the Classic game released.4. No microtransactions or other real money purchases. All the weapons and equipment are able to be bought in game without having to pay real money for them.5. Xbox One controller support.  Seriously this is great. With as much walking and creeping around that you have to do, it's nice to just use the controller and sit back relaxed.  And you can still use the mouse to shoot if you want. I've been using the controller to move, and the mouse for precision shooting. 6. The game is self-contained. No more having to go to theHunter website to setup your hunt and launch. The Bad:1. Bugs. Bugs everywhere.  From sounds not being played, to hunting structures not allowing you to build them, to animals getting stuck in the scenery, it is absolutely riddled with bugs. 2. Progression system feels poorly designed.   It takes forever to acquire enough ""experience"" to unlock new weapons and gear.  13 hours into the release version, I'm level 9 and have unlocked 1 gun, a bullet type, and maybe a caller?  The perks and skills system could use a reworking as well.   Apparently at least one perk doesn't seem to work for anyone.3. No global leaderboards or competitions.  What's the point of harvesting a great trophy animal, if you can't see where it ranks compared to other people, or enter it into a competition? The competitions are one thing that really gave the Classic Hunter such longevity. 4. The missions.  One of the first missions you get is to ""photograph"" a deer for a woman's book.  I want to hunt, not take screenshots. Adding to the frustration is that it seems like you have to do this in a very specific area, and at a very specific distance from the deer. Apparently you get more photography missions later, that get even more specific.  Maybe this could have been more fun if they actually modeled the camera like a real world DSLR set up for wildlife shooting. Instead the game's camera is basically the HUD removed, and replaced with a grid. No zoom controls that I could see.  So basically your smart phone from 5 years ago had more features in the camera than this one.I'm pretty much ignoring the missions right now unless I accidentally trigger one.Could be Better:1. A lot of things could use a bit of rework or tweaking.  One thing I'd like to see added is more fast travel options. If I build a hunting stand somewhere, I'd like the option of fast traveling to it like you can do with the outposts. If the devs don't abandon the game, and continue working on it, it has a lot of potential.  I mostly like what is here now, and I could potentially spend a lot of time with this game.  It wouldn't take a lot to flip the thumbs down to a thumbs up. Mostly fix the glaring bugs and maybe tweak a few of the systems in game. That's not asking much.  I just have a hard time fully recommending the game in its current state.			"

												Ok I dont normally write reviews but for this one I felt I had too based on others negative comments as I nearly didnt buy this game as a result of those negative reviews...If your like me and you always read reviews before buying a game and are normally put off by negative comments about system performance but accept that a new game will always have some bugs then this is aimed at you.I run an I7 6700K 16GB 980TI and have no issues running this game at max settings.The visuals and sounds of this game are simply great and the size of the open world is huge. If your worried about those saying you spend a lot of time walking about doing nothing, yes you will spend a lot of time walking around trying to find animals only to never find them as they see \ hear you coming before you see them and scare them off. Or you find the animal your tracking it sees you and then runs off... But isnt that the point... Its a hunting game its about tracking and not being seen, its about a slow methodical approach, its not supposed to be easy and if it was we would all moan and say its too easy and arcady...In summary I would say you need patience to play this game, practice to get better and yes a few bugs to be patched by the developer. But while your doing all that you will be walking through lush amazing enviroments thinking wow the grass and trees actually move with the wind in the right direction and I need to pick my path so I dont get heard stomping around unlike other games.As for bugs I have encountered three so far:(1) GAME DOESNT ALWAYS LET YOU LEAVE A MENU WITH ESC LIKE YOU SHOULD. For this I found choosing another menu topic and then hitting ESC works fine.(2) MAIN MAP GOES FUNKY OR DOES NOT START CENTERED ON YOU. For this I simply zoom out then back in again or exit and re-enter main map and it is fine then.(3) DIFFICULTING SWITCHING WEAPONS & ITEMS FROM STORAGE TO BACKPACK. By far the biggest bug I have found and only way to resolve is keep entering and exiting storage until it will let you select and drag an item to your back pack and only do one item at a time before exiting and coming back. THIS IS STILL NOT A GAME BREAKER.....			"

												An early game review:So i think most people reviewing this negatively are being way dramatic about the state of the game. It's a bit buggy but it's nothing that cant be fixed with a good few patches.This game is one of the most beautiful games out there right now, runs fine for me personally, quite well really.Points starting from bad to good:- Yeah there are bugs, for sure. Menu buggitude, people sayin bears are bugged a bit too. And whenever i would harvest an animal my game settings would get reset. Im hopeful these things can get fixed pretty easily tho. As far as stuck animals go, as a game developer, problems like this can be really difficult to solve and are common in a ton of games. I think they should maybe look into it but im not going to blame them too hard if i see the occasional stuck animal. i only encountered one stuck animal in my play time and it was just a dinky rabbit.Edit: After some more time i have noticed a few more stuck animals which is unfortunate but not game breaking really, id say youd end up seeing one stuck animal per 2 hours or so of gameplay. Some more bugs as well such as scope clipping and bugged animation on scope zoom, some fps drops wen tracking animals long distances using the phone thing, and game freezing occasionally, sometimes recovering other times not. - Some people talking about the game being too easy and too many animals but id like to know what game they were playing because for me, trying to get a good shot and then not being able to and spooking the animals and then having to track em down for like an hour without seeing anything,, i dont think the game was too overflowing with animals. However there are a lot more animal calls sometimes it seems, which i think is fine and turning off the audio visualzation is good idea as well.Edit - A little more detail on this: Sometimes there can definitely be quite a few animal calls, a lot more than were in theHunter classic. Personally i dont really have a problem with this as they are just calls, and they arent distracting if you have the vocal visualizations off. While running around you are likely to never actually see any of the animals calling unless you run into a field where there may be a few animals grazing (but this doesnt feel unrealistic to me at least) but it does hark on to my point about sound where animal calls are louder than they should be really. Maybe putting the calls on a seperate audio slider or something. Its also important to NOTE: if you hunt out an area and scare off animals its totally quiet out there. So in all, i still dont feel there are ""too many"" animals as the likelyhood of encountering one is not astronomically high or anything.- I've seen some people say its lacking content? But from what i can tell the maps are huuge and vary pretty good in the areas and there are a fair number of animals to hunt right now, as well as a fair amount of weaponry. The game is not like a full price AAA release, its half that in fact, and, if you were to compare it to theHunter classic, this game is a bargain. If you wanted to do any of the stuff in this game in classic youd be paying for a membership and paying real money like $5 per weapon. The game has plenty of content for $30 with more to come in dlcs. -This game however, does not have a lot of the features that classic has in terms of competitions and leaderboards and community. I think this is intentional and likely to stay that way. Both games serve a purpose, and the purpose of this game is not to be exactly like the last one, but a more standalone experience not tied down to microtransactions and a separate launcher with community stuff and accounts and all that jazz. This may turn some of the more hardcore hunters off, and if it does, then i dont think this game is for you.- Does not have free look to detach look direction from walk direction. That would be a veryyy nice thing to have and i dont know why it isnt in already.- Uses a progression tree in terms of weapon perks and various skills. This is a highly subjective way of doing it but i think it is a fine way to do it. I dont think its anything special and is highly debatable but i dont think it should be a turn off. It just allows for progression of the game and your character, which by the way, theres just about no character choice options... this easily seems like one of the most underdeveloped things. but eh.- Sound is very immersive and well realized. Ive seen some people complain about the sound being bad somehow but this is crazy talk if you ask me. Maybe im just not hardcore enough of a hunter to really understand but i think some people are just babies.Edit: while i still think sound is very good, some things ive noticed after more time are music cutting out randomly, bear calls being cut short, and sounds of russling and animal calls being a bit too loud.- A quick graphics review: The game is gorgeous. Hands down the best nature ive ever seen in a game. If i had to gripe about graphics at all as a hardcore graphics enthusiast, shadows are pretty blocky, but they can get away with this because there is a ton of foliage to break up the shadows so that you wont notice unless you reeallyyy look at them. Still a higher res shadow option could be nice, but i think they used resources freed by using lower quality shadows for more impactful features elsewhere. The clouds if you look at them too hard are obviously just moving textures in the sky but whatever really the game is about nature not clouds and they look pretty good when not viewed under scrutiny. Water reflections are a bit low res.. i know reflections can be intense but at least an option for some higher quality reflections would be nice. Also about reflections, and this can be an issue with water effects in a lot of games, around edges of objects where water is in the background there is a weird halo around them, not a super big deal but very noticable. No option for anti aliasing??? this is a weird one but i guess there is AA applied somewhere at least, maybe tied to quality setting, but not cool at any rate. That being said, i havent really had any issues with aliasing, its not a jag fest like some games are. And you would think this would be too with all the foliage. And don't even get me started on the foliage, its so dense and detailed and even reacts to animals and players to the point where animals leave paths through the grass as they walk, easily the best foliage ive ever seen in a game. Overall, Beautiful game.I think that covers most things.Conclusion:The game is pretty good for the price. A must have if you like walking simulation and hunting experiences.Perhaps hold off for a month or two until some of the more glaring bugs and finicky-ness is sorted out if that kind of thing bothers you.

												The Game is really cool and fun, im not sure if there is an option to put out your own blinds and feeders, it would be really awesome if there is an option to do so. THe graphics are great, the framrate has micro stuttes for me, but im getting constant 60 fps, ultra 1080p with my gtx 1070 and my i7 6700. I wish they would add a vehicle like a atv or utv to make getting around easy and fun. This is the most impresive hunting game i have ever played and really excited about the potential, these devs really know how to make a good sim hunting game. I would definetly recomened geting this game if you are at all interested in hunting/fishing, amaizing experience all around. This is my very early thoughts of the game as time goes on i will most likely write another, im new to ""The Hunter"" games i dindnt pick up the f2p classic because of the micro dlc, i love the one time pay.

												The Hunter was and is still the most realistic hunting sim with the release of Call of the Wild. You can start in one of the two gigantuous reserves, in the 2 hours I've played so far I've just seen a very small part of it. The whole game is about waiting for that right moment to take your shot and is very zen like to play overall, since you have such beautifull surroundings.I was really hyped when I saw the upgrade in the graphics compartment and even more important NO MORE LICENSES!!Where is this review coming from you wonder, well I used to play the original and really enjoyed it with many hundreds of hours. Don't be alarmed by all the negative reviews, since the game is still under development. The game is surely no arcade shooter do not be silly everyone, the ingame helpers are great for newer hunters and can be turned off accordingly under the gameplay menu.For 30 euros you cannot go wrong here, since you have full access to all the species and stuff you need to hunt them. 9/10			"

												This game has a lot of bugs, needs serious polish, and feels like a beta.  That being said, this is the 1st decent hunting game released since theHunter, the market doesn't really have any competition.  Cabelas, hunting unlimited and games like that are too casual to be taken seriously.  This game has potential, its still fun even with all the bugs.  If your a nut for hunting games like I am this game is for you.  If you don't like hunting games, or like arcade hunting games, this isn't for you so don't buy it.			"

												Incredible graphics and sound design along side some great gameplay features make this the best hunting game out there and a must-have for any real life(or not) hunter.I've played theHunter since 2009 so I was very hyped when they first announced this. I've only experienced one bug thus far and my game hasn't crashed yet.Definitely recommended.			"

												I so badly want to give this game a good review but in it's current state I can't.  At first everything was great, but the longer i've played, and then stepped into multiplayer, the amount of bugs, gamebreaking bugs is staggering.  Its almost as if the 90% of the development time went into making the game look pretty (and it does).For one, deer can very easily get stuck or spawn being stuck.  Out of the 12 deer I have found 4 have spawned into an object making them a free kill, and 2 have wandered into a wall or rock making an easy kill.  The animations are equally bad, there is many times where animals are doing their moving animation when they are standing completely still, it just looks really ... out of place when you see an animal moonwalking.  They can also be quite dumb and not even notice you shooting at them.When you enter the systems menu it says press ESC to quit but you can't, it doesnt work, you have to click on options again to re-enter options to escape.  On the main map the waypoint you can place down is invisible on your huntermate (and completely invisible in multiplayer to everyone else) and doesn't show up till your very close to it.  You can't exit back to the main menu (to join multi) you instead  have to completely quit the game (same with switching from multiplayer to single) ...Then into multiplayer where is when more bugs appeared.  One of my friends for literally no reason moves at slower then everyone else when we do the same thing (has nothing to do with weight, he is a starter character too).  You can't join friends game as you spawn under the world when you try to join from friends.  You can't unlock any locations or waypoints or outposts in another persons game (only the host can).  Sometimes there is large dysync issues between the animals.  The textures and animations for player models are all over the place its hilarious at times, one of the characters shoe textures are linked. Switching from bow to rifle causes your rifle to be unable to zoom in on your rifle so you have to relog to fix it, making it impossible to use your bow and rifle at the same time.Like I can go on and on, this is stuff that shouldn't even pass alpha yet it made it into release, its extremely troublesom that a company cares SO little about its product its willing to release it in this buggy and unfinished state so mass amount of people will return and downvote the game ... what the hell were you guys thinkingI will still play this game because I am enjoying it, but I am downvoting it because you should avoid this buggy mess till its fixed (and i'll change my review then)			"

												Over 40 hours on record. Still plenty of things to do.That's a good start for a review! :)So first of all, you need a pretty powerful machine to have this monster of a game run without crashes. I'm using an i7-7700 with a GeForce 1060 and 16 GB of Ram. Game crashed only once since I got it, which was after 6 hours of play and on patch 1.1, so a long time ago.The 2 reserves are amazingly detailed, and with patch 1.3, 4 and 5 the hunting part became more accessible. This feels great and immersive, and I have friends getting new computer equipment just to play this.Finding the outposts is one part of the game, which will get you on the road for quite some time. Outposts are still (unfortunately) the only way to fast travel, so to complete your missions, you will need them. Just finding one might get you more than 15+ minutes, especially without using cheat maps and going by all the lookout stations.The game, the animal tracking (dead rabbits to follow when going after coyotes since 1.5! Yeeah!), the shooting, rifles and bows, it's all good....Could use more animals to shoot...Ducks, Geese...Meh, even fishing could be cool in there...Enoy this version as much as possible, because I don't think the console version coming up has any chances to deliver.A good and solid 8 out of 10.

												Excellent hunting simulator... For the most part. Real hunting involves patience, and so does the hunting in theHunter: CotW. But that patience also has to be extended to the acquisition of all the gear, which requires a great deal of grinding to eventually access. Also, unfortunately, the game does have a few UI and menu bugs(like changing the FOV back to default after alt tabbing). But overall, I find it to be a relatively challenging and engaging hunting sim, with possibly the mosts realistic foliage I've ever seen, and it's always satisfying when you land that perfect vital shot into your quarry's heart. If you have patience, you will love this game. Otherwise, probably not.			"

												So in it's current state I can not recommend  theHunter: Call of the Wild™. Right now the game is a bug-ridden mess with terrible UI. The whole experience has a very early access feel to it.Other than that the graphics and the scenary are really pretty. But that shouldn't be the reason for a purchase.I say just wait for now and don't buy. Wait few weeks. Maybe by that time the game is going to be patched and some of the nasty game breaking bugs will be fixed.			"

Product received for free
theHunter: Call of the WildGameplayIt needs to be out of the way first, theHunter: Call of the Wild is about hunting wildlife. If you are okay with that, then the game is going to be pretty much what you expected. I played the original Hunter quite a while back and I was not able to get into it for some reason. theHunter: Call of the Wild seems much more streamlined than the previous game which was pretty inviting for me as well as new player to the series. theHunter: Call of the Wild puts you in the boots of a Hunter in a huge open world with the prospect of hunting virtual wildlife. That is pretty much all the story that is present in the game, because even after the narrator telling you a few lines and giving you some quests, it is pretty vague. Do not go in expecting a brilliant narrative adventure out of this game. Now, how does the actual hunting holds up.For the most part, the hunting in theHunter: Call of the Wild is pretty solid. You get all kinds of tools at your disposal to hunt down the surprising less diverse wildlife. From noise maker to sprays to attract your prey towards a location and then putting a bullet through their lungs, that is the game. theHunter: Call of the Wild does falter in the skill tree it uses to unlock all these fancy tools and you really need to grind your way by murdering quite a lot of fauna.  This requires a lot of patience and time and might frustrate some players. You can unlock Far Cry 3 like towers which show you points of interests on that particular part of the map. The gun recoils are nice and feel quite good to use.Don’t expect to go in all bullet blazing though like a Call of Duty game. theHunter: Call of the Wild requires you to be patient and wait for the creature to be at a perfect position when you take the shot. The animal can even run away wounded and you will have to follow its blood trail to track and hunt it down. theHunter: Call of the Wild is at its best in these moments, I remember trailing a rare bear for some time following a blood trail it left and finally catching it a water body it came near to drink. It keeps you immersed in these moments and truly feels like something special. The wildlife is also very quick to react and they make the world a living breathing one. But in theHunter: Call of the Wild you’re basically like a god. It is nigh impossible for a creature to kill you unless you stand right in front of a bear. Even the fall damage from a high outpost isn’t enough to actually kill you. I felt bad for these poor creatures who were just waiting to be preyed upon. There is no food requirement, nothing that can force you to tense up. You can go hunting in the night and there will be literally no other danger. While there is plenty of wildlife to hunt, the diversity is pretty low. More often than not you will run into yet another bear or deer and it gets very repetitive after a while. You also have to walk a lot which is expected but it won’t please most of the audience. It is not helped by the fact that theHunter: Call of the Wild is extremely buggy. I can’t recall how many times a creature clipped through the trees, my bullets just whizzed past the animal’s lungs without hurting it and the constant crashes are enough the annoy anyone out of their wits. While the multiplayer works fine when playing with friends, it seems that this game is not really made for it. Too many hunters spoil a game and it is very much true here. VisualsVisually theHunter: Call of the Wild looks stunning. From the god rays of the sun to the gentle breeze flowing through the forest, it is one of the prettiest games I’ve played. The animal models are also really stunning and the game just takes your breath away quite some times with the beautiful vistas it presents. There is a fair amount of visual pop in and there are some really hilarious visual glitches which might break your immersion sometimes but overall it is pretty beautiful. What is a letdown though are the human models in multiplayer. They look like someone put a bunch of dolls in a jungle and that does help the game.SoundExcellent. From the animals sounds to just the rain pattering on the leaves, everything is done beautifully. The only trouble is when you walk through a water body which is when your shoes make more sounds than a bear who is ready to mate. But overall it has an excellent sound package.OverallI can’t help but like theHunter: Call of the Wild. It has its problems and it does certainly feel like an early access game but if you want a proper hunting game, theHunter: Call of the Wild should be your choice. It needs some polish and more content but as it stands, it is a solid hunting game which sports outstanding visuals and excellent sound design. It is not for everyone though and you should keep that in mind if you are purchasing this game.

												It has the most beautiful forest I have seen in a game yet.Multiplayer works pretty well (2 players).Walking trough the forest feels AMAZING. Not only the graphics, lightning and weather effects but also the bushes trees and grass, which react to your and the animals movement. Hell, I could play this game just walking around in the beatiful environment. In high grass you can clearly see where you or animals have traveled, as a path will be visible. The sounds of the animals are spot on as well. If you turn off all the help such as highlighting of spotted animals or trails, the immersion is pretty good. However, there are some bugs, for example the attacking animation of european bisons seems to be a bit broken. Some time the multiplayer might crash as well (I had one akward moment where i coulden't see any more prey or animals downed by the other player but bloodtains and stuff were visible, or one time where the headlight went on and i coulden't switch it off). And in multiplayer its seems like only the host can discover places and build stuff. They will be marked for the other player in his session but he cant get XP from them or fast travel to newly disovered huts, only when he visits those locations in his self hosted games he can that.Still, the immersion, the graphics and the gameplay feel spot on and I can only recoomend this games to players who enjoy the tension of searching for a target and don't mind spending much time walking in a beautiful virtual environment.Sure there are some bugs but restarting the game always helps and within the 14 h playtime on clock they diden't happen that frequently (maybe 4 restarts needed and 1 crash). Which I can forgive as they still continue working on the game.			"

												The game is in BETA status atm. I would like to give a neutral rating if that would be possible. I had and have fun with the game, but there are tons of bugs and problems atm. On the other side this game has so much potential. If u like the Hunter and hunting aka slow paced gameplay overall and have a good pc and can live with a not perfect game you can buy it, especially its not expensive. The Devs can turn this into a Hunter Primal 2.0 Fail Game or they can make the best Hunting game out there. Lets see and hope the second thing happens. "

												I've refunded the game for now, I will repurchase it once the issues I currently have with it are addressed.- No bullet entry/exit wounds ""I'm speaking of dynamic decals"".- Unrealistic bullet penetration, bullets cannot even penetrate the neck of a small deer not mentioning torso shots.- No bullet impacts on any material, also known as splash ""useful for seeing how far you missed your target"".- Performance isn't the greatest 55 fps average on a gtx 980ti msi 6g OC edition and overclocked i5 to 4.2ghz.- Cannot get points for shooting rabbit/birds with shotguns. - No ability to zero your rifle.- Animals do not seem to interact with each other.- Animal AI bugs out making animals run in circles. - Automatic bolt cycling ""It should be set so you have to manually manipulate the bolt to cycle the action"".- Tracking on the map is very buggy. - Animals are capable of running very far distances even though they are seriously wounded and catch some amazing speeds considering their condition.- No ability to change the walking speed to aid in sneaking ""developers check out the system escape from tarkov have implemented into their game, it would be IDEAL for this game, no seriously check it out"".Now to the things I do like about the game.- Amazing audio.- The graphics are very very nice indeed however they start to lack at a distance and leave a lot to be desired in contrast to the up close visuals, up close is truly gorgeous besides the floating rocks.- A decent selection of weapons but something that should be expanded upon.- The weapons feel very nice compared to thehunter: primal.

												Its very ovious now why so few was allowed to beta this game.  But as it goes with these companies is... Why have a Beta and release the game with nothing done to the bugs that was reported?? How is it... You can be walking around hunting and all of a sudden your Rifle just leaves your inventory?? Sound quits for no reason.  Game loads with no sound. Game loads but forgets the Resolution you had set for the game.The folks whom bought the game here on Steam have the option to get a refund before 2 hours played. Others whom got it from Amazon are stuck with a half full glass of dirty water. approached as a cash grab and hope it all gets forgotten.			"

												I usually don't do reviews however, I seen some of the reviews and decided that I should give my input. As an original ""The Hunter"" player I had high hope's for the game. I wasn't disappointed. Overall I think they have some issues to work out but I am having alot of fun with the game. I only have a little over an hour and a half into but I'm having fun.I seen a review about the amount of animal spawns and in which case they are correct...Theres ALOT of animals to start off with. HOWEVER, if you read through the tutorial you will read that the more you hunt the more pressure you start putting on areas. Therefore, hunting will get more difficult as you play.The only bug I have noticed is sometimes when killing bears they don't like to ""die"" they just stand straight up untill you ""trophy"" them. I'm sure theres lots of fixes and updates to come...I can't wait to see what's out there! :D			"

												with a price tag on this game, i cant recommend it as it is now. its is wayyyyyy ""early access"".problems i have been facing in the 8 hours i have played:1)Randomly, after opening and closing the map everything becomes sluggish and wont return to normal unless i pull out the GPS and put it away, not everytime, but still. also, you have the option to place a marker on the GPS map, but nowhere on your HUD does it display the marker, not on your compas or on your gps handheld, so everytime you want to make sure you are still heading in the right direction, you have to open the full page map and check. this is why the sluggish bug is annoying, because you are constantly opening and closing the map.2) invincible animals. I have put multiple rounds into multiples animals and they wont die. I mean, 6+ shots into the vital region of a moose with no effect. a straight up vital shot on a bear, it charged me, stopped and sat down after clawing me, shot it in the head (not joking) and it ran off and procceded to waste over 45 minutes scouting a blood trail until giving up. this is beyond frustrating. I do not know how the mechanics work of an animals health and vital regions, but they are clearly broken. a white tail deer cant be gut shoted 4 times and simply walk it off.3) killed animals dissapear before i can claim them. I have had multiple times were i succesfully dropped a target at a great distance and it took me so long to walk to where i shot it it wasnt there. mutliple times. kill a deer, bear, moose, elk.... spend over 30 minutes REAL TIME walking to it (was on other side of massive lake) for it to not be there.4) weather makes no sense, had a thunder storm with clear skies. constant fog off on all day. rain with clear skies. yes hunting season (fall) can have crazy weather, but not every damn day is a storm of the ages. tune it back a bit please, or give us the option to turn off weather effects5) store inventory is weird and buggy. no notification of a transcation. just asks ""are you sure"" gives yes or no option, but the yes or no option stays up if you click yes and nothing tells you a purchase was made.6) there are still mechanics in this game from when it was the free-to-play. you can rest at a cabin to fast forward time, it has a cooldown if you use it often, but has option to spend cash to override it, didnt remove any of my game currency when i used it, so i think its still left over from f2p. this might also be why the marketplace is all goofy, still havent transitioned over from their microtransactions.7) some of the ""immortal"" animals"" show back up dead after a fast travel. but its beyond annoying. a huge part of the game is tracking, when you claim an animal it removes all the tracks and blood spots of that animal. but witht eh above problems it makes tracking a shot animal impossible. you have an entire traits tree you can invest in for it, but with no animals dying when shot, or disappearing, it leaves massive amounts of previous tracks and blood trails that constaly overlap fresh game trails, ruining the game.8) guns haveing confusing stats. i hunt, so i have some knowledge about calibers and which you would use for what, but i doubt everyone who buys this game does, and the stats for rifles dont really have a ""firepower"" category for the less gun savy people. or atleast a ""recommended use for the following animals: x,y,z"". and with how grindy this game is to unlock and purchase guns, it sort of needs that to avoid wasted purchases and just user friendly UI9) all animals are the same model, there are no ""big"" or ""small"" bucks, all look like monsters until you go and claim them and see the points givent. this is a hunting game, there should be spikes and two pointers and all that.at the end of it, id play the eff out of this game if where fully complete, but is far from it. i have 8 hours logged, and about 5-6 of those hours are tracking down blood trails of immortal deer or hiking to dead ones that aren't there. ultimately save your money and see if it comes on sale for a summer or winter steam sale, because they have months of patches they need to do before its ok to play.

												This is the most beautiful game I have played in some time. I would say that the game is quite modestly priced for what it provides, but it is clearly a hunting experience more than a hunting game - so it's not going to be a game for everyone.Headshots at low calibre ""bug""Most of the negative reviews I see claim ""bugs"" for what is actually how ballistics work in the real world. Example: lower calibre headshots will often not kill an animal. Many of the animals use their heads for fighting for goodness sake! I have (in real life) shot goats in the head and have the animal up and leave. The skull on many animals is very thick and therefore you're aiming for the heart/lungs.Negatives:- The Skill/Perk/XP/Points system is insane. Obviously, this is a leftover from the game having P2W/F2P mechanics which I am glad they dropped. But it's left us with a pretty terrible and confusing system that is incredibly convoluted. It doesn't rise to the point of a negative reivew, but it's close for me.- Multiplayer is a little buggy at times. Not overly so, and it's been acknowledged by the devs and they're clearlying targeting patches to this. It's still very playable and enjoyable.- The range of weapons available is pretty low.- The amount of equipment available to upgrade you weapons was much lower than I was expecting. While some of this would be quite ""game-y"", I was expecting being able to customize your weapons and equipment more according to how you wanted to play.Positives:+ The game is the most beautiful game I have played a in a long time, hands down. They're using dynamic color grading, volumetric lights, dynamic shadows... I mean just everything and the results are superb!+ The map(s) are staggering in their scale and attention to detail. They're hand made and they are huge. Much bigger than ArmA.+ The performance of the game on a high-end PC is excellent. Don't expect to run at ULTRA on current gen hardware, and don't be mad about that! The game is made in such a way that it's going to grow with hardware and that's great.+ The pacing of the game is really superb. It strikes an excellent balance between requiring patience and keeping something happening to the player.+ Post kill review screen. You see the pose, entry, and damage modelling for what you killed. Absolutely amazing and makes your kill ""story"" fantastic.+ Tracking is exciting and the classic ""easy to do hard to master"". This is a well designed mechanic that leads to excellent pacing.ConclusionIf you are looking for an arcade game, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a hunting game this is a fantastic find. Even better with friends! It's modest price is worth is alone for how beautiful the terrain is to explore.			"

Posted: February 19
												[Edited 20/02/2017 1711hrs]I'm not usually inclined to write a review but i feel i ought to for this game, i will do my best to keep this updated as time goes on.For those of you that have played thehunter classic i wouldn't recommend it, for those of you that havn't played thehunter classic i still wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend, there are far too many things that the classic has or did better that dont exist in this new release to make it worth buying. A visual representation of where my view on this game is at the moment. I don't recommend  | I recommend[--------------------------//-|--------------------------]Pros:- Jumping! brilliant feature! Having the ability to jump up onto rocks above open terrain, go prone and wait for unsuspecting prey is a brilliant feature, personally i much prefer looking at terrain for firing positions than using the pre determined structures.- Not having to use your Huntermate to track animals, although it does aid you with an easy to follow cone of direction, you can quite happily walk with your rifle in your hands and track animals which helps dramatically in reducing the time to take the shot, nothing worse than cresting dead ground to find the animal standing mere metres away, with only your phone in your hand.- Having Need zones on the map - whether it be drinking, sleeping  or eating, you are given a time period in which animals of that type will use these need zones,which helps dramatically at ambushing prey and also giving them a less random feel, they live somewhat structured lives.- A few different ammo types per weapon, allows you to pick and choose which type of arrow or round you would prefer to use, Softpoint or Polymer.- Easy to see and understand unlockable skills, this gives an RPG feel to the game as you feel you are progressing toward something, it also gives you the choice in which areas you would like to progress, whether it be stalking or ambushing, and perks for the type of weapons you use most.- Vast expanse of land to hunt on, this game truly does feel vast with two large reserves to hunt on, both with different landscapes.- The sheer amount of animals on each reserve is staggering and i doubt you have to go particular far in any direction from any position in order to find them wandering around.- Animals regularly herd together, the most i've seen so far was about 30 odd whitetails wandering together at the foot of a valley, it truly was a sight to see.- Hunting animals in the same area means animals will start to avoid that area until it has ""cooled down"", animals with their skittish nature will avoid areas in which they feel threatened, you will still see animals in these areas just less of them, and the more you hunt in the same spot the less animals will wander into it.- When walking through particular thick vegetation/trees you hear the sound of your nylon jacket, which is incredibly immersive, however rabbits running through the same vegetation appear the make the same noise, i didnt know rabbits were made of nylon (i will admit that after several years of neglecting ear defense this may just be that my hearing is shot and that the two sounds appear to me as the same sound)- There is a guide available by Daniel which shows you how to make your game less blurry and sharper, im enjoying the game more now that i have wiped the slober out of my eyes.- No microtransactions - probably the biggest selling point of this game.- Heart rate and stances effecting weapon sway, this prevents you from being able to run and gun accurately (not that you would neccesarily want to but a good game mechanic to have)- When in the prone position grass and foliage infront of you inhibits sight picture on target, personally i love this, it requires you to either crawl forward to flatten the grass then crawl back in order to optomise your firing postion, or move to a spot where grass wont effect your sight. - The ability to turn off tutorials / mission system / multiplayer nametags / downed animal highlight / spotting outline / audio clue visualization / spatial tracking cone / Points of interest / need zone icons / track effects. Turning everything off gives you the ability to hunt with your own hearing and sight.- Animals leave ""channels"" in long grass and brush, this helps when stalking or chasing down a wounded animal as an almost perfect trail is left behind.Cons:- Graphics, the graphics are OK but are incredibly hard to run for those with dated PCs, i would go as far to say it is heavily unoptimised. Even with the ability to max any modern released game you will be pushing 30 - 60 FPS with medium/high settings in which the foliage will look less than realistic.- The horrible grind to unlock weapons/lures/etc in the shops - you have to harvest an outrageous amount of animals in order to unlock even the most simple lures or weapon of choice, i feel you should be able to buy any of the kit from get go.- Animals very rarily spook, you can shoot and harvest one only to walk a short distance and repeat, gunshots/running for the most part dont have a very large spook radius.- Fast traveling is virtually non existent which is a pain as you have to take time to travel to need zones or particular favourite spots, the ability to put down tents in TheHunter classic sorted this problem.- No ability to errect your own structures, such as tree stands, 360 stands, ground hides etc, the fact that TheHunter classic has this feature yet the new edition doesn't is a real shame, it feels like a real step backwards.- By Comparison to TheHunter classic there is very little equipment/weapons/lures available, which i hope with potential future DLC will be expanded upon, again a step backwards.- The game states that clothes do not have any effect on whether animals can detect you, this again is a feature that is included in theHunter classic with the addition of Ghillie suits, 3D sneaky clothing etc.- The bugs although not game destroying are rather annoying and with some fairly simple bugs i am astounded that this game was released with them, and that after days after release they still persist is mind boggling.- According to the games sound indicator, you give the same amount of sound crawling slowly as you do running.- No ability to range your rifle to anything other than the pre determined 100m.Overall i feel this game is headed in the right direction but as it currently stands lacks some pretty major components of a hunter game, i feel a mixture between this and TheHunter Classic would be ideal, bring back some of those core gameplay elements whilst also bringing in better optimisation and bringing the grind feeling down to a nice enjoyable level and giving the player more freedom on what to hunt from the get go.Having said all that i still feel a burning urge to make this review even longer and do a side by side comparison of the two games which would show you just many features/gameplay aspects have been removed for the sake of improving the graphics, there are so many!

												Extremely fun so far! I am a hunter myself, and i find the experience very realistic. But keep in mind that since it is a realistic hunting game, it will take extreme patience from the players side to enjoy this.			"

												I absolutely LOVE this game, the graphics, sounds, day-night cycle, weather system, ballistics, animal behaiviour, are very well made. yes, it has some post-launch bugs, but even the big AAA titles have those and getting day 1 patches so thats no reason to bash this game. In my opinion this game is a hidden gem, that with a few patches will become the best hunting sim ever, i already have 20+ hours of gameplay, and i loved every single minute of it, even with the afferent bugs.

												This game is great fun, plays just like theHunter classic. I haven't had any issues with crashes like most others are complaining about, but then again im not playing on a potato.There are quite a few bugs here and there but nothing they can't patch pretty quickly.The only issue i have is the ammount of animals on the Lake map is way too high, im getting warning calls left right and center and im not even moving. I feel like the sound element to it or sight is not working as intended.But in all the game is amazing, looks amazing and runs amazingly.P.s who the hell done the UI design lol? an apprentice?EDIT: They have fixed quite a lot of bugs now with the latest 1.1 Patch. So that's something! Like i said above, these other issues are going to be seen too fast.			"

												So, before I get into this, for some unknown reason it is showing myself as having far less time than that I have clocked on on AMD Raptr.... I have tons more hours and have been playing a fair bit!So let us dive in by starting with the basics!Graphics: The graphics off this game are amazing! Seriously they are so good that you can only wish you can play on max to truely enjoy the game for what it really offers, thankfully I can so on this basis I would say the graphics alone are 9.5 out of 10 because they are that good!Audio: The guns sound good, the animal noises are good, rain, thunder, wind all are good but there are problems.  Example, you can hear the rain hammering down when walking but turn around and no rain sound at all, face forward and raining.. It's spinning the mouse to get different sounds which is amusing but a bad bug from my point of view, so I would say here 7 out of 10!Controls: The controls are simple to get used too, but the menu system controlling is horrible and buggy I found, the same as my wife and close friend.  Controlling through the menu is buggy and glitch as hell but if you are rating the walking, moving, gun, swapping etc, it's spot on so I would say 7 out of 10!Gameplay and everything esle:  Now the game! Yes, this game has it's fair share of bugs and problems.  Some are more problematic than others, while some are just pure annoying!Right now as I write this review, if you start a solo game and want to change to multiplayer, you have to physcially close the game down and reopen it and select multiplayer... The same the other way around! Once in a game there is no backing out to the main screen, silly idea!Walking and the level of detail though in this game is amazing.  The grass moves when you go through it, the same as tree's and the grass leaves an imprint on the path you have followed.  Seriously the level of detail is amazing!There are two worlds and not enough animals I found! One German world (Which my wife and I with a friend found this world to be the prettiest and hardest to do) and an American world which seems bland but both worlds seem to have barely any animals in them... I think if I remember correctly there are 12 animals in total in the game and it is 6 per world, which sucks.  The worlds on the other hand are MASSIVE.  It takes a long time to walk around and often get bored a little walking and side tracking to look for fun stuff.  You can fast travel to a safe house if you got them unlocked, but that is ONLY once you unlocked it.There are no vehicles in the game which sucks because they would be amazing to have I feel like many others and many others not, but then it is your choice if you wanted to use them!This is a slow paced game, so no run and gun.  Expect to take a long time, going slow (Which is often frustrating for me at times because it feels so slow I need to sprint)Would I recommend this game? If you are a big fan of hunting games and want something that is going to draw you in and keep you focused and enjoy a slow pace simulation style game then this is the game for you!I am swinging towards a 78% yes because it is unique and offers a fun amount of hours in the game! It is also multiplayer which is a lot more fun as we know with others.  Just the bugs are slightly annoying right now, no vehicles and limited hunting is a little off putting, otherwise good job!

												Lovely game, stunning graphics.Please do understand i love the game, i will keep playing but this should not have been released yet.We should be spammed with hot patches , but the patches are far betweenFull of gamebreaking bugs.- Tracks disappear when there is to many of them.- You can not save the game where you at, so it you have to walk to area where you was hunting again if you restart the game. (pitcha a tent and sleep trough the night/saving the game would be nice)-It did not run stable on my high end gaming machine, on my server i do get the +60 FPS in Ultra stable.-Some menu items doent stick and switch back to a previous or the default value,-Animals get stuck in trees, edge of the water or in some deadend parts of the map.Beside those there some annoying glitches and things.-Sometimes your scope glitches.-Sometimes your stuck in the ground comming out of the map (a jump fixes that) -You can buy one scope and fit it on multiple guns.-Animals sometimes act like idiots, just skipping about or not moving at all when a gun is fired near them.Some stuff also need work or clarification.-I spend more then 14 hours gametime to get a picture of two bears-The numbers for the gun and ammo specs do not make any sense to me.-An ingame tutorial would be much appreciated-Most hunting stands and blinds are in spots that dont make sense, some look out on a big tree or a rock. If you would go trough the trouble putting one up you make sure you have a premium unrestricted view.-The animals should interact more. I have seen a bear sitting and a dear bumped into him but he did not care at all.And last but not least;IT FLIPPING RAINS TO MUCH.This is a game, a single player game, let us choose if we want it to rain or not.It rains in real life, it is depressing, why would i durring my game time have it rain too?It is not even a realistic weather pattren, it flipping rains for 45 mitutes in an hour.If it would rain for a whole day in 1 in 15 game days it would be fine but how  it is done now is ridiculous.My faith in the ""no rain"" menu button that actualy sticks in a future patch is extreme high.Ofcourse it all going to be fixed and all will be honky donkey, but this should be tested before they relased the game.I do not want to participated in a payed betatest games anymore, this  game almost feels like a beta on the moment.Normaly i would have waited or not even bothered to write a review, but the review and the tumbs down maybe urges the Devs to put in some hours to fix the urgent things and keep us, the customers, informed. (known buglist, ATE for patches, much more official info on the proggress}/rant  "

												Sorry bit of a long one The Hunter call of the wild is one of the most stunning games graphical I have seen  in a long time the views are stunning which gives the game a real feel I have spent a long time just walking around and soaking in the amazing views form the lookout points and just watching the day go by sad I know but hay paid my money my game to play.The gun physics are good not being a hunter in real life and not having any time around real firearms can’t honestly say what a real rifle should do whist crouching behind a tree trying to shoot a moose at 150m but for a game they feel nice the rifle recoil seem fair and the bullet travel seems fair what has to be remembered is that this is not a FPS this is a hunting game so no 360 no scopes here the game is trying to simulate a real hunting feel (as stated never hunted so what do I know lol)The animals look real nice even though their behaviour is some time is not realistic never seen a deer walk round in circles four times but on a whole they seem to do as they should solo walks and group feeding and resting Now down to the pros and consProsGraphicsThese are amazing great textures on the animals the map is first class the grass bends beneath you and the animals Weather The sunny days look great with the sun shafts coming though trees and structures, the rain affects look amazing and the thunder sounds kudos to the sound engineers AnimalsThe animals are modelled and animated to a level which cannot really be complained about the behaviour of each species is slightly different every animal will give a warning call just to let you know you are getting to close but the red fox will be gone before you can even see it the bison on  the other hand will stand they ground for a little longer and may even turn the tables on you with you get them cornered Equipment They is a good selection of weapons in the game ranging from rifles to bows you start off with a single rifle for free and the stock ammo is free to buy the other weapons unlock on a rifle score points system the news guns are expensive which depending on your view is a good or bad thing my view is that this is a good thing as this makes you weigh up the options whilst buying new equipment thing like new calls will bring in small less value targets but with the numbers you can harvest will bring your money back up but this will is countered by the problem that hitting larger targets with a smaller calibre weapon will mean you have to track a wounded animal further cutting down on the number of harvests on each visit Cons Weather It rains a lot in this game be this just that the sound engineer had to spend days getting rain and thunders sounds so they put a lot in to make in worth their while I don’t know but it just seem to  rain all the time Animals I have seen on a few sessions animals getting stuck on trees and bushes I know people will say easy kill but in a game that is so amazing to look at a black bear doing the running man at a tree breaks the immersion Other Just a couple of things that made me scratch my head when I saw that they we not in the game at release and sorry to the devs if these are been implemented after this review (as if they read this lol) track ir not supported this was supported in the last the hunter title but has been replaced not to much of a problem as this do’s not really affected the game play but would be nice to have the ability to look around whilst walking as in real life, also the trophy shot has gone which was a bit of a surprise as the photo with your kill is a big part of hunter sharing with friends and other hunters a like I have seen an option on the main menu for a gallery which i have to hope means that it will make a return in a later patch My view The hunter call of the wild is the stepping stone from the hunter we all wanted this is not a game for people that are wanting to just walk in to a field and shoot 15 moose and walk away With the success of the hunter series so far this game has the potential to have the same success and in 8 years time have a still booming fan base  "

												The game is glitchy, buggy as heck, continuous frame drops and I have a newer Graphics card and system so that isnt the issue. The sound clips out where either its too loud or all togther you cannot hear any sounds in the game for a bit such as gun shots or animal noises or even the environment, and all together it just was not what was expected which was a major let down. It was upsetting as I wanted to get by and just say ♥♥♥♥ it to the fact that the frame drops happened occasionally and the sound wasn't the greatest but not the worst just more of an annoyance. But when I could not harvest my kills from the obnoxious plethora of animals that would just be stuck running in the same spot or not responding at all, It made it feel unplayable. I had looked forward to this game very much as I was a fan of the orignial TheHunter but this was a major let down and in no way an exeperience like its predecesor. Sadly I would not recommend this game as I thought I would have. 4/10			"

												The hunter call of the wild is a beautiful game. As you walk, you cant just stop looking at your surroundings. Not just for animals, but just to look at the beutiful of the world. This game is so immersive! There are time my heart felt like it was beating out of my chest when you see a big buck or an elk. But with every game there are some drawbacks. One I think the progressive system is realy slow. This can be good or bad. For right now it is ok for the lack of content but when the game starts getting more content it may cause an issue. For gamers who can only paly for an hour or two will have some problems getting all the good stuff. Also the lack of content, its not bad because maby you always stick one gun or weapon and you might never want a new one. The content of animals certainly is not he issue nor the world you can exsplore. Its the weapon chocie. Not as big as the hunter classic which disappoints me but maby soon we will get more. Finaly, bugs. Usually bugs work in your favor. There is no game breaking bugs and also the game runs well. I hope this review helped you decide if you want to become a hunter in The hunter call of the wild. Also this is a must have for people who love hunting games.			"

												This is my second edit of this review, this time I'm going to be bit more in-depth.The game is well worth the $30 price tag. The game is gorgeous and contains 2 massive, interesting, and varied hunting reserves. I have yet to even explore more than 25% of each reserve.In my opinion the game has enough weapons for now, I've yet to use anything other than the starter rifle. The ammunition prices could be a bit more modest but I suppose it does encourage you to conserve ammo and take safe shots.The game still has a few AI bugs and UI problems here and there but after today's (3/3/2017) patch, I haven't experienced any crashes and have had more success in-game as a result of the sneaking fix. This game is relaxing, even if you don't enjoy hunting in real life (I don't) this game is still very enjoyable. Take a break from hunting and go out and explore for some artifacts, lookout points, and lore points.A few things I would like to see in the game:-Portable Campsites - Pack a tent for a mobile outpost (does not have to contain shop)-Tree Stands-Jonboats or canoes for navigating the rivers, lakes, and ponds of the world.-Fishing-Able to complete missions and unlock outposts/lookout points in multiplayer.See you on the trails!

												I must say its a great game, best hunting simulator I have ever played. People are moaning that its got its bugs and the developers are working on that as they are bringing out patches quite often to fix this which I dont mind. Compared to the classic 'TheHunter' its a very big step up, much better game play and NO RETRICTIONs on the animals which you can kill. Some people may get frusted if they have never played a hunting game like this because if you run everywhere and keep calling the deers they will just run away, to those people I do say pace yourself and leave the calls to every 4-5 in game minutes for calls and before you know it you will turn around and have a whole load of deer surrounding you, I wish I was joking but  its happened to me multiple times now. TLDR yeah it may be buggy but its a damn good game. Buy it			"

												A game where genuinely there are some beautiful scenes, but patience and understanding mechanics are required. In this case, hunting expierence helps too.But don't not buy this game if you have never hunted. It is a beautiful game in itself. I find myself more looking at nature and enjoying the beauty of this game more than aiming and shooting at something. But then it can be difficult to get your target in your sights. But from my expierence in the woods, that's what I am used to.After putting a few hours into The Hunter: Call of the Wild, I enjoy it. I plan to put more time into it over the years. Visually it is a very beautiful game. If running around looking for the 360 no scope is your thing pass on this game, but if you are looking for a peaceful tranquil game where you can enjoy the simulated nature found inside this game give it a shot. (no pun intended)			"

												Short Review: The best hunting game I've ever played. It does have various bugs that do cause minor inconvenience at times. I simply haven't run into any problems that won't be fixed in a reasonable time frame. I can't play this game without stopping to appreciate the beautiful world they've created. I thoroughly enjoy the shooting mechanics in place for this game. I'd recommend this game to anyone who can appreciate a calm/casual hunting game with a decent amount of shooting mechanic depth. It's got plenty of content and land to explore. If you don't mind walking long distances and slow crouching for some period of time, you'll find this game to be quite relaxing! I expect myself to play a decent amount of this game before I get my fill!			"

												  i miss playing cabela's big game hunter (2002) on the ps2.  This game needs a lot of work and i really hope it does get fixed because its beautiful and mulitplayer will be fun. But all i saw was a deer running beside a bear and then they both get stuck on a tree and the deer takes 7 shots to kill then i kill the bear, then you get xp for both kills. it's poachjing not hunting :D. then after that I was trying to creep up on a elk but it saw me and ran away but it ran to a cliff and fell off and died which was pretty funny but then i jumped off the cliff as well and only lost 25 HP -.- then collected the animal turned around and saw a deer running away from me.  you run into animals way too fast and i even turned off all the hints and tracking stuff so i could be relying on my calls and sent but i still found animals no problem. I just think if they added that you have to buy tags for the animal you want and fix the AI making them not get stuck on♥♥♥♥♥♥and spread them out it will be a great game but for now i say wait			"

												This game had high promise but they have unfortunately decided not to fix any of the bugs from the Beta session several months ago and don't really make any indication that they ever intend too.In addition, there is still no ultra-widescreen support for this game which is unbelievable in 2017, multiple crashing issues and poor performance overall. Alpha release at its best... I would reccommend waiting until they put forth at least some indication that they intend on working on these issues.			"

												[[Edited for typos]]Disappointing and confusing.Great audio and looks gorgeous but the menus were a bit broken (Esc to exit does nothing) and forgot my settings every few minutes. I couldn't reliably reproduce this, it just happened occasionally.Whilst I understand the hearing capabilities of my prey, the Sound Meter at the bottom right suggests that crawling prone through soft(!) grass makes the same amount of noise as running and jumping around in the water or dry underbrush, with a few patches of grass as exception.Crouching makes the same noise level according to the meter, regardless of surface. I think we may be missing a 'creep' pace option, tippytoe style.Gun level mechanic from the last game was better, I dislike the level gated firearms and items (more on that in a sec) and currently I'm not sure what my character is even doing on a hunting range when he messes up his reloads, wasting valuable time. Bit odd.I can't fathom why I need to be level 33(? going off of memory here) in order to purchase wind direction detector spray when the compass automatically shows wind direction /and/ there's a perk for it already.The visiblity icon thing was neat, I suppose.I think I'll stick with TheHunter Classic.

												I bought this hoping it would be The Hunter 2. It's more like The Hunter Lite. It's a shooting gallery with pretty graphics. The difficult hunts that made the original so appealing are replaced with animals everywhere with no sense of self preservation. They call constantly and let you walk right up to them before they run.. And they even call several times specifically to warn you that they are about to run. So you can just run around at a full sprint and wait for the warning calls then stop and shoot them. Often times a shot doesn't even spook near by animals so you can lay waste to entire herds in a short time. The leveling grind also promotes this style of gameplay, needing to both earn ridiculous amounts of cash to buy new equipment as well as needing a ton of XP to unlock the ability to even purchase it. On the plus side its pretty, the landscapes are massive, the draw distance has nearly doubled and the shooting feels a lot better than classic. The game has a lot of potential but this isn't early access, this is a full release and they have no obligation to change anything. This combined with the history of Primal leaves one with doubts about the future of this title. Hopeful doubts, but doubts nonetheless.			"

												Just hit 84 hours, and I think it's time to stop.This game looks incredible, I've found myself taking tons of screenshots, especially for kills I was proud of. Let me be clear here, I don't like hunting, I don't agree with hunting, but this game is SO good that I've put 84 hours into it. The positives outnumber the negatives, but unfortunately the game has one whopping failure. So the game itself looks incredible, I've found myself reminiscing about holidays I've been on due to the realism and immersivety. The sounds fit in well with the setting (even if a few things could be worked on) The maps are huge and have some incredible points of interest that have clearly had a lot of time spent on them. The animals are difficult to hunt and you have to be mindful of many different ways in which you play in order to stalk an animal and get up and close. This is great! Going from scaring everything off in the vicinity to being able to get within 20m of a deer feels like great progress. The guns seem fairly priced, the missions tell you stories that are pretty interesting. You can choose whether or not you want to do a mission - you'd probably spend a good 50 hours walking round and exploring if killing isn't your thing. The game really is incredible. However, 84 hours in I'm here typing a review for a game that I don't recommend. So let me explain. About 20 hours into the game a friend asked me if it was worth buying, and I told them absolutely. 5 minutes later, my game crashes. My entire system crashes and I have to restart my PC manually. Frustrating, a waste of ammo and time, but no big deal. I reload the game, 5 minutes later, it crashes again. I get the frozen screen, sound loop, I can't alt-f4, I can't Ctrl-alt-delete. Again, I have to manually restart my computer. Turns out it's not just me getting this issue, so with the help of the discussions I try what seemed like 3000 different settings changes just to see if the game is playable. Next time I start up the game, I get 4-5 hours out of it then stop playing, seemed like something had worked. Load up the game again, crashes within 30 minutes. To this day I am still dealing with crashes that seem to have no correlation to any setting, any part of the map, any animal, anything. I've changed so many settings at this point that I'm literally just playing inbetween crashes and every now and then it'll crash so many times in such a short space of time I just give up.This game is literally incredible. I've had crashes ever since 16 hours and yet I've still put up with it up until now. But I cannot recommend this game. It's not badly priced, but this game desperately needed to be released as an alpha or beta. It's just not ready. There are some other bugs (floating guns, weird arm twisty thing, animals getting stuck, rocks killing you for absolutely no reason) but these do not break the game. They're few and far between and they're absolutely bearable. Sitting at my PC for 2 hours and having a game crash 30 times within that time frame is absolutely soul destroying. TO SUM UPIf you're patient, love hunting, fancy a walking simulator or even a fantastic hunting sim, then maybe give it a shot. If you want the game to run smoothly and want to play with friends, really really avoid this game. 84 hours and I don't think I'll be launching this game any time soon. I will say, the developers seem hard working and eager to fix the issues but this game was clearly rushed and isn't in a fit state to be released yet. I really hope they can fix it soon because it's such a great game, and has such great potential.			"

												Absolutely loving this game!  Enjoying the fact that there are missions and you have to ""earn"" everything by gaining experience points which can be transfered to skill points to increase your hunting abilities, yes it is a little buggy but it is a fairly new game, the bugs will be ironed out eventually but aside from that it is awesome!  The graphics are quite high so I am having to keep everything set to low to be able to run it on my computer but it still looks awesome and realistic.			"

												Fantastic game. The visuals, when maxxed, are gorgoeus, almost photorealistic. Sure there are bugs, glitches, odd nuances that the game has. These can all be fixed by patches. The base game is fanstastic. The rush of killing a new animal, exploring the open wilderness. As long as they keep updating the game, this will probably be the best hunting game ever made. The game is really really relaxing, if you just wanted to relax before work or bed, hop into this for a little bit. I also hope they support mods, while I highly doubt it, it would be fanstastic to see people add new content. Overall, about 6 hours in, it's a good time killer, and the mechanics of the game are really solid, teh way you can see the kill shots and whatnot. Would recommend.			"

												With only 3 hours into the game as of writing it, theres only so much I can say about it. Currently it feels like a Euro Truck Simulator 2 game, where relaxing and walking around is really fun and enjoyable, the immersion is lovely but as people said below there is  a tiny thing or two that you may want to look out for.Firstly the game might be frustrating if you're new and thinking you can sprint everywhere and noscope stuff, well stop doing that and if you refuse to and keep on noscoping then back into the cesspool of Call of Duty.The game is buggy, quite buggy but it seems fairly optimized with a R280x and 8350 8x core processor, I've yet to see any crashes and i've done most of the three hours in one session so it seems to be pretty solid from my standpoint.Now would I recommend it? Well if you want a game that is just about walking around and hunting with full immersion like listening on trance at a sunday, then hell yeah go for it. But if you want alot more then I suggest waiting until they fixed some of the bugs and add some more content.... What? I liked it! Sorry if you didn't.. jerks..			"

												This game is AMAZING! I love how beautiful it is and how exciting it can be! I love how the skill system works as well as the item shop. Every animal encounter is so much fun. I already have 30 hours and can't stop playing. I haven't even explored 25% of one of the 2 maps. If you are into hunting or like exploring this is a wonderful game for you.However there are a lot of weird bugs in multiplayer and issues with the menu. Its pretty stable on my pc but I've had plenty of issues with not being able to collect my animal that I shot in multiplayer, as well as the shop menu having issues with the item pictures not showing up after double clicking an item. I kinda wish this would have been labeled as a early access because there are a ton of things that are not working right at times. I hate to say that because I don't want to take away from anyone wanting to buy the game... I love it and I really hope the Dev team don't stop putting out updates to fix these problems. I know I'll do my best to put in bug reports!But yeah worth the money in my opinion but that's me.			"

The gameplay turned out also nice for the non enthusiast I was with the theme.I turned a fan of Avalanche studios with Just Cause 2. Was quite disapointed at Just Cause 3, but damn... this one...

												Game looked ok to begin with  , but lack of interaction with the developrer and the developers  recent  hotly contested  hs 2.0 in THC and rendering 20 plus weapons useless to those who bought them with no compensation  makes one question just how much they gonna actaully listen to the community here. With all the current issues existings on both thier games and some for several yrs on THC  i would have to not recommend this game till everything is resolved if they ever manage to do that. And no one has any idea what the price tag for dlc will be but given the insane greed of this company one bet it wont be cheap.			"

												All i can say is Wow.Played for 5min, got stick between two rocks and found myself in a loop of dieing/spawning every 3 seconds unable to open the menu to exit so i had to alt f4 just to exit, now i can't load back into the game because it crashes... I just... wowEdit after actually playing some: Yep bug ridden, no where near the content of theHunter: Classic. what bugs are there don't usually break the game, the pricing system seems abit weird.Looks pretty, only redeeming feature.Still can't recommend either theHunter CotW or Classic, I'll still play CotW only because you don't get extored playing this even though it has ♥♥♥♥ all content compared to classic.Edit 20/02/17:After sinking some 18 or so hours into the game and discovering some things.there's more animals then i first thought just the leaderboard doesn't track every species (not that it updates your kills anyway -_- ) It's still very... just... bugs, some of them funny but some make you want to rage, forinstance. i spent about 30min heading north to get to a lookout to find where that aera's outpost was, the outpost was on the other side of a mission i had so i went into the mission aera and chilled out, called some Fallow to me. i went to go into my settings option to turn my sound back up (because wind and rain will blow your ears out if you have headphones) and the second i hit ""System"" in the menu (where options and exit to desktop options are) the game exited to windows without a prompt, so now i have about a 20-30min run back up to that lodge as i've got a mountain to go around. As it turns out there's a bug that when you press ""System"" instead of opening the side menu that lists Options and Exit to window buttons, it just exits to windows... ♥♥♥♥ my life.The animal pathing is messed up, they're always getting stuck on rocks and running on the spot. and they act like skyrim horses when they don't get stuck.Exibit A

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=867566516Enough said.Some of the things in the game aren't explained properly and some are just worded wrong completely for example, one of the skills you can unlock is called ""I'm only happy when it's raining"" and there's two levels and they go like this.Lvl 1: Decrease visablity when it's foggy.Lvl 2: Decrease visablity when it's raining.See the problem? (This is a perk by the way, not something that disadvantages you), if you don't then my point has been validated.Multiplayer, It's still kinda broken. people are having more luck joining games but as we found out pressing F6 i think it's the multiplayer options for the lobby leader, just pressing that button was booting someone at random from our game so that was fun.Another issue i have is if you join your friend in MP, you both walk upto the other side of the map hunting and exploring on the way. If you find a lookout, lodge, point of interest, You simply can't interact with them which pisses me off for lodges. if you want to unlock that lodge you have to go back to single player and walk all the way back to the other side of the map and press E on it in SP.Speaking of pressing E on things it's a fun little mini game at points of interest, some of them i haven't been able to collect/interact with, some have been fine, others i have to run around them jumping and looking into the sky to get the interact option... and finally how many times andwhat i've been killed by.Wild Animals: 0Skyriming and simply falling down sheer clifs: 0 (I do it allot, fastest way to get down the mountain)Other players: 0 (if you get shot in the face the bullet impact decal is actually cement so go figure, were's actually statues hunting wildlife in the game)Trees: 4, Yes i've been killed 4 times by inanimate trees the second most lethal thing in the game.Rocks: 15, This is encluding my encounter when i started playing which killed me about 9 times respawning me in the same place to die again over and over, other times i'll just be walking along and stand on a rock funny and I instantly die sooo.... yeah.The good :D yes there's actually good.. well kinda.The game is very pretty and being an AMD Processor user i was greatful to realise their new engine actually spreads the load evenly over all 8 threads of my FX8350 and i'm actually maxing out my GTX 1060 running almost everything on ultra.there is however a slight kind of fuzzy ness i think caused by the Anti-Alisasing (for the record i have no idea what i'm talking about but it seems that kind of blurry/jagged edge look)There's also some issues where i'll play along at 50ish FPS in 1080p and then my FPS just tanks to 15-20 and it's eyestraining to play forcing me to restart the game (ofcourse if i haven't gotten to that unclaimed lodge i have to do the walk all over again -_-"").Final Verdict:When this game works, it works in the most epic of fasions and i've had some rather intense encounters with Fallow deer. after following a herd i engaged some distance i finally found one that had dropped but i was then attacked by two cornered fallow, ended up using iron sites at 16m and lungshotting one that charged me while the other charged me right after and got away before i could get my bearings and get shots off in its direction.However in my opinion the game needs allot more polish and it should not have been released in its current state, I feel sorry for my fellow hunters who have to deal with the fustration of this game while it's being fixed and that's if it gets fixed. I've seen on a game news site they were responsible for Just Cause 3 and Mad Max, Mad max never had it's little niggles fixed like getting stuck and just derpy things and the short time i had Just cause i found it aweful to play, the controls and menus were just bad and poorly laid out and it shows how they've made the menus in theHunter: CotW.Edit for update 1.1:This game has become a boring walk around shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥ by removing the work you had to put in to get the best stuff in the game they've literally turned their game into a feature bland theHunter Classic that looks pretty.

												I just wanted to write this quick review - I'm a slightly older gamer than average I guess, so tend not to buy new Games the moment they appear (i.e. I'm a skinflint and remember when Games were £5 new!)...anyway was convinced to buy this as I do a bit of hunting in real life.And WOW am I impressed - stunning graphics ( I play at 4k on a 55inch OLED and it's Fricking beautiful!)Gameplay is good,Animal AI seem pretty good, I've not seen ANY of the many bugs that people have reported from earlier versions.Weapons handling seems very realistic - two small improvements could be the ability to rest the weapon, i.e. stabilise it on a Tree or Rock or whatever with a bipod etc...

												Ok where to start this is a senic almost perfect game. but thats where it end as of now multiplayer is bugged.you cant apply settings in game one example is the aim mode toggle you can change it but as soon as you shoot it goes back to default. the crashes omfg the crashes. the original the hunter had problems for months and i fear this game will be simular to sadly.the where looking for betatesters those surly did a great job well done picking them... over to gameplay this sure have a more arcade angle on the hunting compared to the hunter original. a good thing for getting more players in to it. animal behavior  seems to be really strange in this game compared to the original. the hunter pressure is not working as intended i noticed the more i shoot in a area the more animals i see and hear should be the other way around i think personally i dont like the whole level to get gear thing i think the game would be more enjoyable if i could get stuff♥♥♥♥♥soon as i had money for it. wounder if you should get the game? at the current state i would put the value to $10 so thats my answer.

												This is the first review im writing. The reason is because i was so dissappointed with the Multiplayer. This should have been a early access game in my opinion. First off, the game does not support resolutions above 2000x and widescreens. So you have to downscale and miss the whole graphic part.Seccond off. Everytime you join a multiplayer game you start at the same point, and the game bugs so you cant access the different traveling locations.Been bugged 2 times where im tossed 150 meeters up in the air and die when i land.Also, you cant hunt together with your friends, you actually hunt 1 by 1. If you help spotting the animal, you get no points, xp or credits. You have to hit the animal in order to get XP. "

												This game definitely wasn't ready for release. It's a (pretty bad) beta at best.After reading on the forums that Stefan, one of the developers, refuses to acknowledge one of the most game-breaking bugs (see below) and closes threads, I decided to request a refund.GraphicsThe game is pretty gorgeous looking, that's for sure. Good textures, day/night cycle, dynamic weather, wind moving leaves, grass, etc.I did experience a few minor issues though, like clouds flickering, the handheld occasionally being shown without its display (just the frame) or rain falling right through the roof of a deer stand (how there's still devs in 2017 not paying attention to something like that is beyond me).SoundSounds are very inconsistent in quality. Some sound very realistic with high production quality, others just sound terrible, with static noise at the beginning and/or end of the sound sample (at least when playing with headphones this was easily perceivable).I also repeatedly had issues with sounds ending abruptly (like animal calls or birds chirping) or stuttering, or ambient sounds like wind changing way too fast.Obviously issues like that are constantly breaking someones immersion.InterfaceThe menus are buggy, with buttons not always reacting to clicks. Some options like mouse sensitivity are also a pain to use, since you can only increase/decrease the value by clicking arrows to the left or right. There's no slider or a way to type in a value directly. Annoying, especially if the game doesn't save the settings properly and you have to re-do them the next time you launch the game. There's also no way to go back to the main menu -- you have to quit and restart the game for that (no joke).Several HUD elements don't scale properly when playing on a 16:10 screen. For example, the compass is oval, and markers on the map are oval as well. I suspect people with widescreen-monitors like 21:9 will be affected by this as well.There's also graphical glitches on the map, like terrain textures that aren't properly stitched together, and map overlays that are only partially visible.You can also disable certain aspects of the HUD (like tutorial hints or point of interest markers) or change how animal tracks are being visualized. Sometimes HUD elements can get stuck on your screen or behave strangely if you change the settings and don't restart the game afterwards.Animal AII'm not an animal expert, so I can't talk too much about this topic. But at least on two occasions, after firing a shot, deer ran away, just to come back several minutes later, walking right towards me, coming as close as 10 meters and not notice me at all. Well, I doubt any real animal would do that, unless they are suicidal.There's also reports of animals getting stuck, but I haven't seen that myself in game.Shooting/gunplayShooting seems weird. First I thought I'm doing something wrong, like missing vital organs, since I couldn't even kill non-moving small game from less than 50 meters. I then read in another review that someone was testing the shooting on stuck animals, and had to hit them with up to 6 rounds to kill them, from only a few meters away.A hunting game with broken gun mechanics. Awesome.PerformanceI'm on Windows 7 with an Intel i5-3570K (3.4 GHz, 4 cores, 4 threads) and a Radeon RX 470 (4 GB VRAM). I maxed out all graphics settings, only turned off motion blur. Resolution was set to 2560 × 1600 to reduce flickering of the foliage (native screen resolution is 1920 × 1200).I didn't measure the frames per second, but it was around 30. Which in my book is okay for a slow-paced game like this.ControlsMouse sensitivity is annoyingly low when using binoculars or scopes, even when set to 100 in the settings (the maximum). Maybe it's on purpose to make shooting more difficult, but then at least exclude the binoculars from that 'mechanic'.One severe issue is that you can't walk slowly when using keyboard & mouse, meaning your noise level is always at max when moving, no matter if you're standing, crouching or prone. For comparison, I tested it with my Xbox gamepad and it's fine there, but why would I play a first person hunting game on the PC with a controller?Now, as mentioned at the top of the review, several people have pointed out that issue on the forums, but it seems the developers just try to ignore it and refuse to acknowledge this being a major problem. Which led me to requesting a refund. Because it's bad enough to release a game in a state like this, but then trying to silence or ignore issues... I refuse to support stuff like that.If they fix all these issues (and there's a bunch more I didn't experience personally or forgot to mention) I'll gladly purchase this game again, but until then I recommend everyone to wait and see if the devs get their **** together.

												Fantastic game. There are minor bugs, but I hardly notice them, the graphics are good, and I love the mechanics, such as tracking and AI. There are also the small things, like tall grass being flattened where you walk, that add so much to the game. It is well worth the thirty dollars, and I cant imagine exploring the entire map, it's vastness is overwhelming. My only complaint is that I think there should be more waypoints, I personally am very distracted by the smallest of things, and end up chasing a deer miles off the trail, making it almost impossible to reach my destination.

												Let's get it out of the way first - the environmental audiovisuals of this game are absolutely astonishing. Possibly the most beautifully realised and naturalistic open game world I've ever seen.Unfortunately the artistry, technical prowess and obvious dedication that went into the game world simply don't extend to the gameplay and UI. Quite simply the game should not have been released in its current state as anything other than early access, and the devs would be receiving a lot more support and understanding if it had been.Currently Hunter CotW is a hunting game where you can't quite trust that the casualised hunting mechanics are coming together properly. Bagging or losing an animal because the game glitched out rather than through your own skills or lack thereof kind of defeats the whole purpose. Numerous crashes, bugs, design flaws and gameplay oversights just add additional salt to the wound. I'll give it a positive review because even as incomplete and bug ridden as it is, the immersion from wandering around its incredibly realised world (and occasionally shooting things) is unbeatable. It just has a long long way to go to be considered a finished product.			"

												After 6 hours, as of right now, I can say that if you are interested, you should buy this game now. The occasional bugs are dont stop the game from still being enjoyable, and most of the ""game breaking"" bugs have been fixed, except for the crashing, which for me, I figured how to resolve. HOW TO FIX THE CRASHING: *at least for meAs soon as you start the game, immediately hit continue and dont spend time on the home screen. For some reason that worked for me, and I hope it helps other people. PROS/CONS:Pros: Animals are mostly everywhere making the game at a good pace, not to fast nor slow.Good sound designGood Graphics Wide variety of ammo types for each gunMaps are giantLots to explore INCREASED VIEW DISTANCECons: Cannot distinguish male from female calls unless you unlock the part of the skill treeFemale deer make male deer noisesAnimal AI is sometimes downright stupid, the animals walk in circles, get stuck in rocks ectNoise meter is full when crouching through short grassThats all I can think of right now, but I can say if you want it, get it now			"

												Awesome game! I love the whole concept of it, the graphics are really beautiful. For a game that run's an open world engine I can tell this one has been optimised well. The game always runs smooth and constistant, and the clever AI system really makes hunting all the more realistic. Please be aware that this game is also still buggy although the developers are still hooking us up with updates including fix's and so on. I've owned this game for 2 days and I'm already satisified with my purchase. If your like me and quite like the great outdoors but never really has the energy to do so, then I highly recommend this game. Cheers.			"

												There are problems with this game don't get me wrong but isn't that the case with many titles out there. Take BF4 for example, that game was terrible are launch but it became through many updates one of the most played games out there. theHunter: Call of the Wild is a great game if you are looking to take a break from more mainsteam shooters like COD or BF. What other games allows you the track an animal and stalk it until you have the perfect shot that isnt from 2010 or requires you to buy licenses (sorry fans of the first game theHunter). I know this game has its problems but they have already released 4 updates and are listening to their fan base. The graphics in this game are out of this world and make you feel like you are right there in the action. Don't fall for the people saying this game is terrible for not having the best launch. I have enjoyed this game a lot and once they fix some stuff I will be playing it more often. Highly recommened this for the person that wants to try something new!			"

												i hope u dont consider BEING ANGRY FOR SPENDING REAL MONEY FOR UNFINISHED PRODUCTWITH LOTS OF BUGS AND GLITCHES as being not polite. Oh yes, i am angry. CONFUSIONS:1. Why make the game requires latest graphic card when my high end graphic card can smoothly play much better graphic than this one? My laptop can play Splinter Cell Blacklist ULTRA SETTING without stuttering at all, but even in The Hunter Classic, the medium setting stutters significantly. The Highest Setting in The Hunter is still inferior to the LOWEST SETTING of Splinter Cell Blacklist, at least to my non-expert opinion. I am stand corrected as this confusion might come from my own lack of graphic card knowledge, but if my confusion is based on a fair ground, can the developer do something with/change the engine provider or does this has something to do with the graphic card manufacturers business politic?2. The developer is impressive in inventing a great concept of gameplay. That requires a great deal of creativity and careful fine-tunings. But i am very confused about the sound of some animals, like the Red Kangaroo in The Hunter Classic. When i had first heard the sound of them, i was surprised because i did not imagine such animal would produce that kind of sound, and it sparked some doubt in me too. So i googled and youtubed it. Turned out that the actual sound was very different. I checked lots of videos and none came up with the sound like the one in the game.I thought this game is some sort of simulation so it is really a turn off with that kangaroo sound thing (if it really is different from the real ones)			"

												Awesome Hunting experience! extremely realistic, and while there are a few bugs, they have mostly been fixed in the most recent update. they arent even game breaking so honestly did not regret purchasing with the bugs. Hunting with friends is extremely fun, and the only thing i could ask for is an atv to drive around that would be awesome!			"

												Don't buy it unless you want to feel like you are in Pre-Alpha testing! Freezes, crashes, bullets often don't do damage, Animals will get stuck in bushes or hover over rocks. Setting navigation is awful and clumsy. Switching from an animal call to a weapon will almost always cause your character to get stuck on whatever item is equipped. The list of problems goes on and on.  The landscapes and graphics are amazing at times but ultimately the game is ruined when you track an animal for 20 minutes just to have the game crash or to be unable to switch to your weapon to shoot it.

												It still has some work to do such as fixing sounds, animations, and quest. Besides what there is to work on this game as of release is very slow in pace for to unlock new items requires alot of time and effortAfter some time as I have noticed that the mission reset was from my own doing, for i was using the ""start new game"" option to switch reserves instead of using the map option too. As for my previous comment, the sound issues I have with this game are with the animals, in which i have experianced animals using mating calls as warning calls as well as female animals using the sounds produced by their male counter parts (ie. does grunting). As for my comments on the animations, they are bugged for example animals have delayed or unreponsive reactions to being shot (especially at longer ranges) as well some anmation issues with the callers. Other wise this game is fairly decent but can still use some patching for a better experience.			"

												I was super pumped to play this game, but....When I launched it I knew something was off.  The game seemed fine and had a decent frame rate on high settings.  I started to play and could barely move.  The game was running well, but the character would not move fast.  All the animals were moving at normal speed as well, making tracking and finding animals nearly impossible.  Because the game involves so much travel, I decided to ask for a refund because my character moved to slowly to properly enjoy the game.I have checked online, and this appears to be a common problem.Also, I watched many youtubers play the game before deciding to buy.  They moved MUCH faster and the game looked like tons of fun.If the devs can fix this problem, I would happily play it again.  The hunting itself was great, but after this glitch gets fixed, it could easily be a 4 star game.			"

												It definitely has its issues, mostly related to bugs and some optimization issues, but I've had a lot of fun with the game.  I have no history with the series or hunting games in general really, but I find this game to be incredibly relaxing and immersive.  The visuals and sounds are awesome as well as you watch day shift to night and storms suddenly roll in with high winds and heavy rain.  If you are on the edge it might be worth waiting a bit for another patch or two to roll in and see if it fixes some of the bigger issues, however I took the dive myself despite seeing quite a few negative reviews and don't regret it.Pros:- Great visuals- Immersive sound design- It could just be because this is my introduction to his type of game, but it was a thrill listening for and tracking down animals to kill.  I look forward to some more difficult targets that will require more time.- Feels welcoming to players newer to this style of game with a bit more casual presentation.  This of course could be looked at negatively to veterans of this type of game or theHunter Classic.- Speedy loading times.  I don't even have a SSD, but this game loads from the title screen into the game world very quickly which surprised me considering how large the map is.- Various challenges, quests, and lore discovery locations are sprinkled throughout the map, giving some extra activities outside of general hunting.- The two hunting reserve maps are massive in sizeCons:- The biggest issue right now is that with mouse and keyboard controls you have little to no control over the speed of your movement in each of the stances (walking, crouching, prone).  If you have a controller and test the movement out on that, you'll notice with analog control you can move the stick varying amounts to control your speed and subsequently the amount of noise you make.  Considering how important it is to try and remain silent in a hunting game, this is a pretty big issue at the moment.  Either controller movement needs to have that disabled and rework the amount of noise each stance makes, or keyboard needs an keybinding to slow your pace to a level that makes minimal sound.- While I've had no crashes (Update: I have experienced my first crash, so this does seem to be a relevant issue for many players), I have had a performance bug which was causing framerate to drop significantly when I was tracking an animal's footprints a lot.  Having too many of these tracking markers will cause the framerate to drop after opening the map or looking at your Huntermate device.  It would fix itself by either putting away the Huntermate or if you killed the tracked animal and collected your trophy.- Semi annoying menu bug that doesn't let you back out of the menu with escape unless the mouse is hovering over one of the items on the side.- A few of the animals I've shot seemed like it should have been a clean kill, but they would somehow get away with just a minor wound and run off.  More often than not I found success with my shots though.- Animal AI was a bit wonky on at least one occasion with a fox that clearly should have been trying to run away, but instead was running circles around me like a friendly pet dog or something.  Perhaps it was being aggresive and trying to attack or something, but it seemed a bit bizarre with it essentially giving me an easy kill.- Right now it is limited to 12 different animals.  These do have variations to discover, but it would be nice to see some small game targets and birds as well.  I'm assuming we'll see this added down the line at some point when they add some of the planned free and paid DLC content.- The menus ui and control of them in general just feels like it needs a rework as they look and feel like a placeholder that has been in the game since an earlier state.  There are also some issues with the controls when managing your storage where it just seems to completely break when in that particular menu and you have to back out and open it back up to do anything.

Original review 17/02/2017Positives: Sound is incredible. Environment is gorgeous. Weather is fantastic. Tracking seems markedly better (though the new huntermate is practically useless). Animals react to being hit instead of just running and are visibly hurt when running away. Bears attack deer (hilarious). Weapons feel nicer.Negatives: BUGS, EVERYWHERE. Animal behaviour seems to be much worse than Classic, though could be bugged like everything else. UI sucks, buggy and badly designed in places. Mission progress resets if you change reserve. Changing reserve allows you to fast travel to any outpost you want and claim the XP again. Scoped weapons can bug out and prevent you from being able to see anything. More bugs. Bugs all day.Feels rushed to production. Full of bugs. UI design is not great and the bugs in the UI make it even worse than Classic's UI. There's currently more wrong with this game than right, which sucks.UPDATE 05/03/2017Played a few hours this morning, seemed less buggy.• Menu works generally as expected.• Animals still run into trees and rocks and inexplicably turn and walk directly away from you all the time only to return when you call them. Still don't seem to have the level of intelligence they had in classic, either.• Scopes on rifles still buggy, even when you're not using a scope they can bug out now too. • Temporary hunting stands buggy with bows (arrows shoot into wood instead of where you're aiming), not sure about rifles.Tried to play this afternoon, crashed twice in 5 minutes. Still not recommended.One last point I'll make is that I've realised, even though now it's less painful than the first iteration, the progression system is infuriating. I'm not saying it shouldn't be part of the game but its current implementation makes the game boring and repetitive.			"

												Its a beautiful game, the graphics are stunning.  However, it has many problems.The bad:1 -The animal AI is pretty bad, they just kind of derp around until they see you or you shoot them. I literally got headbutted by a moose that didn't even see me, it was just running and I happened to be in its path. 2 - The noise level your character makes is way to high by default, the only way you can move without spooking animals is to crawl prone, or mash the move button and take one step at a time.3 - Your character gets stuck on random things for no reason.4 - Theres no anti aliasing that I can find in the graphics.. like.. why?5 - There aren't tags, so its just kind of a ""wander around murdering animals"" simulator.  This is a plus for some people id imagine, but not for the hunting simulator croud. 6 - Your character moves sooooooooo slow.  Like its really annoying.7 - The only way to get other equipment is to collect animals, and you need to kill like 50 deer to get a new rifle/scope/ect.8 - The skill tree is very poorly done.  Like one of the traits is ""See 15% less during fog"".  Like... what?  How is that a perk?9 -Theres a bunch of pointless♥♥♥♥♥♥on the map.  Like theres just random pillars out in the wilderness that give you ""lore"".10 - There isn't much for a tutorial in the game.. it pretty much just drops you into the world.11 - Bad frames when foliage gets really thick.The good:1 - The tracking system is very user friendly. Although not realistic.2 - The map is very good looking.3 - There are 2 zones you can hunt in, and both are very large.4 - Theres plenty of action.  This may not be good if you are looking for realism.Thoughts:This game defintely has potential, but in its current state it seems unfinished. Theres plenty of stuff to hunt if you are looking for an arcadey hunting game, that's multiplayer. But if you are in the market for a simulator, I'd skip this one for now. 5/10			"

												Sorry, but this game is UNFINISHED. And:The amount of bugs is unacceptable for a game costing 30€ and being not early access. Some of the bugs are not even bugs - they are just a sign that the game is not ready yet. Example? - No EXIT-button in the menu (it seems due to the fact this game is obv. a console-port from work in progress --> yes, you will play an alpha-version on PC from a console-port which is not even released yet in 03/2017)- menu is absolutely horrible, buggy, ugly and unfinished. It's a conundrum how to put sighs and amunition on a weapon --> as mentioned, it's obviously a rough console-port- menu stays open in the background - so during game you change options, map or even fast travel incidently when 'hitting' something with your mouse which is hiding behind in the hidden but open menu (edit: solved with patch 1.41)- sounds are missing, too loud, not playing sometimes or not fitting (for example in muliplayer you can hear callers extremly loud even when it comes from a player on the other end of the map)- descriptions for some amuntion and options is completely wrong or reversed or do not work at all- why the hell you can find a scope for revolvers in the section for riffles? This is no serious bug, but shows that the developers throw this pre-alpha-game on the market even without ironing out the most visible errors- crasehes to desktop are very common for lots of users. In my case I do suffer it accidently over a period of timeThe game seems very unbalanced. And I think, the developers know it. What else could be the reason, they changed for expample the price of amunition and DOUBLED it. This is no tweaking of the balance - this is reinventing the game settings. There is no possibility for changing the game hardness. For beginners it seems to be good, running in ZOO full of animals. But for advanced guys this is no fun. Too  much animals in the game. And part of the animals are completely AI-buggy. Example?I hunted down approx. 15 deers in the northern part of the US-map. They stood in shallow water and did not react when shooting on them or on they neighbours. Other animals stick in rocks or trees. Or do not react at all. Example (not my clip):

Sorry - but I can not recomend this game due to the fact, that CORE ELEMENTS of this game are messed up. Edit 11.03.2017:After about 60 hours playing this thing, it suddenly started to crash every 3 minutes. In both maps. With same PC-configuration, even without changing anything on the PC (it's the gamig computer). I regard it as completely unacceptable by DEVELOPERS and PUBLISHERS to release this game and/or not willing to give a refund. The problems did not start inbetween the first 2 hours of playing - so STEAM is not willing to take back this bug-feast.Edit 27.03.2017:Patch 1.4 and still no real progress. Players find NEW BUGS en masse, weappons are out of order, developers are still not able to ad a simple button in the menue, UI has still very serious bugs, animal-AI still extrem bad and for lots of players the game does not even start!But developers have a new information for us:THEY ARE WORKING ON THE CONSOLE-PORT to XBox and PlayStation! Great. They are concentrating on real important topics:Make MORE money! Do not listen to customers, or even try to iron out bugs. Make MORE money!Happy Hunting!Edit 29.03.2017 Patch 4.1:Small patch, UI ist still a mess and partly not functioning. Players report newe bugs or bugs beeing solved now reactivated (for example dying instantly on game start).Edit 31.03.2017:Now due to my repeated criticism in the forum I have been BANNED. But not even banned, ALL POSTS, ANSWERS (even very constructive to help players overcome bugs) have been DELETED. Everything without a trace. And I am not the only one...Edit 23.04.2017:Called for a return of this product on Steam and waiting for answer. I would be sattisfied even by having returned 50% of the price. After serveral patches there is no real progress in making this game a FULL and playable one.			"

												An absolutely stunning game in terms of graphics and even audio, just the sound of the wind gusting by or the stunning vistas, heavy rainfall and animal vocals makes this an immersive game set in nature.The map is enormous, the scale is just simply put insane, you can walk for hours and hours and it won't get repetitive as it feels like its several maps in one with the diversity each area brings.Not to mention the amazing grass effects, you could if you want track an animal by following the grass it flattened, and you can also see your own and other players their paths, ocassionally i also used this to get a clean prone shot where normally that wouldn't be possible due to the grass being in the way.But each game comes with its downsides and this game also has no shortage of those.The gamebreaking ones to me were:In Multiplayer only the host can unlock map objects, such as hunting stands / outposts (important one, they allow fast travel)Animals get stuck, from my 12 hour experience i would say i have seen 1 in 8 getting stuck, mostly on edges or rocks with bears being a big outlier as i have seen 1 in 4 of them getting stuck.The UI design is unintuitive, being unable to exit to menu and aspecially when it comes to loading ammo/scopes onto a weapon, it's also impossible to read some of the descriptions as the text moves offscreen, and in quite a few cases i saw what i can only describe as a alpha/beta-like placeholder text for some of the ammo/scopes.Some minor issues/bugs i had were:Some crashes when tabbing out and back into the game, i fixed this by adding the ""/Borderless"" in the steam launch options.Sometimes got a bug with my scope being off center forcing me to restart the game, the adjustment ontop of the scope itself became my crosshair, unequipping etc didn't fix it sadly.In Multiplayer when another player jumps its heard across the map, i suppose this might be an engine issue as it also happened in the previous hunter game with someone reloading.When you fatally hit an animal they sometimes do this weird freeze for up to 1 second and then start to ragdoll, i would love to see this changed / fixed so that you feel more feedback from the bullet impact and it kinda just looks awkward as it is currently.Animals don't spook enough from gunshots sometimes it feels asif they don't even hear the gunshot, i've been able to shoot up to 3 animals ocassionally before they even started getting spooked, i would like to see the range that animals get spooked by gunshots increased.Animals don't seem to interact with eachother, i would've hoped they would introduce something like this, i believe they added something similar to classic with the introduction of wolves so it would be nice if this could be added eventually.And finally theres just too many animals on Layton district, i would prefer it if they were a bit more rare or more easily spooked just recently i shot 5 bears within 10 minutes and before that about 3 within 4 minutes, one of which was stuck underneath a bridge, although Hirschfelden seems fine.It's also too easy to spot an animal by zooming in on where its call came from, it feels like its fine when you are scoped out and they callout as it covers a wide area but you can zoom in to get a pinpoint location on where it called out from, I'm not sure if thats by design or not but it makes it too easy, you can turn the call direction and other effects off in the settings, but it would be nice to have a middle groundI would still recommend the game to anyone remotely interested in the setting or who played the previous game, it does clearly have some bugs that makes you question why it was released so soon,But if they fix / change most of these issues, i can see this as one of the best games this year and i look forward to what content they might still bring out.All in all what is here is a gorgeous landscape filled with tons of animals to hunt, great gunplay mechanics such as bullet drop and organ hits, amazing graphics and audio, but also some of the worst UI i've seen in a while, and quite some bugs which hopefully get fixed soon.

												To start off with, this is an absolutely beautiful game. The environment is stunning and the texturing and animations for the animals are incredible. The sounds are amazing. They've definitely done an excellent job with creating a visually spectacular game. However, I don't want a hunting game that's just pretty to look at, and that's just about all this one is so far - pretty.It is essentially a very dumbed down version of theHunter: Classic. While they improved certain mechanics such as the tracking system - making it so you don't have to have the HunterMate in your hand in order to track animals - and a visual wind direction right on the compass, they drastically oversimplified others. Size/rack variations are practically non-existant from what I've seen thus far, small game other than coyote is present, but not able to be harvested, there's no trophy shots (although you can always just take a photo manually prior to harvest), skill progression is global rather than per-species, and is based on general XP gain rather than skill-specific XP, and many of the points of interest which say they grant skill/perk points do not actually do so.  Overall it feels like they've gone the way of a Cabela's game - going from a simulation heavy title to an very arcade-like experience.Hopefully a lot of those issues can be handled by an update. Until then, if you're looking for something close to theHunter: Classic, this simply isn't it.			"

												For fans of the subscription based classic, the new engine allows for a lot of previous shortcomings to be overcome. The draw distance has been extended and the vibrant environments are lovingly crafted and perfect to while the hours away in.However, a number of core features are sorely missing. The lack of an appropriate way to take photographs of trophies, no community wide competitions, and a lack of any trophy record keeping outside of raw statistics results in a game where every Buck is just a number.From the rushed and huddled menu design to missing fundamental features, this is a title with a lot of potential, but with a lot of confusing omissions.

												Just started playing this as most have. There are a lot of bugs but for me it is stable. I play on a rig that is able to cope with anything and  can play at Ultra settings with no problems and no crashes. Friends on I5 processors have had problems.I have a 2k+ profile on TheHunter so I know how this works.Suggestions...Use all your hard earned cash to buy callers and the first bow. DO NOT BUT THOSE TOWERS.you do not need them yet. That bow is awesome at close range.Problems I have had ...when i bought the fox caller my scope went foggy on the 243....go figure.The fox caller sometimes sticks and you can not do anything  but call foxes...easy answer...back up a bit and select a gun. The fox caller will start to work again.Seems likes foxes spook at 38m...regardless of what you are doing....seems scent spray is required.Great game ( the graphisc are awesome) and hopefully the devs will take note of this .  Got to  level 10 and hopefully will go furtherCheersDave			"

												I am conflicted leaving this game a negative review. For what it is, the game is very beautiful and is very well detailed. When you first start it up you will be impressed with the surroundings and weapon graphics. The phone UI is a little whacky. In fact the UI in general is kind of weird.The AI is bad... really bad. When you first start, the game introduces you to tracking and killing an animal. This experience is pretty amazing. Then you go off doing ""quests"" and you realize that the open world AI is just flat out stupid. Animals walk into things. Deer literally keep coming back to the scene of the crime using the caller, until you murder their entire family. Getting into a hunting blind is cool... until literally everything becomes blind to you. I was calling for deer and a bear just walked up and stood there. Shot it in the neck for an instant kill and got a lot of XP.Sounds are amazing, for a while. You hear wind, walking through brush, rain, and trees all over along with the wildlife. But it gets repetitive and it can get really loud when you are trying to listen to things. When you hear the fog horn sound of a warning call, you will wake up the entire house with a feminine scream.All in all it's a cool game. But it is buggy and lacks real content. It's just a grind with a small variety of things to kill around you. I think this game could be amazing, and with some content and patches it probably will be, but for $30 I would just wait for a sale or some fixes. So my ""negative"" review is just one in waiting. I will pick this up again for sure when it goes on sale or a DLC comes out to fix and expand on things.			"

												*Editing review*2017-02-19Okay so ive been playing non-stop for the past days since release, i am now level 19.COTW still runs great and the bugs really dont bother me at all, but after playing so much, the flaws in the gameplay really become an apparent issue.Too many animals, they are everywhere almost all the time, very rarely do you go 30 mins without seeing an animal (usually see 2 about every 10 mins) which for a hunting sim is way too much.Warning calls are BS and should be taken out of the game. I feel like its the whole reason it seems like there is so much wildlife. you hear them EVERYWHERE! Yes you can turn the blips off but youre just putting yourself at a disadvantage doing so...No fun in that either.Tournies, truRAC and leaderboards need to be added ASAP if this game wants to survive aslong as TheHunter Classic has. Of course only after the major bugs are fixed!as of now this is my personal opinion rating, if you disagree dont feel afraid to comment.Gameplay 6/10Sorry its just to darn easy, tracking is useless, unless it shoot the animal you are aiming for and there is almost no bullet drop.Graphics 10/10Its ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous guys, seriously looks amazing, other then some muddy leave textures every once and a whileSound 9/10All the sounds are amazingly well done, Wind, rain and thunder all at once kills your ears and is way too loud. also rabbits OP!If youre a hardcore hunting fan just stick to classic unless you have money to burn, until they release patches.I am still reccommending the game, ive loved all my time in it so far! there are just a lot of gameplay issues!*release review* feb 14thCOTW imho should be at minimum labeled as ""Early Access""there are some annoying UI bugs, ive crashed twice over the span of 12 hours, which really isnt bad.Ive had almost no issues with the game, other especially with AMD have it bad i hear.The Hunter Call of the Wild is, is a lot of fun and well worth the 35$ for me. but its far from finished, right now there is no tournaments, and leaderboards which really makes hunting sort of meaningless unless youre in a MP server where you can see other players top score.for 35$ it has more than enough content for me until the patches (hopefully tournaments) start rolling in.Nice physics, great graphics, runs crazyyyy smooth, honestly feels like it runs smoother than classic version. and not a god damn cashcow like classic aswell. if you want more content, then play classic but its going to cost you a hell of a lot more than this game will. I can see call of the wild being amazing if they do everything correctly.			"

												Lazy coding, buggy and feels like early access.Suggestion for the dev team: Get your finger out lads and you might have a nice product here.Suggestion for their customers:  Wait for a sale and don't pay anything more than 15euro.			"

												Really wanted to like this game. Keybinds unbound multiple keys including aiming (Right Mouse) when i go to settings to change it cant press escape to leave the settings menu so i cannot change the ketbinds. Hopefully the bugs get fixed, gonna refund and maybe buy later. This stuff seems pretty trivial to test irks me I cant even leave settings menu and keybinds get removed			"

												In the games current state, I do not recommend.theHunter: Call of the wild was a HUGE dissapointment to me. Coming from the classic ""theHunter"", beleive me when I say, I feel cheated and as if no effort was put into it. theHunter brought more diversity and unique opportunities than this game. I can only hope in the future they plan on adding more, as in, treestands, blinds, and water game. Also in the original theHunter something as simple as having a trophy count and trophy shot/picture brought more to the game than call of the wild has. The initial realease was a hot piece of garbage as the menu was broken, animals being stuck, spawn system way too high in areas, and etc.They turned this game into your average objective based game while taking away the uniqueness theHunter had to offer. Pros:GraphicsCons:No diversityNo trophy system or trophy shotGame still in beta after initial releaseNo effortNot a simulationMultiplayerI can see great potential for this game, but I hope they make the necessary additions to help improve.

As of this post I am level 15, 20+ hrs, Several Weapons and 100+ Animals down... Never played the OriginalFirst Impressions: I love it, great game, somewhat unfinished but everything these days is. A lot of people expect a finished game upon release which I find silly... Expectations of games in the modern day is insane, people think every game is a AAA title will hundreds of millions backing it. While the game isn't finished and many bugs are still out there it isn't game breaking and I have had no issues progressing. I had to adjust playstyle to accomodate bugs, mainly making too much sound while moving in any kind of stance (this includes the lower noise perks).I think give this game a little time and things will iron out, not all bugs are going to disappear but they will fix the major ones or at least I hope they do.Animals: The Animals are great, a huge range to shoot at and the bedding/feeding/drinking zones make finding a required animal a lot easier. The movement is pretty solid along with the animations of reactions to bullet fire or getting hit. I see a lot of people complaining about not being able to down a deer with the starter rifle and sorry to say but you are just a terrible shot. A heart or decent lung shot is going to drop a deer straight away if not a lung shot is going to have them run an extra 50m then die, anything else is just punishment for a terrible shot. Leading animals also appears to work well, more often then not I am able to get a 2nd or 3rd shot in before the animal is in cover or I have lost sight.Weapons: These are fine, I never played the original but having a background in FPS I am able to aim the rifle and hit my target at anything under 200m pretty easily. The 223 is a neat little fox hunting rifle which I have used on countless foxes including my 48,000,000 score kill (another bug). I have recently unlocked the 270 and it will drop pretty much any deer with a chest/shoulder shot. Progression on weapons is fine, its not too slow and definately not too fast. I would like to see more customization however this could happen in the future.Progression: Currently I am level 15 and it hasn't been a quick ride, having explored 80% of the map and killed over 100 animals it hasn't been easy. With that said I do like the progression, it isn't fast and I really have to work at it to get the unlocks I want. There is no quick level option in the game (that I know of) so doing what I am doing seems to be paying off in the long run. I also like how you have to progress with the weapon of choice, instead of just having a level requirement to shoot the best gun in the game. On that note by the time you unlock a better rifle you should be a better shot with rifles.Graphics: Amazing, running a 1070 makes this game look noice. Having played a few open world games now this does look amazing. From what I have heard from others this does look better then the original game which once again makes a lot of sense.Bugs: There is a few, a few really annoying ones which have turned away a few people I know.... That is fair enough and I respect that... However... Coming from Classic and expecting a polished game with the ability to just jump in and shoot whatever you want with whatever you want is not going to go down well.Overall: I would give it in its current state a 6/10 with the opportunity to hit 8/10 if the main bugs are fixed. I love how the game plays, how it looks and the progression. I love a challenge and having to really work for those quality kills, I will continue to play the game and looking to get some of those later unlocks.TL:DR - Overall great game for someone new to theHunter series, also for those looking for a hunter sim, different from Classic game, harder to bring those on Classic in current games state... Definately potential if bugs are corrected.			"

												The most beautiful environment i've ever seen.. NOTE: This is the only review i've written on steam since i've found no game really in need of it.I started playing the old hunter game as an escape with one of my friends and it was all right but this one is one of the best games i've played. It's so relaxing so stroll around without any competition tracking down your prey and then taking a well prepared shot. The two maps that are available are huge and has by far the most beautiful scenery and environment that i've ever seen. Walking around the huge maps really takes your mind of everything in life, add some calm music and i'm in total bliss. The sounds made for this game are amazing and it's so much so that you might for a second actually believe that you're in whatever forest or field that you're currently tracking prey in. The game is so calm, the only thing that disturbs the peace is your bullet leaving the muzzle.I found this game awesome to play with a friends and ganging up on some resting bear that just happens to get shot 5-10 times it's just friggin' hilarious and also brings time to talk about other stuff that might not even be related to the game. Now on to the bad parts, the game in single player for me is running flawlessly on my setup and i have no issues at all really except for some minor bugs that won't really affect the experience.On the other hand, multi player is riddled with small bugs that actually stack up, one of my friends game crashes all the time whilst mine doesn't and i have almost the same setup as him. The mission system doesn't work in multi player, menu's will click without any warning and i have accidentally kicked friends from the multi player game by accident because of this. If you're the host you can still locate landmarks/cabins and get the experience and lore from interacting with them, BUT your friends that are clients on the server can't which hinders the experience on their part since they can't progress in the game world when they play on your servers. But this isn't really a problem if you switch between host/client from time to time. You're usually not even concerned by this since you always get sidetracked by prey.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game for those with patience with some minor bugs. I would agree that this game should still be in a Beta stage. But it is so immersive that i'm glad that i can take part in it right now.If you're constantly annoyed by bugs and can't let go. Then this game might not be for you right now. "

												It's as step up from theHunter: Classic in some areas and a step back in others, however it's a good platform to build on like they did with Classic.Pros: - Updated graphics, some of the best scenery you will see in any game. - Hunting pressure, new mechanic to make it difficult to hunt in areas you've already hunted.- Improved animal behaviors. Animals will give warning calls, mating calls, and can be found in large heards.  There was also the addition of ""need zones"" that you can discover such as sleeping zones, drinking and feeding zones where you can find specific species at certain hours of the day.- Night hunting, with the help of a headlamp. - CoTW replaces a membership pay model of Classic with a RPG system that makes you gradually unlock new weapons and equipment through XP, also has a pretty neat skills/perks system that really adds some flavor to hunting. Cons: - Lacks the diversity of theHunter: Classic. Only 2 hunting reserves at the time of launch, a handful of weapons and a pretty small roster of game to hunt. - Scoring system seems wonky, not a huge fan of the ""consecutive harvests"" idea. The game awards senseless killing and not being patient and selective like it should be. - Small features like trophy shots and trophy galleries not available at this time. Guessing in the future? Not sure why something like this would be cut from the game.- Performance issues, some people complaining about crashes/bugs. Latest patch addressed some issues though.-  No mobile tree stands, or tents. You have to discover outposts around the map and use them to fast travel.			"

												The Game has potential, but in this state, its not ready for full release I would say.It needs a bit more work, and to fix some of the major issues:* The Menu UI has allot of problems, and crashes often, very difficult to use.* The game Only runs 60 FPS on 1080p.* Capped to 30 FPS on 1440p and 4K. :(* No option for any AA (Anti-aliasing) The feel of the Game is much like the previous Hunter Game, but now feels a bit warmer to the new players with the Tutorial in the beginning, and the added skill and leveling system.I will keep the game in my steam game library, and give the Devs some time to fix the major issues, and check back later.

												I was an avid fan of The original Hunter even with microtransactions, so when I heard about this game I was super pumped. The game doesn't disappoint for $30, there is still a good bit of bugs and gameplay fixes to be made but it's definitely playable. The new trick for this game is to run around until you hear a call then then hit the deck, call for the animal (if you can't call that animal, crouch and crawl to the sound being very careful not to spook it). Also aim for the neck for any animal except foxes and coyotes (this sucks if you know anything about hunting and the bread basket rule). Also don't listen to any of the asses complaining about this game, they don't have a clue what they are talking about. They're just a bunch of whiny children who have to nit-pick every small error in a game that just came out.			"

												Quick review since I only owned the hunter for a day or so.. Pros-Great graphics-Great sounds-Pretty Realistic hunting experience-Multiplayer with friends is quite fun-Decent price-Has Potential-Devs care about our comments and reviewsCons-Menu/Exiting or changing servers can be quite frustrating. Possibly just my menu bugging out-Some animals act very abnormally (Shoot a moose and it runs in circles at 60km/h)-Buggy animals such as.. after shooting a deer it stays standing and alive but it's really dead.. animals getting caught on trees while running and keep running in place.. Shooting something 10 times with the right caliber point blank but it just walks away as if nothing happened.So far that is what I have experienced, I don't regret buying the game but I feel that it was released a bit quick, I see it more as a beta with alot of potential. The bugs have not happened very often to me yet so i'll stay positive because I feel this game has much potential. "

												Contrary to what my profile shows, I have more than 10 hours experience to back up my opinion of this game. I am not ashamed to admit that I bought this game today, and that I trialed it with an illegal copy of the game. Point is I've bought it now and at the time of writing this have tested it on version 1.11. I'm not even one to play many FPS games, let a alone an FPS game that simlulates hunting and as such requires you to be patient while moving veryyyyy slowly and cautiously so that you do not disturb your prey.  This is something new for me as a gamer who needs relatively paced gameplay with action at least every now and then. I was drawn in by this game's graphics presentation and this ultimately led me to try out the game. To my surprise, the gameplay also started to appeal to me after getting the hang of it and now I am convinced that this game deserves a try. If you like survival type games, rather come to this with a fresh perspective and you may enjoy theHunter for what it is and not for what it isn't. Also, there are several glitches that I have encountered but none were too detractive of the whole experience. My only gripe with this game so far is the inventory management system, which seems to bug out a lot depending on whether or not I am using KB/M or a controller at any given time. Devs, you have surpassed my expectations of this game, please fix these issues and more people will come to realise the potential of what you have made.			"

												The game is overall pretty fun,Pros:-Absolutely beatiful graphics and very well optimized. -Very realistic in all aspects.-Good value for what you get.-I think if you like hunting you will like this game.Cons:-In 10 hours the only bugs I found were with the sound of the game, the normal sounds are always there, but when it's music, sometimes rain, or even when you use a deer caller, somehow the sound gets glitchy, the deer caller I can't even hear it most of the times. This sound glitches don't often occur (besides the animal callers), but it can still be annoying.I think it's wise to follow the patches of this game, if the sound is fixed, it becomes an extremely good game for those who like hunting or wilderness.

												I like this game.  But let me start with the cons:Slowest walking simulator ever made.  They need to increase run speed by about 30%,  as, when you're traveling at running speed, you generally don't care if there is prey nearby that will run.  You're just trying to get where you're going.  And as there are no real ""save"" points, you always spawn at the last outpost you were at.  It can take forever to get from one place to another and it just takes tooooo lonnnng.   Maybe make it so you don't need to jump to get over fist-sized rocks when climbing uphill, while you're at it.  I shot a moose, which glitched out- shot it again, then again, at point blank, then it rand at lightspeed away into the distance.  F that moose.  At one point I jumped near a small waist-height tree and immediately died.  Game is buggier than a termite mound.  I wish you could save at any point, and start where you left off, or maybe have it autosave every 10-15 minutes in case the game crahes, instead of at your last outpost.  They're miles apart, and take forever to get back to, so if you do die jumping near a tiny tree, you're going to cry when you respawn miles away.Pros:Apex engine is beautiful.  If you have the gpu/cpu to rock this at ultra, it's stunning.  Audio is gorgeous as well,  it puts you right into it's world with all of the ambience you'd expect from a living forest.  Tracking and hunting remind me of Witcher 3 without all the Noonwraiths.  I've only been playing the Pacific NW-ish map, and I really like the mission-giving walkie-talkie guy.  It reminds me of firewatch, but not as linear, with no plot.   This is a great game to play when you're tired of getting smashed in the face in For Honor or need a break from anything competitive or serious.  It's calming, slow, and patient.  I have an i5 4670 and an R9 290, and can play this at 1440p with most settings at ultra but a few turned down.  Apex engine is beautiful - but demanding.  Another thing I wish they'd fix is the cost of items.  The progression system needs skin unlocks or something to motivate you while you save 30000 for that one rifle.  Plus skins are cool!  People love skins!Overall, there's a LOT to dislike, but TH:COTW still has somehow won me over.  There's a lot of heart in this game.  And a lot of shooting things in the heart, I suppose.  This will remain in my rotation as the game I play to chill after a stressful day.  Overall, recommended if you're looking for something different and don't mind early access (because that's what this really is, feels-wise).  If you have the cash, it's a fun diversion.  They've been steadily ironing out the bugs, and I look forward to future updates.			"

Some of the walking sounds dont match the ground you walk on.Maybe the ability to walk slower with keyboard and mouse? Maybe a guide arrow that points in the dierection of the pin you place?also what are the random blue location markers?			"

												I was an avid fan of The original Hunter even with microtransactions, so when I heard about this game I was super pumped. The game doesn't disappoint for $30, there is still a good bit of bugs and gameplay fixes to be made but it's definitely playable. The new trick for this game is to run around until you hear a call then then hit the deck, call for the animal (if you can't call that animal, crouch and crawl to the sound being very careful not to spook it). Also aim for the neck for any animal except foxes and coyotes (this sucks if you know anything about hunting and the bread basket rule). Also don't listen to any of the asses complaining about this game, they don't have a clue what they are talking about. They're just a bunch of whiny children who have to nit-pick every small error in a game that just came out.			"

												The Game has potential, but in this state, its not ready for full release I would say.It needs a bit more work, and to fix some of the major issues:* The Menu UI has allot of problems, and crashes often, very difficult to use.* The game Only runs 60 FPS on 1080p.* Capped to 30 FPS on 1440p and 4K. :(* No option for any AA (Anti-aliasing) The feel of the Game is much like the previous Hunter Game, but now feels a bit warmer to the new players with the Tutorial in the beginning, and the added skill and leveling system.I will keep the game in my steam game library, and give the Devs some time to fix the major issues, and check back later.

												I don't understand as to why people are giving this negative review's. It's a really good looking game with really good gameplay. Better than other hunting games I have ever played.I just wonder what's the future of the game in term's of more weapon's, and other feature's. I hope they add thing's like ATV's and other offroad vehicles along with more maps that are bigger too. Aside from that the game is a worth a buy and is really gorgeous.--------edit review------------Ok so now I ran into some bugs, that being animals getting stuck on random terrain and weird spawn issues with deer. I came up on a hill and found like literally 15 fallow deer all just in one place and cant move. I went up close enough to actually be able to pet them. On the plus side, they look good. So far these issues seem to be something that is fixable in the near future.....but the forums don't allow us to post subjects. So this is a serious problem with communication.			"

												This review is for solo play only, I haven't tried online play yet.  The game feels like early access (particularly because of the UI being unresponsive at times) but it is in a highly playable state at the moment. I've spent 5 hours so far, and I've enjoyed the title. Other than the UI occaisonally taking two clicks instead of one I've only seen one bug, A deer was stuck in a tree trying to run away. Not exactly the end of the world, as you see similar pathing errors pop up in Bethesda games. The environment is very well rendered, effects like tall grass getting stomped down as you walk through a field were a nice touch. Probably one of the most relaxing games involving shooting I've ever played. Provided support and development continues, this is well worth picking up. Particularly if you enjoyed the original 'TheHunter' but were put off by microtransactions. Wait if you're worried about the title being dropped, otherwise give it a go.			"

												This is a amazing hunting game, it has very good graphics and sounds , its playability is very smooth , the map is so huge it seems endless , you start off with a low end bolt acition rifle which is meant for small game but it is possible too take large game down but you need a vital hit and a lil bit of tracking it down , but dont worry you can buy better weapons in time the game has ingame money that you earn from your kills , exsploring ,quest, selling certing stufff to a npc you may find on your journeys (note this on selling i havnt got to that point in the game but i heard that you can from a quest) and you allso get a reward by turning in historical artifact im thinking its pretty rare to find them i only found 1 myself , ok by doing all those things you gain XP so that you can lvl up your hunter you will get points to use for passive and your active tree perks.. im not saying this game is 100% prefect but to me it worth every penny for the amazing open world map .

												This is perhaps one of the prettiest games I have ever played. That being said , it's got alot of kinks to work out. 1) Some animals are complete morons. I call them and not only do they get close. They get close enough to touch and just stand there. Pretty easy to shoot a deer at 2 ft.2) Tracking is fun. But sometimes the deer path in such a way that actually trying to figure out were the deer is .. well is nearly impossible. Hopefully they will make it so you can erase tracks that you have already went over.3) Inventory and management of. It's a mess atm.4) Map. Why my game runs great until I pull up the map I'm not sure. But when I pull my map up it goes laggy. VERY laggy. AND 5 This is what brought my experince to a halt. For some reason now I can no longer reload my gun. FIRE my gun and do anything that requires me to use left mouse button. And my mouse is fine btw. Can't HUNT if I can't SHOOTHopefully they will patch  some fixes for this stuff. Some major and some minor. But I would advise maybe waiting for a bit until they fix stuff. But if you have the $30 to blow. Pick it up and look the amazing beauty they have made.			"

												Haven't play much of it yet so not a really reliable review.The game looks and feels great as far as a hunting game goes. Compared to other hunting games that are all arcade point and shoot, this game is as close to real hunting that most gamers will get to. Having an open world where you can go wherever you want or shoot whatever you want is really all most people ask for in a hunting game. A few things I have noticed:-Deer dont seem to walk and act like deer, although they are still huntable.-The Sound effects are awful. Like minecraft sound awful. In a game where you are trying to sneak up on a deer, the slowest footstep I can manage sounds like Im kicking gravel down the driveway.A few things the game needs:-FISHING!!! The number of ponds and lakes that look perfect for fishing is immense. Add fishing to this game and why would I ever play another game?-More animals. Aside from basic deer, moose, elk and bear you can hunt foxes and coyotes. Also Buffalo. I noticed a distict lack of bird hunting. Ambient birds are loud and annoying and deserve to be shot.-Polish. The game is good, really good. but there are things here and there that need shining. If the devs are still updating we can only hope the game gets better.Don't let anyone talk you out of this game because of glitches or bugs or because it's hard to kill or track. Hunting isn't easy IRL.			"

												Feel like pro hunter!!This hunting game absolutely sandbox and open world. Though there are some mission to boost your xp and cash, you are not forced to do that. You can traveling around the map and kill as many animals. 90% of this game is tracing the animals track. Lurking at their ""needs"" area, hit them, and track them then get the trophy. Get the exp to obtain new skills and weapon perks. There are still many room for improvement in this game like, weapon type, tools and gadget. Hope the dev often release new equipment and map. 9/10 for hunting game. Best hunting game i've ever played. Pro : - Stunning Graphic, environment and sound- Animal AI overall is good- HUGE MapCons :- Still many minor bugs like suddenly slow motion (not fps drop)- Animal stuck at tree - Lack choice of Weapon and Equipment- slow weapon/equipment change. it takes 4-5 seconds to change from rifle to binocular (not a fps drop) "

												So i've not played that much yet, but i think i've played enough to give it a pretty fair review.The game is great, it takes everything from classic and improves upon it and removes those damned microtransactions.I had a blast playing and it was thrilling and very rewarding to track down a level 6 black bear... except for it wasn't and the bear was actually stuck in som foilage. The game is pretty buggy right now and when i finally found another black bear the UI glitched out and i couldn't get my rifle back after I had tried to switch to a new one. The devs really went all in with this game and it shows. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are realistic and easy to distinguish from the ambience, and the voice acting is really good. Give this game a try and you wont get dissapointed. The devs will probably fix the current glitches soon, but even if they don't it's still a great game and you should try it.			"

												I really like this game, I think it's a great hunting game and can be full of surprises and twists, like hunting a bear for a hour and it charges you from a under brush that's really cool, but what I HATE about this game is the ridiculous game breaking bugs that are abound everytime I log in. Such as not being able to switch to any guns or calls, tracks that are stupidly inaccurate and a stick pile that my friend got stuck on and died in (check my screenshots), oh and I almost forgot the crashes. But this game is promising and is fun if none of those things happen to you and I really hope the Devs get on this game and make it as best as it can be. (I reccomend because there is no middle ground option if there was I would put this review there)			"

												We know why you are here. Lets just get this out of the way right now. This has some of the most beautiful environments I've ever seen in a game. If you love the outdoors as much as I, then you where probably equally pained throughout the Elder Scroll's laughable attempts at wilderness. Skyrim's best just wasn't real enough for me. It all looked... unnatural, as if someone who had never been outdoors looked at pictures. The great outdoors got that name for a reason. This game understands. Freaking. Gorgeous. I play on Ultra with a measly 8gigs of Ram, GTX 970 and an i5 6400. It runs great. If the optimization is buggy, I havn't noticed.Next up, if you like hunting games, your options are fairly limited. The Hunter Classic, Cabela's Hunts, maybe Hunting Unlimited if you can stomach the ancient graphics and mechanics. Now The Hunter Classic is a favorite of mine, despite my low play time, it rocked. I'm currently getting into Bowhunting IRL, and when I play these types of games, I'm looking at Bows only. Make of that what you will.The Hunter Classic had a variety of weapons, animals, and reserves. In comparison CotW, is pretty underwhelming. TWO BOW TYPES!? WHAT IS THIS HERESY!? Not even a recurve, or a longbow, or more compound... just a beginner compound and a high end. A real shame, as I really like variety and the challenge that a recurve provides. Same with Shotguns, hope you weren't looking for a large variety here. Seems the devs liked rifles more, and it reflects in the quests, some require super long range shots... which rules out bows and shotties. You get a paltry two reserves.... but they are pretty dang massive. I'd say they are equal to ... the alaskan one from the Hunter Classic in size. Lots of little things to find, and things to do. Shed Hunting, Feed ground spotting, camp finding, dozens of quests, Animal variety is ... fairly small in comparison to the hunter classic. I don't think the game has Grizzly, Wolves, or some of the varieties of Elk and Deer. I also didn't notice ANY waterfowl, or turkey. Although the ambient animals are significantly improved. Lots more birds, rabbits, squirrels ( I think that's what it was.. scared the alcohol right out of me.)So what about the important stuff? The actual hunting? Its superb. When it works. The game seems to have alot more wildlife than the Hunter Classic, so you are in the thick of it pretty much every step. Hit that caller and watch a group of four just wander in. Its probably not realistic, but it gets you into the hunt much quicker. ...now if you don't have any experience with hunting games, you probably will make the mistake of thinking that the .243 you start with is somehow effective at hunting.You would be wrong.The .243 modeled in this game and the Hunter Classic is a pea-shooter, that probably shouldn't be allowed on Deer, I have no experience with .243 in real life, but if you don't make a perfect shot, expect that deer to run for quite a ways. Its a beginner gun, do not expect them to drop with one shot unless you hit the sweet spot behind the front legs kinda near the knee. God help you if you take pot shots at a bear... like I did. 4-6 shots to put down a charging bear is not pretty. You ideally want to upgrade pretty much immediately. Men use bows, as our anscestors did. Real Men use Recurves as god intended, but the developers are clearly not as concerned as I. Point is, the beginner rifle will give you a bad impression if you are new to hunting. Stick with it. ... then get a bow. ;) Nothin like taking that perfect bow shot up close, and watching that buck drop....oh and this might as well be a beta for how buggy it is. I have numerous screenshots in my 3 hours of play of animals getting stuck on vegetation. Really the only bug I've found. If an incredibly annoying one. You spook an animal it will sometimes just fly right into a bush or tree and get stuck. The Hunter Classic had some great bug fixing, so I'm hoping this gets fixed. We shall see. Oh and the tutorial is absolutely terrible. If you are new too hunting, please for the love of god youtube some videos. Animals are smart. You have to be to get them. Calls, Stalking, Tree Stands, and an incredible amount of patience apply here.FINAL VERDICT TOO LONG DIDN'T READ: Lack of weapons. Lack of Reserves. Fantastic game, gorgeous environments, pretty buggy, so unless you LOVE to hunt (Like me.) I would wait for a sale. That being said, I HIGHLY reccomend this game if you are into the hunt.			"

												I like it... Probably one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen. The landscapes are beautiful, and I really feel like I'm walking in a dense forest or an open field. And the rush of getting that perfect look on the animal and placing the round right where it needs to be is just amazing. The game is like a rollercoaster, at first you are bored and kinda tired of tracking things down and then BAM! Huge buck outta no where and you slam him down to the ground and 20hrs go by lol. But.. sadly it has its issues.. Lots of bugs, sometimes the textures don't blend right (I noticed the road hovers above the ground a touch) and things don't make sense like the soft rounds saying they do more pentration but its supposed to be the polymer rounds. Yea.. there is a lot of stuff that I could say bad, but I won't. Cause this game is good, but it feels like a good solid foundation. I hope and pray the devs give this game lots of love... and keep patching and adding to it for a long time. Cause if they do, this will be the greatest hunting game of all time. Please, please keep showing love this game and support the community and I promise the community will show the love right back.			"

I loved my time hunting in real life and I don't believe there is a more accurate experience than this.But of course the only proplem with this game is the bugs, lots of bugs.

Makes one recall the time spent playing Deer Hunter 2004 in their childhood.Didn't really like the previous theHunter games as they were free but required microtransactions for anything to be accomplished, but thankfully there isn't a single one in this game. Everything is earned in the gameplay itself, which is bloody marvellous.Another plus one such as myself appreciates greatly is the single-player (there is an option for multiplayer), which as the name would suggest doesn't require internet to play. It's great for us Australians stuck with less than 50kb/s internet on peak. The story on campaign is fairly neat too, thus far.For the price it's currently at (AUD$40), I'd consider it worth it. If it's on sale, I'd highly reccommend grabbing it. Consider the game for it's graphics alone if hunting isn't your thing.			"

												This game is worth the $30 and it is a great improvement over the last game.Pros:-No microtransaction (everything can be unlocked relatively easily, to those saying it takes ages you just have to stop scaring away everything you are about to shoot, I've unlocked 2 new rifles in 10 hours of gameplay)-Beautiful graphics (the optimisation however isn't the best for example having too many points marked on the GPS can cause lag when the GPS is open)-Easily the most realistic hunting sim (weapon ballistics, correct hitboxes for each animal)-Multiplayer is very easy to setup and is p2p (just invite your friend to your game and they'll be able to join)-Very nice sounds-Very large map and nicely decoratedCons:-Animals sometimes stand in place (haven't encountered this since patch though)-Average optimisation-Some animals for example rabbits and birds can be killed but you cannot harvest their bodies-You make way more noise than you should (having a walk button that makes you slower and quiter could solve this)-Sometimes the tracks are pointing in the wrong direction-Bears attacking you is a bit glitchy-Some form of campaign/storyline which is nice however they're basically just quests to go do thingsThings you should know before buying:-Only 14 different weapons without around 2-3 ammo types for each-This is a very slow paced game so you'll probably find yourself getting frustrated if you're sprinting around looking for animals to shoot-Map is very large and there isn't any vehicles however when you claim an outpost you can fast travel between them-Your shots can ricochet off animals and you'll probably get mad and think it is a bug like I did the first time it happened-It helps to know how to hunt in real life-Knowing where to aim is key-Ballistic system-RPG like leveling up and skill system however they don't make much of a difference-High end system is probably needed-This game has controller supportSo yes I recommend this game at it's current price of $30 with no microtransactions "

												**DISCLAIMER** This is NOT going to be a serious, well structure review so if that is something you are looking for then you are better off scrolling on.Call of the wild is my first real hunter game I've gotten into, I dabbled in the free to play version but once you realise how much of a sting all the micro-transations are then it can be an instant turn off for loads of people, including myself. But then this beauty comes along, a one time payment, everything in the game is unlocked and available to use (Outside of the ingame currency earned) and there is room for DLC in the future. I really hope they don't take the mick with it though.Gameplay wise I find it very pleasing, tailing and calling in prey to be shot is really satisfying, especially if the kill is a beauty. Patience is a virtue in this game thats for sure.Graphically it is stunning, you can check my profile for some of the screen shots but this game really has some stunning moments in the game, all made available to capture through the ingame camera (for added feels). If it isn't the wildlife that grabs your attention it is the landscape!A few bugs I've noticed so far is sometimes the hitscan seems way off, I'll aim for the vital organs but when I claim the trophy ive shot right up the poop shaute.. Another is that the callers seem to bug and wont go off when used. I'm unsure if this is an audio thing or if it actually doesn't work in game when the item is used. Lastly I've had a really rare bug where I can't toggle to other eequipment. It isn't holdstered and the symbol in the bottom right will change but the character won't take out the respective equipment nor is it able to be used.Overall I love this game, and I am sure to have many more hours! As mentioned I just hope DLC isn't something that takes the mick over time.. Last thing steam needs is another Train Simulator DLC mockery!			"

												At its current state I can't recommend the game. I'll be waiting for updates and may change my review. Too many frustrating bugs are present in the release. Who knew you could instantly die from slowly walking into a boulder?UPDATE 1:Many, many bugs. Animals keep running in circles and get stuck behind objects. Finally scored that big game you wanted? Too bad, because we won't allow you to claim it. Love the sound of your rifle going off at that climatic moment? Too bad, because we won't play it. And so on and so on.			"

												After read so much evalutions and the developer replies, I decide to buy this game base on the actively developer communication. Most reviews had focused on the BUG and crashe problems so far, I hople that further updates could make this a  better game. Looking forward to edit my reply after hours of gaming time.------------------------------------------------------------------------------The first two hours of game: the first two animals I got was two female deers which was stick into trees and I walk to the in front of the deers and then aim, shoot.-----what a newbie treating!The third animal I got was a bear! I was little bit of scared of the first time hunting this big and wild beast! I aimed from 20M far, I was too afraid to get any closer. Left mouse cliking, I got her. Then the gaint wild beats stick into a rock and yet keep running away from my bloody gun. I walked into the bear slowly and give her more shoots-------what a newbie treating!------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keep looking forward to edit my reply aft more gaming time.

												So I love this game. I'm biased I love hunting IRL, The game needs some features to make sure it lives up to the hypeOf the most realistic hunting sim, .Fix the bugs that are already In - I understand this will take time..Trophy shot. .Mobile stands? .hunting pressure issues.bow hunting issues - sights. (Area to train) - also hitting a 50kg for from 10m with a 70lb bow would go straight through..Selling ability for weapons. I have almost all of them and I use for them..swimming - common sense, I can swim he should swim.Possible vehicles? - boat? Atv? At the moment the game has a lot of issues. Patch 1.5 saw frame rates drop a solid 30-40per second.Animals are bugged out, and generally the game doesn't run fully smooth.All this said. The game is awesome! I'm hooked. Massive thumbs up. Keep getting the work in and you will have a product people love! Just don't go back to that horrid Pay to Play days.  "

												Currently at 20 hours of gampelay in this and I can understand why the game is recieving mixed reviews.First off: Bugs. Yes there are bugs. The game was JUST released and by a developer who is small compared to other developers. Give them time. They actively listing to the community and review what is said. Bugs will be fixed, have patience.Some feel this game should be marked as early access. I personally disagree, for what it has it feels like a functional game, it just needs some patches/hotfixes. It is a full working game for the most part.The graphics are absolutely stunning, even on the lowest setting.If you've played The Hunter (Classic) you know what to expect, tracking, tracking, more tracking and finally the kill shot. This plays similar but the maps are MUCH larger. Hirschfelden is at least 6 times larger (IMO), the classic map itself is contained in the North East to give you an idea of size.It has a decent amount of weapons, good selection of rifles, handguns, shotguns, and bows. All the necessary callers/scents for the current animals, and they will be adding more as they expand their reserves, why wouldn't they? Look at how many animals and reserves they have in Classic.If you've never played The Hunter (Classic), this is not like other first person shooters, though I hope that would be obvious enough to not have to say. Keeping in mind that the Dev's will be releasing more content, and If I remember correctly the price should stay at ~$30, compare the average cost for the Classic game: weapons, outfits, membership fees, all the reserves and animals possible to hunt. You'd be talking potentially upwards of $60 if not even more (I've sunk more than I care to admit into that game and I still love it). $30 is NOT a lot compared to that, and it's on a more modern engine with planned content being made.For weapons each rifle and pistol comes with two different ammunition types that, I feel, are a little too similar right now. Shotguns still have three types of rounds.Animals now have different classes that are used for them (0-4 currently). 0 being Coyotes and Foxs, 4 being bears and bison. Weapons have a specific class type that can be used for any animal of the same class or higher (not effeciently), if you use a higher class weapon against a lower class animal it will ruin the integrity, causing lower payout and score (potentially score).Bows on the other hand have 3 ammo types, where each ammo type is a different class. I find that interesting because it makes it more versitile. Bows now take some getting used to due to the now random arrow off-set that can happen (The in-game dev's themselves state it is NOT the aim wobble but a different calculation) but is still a VERY powerfull weapon.All in all, I'd say $30 is definitely a very fair price for the game, in it's current status and obviously as more content gets released.EDIT: Forgot to add: NIGHTTIME HUNTING! I totally forgot about this. The game includes a FULL night/day cycle and you have a headlamp that is used to find tracks at night. This actually provides a bit more challenge because you can only see the tracks one of two ways: Stumbling over it or looking around with the headlamp on. I love the increased difficulty of this because it makes it more fun in my opinion. Couple that with the weather cycle that was heavily improved on compared to Classic (wind can affect your scent direction and distance, but also make you harder to hear), Fog makes you more difficult to see, and Rain can also affect how difficult you are to hear.

												The gameplay is super fun and beautiful.  Unfortunately, this game has too many bugs to count.  For me, the bugs don't affect gameplay, but my friend has to completely restart his computer every time he wants to play for some reason.  However, this game is much better than the first game (theHunter) that was almost 100% pay to win.			"

												This game certainly has some strong qualities. Great graphics. Excellent lighting effects, weather effects etc.Really large map. Nice weapons and accessories.Tracking system is not overcomplicated.But it also has some weak qualities. No vehicles on a ridiculously large map. You have to walk everywhere. All of the time. It's so boring sometimes when you just want to go from point A to point B.The level progression is insanely slow, to the point where it can take days to get a new weapon. No way to pause the game, literally, none. You can't rest without paying the money you earned from hunting. That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a video game. In the current state I do not recommend this game. It is good for just relaxing instead of going fast paced like in most games, but other than that it needs some serious improvements in those areas.EDIT: Still giving it a go. I just went up a tower to survey the land, with the intent on finding the nearest hunting camp afterwards. Fell off the tower, now I have to walk nearly 2KM to get to the new camp. All because there are nowhere near enough fast travel points. This is the main problem with this game. I hope things get better because once a few of these issues are fixed this could be one of the best games ever.			"

												I really would like to give this game a good review. It's obviously made by professionals, and has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it's just not possible to recommend someone spend $30 on this. There are too many bugs, and they're not just minor nuisances. It's irritating when the game starts up and the mouse cursor isn't locked to the screen, or you're just given the view from a player camera frozen in the air and you have to restart. I don't like it when you place a waypoint and it acts strangely, or the screen of your smart device disappears, or when you have to click a menu element five times to get it to respond. But when animals don't react to your presence, or when you shoot them and they freeze in place like statues that soak up your bullets, there's just no point in playing. The game's just broken, and you shouldn't buy something that's broken. Bugs aside, the only complaint I have is that the game is trying to be as realistic as possible, but the geometry of the terrain is just generic video game terrain that doesn't even remotely resemble reality. They could salvage the game at some point, but right now, don't buy it.Update:I originally posted this review after about 4 hours of play, and I had already encountered all of those bugs. I stuck with it, mostly to have something to do while I listen to podcasts, and the bugs just keep coming. No part of this game isn't broken. Every UI element, every interaction, every game mechanic is flat-out broken. It would be one thing if this game was in early access, but selling this a finished product is a stretch, if not downright deceptive. If they honestly believe this is a finished product, then they must not be anticipating doing the amount of work it would take to just be able to say it's not broken. That is worrisome.			"

												+10 hours since release and im enjoying the game so far. I havent tried the multiplayer yet so this is going to be mostly a single player focused review. For starters the game launched pretty sloppy for many, including my self, and many of the issues are still prevelent such as graphical glitches, crashes, and AI issues, sound issues. Since launch the game has felt like a unpolished beta rushed to meet a release deadline.The game over all plays pretty well for those who are a fan of The Hunter and already know what to expect. For new comers to the series It might be the only start to The Hunter they can enjoy since Classic has more of a F2P/P2W business model behind it and isnt very welcoming to new players since they are locked out of 95% of the great content in the game. If you are new to the series i would recommend picking this game up over playing classic first, if you are not a new commer to the The Hunter you might find this game a tad bit lacking in terms of equipment and features (dogs, tents, stands, tripods, scents, callers, birds, ducks, geese, blinds) so it wont fill those voids if you've enjoyed +100 hours with those features in your hunts. The game offers two reserves to hunt on and a wide array of equipment to use and animals to track and spot, Every animnal you harvest is awarded with XP and cash based on the difficulty of the animal, the weapon used and the shot placement and whether or not the animal died instantly or bled out over time. New features to the game are the new stealth mechanic, sight and sound now play an important factor as well as smell, the noob friendly meters on the HUD will show you how visible or how noisy you are in the environment, i found that the controller utilized these features better than traditional K/M. Progression in The Hunter is very different from other games and very time consuming, and given the unpredictiblity of many animals the game does not reward simple tasks and you will find yourself grinding or side tracked many times. A few new features to the game are ""need zones"", areas where animals migrate or congregate based on there needs at that specific time of day. NIght time hunting is also a new feature, hunting at night is alot more challenging than during the day you will find yourself wandering the game world following tracks since animals are usually quieter during the night. The new features in CofW are refreshing and a good reason to pick the game up if you like simulation or hunting games. Over all the core elements play well.  The game ran fine on a single Zotac GTX 980 on ultra for the most part with a Gsync display and Vsync turned on for many hours on end so its not a very demanding game if youve still got an older gen card in your machine. I have yet to test the game in SLi but for the most part it runs well without SLi.In review, The Hunter CotW is essentialy a bare bones experience of The hunter classic with an updated game engine and graphics and some unique gameplay features. I can see this game being polished and packaged really well in the future with a handful of updates and DLCs but for now you will only be getting a fraction of what The Hunter Classic has to offer currently.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay:7/10Features:7/10Content:6/10Over all: 7/10A solid game for sim lovers and hunters alike.

												Wow what an utter disappointment! The game was over-hyped and obviously rushed out in incomplete state. Numerous game breaking bugs and constant crashes everywhere! No matter how good it looks this is actually a downgrade from The Hunter Classic in terms of hunting experience. The Hunter CotW feels arcadey at best. no Trophy shots or display of any sort. Antler system is non-existant meaning you have dozens of deer clones running around, getting stuck in mid air...What an utter fail of a game launch. Out there with Arkham Knight dissaster for me!Refunding until the game is fixed!			"

												Me and the family decided to take a camping trip but after buying this, I told my wife to take a friend. Btw ppl stop being so lazy, the whole point in hunting is it takes time like fishing, you can't just run through the forest hoping to spot one, take it easy walk slow watch your sounds.  Only bugs I've noticed are when pulling up the map, sometimes you get big letters but it fixes fast and I have seen 1 deer get stuck on a rock. Over all this is best tracking and hunting experience in a game so far.			"

												I figured I would write a review solely base upon the mixed ratings.- This game definitely has it's bugs, but none of them have been absolutely game-breaking.- Expansive Worlds has made a step in the right, non-greedy direction.- You'll want a fairly beefy computer, but performance isn't as bad as some people make it out to be. (I'm getting 60 FPS on average, with the occasional drop to 50. Specs on my Profile)- Graphics are seriously phenominal. The game really looks like the screenshots. I haven't played a game of such large scale that manages to accomplish as much detail as this game.- Some story-mode/quest missions available that give the game a little more direction and challenge.If you want the game, I would recommend it. Some of the negative reviews seem a little harsh. "

												TL:DR - Its the most beautiful game you will ever see. The screenshots barely do it justice. Gameplay is pretty good, just what you'd expect from a hunting game. Multiplayer is very fun and easy to get into.-------------------------------------------Hands down, without question, THE MOST jaw-droppingly gorgeous game I have ever played. Turn your graphics up, your sound up, headphones on and just close your eyes. Its amazing. I moved out from the shadow of a tree into the sunlight and I would swear to you, I felt my arm get warm. THAT'S what kind of immersion this game delivers. You are going to walk around, ALOT. But once you come across the huts, you can resupply and fast travel between any you've unlocked. Hunting feels rewarding and frustrating at the same time. You need to move slowly, keeping an eye on your sound levels, but its only natural to want to ""hurry up"" and catch your prey. I found that after hearing an animal call out, it was easier to take up a good position, use my caller and wait for it to come to me. Multiplayer is very easy to get into and the fact that its up to 8 player co-op is pretty awesome. You can team up or go your own seperate ways and hunt ""alone."" You can even issue challenges and compete against one another. The mechanics themselves can be a big grindy. You need to make sure you try your best to take down your target with one hit so that it goes down quick and clean. You're pay for the kill will change depending on those parameters. It definitely takes awhile to unlock the weapons but everything is available ingame, no micro transactions.Shooting feels pretty good. Once you kill your animal and track it down (if you dont kill it outright) you can actually see where the bullet entered, what body parts it hit etc etc. Overall, I recommend it. Its absolutely gorgeous, 9/10 "

												Waited a long time for this game and fortunately it turned out to be everything I hoped it would be. There are some bugs and issues, but none have been in any way gamebreaking for me. The important stuff works.So here's some of the things that are great:- The visuals and sounds are gorgeous in every way and there's nice variety in locations.- The chase gives you the same kind of thrills as when you go hunting for real.- Tracking is done properly and is quite enjoyable.- Player movement and gunplay is spot on.- The statistics info on the harvested animal is done properly.Some small things that still need some improvement:- The menu and keybinds have some problems- Gear needs a lot more variety, since now there's only a fraction of the items from the original. But I guess that's the DLC plan...- Sneaking feels a bit dodgy and the vagueness of the movement sound UI doesn't help. Makes it a lot more difficult to track wounded animals.- The animal AI sometimes does funny things like gets stuck on things.- Freaked out wounded animals run around way too fast compared to the real thing.- It feels like the bleeding mechanic also needs a bit of tweaking. If you miss all the critical target hitboxes, the animal always bleeds at the ""Very low"" bleed rate, even with clear head- or gut shots. Also, wounds bleed more if you run, so running speed should affect the bleed rate.- I would prefer vehicles (or a horse) over fast travel any day.Conclusion: A very enjoyable hunting game and I expect it only to get better.

Really sloppy flaws that just makes it not enjoable for me at this stage.  You have to use a controller if you want to be able to sneak, otherwise your noise level is always at max? ♥♥♥♥ you, EW			"

												I think this game is good, if you are not patient I probably wouldn't recommended this game or hunting... but I think this game is great and the graphics are amazing! I see there are a couple of bugs (Main thing is that I noticed is the blood trails and tracks can be weird at sometimes) but if the developers fix everything and add more animals, locations and guns it will be the best hunting game made on pc by far. Another thing is that I feel like there should be atvs or some faster way to transport and adding like a hardcore mode where u have to eat and stuff would be pretty cool, as well as fishing!			"

												This should have been an easy recommendation. A lighter, better looking, more polished version of a great hunting game I've been enjoying for years. At first it seemed that's exactly what it was, but further playing revealed that the stealth system is totally busted, making it nearly impossible to stalk something using a keyboard. Prone movement on totally open grass should not be scaring deer into running off when they're over 100 meters away. Making as slow of movements as you can, avoiding foliage even, should not cause you to make the maximum amount of noise possible. Yet this is exactly what happens, all the time.If this problem is fixed, I'd love to revisit the game, but as it is now, it's just fundamentally broken.			"

												Tere are a ton of negative reviews, but I think some people should know this:1. The game just came out, so use common sense and know there is going to be bugs instead of spending your money thinking its perfect.2. Im sure they will update the game so people should stop complaining about no competitions or trophy shot system. Just be patient.3. The game looks great atm4. It IS playable, just some bugs here and there, but it is somewhat arcade style atm. Im sure this is subject to change later on.5. Have a good PC. It's not always the games fault that it crashes as soon as you join. For the short time I have been playing I have had no crashes because I have a decent PC.			"

												First off, to explain why I recommend this game:If you have been waiting for a hunting game to relive the old times like back in Deer Hunter 2005, this may just be it. However, if you are invested in theHunter Classic and have played that, you may want to stick with that for a while.As many have said, this game feels like a Beta title. The bugs are there, and while I haven't had anything game-breaking, they are still there. First, this game is beautiful. Just walking around, taking in the sights is a great experience that I find extremely relaxing.But, I have a few small gripes with the game in my playtime so far. For one, I feel like the animal AI is strange. The deer move at such a rapid pace, and trot around way more often than I believe is realistic. Even in the Hunter classic the deer were more docile and seemed to behave more realistic than this. I feel like tracking a deer is extremely difficult if not impossible. Granted, it should not be easy, but I feel like they just move too fast for you to effectively keep up.The noise mechanic is a nice feature of this game. However, I feel that the player character moves way too fast and makes too much noise. Sure, you must be careful and walk slowly, but I feel that crouch-walking the entire time is just not realistic/feasible. In real life, I can walk more carefully and tread lightly when needed. I know there are perks that can reduce walking noise, but it makes it hard to even kill anything and get to level up to get those skills. And then, since you have to crouch walk, you either cannot see the animals you are searching for, or you cannot keep up with a trail as the deer are moving away.I'm not saying we need slow moving, deaf zombie deer, but I think it still needs a little work.Now, I still recommend this game. I'm not a Hunter Classic player myself, but seeing how the devs have stuck with that game for so long gives me hope that they plan for this one to be around for a while too. I know tHuner Classic's subscription model might have been why they stuck with it for so long, so we will have to see. I do still have hope that they will fix this game and make it much better. The Hunter Classic 7 years ago would be laughable compared to what it is today. Let's hope they apply that work ethic to this title as well.If you're looking for a solid hunting game, that you can pay once for and get a full game, then I think this is your game... Once all of the wrinkles have been ironed out. But, if you're like me and just can't wait to jump in and scratch that hunting itch, then go for it! I will update this review as time goes on to see how well the devs keep up and fix the game, hopefully making it better!			"

												Shot a fallow deer 5 times, tracked it for over 1 real time hour, game crashed before I found it. 10/10 too much waterEDIT:TL;DR - Enjoyable, feels like a beta but very pretty with an iffy interface, less of a hunting game and more an animal shooting game. Bows are OP. No microtransactions.After putting more time into this, I feel I can write a proper and serious review. At the time of writing, this game functions like beta. That said, despite being riddled with bugs and occasional crashes (though your mileage may vary on bugginess) this game is a graphically superb and worthy sibling to theHunter Classic, and I don't regret my purchase. My only major complaint is that they somehow managed to be less realistic in this game than Classic with both the general feel of the game and with animal behaviors - I feel I can describe it best in the way that Diablo 3 is not a dungeon crawler like D2, but a very large loot run. Similarly, you are placed in the vast reserve (and I do mean vast, the maps are colossal) with free reign over a never-ending hunt. It doesn't feel like hunting to me, it feels like animal shooting. Veterans of theHunter Classic (or even other hunting games, I suppose) might understand better than someone fresh to the genre. Animals, particularly female deer, are still dumb as walking rocks with the added bonus of sometimes running you over on accident in their zeal to be the first to stand as close to you as possible. Bright side? They don't seem to magnetize toward you anymore - they go where the call was and stick around the immediate area. You're free to sprint like a madman with (seemingly) little consequence. In fact, it seems rewarding by the warning calls provided by animals, alerting you to their rough location. Just crouch and spam your callers. Move toward them for increased efficiency. Animals also seem to be very nonchalant about gunfire, even within ranges where they would probably reasonably hear it. They also seem to not mind returning to the same area where you butchered several herd members already. That said - the hunting pressure system seems to mostly work. Animals outside the group (if there was one) you killed from are very unlikely to enter the area when attracted to calls or scents. They do, on occasion, wander through to get somewhere else, though.So far, weapons handle reasonably well and have satisfying sounds and animations, though I personally find the kick-up of recoil to sometimes be laughably extreme as an avid hunter in real life. The .243 is not as woefully pathetic as in Classic, and will absolutely do the work you need it to (until you can get the .270. Get it.). However, I recommend polymer tip bullets when available. They are a pleasant step up from the standard soft points, but certainly not a critical upgrade. Bows, however, seem grossly overpowered at the moment. Flesh wounds will have deer bleeding out in times comparable to decent rifle shots.The interface is a bit cumbersome and lacks information (e.g. current weapon scores outside of the shop, experience until next level, return to main menu button) that I would like to have access to, although this is more of a personal gripe than a point against the game. Most of the nitpicky issues I have with menus and interface are personal beyond being unrefined. The map also has the tendency to find itself focused on anywhere except where you are when opened.If I sound harsh on this game, it's not because these are glaring faults that should dissuade you from buying. This is a good game for the state it's in, but realize that it does have issues. I can recommend this to veterans of Classic that want a more streamlined and immediate hunting experience without fussing through menus and launchers or simply want to support Avalanche and Expansive Worlds. It's more of theHunter, what can I say? If you're on the fence or new to this series, perhaps stick with Classic until this game is fleshed out more.			"

												When it works it's great, huge maps, great graphics. However, the current state of the game is game breakingly buggy. The menu screens have memory leaks for some, the inventory screens don't work, freeze, and don't transfer items for a lot of people. As of right now, with almost 6 hours into my save, the inventory system has locked all of the ammo into storage, and since it's bugged out and I can't retrieve it, it's effectively made it impossible for my to play any longer without starting a new save game.I like the game a lot so far overall, but until the bugs are all fixed I highly recommend holding off on purchasing this. Give it a month or so.			"

												I was excited for this game, but it has been a huge let down.Reasons to not buy this game/delay your purchase until patches are released:- Terrible optimization (I have a powerful PC, even on the lowest settings it isn't great. I currently use a R9 390 so Gameworks is suspected to be the issue, no surprise there)- Game breaking bugs (spawning outside of the map, spawning under the map, being stuck on the world screen)- Buggy menus (half the time menu category buttons do nothing when clicked)- Broken sound (any items I use including the rifle make no sound at all, even when the world ambience is working fine)- Clunky animations (e.g. when reloading the right arm of the player model has a muscle spasm)I'm sure after a few updates these issues will be resolved, but releasing a product in a state like this shows that the Avalanche hasn't given Expansive enough time to release a functional game. Will update this review when the game has improved.			"

												I've been watching this game since it went into Beta. The graphics look great, but the developers just fall short on the basics...- 3440x1440 has message boxes showing up off screen. Only the edges can be seen, while all of the text and general data is offscreen. Making it much harder to tell what is going on in game. Wide screen and custom resolutions are just basic functionality that should simply work on ANY PC game. If you don't support custom or at least standard resolutions, then you can't really call yourself a PC game in my opinion.- Going prone on an incline causes a graphical glitch allowing you to see through the world. How did this ever make it through both QA and Beta? This is another bug dealing with basic functinality. How do you produce a game that allows for prone and crawling and never once notice the clipping? Either that or they were simply too incompetent to fix it, neither of which is a good sign.- AI got stuck in the water. Two deer were walking in the water and just got stuck on nothing. While this bug is a little more forgivable given that these types of bugs generally require very specific locations/actions, on top of other basic functionality it all just points to Devs who either don't care about the quality of the game, or who are too incompetent to ensure the quality of the game. In either case I do not recommend buying it, though I will say it looks beautiful when it isn't glitching out.			"

I can't say that I have seen a hunting game with better graphics.  The inital tutorial (If you use it)  was very straight forward and gives you good information in regards to gameplay.  Full controller support is a + but I didnt see any tutorial telling you how to better learn the controls if using a gamepad.  I opted for mouse and keys after discovering how clunky the controls felt on the 360 controller.Played the game and streamed it for a good 7 hours solid on launch day.  During the time playing I noticed more flaws then animals.  The deer seemed to be more responsive to calls then in classic.  They will literally run up withing 10m of you just to immediatly spook and run away.  So keep your eyes peeled for that and make sure you dont call them in when they are slowly heading your direction or they may just run right to you.Huntermate bug.  Having the huntermate in your hand and then pressing H to hide equipment swapping around then pressing Tab to bring up the huntermate actually brings up what looks like the face of an otterbax that your phone has fallen out of!   Whats this?!  Sure you can Tab around and get it back easily but hmmm.People with a poor quality internet connection, or beloew requirement PC can still play.  But be aware that you will Croush, Walk, and Run at least 10x slower then anyone else in game and you will rubberband around and have glitchy player animations.  I whitnessed all of this while playing with a friend that I am going to build a new PC for. I unlocked the bow!   YES! now that I've earned 10,000 and change I am going to buy the bow and some arrows and give that a shot.    Supprise Supprise....  I have EXPLODING arrows?!   While luring in an animal there I was.... Tucked under a tree for better cover and got my doe lured in at around 15m away.   I draw my bow and wait for her to turn.   Booom!  I fired my arrow to notice a flash and a giant puff of smoke come off the deer I shot.   Realistic?!  Hardly.While in a game and checking out the menu I noticed there is NO way of going back to home screen.  You simply have to Alt+F4 or you have to X out of the game and restart if you wish you start a new hunt or go from singleplayer to multiplayer.There are no micro-transactions in-game and I feel this is a good thing!  I feel that with how they marketed the game you should have to work for your gear which in turn will make it more enjoyable.  Simply being able to hop in and buy the guns you want, and anything you need with a micro-transaction seems to bring out the boredom and fast.I think in total having TheHunter (Classic) since 2011 and putting in over 300 hours on steam and well over 400 hours with the launcher from the site.  If you are looking into a new hunting game and have not tried TheHunter (Classic) then that is the game I would go for.There are many other glitches and bugs I have not mentioned in this post for Call of the Wild but believe me when I tell you they are there.  Expansive Worlds released this game too early and didn't spend the quality time required from a dev team to iron out majority of the glitches and bugs you are bound to discover if you download this game.Sure you are going to have bugs in a game. But for it not to be announced as early-access or beta.  There are too many in this game for it to be launched as a complete title.TheHunter (Classic) also has a vast array of species for you to hunt.  There are only 2 reserves and limited species to hunt on Call of the Wild as of yet.I'll leave the decision making to you the gamers, but if I had to choose now after only being 7 hours in.  This game needs some serious work.  Oh.... and waterfoul hunting.  ;)-FoX "

												I like it! Alot, actually. I haven't had any of the notorious crashes or bugs everybody's been talking about so far. Being an avid bowhunter our in the real world, there's alot in this game for me to like. So, let's get into it:Pros:-None of that monthly payment crap they did with theHunter classic, which I never played because of that.-Gorgeous game, period. -Good animal models.-So far, I like the animal behavior. It seems realistic enough.-The needs areas. It's about as realistic as you can get to areas where animals bed down and where large water sources are.-The hunting pressure system. Finally, a game does it. If you hunt out of one area all the time you're never going to find anything in there because it's all been chased out.-Realistic scent and sound mechanics. Keep an eye on the wind and watch your step. Keep your ears open for calls.-The sheer amount of space available to you. The reserves are large, to say the least.-It's ****ing hunting!Cons:-It doesn't say it's in early access, but it pretty much is. The lack of content shows, mostly in the weapons department. The game could use birds and more big game, too. -No traditional bows. I've used compounds all the way up to longbows. I use a recurve during the bow season, so the fact that it's isn't in the game bothers me. The compounds will have to do for now. -Bleed outs. The fact that the feature exists at all is excellent. However, they bleed out way too quickly. I get that it's a shot to the vitals, but they aren't going to run a hundred yards and just drop. They hole up and lay down, pretty much waiting until they die. Granted, it depends on how badly they've been shot, bow or rifle, but right now the distance run by the animals after the shot seems rushed and artificial. I can't speak for the bugs, because I haven't seen any yet, truth be told, but I like what I've played so far.Definitely a recommend from me.			"

												I've been playing theHunter classic for several years. I was looking forward to CotW. It looks and sounds as stunning as the game as potential. That's about it.-It crashes regularly, to a point where it locks up your whole computer and warrant a restart. I didn't experience that for a decade.-The game only supports a handfull of resolution, god forbids if you have an ultrawide screen.-Animal tracks completely disapears at some point, for no reason and with no way to bring it down, at all.-Animals are constantly calling and pin pointing their location to the player, it's a shooting range-Game has better support for controllers than kb&mouse (no way to move silently with a keyboard, no matter the stance)-The starting rifle is a toy and will hardly even pierce a small roe deer or coyotee's flesh even at a good angle. The solution is to aim for the head which is a nonsense in hunting.-The UI is clrearly your generic usual console UI,  plagued by bugs and inconcistencies.-There are no antler's variety-The grind is realAfter that rushed released It's up to the devs now to reach the amazing potential of Call of the Wild. Hoping most customer's first impressions won't be the last I still cannot recommand this game.			"

												The menus are garbage. Like, seriously.The menus are the worst thing about this game. I would honestly not care if they went the simplistic route like you would find in theHunter Classic. The gameplay isn't bad, unless you decide you want to look at your skills and press ESC. Except wait, that will just close your game because it thought you clicked ""Exit To Desktop."" Then there's the fact that there is no leave game option, just exit directly to desktop. Why? Navigating to another tab (i.e. Skills, Perks, Map) will act as if you're double-clicking or just glitch out in some other way.My experience in game hasn't been bad, at least until the menus decide to frustrate me.

												first and for most.. all the bug that were in closed beta still here they sent out a link for people to sign up to join in an talk with the devs and who ever got in for the testing of it must have not play or test anything since the same beta bug are still here.. and for everyone saying this is realistic your full of♥♥♥♥♥♥i dont know about you but shooting a moose with a .243 is not realistic.. if i had a choice to set a price on this game $10 max so dont wast your money..*UPDATE*you have known of many problems with the game since closed beta and never fixed them.. wonder why the game isnt in as ""Early Access""??? and im sure you would not have all this hate from your dedicated players... we would see EA on it and say wow ok at least we know they are still working on it and should exspect bugs sure no prob.... but no you release a game that has the same bugs in it from closed beta... and now we have to wait for the community ONCE AGAIN to Fix YOUR F*K* up sneak should have been PRIORITIZED with the first patch... and your ask why is so many people mad at this game.... But im not mad knowing your track record with thehunter classic i knew from day one when i launched the game and it crashed with in 3sec of sitting on the main menue this is going to be a long road ahead of your customers an i can see why so many people asked for a refund.... EW has tied there own Nuse i just hope they dont pull the lever as well... game has a great potential... so i hope that EW can pull it off soon so we can still have good times in the game			"

												So I've decided ro review for this game as I see the previous hunter game didn't get much recommendations.Firstly, this has to be the most beautiful game I've ever seen, it smashes any other game in terms of realistic colours and lighting, the sun bouncing off foliage is exactly replicated in this game and looks photorealistic when seen.Secondly, the sounds are absolutely perfect, running through wetlands, rustling through bushes, all the sounds are perfectly recreated in this world, you can even hear the equipment your wearing rubbing against the objects around you.Now I get onto the hunting, which is in it's early days and constantly being improved, the devs are hot on problems, and I no longer get crashes. There are few bugs, when playing for an extended amount of time, tracks and scents seem to stop being generated, making it almost impossible to hunt anything.The actual hunting in itself is pretty decent, there's a nice flow to tracking to stalking to then finally killing the game, animals will nearly always hear you if you walk or run, so following a ""fresh"" track normally means crouching and taking it slow, running around everywhere wont get you any results, so if you're impatient, or don't like waiting 20-30 minutes + for a shot, then you obviously have never been hunting! It's not all about stalking though, there are open areas where there may be drinking, feeding or resting areas, and near there, is most likely a chance to build a lookout stand, this is great fun if you dont want to be stalking, but requires patience as the area around you may only be visited at certain times of the day, so time management is key with sitting and waiting.Once you actually find something to shoot, it's not a matter of shooting it ""wherever"" there is an art to knowing where and when to shoot, shoot them in the wrong place, and you're basically being cruel and irresponsible. shoot them through the heart, you'll most likely get a clean and instant death, and PETA goes home happy.When you DO kill an animal, you'll get a reward based on the following, the animal you killed, whether it has a trophy rating, how long it took to die, the integrity of the shot (the right weapon choice) and obviously where the animal was shot. Getting a gold rating is always a big thing in this game, the ability to track, stalk and shoot an animal properly and cleanly, and this game graces the player when they complete this correctly.Overall, some of the things I would like to see in the future include small game hunting, as an Englishman myself, I hunt rabbits with night vision, and do alot of pest control, night vision sights would be a great addition to the game, but also small game hunting. another great addition would be birds, pheasants for the english, ducks for the americans, would be incredibly entertaining and I look forward to what the game brings in the future.I would recommend this game if you hunt in real life, if you don't this might be abit dull if you don't understand why this game is so good, but if your looking to buy something straight out rather than pay a subscription, this game is for you.

												This game absolutely has the potential to be the best hunting sim one could ask for. However, it should never have been released in it's current state.Right now, it's just too buggy overall. Animals getting stuck on rocks, mission rewards not paying out correctly, nonresponsive and generally sluggish menu, etc.I'm sure all the above issues can be fixed with some time, but I can't bring myself to endorse Call of the Wild for now. If the situation changes and bugs are fixed, I will of course change my review.			"

												Well... the game it self is beutiful. Walking in the forest with you trusty old shotgun while the sun is shining thrue the leafs, that looks stunning and feels good to. So the grafics is indeed very good! But.... the game is full of buggs and tbh it dosent feel like the devs are doing so much. Tracks dissapere, animals get stuck and you might die when you are just taking a walk. There is 2 Maps in the game. Both are in the summer. Idk why they dident make the second map winter.. Been playing +40 hours Now and i continue to find bugs.. So for now i Dont recommend the game. Mostly becuase the say that the game is complete But its not! Its an Alpha game that they charge a full price for.			"

												This is a joke, not a game. I paid 30 euros to discover it has just two maps...wtf ? It's full of bugs from day one. This one of them which comes first into my mind:I went to system when I was in the game to make some changes. Guess what, you can't change brightness, there is no button for such setting and because of that screen colors seem washed up, it looks terrible. When I wanted to resume game the escape key didn't work, even if it says press escape to go back. This is, as almost all the launches of EW a  ♥♥♥♥ed-up job, like Whiterime ridge map in Hunter Classic. Don't buy this game, it's a waste of money. And that is not all. The so called bonuses won't work, they are ♥♥♥♥ed up even if on The Hunter forum a it's silence, no one from EW, despite the problmes raised, is there to give us an explanation for this new screw-up .  At the hour I write this review I still can't have the three bonuses promised. (A rifle for the classic and two items for this game I review in this very moment)PS - And guess what, in its first day the game was cracked , it's for free for whoever wanted on the web. If I knew it was so bad, I would have waited this moment instead of wasting my money on a crap game. "

												I have 380+ hours of theHunter: Classic under my belt so I think I've come to some conclusions after a dozen hours or so.I have had zero performance issues, crashes or the like to date and it runs slicker than dog poop on linoleum on my i5 and GTX 1060 6Gb. I don't find all of the claims of clipping and geometry issues to be any greater in extent than what I experienced in tH:C (theHunter: Classic, not THC). Is this a better game? Graphically yes and the gameplay is not far off of par in my opinion. They ruined the huntermate by changing a few things so that takes some getting used to. I enjoy the missions and perk points as a bit of a motivator to play and don't find the menu system to be all that difficult. Seriously so much salt over small potatoes.Yes, some of the animal behaviour is screwy and some of the calls seems a bit over the top but I would expect that with continual patching as seen to this point, some of this stuff can be tweaked.There are no micro-transactions or the idiotic 3 month license that tH:C forced you to repeatedly buy so this is a thumbs up for me. Haven't tried MP yet. May update if I do			"

												In short:While theHunter Classic could be called more of a hunting sim, Call of the Wild is an arcadey animal shooter, which was released utterly unfinished. Don't let the pretty landscapes and cheap(ish) price fool you; Avoid Call of the Wild like a plague until it's at least technically fixed and then hope they fire whoever whose idea this 'new direction' for the game was.Pros:+ Super pretty graphics+ No microtransactionsCons:- Unrealistic: Too many animals, which are near impossible to spook- Buggy: Encountered tons of glitches during 30min of gameplay- UnoptimizedMy experience:I loaded up the game and - after fiddling with the settings to make it run even semi-playably - decided to head out and find some game. Literally one minute after leaving the cottage I heard the warning call of a bear. I looked at the handy audio direction indicator and there the bear was, casually strolling at me. WTF?? I decided to take a shot at it. The bear reacted by taking a few running steps and then getting stuck on an invisible wall. I shot at it again, and again it took a few steps and stopped. This time it turned to face me head on and stare me with its big, quizzical eyes, as if it was hoping me to end its buggy virtual existence. I did.Now, in the original theHunter, running around and shooting your gun tended to have the side effect of making you unable to see a single hair of an animal for the next ~30 minutes. Not the case with this game, it seems! Just as I had finished slaughtering the poor Pooh, I SAW A BLACKTAIL DEER LOOKING AT ME, COMPLETELY PLACID. AND HEARD ANOTHER BEAR. What is this? Russian oligarch hunting simulator with tame animals tied down for you to shoot at on your private ranch?Thanks for turning the only somewhat respectable hunting simulator in the world into a dumbed-down shooting gallery for the Adderall generation. A bold move, I would say, as the niche appeal of the original game was the only thing keeping it afloat. Let's see how it pays off.EDIT: It is entirely possible the game was bugged and/or the game makes sure you see an animal the first time you play the missions. Or I just got extremely lucky. However, I wanted to keep my playtime short to keep my eligibility for the refund program, after seeing the glitches and framerate issues. I'm open to trying this game again at a later date - but at this time I cannot recommend it.			"

												This game has alot of bugs, don't get me wrong it is playable but damn it has so much bugs.This is the reason why I dislike the game and it is the only reason:Furthermore the developers want to bring this game to the consoles which means that there will be less support on the pc version and on the other hand a extremly bugged version for the consoles because this developer team is really small.

												To anybody that likes hunting games i would recommend this game to you, it was huge maps, a variety skills and perks, multiple ways to hunt, and the developers are working hard to fix any/all problems that people are having with the game. There are a couple of problems i have with the game so far.1. In multiplayer the only the host can inteact with everything your friends or other players cant interact with lookouts, outposts, and undiscovered points on the map.2. Its some times feels like you go really slow out of no where kind of like if you were in slow-mo but only you this includes reloading, running, using lures etc.			"

												Overall...probably one of the best hunting games to date. If you are looking for a casual hunting game this is it. Expect a lot of walking, a lot of crawling, finding animals needs zones to hide out at for awhile, etc. Cons:It feels like its early access. Currently has a lot of bugs and some game crashes. I still consider it worthwhile though, even in its beta state. The missions are kinda dumb. But you can just bypass them and do whatever you want. For example: the missions are currently arranged in a way that makes it almost by chance to complete some of them...such as the take a picture of 2 bears in one pic. I personally hate the photography missions. This will most likely be fixed at some point.... but the animals sometimes get stuck on rocks, or freeze in space. This also will at some point be added: more animals and more content. Pros:None of that monthly pay crap they had in the first one. This is the reason i bought this one and nothing from the first one. Free roam. You can follow the story missions, side quests, or do whatever you want. Some scenery is so gorgeous it could be a background for your monitor.Huge enormous reserves. I havent even been to every location in almost 40 hours of gameplay. Bleed outs from animalstracking.......you can literally spend an hour in real time tracking an animal that you shot, it you hit the flesh and no vitals. hunting pressure zones. If you shoot an animal in the same spot, they come around less, if not at all. History. Their past game shows that they will work one this game for years to come. Adding content, fixing bugs, etc. etc.Realistic features.... sounds, smells, and visuals can give you away as a hunter.  "

												It's an excellent simulator of what hunting really is and should be like. There are some annoyances that I HOPE the developers keep in mind when releasing future updates, but for the most part the game is excelent.Pro's1. This game is beautiful. It is taxing on the system, but I am able to play on a steady 30 fps, and the textures are all at least 4k. Its amazing and I definetly applaude the developers for making it so.2. Realism of the process of hunting is outstanding. It goes through all the steps, and doesnt make it overly simplified to find prints or track animals.3. Animal diversity is also quite astounding.Con's1. The A.I of the animals needs a lot of tweaking. This is a problem that should be able to be remedied, but it is something that needs to be fixed in the future if the game is to be succesful. It kinda takes the realism out of the game when you finally track down a deer stuck in a tree, and shoot it point blank. Take collision with trees off at least?But other than that, the game is fineThere is not a whole lot more to a hunting game than what it already has guys. This isnt bass pro;s either, so they dont have an entire warehouse arsenal of hunting equipment for you to choose from. It's just the way it is and I can understand it.Overall 7.5/10, If the A.I is fixed 10/10			"

There are some bugs with animals and wepons but nothing to major I have seen besides a animal getting stuck on a rock.I have shot and killed most of the animals with the starting weapon and poly rounds. (Bears,Deer,Elk,Moose,Coyotes.) I have not killed any bores or bisson yet with it. Grnated i have to do alot more tracking on bigger animals but hey its the fun part.			"

												This game is as enjoyable as it is good looking; exploring dense forest, wavey plains and steep rock faces all in search of that perfect deer. You've got a decent selection of gear to choose from, such as bows and shotguns, bolt action rifles and lever action repeaters, scents and callers and ammuntion focusing on either penetrating thicker hides or causing more damage to the vitals. You'll be using these against several breeds of deer, fox, bears, herds of bison, moose and wild boar, all of which spread over two large open maps. One map takes place in Northern America and the other in rural Germany.This game still has a few flaws, however. The animal AI can sometimes get caught on the terrian or get stuck in pathing loop. Whenever you go prone, the camera can clip through the ground, revealing the vast nothingness below. The sound glitches and crackles when there is a lot going on.It you can look passed a few rough edges, you'll have a great hunting game on your hands. I've paid full price and I do not regret waiting for a sale. It you enjoy hunting games or exploring vast open worlds, then I highly recommend this game.			"

												Gameplay:Its not Call Of Duty in the Forest, where bears on steroids, 50 feet tall attacking innocent topless girls in mini skirts, and u save them - (btw I would love this kind of game) - this is slow paced, hunting simulator. My last hunt was tracking black bear for like 20 minutes, and then hit it from 250 meters in the head. It really was like real life hunting - you have shot statistics after hit, where did u hit animal and the score. Its really interesting. I can suspect there will be more DLCs like Alaska with Grizzly bears and stuff like this - which will make this game only better.Graphics are great, and you really have feeling being in the forest, moving slowly tracking your prey - if you like, slow paced games, where you have to think a lot, a truly hunting simulation - it is game for You.

												Been playing for a minute now and have noticed a couple things that bug me, first in multi player everyone can hear the bleet call as if they where using it when they dont have it out. it only takes one person to clear out a entire session. also when using some calls i notice where the clip for the audio begins and ends. this is only when im using headphones. but lastly the acuracy on some weapons is extrememly poor mostly the bow butt some rifles included. also i wish i had better audio mixing setting for example being about to turn down the volume for some things like the calls and the gunshots. but not effect ambiemt noises when doing so. more settings in general would be nice. also their is currently at the time of this post a bug that effects your scope and makes you relog when it happens in order to fix it.all in all this game is like a 6 out of 10. i really enjoy it but the little things irritate the heck out of me.

												Great game with great features. My fewcomplaints arethe incompatibility of the controller with the map and inventory and basically the whole menu ui. The lack of power the players that aren't host have in multiplayer, such as not being able to buy outposts or unlock lookouts. Also if they just added all the features of the free (the Hunter) like the guns and all the animals and maps. Which i hope in the future they will. This game would be a solid 10/10. For now its an 8/10 due to the lack of things to do after unlocking all the items. Waiting for the patch where they take everything from their other game over to this one.			"

												Everything about the game, graphics, scenery, AI and much more are 100% phenomenal. I have been complete emersefied in the game since purchase. I like everything about it and would recommened it to any one that loves hunting with a few exceptions as listed below. 1.) Sometimes the animals glitch out while walking/running or after being shot. 2.) So far i have discovered a few watch towers and 1 camp, which gives you rewards such as perks, cash or skill points. The one thing i have noticed each time is i don't actually recieve my perk points, has happened 3 or 4 times now and mainly on finding the watch towers and a couple other times on some other things. I do how ever receive them for leveling up though just fine. 3.) I don't know if it has to do with how im playing or not but there seems to be a bit of lack on animal species spawn rates. Out of the 16+hrs played i see an animal on average of 1 time every 45mins of real world time not game time. I do however know the game is different if a new game is started up again and i mean new as is starting all over at level 1. The first time there seemed to be more spawn rates. I only started a new game as i was only level 3 and the wife wanted to learn how to play as well.4.) Currency relative to game play builds and purchases. I feel the game is a little over priced on guns,bows and ammo as prices range from 10,000 to 60,000 for rifles and ammo starts as 350.00 for maybe 5 to 10 shells, as i have spent 1000.00 on ammo for the .243 (starting rifle) and received around 60-80 rounds. The building cost of the stands vs animal kill cash prizes and other world findings is a little high as well, say around 25% higher than i think it should be. Im all the time building stands and but that cost effected me being able to purchase better guns.			"

												Not every game is a full on shooter, Not every gamer wants a full time shooter. I played the original Hunter game and the Mini transactions were a big put off. If you liked that game but not the transactions, then this one is spot on. This is graphicly a lot better and playwise, a lot more to offer. I was hesitant as the original one left me feeling like an open wallet and that the game would require constant funding. This is how it should have been released to start with.Definatly enjoying my experience now.			"

												Multiplayer dosent have any feutures from single player,  all u can do is shoot animals and get money. So when ur ammo runs out u have to go back to single player to get ammo. And there is no return to menu option. So if u want to switch from multi to single or the other way around u have to restart the game.			"

												It's fun. There's a handful of frustrating technical isssues that still persist after several patches but I'm enjoying the game anyway. However, I do wish serveral features had been carried over from TheHunter for the launch of CoTW but with any luck the devs are working on them now. This game will rank higher than the previous game for me personally once all the kinks are ironed out and we start to see a steady flow of new content but it feels like that is a bit far away from now. Until that happens I can happily roam the gorgeous landscapes and relax for a while.			"

												theHunter: Call of the Wild by Avalanche Studios, Expansive Worlds and astragon Entertainment might just be the “ground-breaking open world hunting simulator” you’ve been waiting for. The game implements realistic animal behavior, ballistics, and even weather cycles. There is not much of a tutorial and the player is dropped into the world with a gun and a map. Although there are initial voice overs and some tips, the player is pretty much left to their own devices.In regards to gameplay, the tracking mechanic can prove to be both frustrating and exciting. This is perhaps what lends it so well to creating an immersive experience that feels pretty real. While deer don’t have glowing prints, it is difficult not to feel excited when you realize you are getting close to one of the many types of wildlife in the game. It is also important to be on edge because many of the animals can turn and attack at a moment’s notice. It is hard not to feel excited when you finally line up that shot and pull the trigger. This game’s ballistics really alter the success of each shot based off of distance and trajectory so accuracy matters.However, I did find a few issues with the game. Due to the sheer size of the map and it being rendered all at once, the game is both beautiful and sometimes laggy. When prone I noticed that the grass does not connect to the ground, which caused clipping and obstruct the path at times. The most noteable glitch was a moose stuck in a hillside that would not die until it was shot five times. This is a big deal when ammo is limited and weapons are difficult to unlock in the beginning. There is also an auto walk feature, which is nice when walking great distances, but problematic when collecting trophies. This is because when doing so the game does not pause and you can walk off a cliff, be attacked by a bear, or both in my case.You can read the full review here {LINK REMOVED}http://bit.ly/GCypher7336 "

												ALthough the equipment is extremely expensive the game is pretty good. It could be a awesome game if they would add a few things. First we need tents to sleep in at night to save our progress. Portable deer stands and deer feeders would be sweet. Also throw in the ability to use a campfire to eat and drinking bottles for a better feel of real life. It takes a while to level up. Cover scents and camo clothes should be unlocked from day one and alot CHEAPER! I definetely look forward to future updates.Throw in a atv for the long trails and you got a great game.LolOne last thing. A CROSSBOW would be awesome. Thanks			"

												Dont know why this is getting bad reviews. I played the first game and the feeling it gives you is like no other. This sequel based on the very short time i have played it (just a bit over an hour i think) is just like the first in giving you that feeling. Its very zen like.... until you find your prey... then the anxiety is turned to 11. Most games are incapable of doing this. This game is very special. If you have this on your wish list or it interests you. Buy it. Bascially the game drops you into the middle of a large german hunting reserve. It takes you on a short tutorial on how to move around and do stuff and then abruptly sort of lets you do whatever you want. If you played the first hunter game you know there is no real.... DIRECTION you are supposed to go. Its a hunting game so you have to find where to go. Be it in the form of a sound. a track. poop. or even an animal in the distance. Once this happens the game gives you directions to follow in the form of azimuth. And in the case of tracks , it points you in the rough direction of your next set of tracks which glow blue.  Its a very zen like experience. This is also the longest part of the game. It can take quite a long time to track an animal. My first play through was just 1 deer and it took 40 minutes. And I shot at it multiple times and had to start tracking it again. This is frustrating but realistic. eventually when you end up hitting a deer , depending on where , it will start bleeding. This will start leaking on the ground and giving you a new set of tracks to follow. If you shot the deer in a good spot. It will slowly or quickly start to bleed out. And you follow the blood trail to the body. Then you harvest the deer and get your points. There are other animals in the game but i have not seen them yet.It also has , what i would have to say the best environmental graphics of any game ever made. I dont know WHAT kind of magic the developers did with lighting and foliage. But taking screenshots in this game is almost as fun as playing it. If you are old enough to experience CRYSIS when it first came out on PC , you know what its like to be completely blown away by graphics. I have not had that feeling since today. It really is a technological marvel Give these devs your money. And make sure to leave a review. I dont understand where the negative reviews are coming from			"

Cleaning and maintainance to your rifle/weapons.7. Firing range for practises.8. Make clothing have progression, better gloves and better clothing / shoes for hunting purposes.			"

												I picked up this game and started playing it on average computer. It was nice but I realized it was not running as it should. I was ready to give it up. Then I decided to buy a new gaming pc OMG this game comes to life on a good computer, gone is the slow hunter. I am the Ben Johnson of hunters!! This game is amazing in so many ways.if you are looking for easy go play something else. You have to treat this game like real life. Do you have a tutorial in real life?? I don't! You also won't start to enjoy the game until you get to around level 4. Have you ever been driving late at night and you are a little tired on a two lane highway? You know when your trying to stay awake and think ever bush is a deer or moose about to jump in front of you?? This  game does that!!  You swear that I'm the distance deer are bushes you squint your eyes trying to see but no that's just a bush not a deer!! Lol The people that say there are no animals? Just like real life the animals on this game are WILD!! Do you think they want to be shot and killed and eaten by me?? Heck no. They run and hide when they hear your noisy♥♥♥♥♥coming. They smell your old spice aftershave you splashed on this morning. Don't be stupid!! WILD animals are smarter than you!!You have to go slow, sure you can run to a place. But then your sure going to have to wait for things to calm down again after all the human noise you just made!!I myself have encountered very few problems with the game now that I'm running a 1070 video card and i7 processor. I'm on max setting on everything and it looks and feels like real life.The calls take a bit to get used to. Start with the small black one it travels further. The deer will come to you after awhile in the right location. When they get a little closer switch to the can call. I had one today come so close he was almost on top of me!!! Then I was so excited I missed from 5feet  away lol . Just remember if you kill something move on because that area is full of the animals dead smell now lol great feature, it makes you move on and explore more.This is bar none the best and most realist hunting game out there by far!!  I have much more to unlock and I am super happy with how it's going so far. I can't wait to see what else is in here!Great game with so many options on what you can do. Walk around or just find a place to bring them in. Buy this if you have the computer to run it! And they taste great too!!			"

The gras and terrain give clues and paths that animals have obviously taken. It is amazing! Great game. Definently worth the buy! They have GONE AWAY from microtransactions and have already added FREE DLC. NOW, there are a few glitches but they are definelty not game breaking.

There are numerous UI glitches, an interface that is half missing when playing on 21:9 resolutions being the most noticeable for me, goven that the critical display of ammo, visibility and noise are off the screen. The map is very clunky as are all the menus.However, I have never felt so immersed in an environment. They are huge, gorgeous and full of wonderful ambient sounds and changing weather and lighting. I really hope the devs can bring the rest of the game up to the same standard but in the meantime I am simply enjoying the escapism of wondering through these worlds.			"

												Gameplay:Its not Call Of Duty in the Forest, where bears on steroids, 50 feet tall attacking innocent topless girls in mini skirts, and u save them - (btw I would love this kind of game) - this is slow paced, hunting simulator. My last hunt was tracking black bear for like 20 minutes, and then hit it from 250 meters in the head. It really was like real life hunting - you have shot statistics after hit, where did u hit animal and the score. Its really interesting. I can suspect there will be more DLCs like Alaska with Grizzly bears and stuff like this - which will make this game only better.Graphics are great, and you really have feeling being in the forest, moving slowly tracking your prey - if you like, slow paced games, where you have to think a lot, a truly hunting simulation - it is game for You.

												Outstanding looking game with a lot of potential, but the game is basically an Early Access title. Lots of bugs that needs fixing and there are some problems within the game such as the currency system (takes like 4 hours of hunting to get 1 rifle that is barely better than the first one you start with), and the travelling in this game - oh man.. There are 2 maps in the game that are both vast and beautiful, but you have to walk/run EVERYWHERE. There is a fast travel option but you need to travel to the hunting lodge in order to unlock it. Basically everything in this game needs a slight tweak of some sort. The devs have been communicative and I trust that they will straighten things out to make this game what it needs to be.For now, I can't recommend this game until they fix some of the major problems and add much-needed content.

There are a couple of problems i have with the game so far.1. In multiplayer the only the host can inteact with everything your friends or other players cant interact with lookouts, outposts, and undiscovered points on the map.2. Its some times feels like you go really slow out of no where kind of like if you were in slow-mo but only you this includes reloading, running, using lures etc.			"

												Beautiful game. Haven't been able to put it down yet. You can easily play this game for hours and not realize it. You have a lot to keep yourself occupied with. A lot of terrain to explore. Massive map. The only thing I can think of that would make this game better is fishing, tree stands, and that would be badass if you could somehow have hunting cameras.Some people are talking about glitches and bugs, but not sure what ones there are, because I have yet to come across one and I have put in enough time that I wopuld think I would have seen a few by now. Definitely worth the buy.			"

												After patch 1.5 I would recommend it. You get a LOT for 30€. Two Massive reserves with best representation of digital nature to date. It took almost 70 hours just to explore all points of interest, lodges, outposts etc. on both maps. While hunting in between of course. Enough different animals to keep you busy for a while. The game still has some minor problems and a few major ones for a couple of players. Devs are fixing bugs on a weekly basis. DLC's paid and free will come. A truly relaxing and beautiful game. Just opening a cold one while walking around and taking pictures takes the stress of the day off. P.S.You need a decent PC. Well done!			"

												fun game, certainy the most realistic hunting game i have ever played, and absolutely the most beautiful.pros:realisticbeautiful decent pricespend hours and hours playing the gamecons:does have glitches, like animals being stuck where you can walk rigth up to them, (nothing bad though not enough to make it unenjoyable, its a great game)spend hours and hours playing the gametakes forever to get skill and perk points, I highly recomend it if you hunt or are into hunting, expect to do lots of walking and stalking, don;t expect high action, game is designed to be a hunting game,			"

												I like it very much.For those who play theHunter, it lacks freelook, has a jump button and running and gunning will get you farther faster.  The AI pathfinding needs quite a bit of work and it can be a struggle going uphill at times.You can also jump off of the towers.  Needs jetpacks and raptors.			"

												This is so fat the best hunting game i have every played.please pardon my english, its not my first language. pros:Very good graphicVery good atmosphereGood vital organ hit display (The penetration difference between guns EXIST!)Good Terran grass displayFine bleeding systemFine Trail systemThe vital organs hitbox is not fine tuned, it works but there are room for improvementCons:Many minor bugs e.g. cannot place new waypoint unless manually remove previous waypointIdentify accessible and unaccessible slope is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥br>Sometimes the animal teleport in short intervalcannot change LOD settingssometimes the animals run in Z-shape when they are scared or were chaesd by the hunter, almost like they are trying to double backing to cover their trails (i have never hunted in real life so i hv no idea if animals do that)cannot set up your own hide in desirable place (only can purchase hiding spot in fixed locations)too few guns and bow selection (the few options they offer are good quality but too few...)indepth score system for games...no significance system for different size and weight games.no shooting range to understand your favourite rifle's trajectory.suggestion:fix those minor bugsmore animals more maps (don't care if it is paid dlc as long as it is content rich and good quality)more guns (please don't be paid dlc)NEW online mode: battle royaleNEW online mode: survivial mode with pvp optionsNEW offline mode: survival mode with hostile npc hunters...you have to shoot animals for food, attract hunters, kill other hunters for equipment and ammo and currency, trade with friendly outpost for equipment....etcA CABIN TO REVIEW YOUR TROPHIES!!

												As a Jeger (hunter) in RL, I find this game to be the best huntingsim I've seen so far. The scenery is rather beautiful, at times I do forget that it's just a game. But in my opinion this game is still in alpha, there are many issues that needs to be addressed. This game shows real promises, I hope they will follow through with what they have started. It is now up to the developers. If they are interested, they may contact me for a ""shoppinglist"".			"

												Solid game. Haven't ran into any of the bugs that have been reported in the other earlier reviews. I have no complaints about the UI. The realism is both hit and miss. I would like to see noise through short undergrowth and grass reduced with rain, rather than moving under the ambient noise of the rain. I would also like to see blood spots in tracking more accurately reflect the hit. For example, bubbles in lung shots or cartilage in front shoulder blade hits. Parabolic flight patterns would be nice too!Overall it's a fun game. If you're a hunter or just like hunting games it's the best thing going atm, imo.   "

I hope they fix the folowing things in the upcoming update:- Able to switch between single and multiplayer without restarting the game- Able to minimilize the game and open it again without crashing- Unlock outposts in multiplayer, cause a friend of mine unlocked a outpost which i cannot unlock, cause he did it before i       could in single player and now im not able to use it- Sometimes the tracks become invisable and u cannot track anymore untill u restart the game- The mechanics and accuracy for the bow and arrow- Animals being stuck and cannot move, which are easy money and exp right now :J- Some structure like lookout towers are glitched and cannot be buildBut like i said its just got released, but if they can fix the stuff above the game is absolutely great ^-^			"

												The open world and scenery is simply amazing. While you maye need a moderately powerful computer to play this game to get the ""full beauty"", you  can still be left awed by the many sights. Are there bugs? Well yes, all new games have bug's. If you have ever let that be the reason you got fed up with a game and give it a poor review, thats not a good reason in my opinion.  Pros; open world, relatively cheap, no licenses for animals, infinite starter ammo, hud is easy to follow, and more.Cons; tracking at first is confusing, menus seem chunky and slow/freeze, small graphic errors/lag.With more time things will get ironed out and improved upon, making the game smoother and even more enjoyabe.  Just remember this isn't thehunter classic and plays differently but shares some simular key features. Most importantly be patient and have fun!			"

												Highly immersive game with grand detail to the map! VERY VERY SLOW game play, and not exciting. Travel is probably the worst since the map is so big and have had absolutly no luck using the stands or blinds. I think adding in some utility vehicles to travel would help this game alot. It is a good game and recommend for some time just sitting and staring at the screen but for excitment maybe another game.			"

												March 6th 105 hours in...I have to say STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAMETHE BUGS ARE WORSE THAN EVER AFTER PATCHES.SO FRUSTRATING YOU WILL WISH YOU COULD SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FACE. But you can't because one of the bugs is you lose your weapons. You cannot unlock blinds and towers. I wasted 5 hours doing that only to log back on and have all green question marks on the map again. Tracks, blood trails and animals keep dissapearing even after a fresh start. Low fps,Glitchy inventory which you can access once in awhile. It will move your quick access items. Have had crashes, Sound looping, and multiplayer games where some people can't see animals. The devs are busy changing prices on items making them 3x original prices, cause I guess its important to tweak game play instead of fix broken game problems. There is no quit to menu button, Animal Ai is horrible. We play in multiplayer just hoping to find a herd of buffalo stuck in the rocks so we can waste them as the bury their heads in the dirt with their hind legs kicking in the air futely running to nowhere. ITS A FKN HUNTING SIM. You think that animal AI might be on the top of your priority list. Also you cannot get some animal callers even 105 hours into game. That's great. Lets have prey running around you cannot call in. You can just randomly hope to run into one and kill it. RIGHT because most of the people buying this are going to play 100 + hours to try and unlock everything. Hence them changing prices and level caps etc. THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THIS GAME IS. They boast about making it more arcade style so they can still support hunter classic. 100 hours into a game and still having stuff locked is not arcade stlye. You have no concept of what your own game is. The maps are so big and you have to run everywhere. No vehicles. You have to find the outposts before you can even jump to them. That would be fine if AUTO RUN didn't kill you half the time on your way there. I have tried to be patient with this game. BUT AS OF TODAY MY PATIENCE RAN OUT. There are MANY MORE problems with this game. Many of which existed from beta testing right through release. STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNFINISHED TURD!!!!10 hours in or so...updateOK This game just won me over!! Here's why I just had a great moose hunt. Learning only shoot one animal. you can track a vital hit animal for 15 minutes or more this game is not easy.  Then I had the best hunt ever. A black bear 100 yards out I shoot him. He's running I shoot him again at 200 yards he's still running I shoot him a 3rd time...all of this within 10 seconds. I go in to find the track. (oh don't forget to reload) I come in 300 yards I just get to where I last saw him...and out of the bush he charges BANG I shoot him again at 10 yards, gun recoils I'm shaking I cant see, he's still charging. I get my trusty ranger under control and down just in time to drop him with a 5th shot at 4.44 yards...I LOVE THIS GAMEI am now changing my review to recommend. If you love hunting this is a great adventure game.lets keep those updates and patches coming though ;)Editing as time goes on:After 6 hours or so I would like to update and add the following. I am a die hard hunting game follower having played every deer hunter back in the day, trophy hunts, cabela's and a host of others. In real life I am a hunter. (Harvested 3 whitetail this last fall).  This game is the best looking I have ever played. I have seen some cool things in this game. My first kill was a fox. I shot the fox he ran off. Narrator says he's not going far. And boy was he right. Out of the bush 2 black bears burst and grabbed my fox. I never saw it again...LOLThis is a good game. It has not crashed on me once in my 6 hours. The little bugs are just soooo annoying. I will change this review to positive when the bugs are ironed out.This game has POTENTIAL. As long as the dev is fixing and adding this will be a great game!Original reviewWell I have to agree with the negatives on this board. Too many bugs to play right now. We pay full price for this and its unplayable. Very annoying. Yes I see there are patches coming out and they are working on it. Why would you release this game with all of the same problems listed by beta testers. That's bad mojo on your part. I knew that coming into this and was so stoked to play the game I bought it anyway. Now I have faith that it will be fixed and sooner rather than later.bugs I found in my first couple of hours:Bought bow bought ammo. (3x) no ammo in inventory cannot use bow. FRUSTRATINGcannot zoom with controller setupcannot select menus with controller setupjoining multiplayer game issuesGame does not save sound menu changesInventory menu does not workHeadlamp will not turn offDeer caught on structuresdeer shot 4 times at close range would not die....just ran in circlesHunter stats are not correct. shows wrong number of shots and accuracy numbersLow FPS on high end machineOn the bright side:game looks and sounds greatlarge mapsdecent price for full gamesupport is coming (2 patches already)in conclusion you get points for support...but then I have to ask why did you release this game in such a poor state?

												My TheHunter: COTW Review. Graphics: The graphics are very pretty and really well done but it is sorta a wool cover over our eyes on whats hiddenly broken about this game. Hunting: You have to either get a rare one hit shot on the game your hunting and take it down in that one shot but most of the time you will find yourself shooting an elk or bear or boar more than enough to take it down doesn't matter if you shot it in the spine or leg it well still be able to run. Also you can't hunt small game such as rabbits or other small critters same goes for birds you can't hunt those either. Also it would be interesting if they add fishing that is a form of hunting.Shop-Locker: You spend hours gathering enough money for that one rifle you wanted for some reason it's more than 1k but you buy it anyways just to realise that you just spent $42,000 on a basic looking rifle no carved animals on it's stock no gold or silver enlays nothing just wood maybe some cheap camo bullet holder on the side nothing fancy isn't like you just spent aton of money. Then you notice for $680 you can get a signle pack of 10 rounds for your said rifle. ""Side Note"" irl you can get a deer hunting rifle as cheap as $350 and for $20 you can get some hunting rounds for a scope it can be very cheap like the rifle or less or it can rack your price up to 6 times the price of the rifle. Menu: Just a basic menu nothing fancy and once in the game there isn't a exit to the menu only to desktop. Now this well probably be fixed soon but doesn't change that they placed a game for $30 on the market without adding a main feature into the game it's self. So ill keep this in the review. UI: Nothing fancy just a somewhat see through tiny box that tell you your ammo count heart rate a basic campos that's about it even your smartphone gps looks basic the one from TheHunter looks more well done and better. Now of course in time there might be an update where they make the ui look way better but as of now it makes me think our hunters we are playing have a pair of google glasses on that's how bad it looks maybe have a more realistic looking map or have a campos that looks like something a hunter or hiking has. Maybe the ammo count is a pouch or something so it's more realistic looking either way it doesn't look that great. Realisim: Now i know it's a video game but it's trying to be like a realistic hunting sim. I feel like just playing it these devs didn't do any research they were doing far more research in making the 2 maps look as realistic as they could or pretty as they could. Instead of going on irl hunting trips or just watching videos on it. Something that can give them a taste on what it is like. Also there's something called google all they had to do was look up hunting sites on how much hunting clothing cost same goes for all these weapons and ammo. Then how it is now in the game where it almost feels like a pay to win but you can't pay with real money only in game. Weapons: Where is all the 22's and air rifles. That's what id want to see people hunt with those type of weapons in Euro and Germany same with the west. Gameplay: You well be able to spend lots of hours hunting unlocking new weapons exploring messing around in multiplayer. Finding all the relics or easter eggs. Climbing up high places taking pics of animals. Just enjoying the view it's a very nice game if you always wanted to hunt or you just like the outdoors but you are mostly in doors. Updates: There well be updates soon or later that well fix these issues just wait and in time everything well be fixed also there well probably DLC's.			"

												Brilliant effort by the dev. Waited all my life for a really good hunting sim. Its been awesome to play a really rewarding especially those dam coyotes. Almost zero bugs now with single player, few minor UX issues with the interface, buying ammo and more visual inticators on what you just bought. Mulitplayer is great but it does crash at least twice in a few hours everytime still after latest patch. 2 people cant go in the same deer stand either or one of you die from injuries. I dont ever remember killing my friends in real life when we are both up in a stand lol.			"

He has given every game a negative review except one game...out of the 50 + reviews He has given all have been neg.The game has nice graphics, and is easy to learn and for the price..I am having fun.  If you looking for something to enjoy..Buy this game.  Its not super easy..but is quick to learn.  I am sure they will be adding more content.  I have not crashed one time.    Would be fun to try with multiple people in the game.If you like to Hunt and enjoy long walks in the woods...go for it...Adding to this review:Been Playing for a few days now..Still enjoy the game.  They just did a patch and I think it has even added to the experience.  I do wish they would put an ingame clock someplace so you could tell what time it is in game...some missions have time elements and that would help.			"

												used to play this alot and when i did played the game find it little boring still do now, But i will say the graphic are simply great and better then when i 1st played the game on demo. So i know the graphic have change in game big time. and the feeling of finnly finding and shoting the animal that youve been stalking for the last 10 hours is just simply   boring thats prob why find the game boring. everytime kill  a animale from long distanes it disapers time you get there. STUPID !! But i will say i do keep playing trying change my mind on game. Also it is ashame that your limited in map and to go out in water and outside of map. But end of the day apart from the boring limited side and some times the things you kill disapers it the grathic i like think it has done well in that side of things. Has for the game it self yeah its ok but not worth 29.99 or more. The price need to be dropped BIGTIME.			"

												Let me get one thing clear straight away, I love this game! It hits all the right notes and I just hope so bad that the devs keep updating the game and adding new content. I played Classic but really didnt like how expensive everything was; as soon as I saw they were creating a one time payment game I couldnt wait.The graphics and the audio for the most part are fantastic, while I would like to increase the draw distance its not as bad as the TheHunter Classic. There are a few sound bugs every now and then, epecially when you are close to water and its raining, the audio starts clipping and looping. Also I dont know how AA works in the game but I would like to be able to change it as I can still see jagged edges everywhere when in 1080.Multiplayer is a lot of fun but this is where most of the work is needed; I have only played multiplayer for a few hours and there has been quite a few bugs. I have had a game where the other person couldnt hear or even see any of the animals that I could, another game where the other person couldnt get any of his items out even though they were in his inventory, and perhaps the worst thing for me with multiplayer is that only the host can unlock new camps, lookouts and anything else you can click on. Also we have to take it in turns to claim downed animals because only the person that harvests the animal gets a reward and there is no way to tell who hit it without clicking to harvest it. Apart from the above problems I really have had a great time playing this game, I love the feeling of tracking an animal through forests and fields only to finally get that shot you wanted and hope that the animal doesnt run off for miles while spilling blood everywhere. You get a great feel of acomplishment with this game and it can be very rewarding. The items are quite expensive and take a long time to get and levelling is very very slow which is a pain when your waiting for those new skills and perks you so desperately need.Things I would like to see added:1. More animals - a lot more, especially birds as currently you cant harvest any flying animals.2. More guns, scopes and other items like tents, portable hunting encloures, etc.3. Missions for multiplayer, not everyone wants to go against each other, coop missions would be nice.To me the game is still in early access but after some updates and new content I think this could be an amazing game. I know some of the new content will be DLC but I hope a good portion of it is free as the game does lack a bit of content at the moment especially in the flying department.If and when things change I will update my review as necessary.

												March 6th 105 hours in...I have to say STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAMETHE BUGS ARE WORSE THAN EVER AFTER PATCHES.SO FRUSTRATING YOU WILL WISH YOU COULD SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FACE. But you can't because one of the bugs is you lose your weapons. You cannot unlock blinds and towers. I wasted 5 hours doing that only to log back on and have all green question marks on the map again. Tracks, blood trails and animals keep dissapearing even after a fresh start. Low fps,Glitchy inventory which you can access once in awhile. It will move your quick access items. Have had crashes, Sound looping, and multiplayer games where some people can't see animals. The devs are busy changing prices on items making them 3x original prices, cause I guess its important to tweak game play instead of fix broken game problems. There is no quit to menu button, Animal Ai is horrible. We play in multiplayer just hoping to find a herd of buffalo stuck in the rocks so we can waste them as the bury their heads in the dirt with their hind legs kicking in the air futely running to nowhere. ITS A FKN HUNTING SIM. You think that animal AI might be on the top of your priority list. Also you cannot get some animal callers even 105 hours into game. That's great. Lets have prey running around you cannot call in. You can just randomly hope to run into one and kill it. RIGHT because most of the people buying this are going to play 100 + hours to try and unlock everything. Hence them changing prices and level caps etc. THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THIS GAME IS. They boast about making it more arcade style so they can still support hunter classic. 100 hours into a game and still having stuff locked is not arcade stlye. You have no concept of what your own game is. The maps are so big and you have to run everywhere. No vehicles. You have to find the outposts before you can even jump to them. That would be fine if AUTO RUN didn't kill you half the time on your way there. I have tried to be patient with this game. BUT AS OF TODAY MY PATIENCE RAN OUT. There are MANY MORE problems with this game. Many of which existed from beta testing right through release. STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNFINISHED TURD!!!!10 hours in or so...updateOK This game just won me over!! Here's why I just had a great moose hunt. Learning only shoot one animal. you can track a vital hit animal for 15 minutes or more this game is not easy.  Then I had the best hunt ever. A black bear 100 yards out I shoot him. He's running I shoot him again at 200 yards he's still running I shoot him a 3rd time...all of this within 10 seconds. I go in to find the track. (oh don't forget to reload) I come in 300 yards I just get to where I last saw him...and out of the bush he charges BANG I shoot him again at 10 yards, gun recoils I'm shaking I cant see, he's still charging. I get my trusty ranger under control and down just in time to drop him with a 5th shot at 4.44 yards...I LOVE THIS GAMEI am now changing my review to recommend. If you love hunting this is a great adventure game.lets keep those updates and patches coming though ;)Editing as time goes on:After 6 hours or so I would like to update and add the following. I am a die hard hunting game follower having played every deer hunter back in the day, trophy hunts, cabela's and a host of others. In real life I am a hunter. (Harvested 3 whitetail this last fall).  This game is the best looking I have ever played. I have seen some cool things in this game. My first kill was a fox. I shot the fox he ran off. Narrator says he's not going far. And boy was he right. Out of the bush 2 black bears burst and grabbed my fox. I never saw it again...LOLThis is a good game. It has not crashed on me once in my 6 hours. The little bugs are just soooo annoying. I will change this review to positive when the bugs are ironed out.This game has POTENTIAL. As long as the dev is fixing and adding this will be a great game!Original reviewWell I have to agree with the negatives on this board. Too many bugs to play right now. We pay full price for this and its unplayable. Very annoying. Yes I see there are patches coming out and they are working on it. Why would you release this game with all of the same problems listed by beta testers. That's bad mojo on your part. I knew that coming into this and was so stoked to play the game I bought it anyway. Now I have faith that it will be fixed and sooner rather than later.bugs I found in my first couple of hours:Bought bow bought ammo. (3x) no ammo in inventory cannot use bow. FRUSTRATINGcannot zoom with controller setupcannot select menus with controller setupjoining multiplayer game issuesGame does not save sound menu changesInventory menu does not workHeadlamp will not turn offDeer caught on structuresdeer shot 4 times at close range would not die....just ran in circlesHunter stats are not correct. shows wrong number of shots and accuracy numbersLow FPS on high end machineOn the bright side:game looks and sounds greatlarge mapsdecent price for full gamesupport is coming (2 patches already)in conclusion you get points for support...but then I have to ask why did you release this game in such a poor state?

												The first thing I would like to say is this game is absolutly BEAUTIFUL! I bought this game for my Grandfather, so we could play together, because he is a fan of thehunter series. We have over 200 hours in ""TheHunter Primal"" so we decided to get it and try it out.This game has HOURS of fun. We stayed up till about 4 in the morning playing this game over night.

												Brilliant effort by the dev. Waited all my life for a really good hunting sim. Its been awesome to play a really rewarding especially those dam coyotes. Almost zero bugs now with single player, few minor UX issues with the interface, buying ammo and more visual inticators on what you just bought. Mulitplayer is great but it does crash at least twice in a few hours everytime still after latest patch. 2 people cant go in the same deer stand either or one of you die from injuries. I dont ever remember killing my friends in real life when we are both up in a stand lol.			"

												The Hunter Call of the Wild is essentially a first-person shooter. Unlike most shooters, though, you don't get shot. You shoot or try tho shoot game like deer, foxes, and bison. You hunt this game in a forest in Europe. This forest is very beautiful with lush vegetation and has weather effects like wind, rain, and fog. The terrain is varied being fairly flat in some places and mountainous in other places. The forest is huge and can take a long time to traverse. Fortunately there are outposts scattered about the forest. Once discovered, you can fast travel to other outposts in other areas of the map.On the downside, the game requires a lot of patience. You can play for an hour or more without seeing any game. When you do see game, it is very skittish and will run off even when you are far away from it. If you do shoot an animal it may run off leaving you empty handed. A bug in the game sometimes causes the animals to run in place. You can shoot them point blank without killing them.Is The Hunter for you? If you like something that can simulate hunting, then it might be a good choice. It does lend a feeling that you are actually stalking animals in the woods. When you do get a kill, it can be a satisfying experience. The map can be fun just to explore. For those of you who want much to do much of the time, this game probably won't please you.Is The Hunter for me? I've found that it does get better the more I play. It is a bit different from most of the shooters I play, and I've been looking for something different. I'm also pleased with the graphics. I'd say The Hunter is fair, and that's why I rate it three stars.You may wish to consider Far Cry 3, Far Cry 4, and Far Cry Primal. Theses games allow you to hunt game along with battling enemies. Unlike The Hunter, these games are much faster paced and animals much less difficult to hunt.			"

												I've played 10 hours so far, and can say that this game is absolutely amazing.  The graphics are amazing and the all around atmosphere of the game is fantastic.  So far I have run into a couple of bugs, one being that animals will get stuck on trees and keep running into them, so it's basically a free kill.  Other bugs i have found are that the .223 rounds in the store are backwards, being that the soft point and polymer tips got mixed around, and finally if you are using binoculars and you press Esc and go back to the game, the binocular's outline will still be on your screen until you look through them again.  But other than these little bugs, this game is still fantasic.			"

												Positive-The World is awesome, it looks really nice, the trees, the light, the climatology...-The map is gigantic, with variety of landscapes and geographical accidents.-Arms recreation it's so good too.-Simulation oriented.-Missions; some are really difficult and require a lot of time and luck, it can be like a kind of challenge.Negative-Lots of constant bugs. Animals dancing in circles, rotating in the air or stuck in trees or rocks. The Whole pack of buffalo weirdly trapped in a hillside doing strange movements and noises, you can kill them one by one and them don't run away. Sometimes you'll die in the middle of the forest for no reason. Strange view rotations. Bugs are constant. Everytime you play you'll see something weird.-Animals lack of AI oftenEither way i'm not fully dissapointed with the game, i think that deserves patience. If the team are working on the rigth fixes this could be a very good game. But now, for me, it's the seed of a good game that should be on development or testing till it grows. "

(I almost felt bad for the poor things)-Had 4 game crashes in 2 hours. (Most likely it will crash when you're about to get the shot you waited for so long)-On 3 occasions, I headshot a deer from a 50ft distance. The deer runs (it was probably frightened by the bullet going through its head).Refunded, too many crashes and bugs. Great potential though.			"

												First i just want to say Its not my intension to bash or ""♥♥♥♥♥♥talk"" this game!   I have a love/hate relationship to this game atm.  I had a good few hours in the online game before this came out and loved it.  This game on the other hand I'm still not to sure about.   I have played this game for 20 + hours the last few days and have made a little list of pros and cons.  There will be more cons then pros atm but that does not mean i dont like the game, i just feel like its not at its full potential.   CONS!  1: In the settings u can choose between toggle aim or to hold the aim with right mouse and this works for a few ""aims"" and its just reset to default again.  2: The waypoint system is either bugged or its the weirdest waypoint system i have ever seen in a game! When you place a waypoint on the map it shows how long it is to the place you want to go , but it also shows up in the opposite direction of where you want to go and its just confusing.  3: Animals get stuck in trees and bushes.  4: Animal trails disappear  5: When you og prone you can see under the map at some locations and that can make you shoot the map instead of the animal you are hunting.  6: Missions with taking pictures of the animals is so bugged and it took me 1-2 hours to  finish the mission! And i took more then 50 pictures of the deer! The mission where u have to take pictures of the 2 or more bears is impossible ""At least for me"" honestly i dont think the picture missions should be in the game... 7:  And then the most annoying bug for me at the moment is a shotgun bug! I used the shotgun to takedown a deer at close range and now when i shoot at any animal with any gun it says i used the shotgun, and that means i cant do some missions since the game thinks i used the shotgun at a mission where I'm only allowed to shoot with a rifle! 8: The maps is large! Very large! And that means a lot of walking around... It takes forever to get to the destination you need to be! This can be fixed with cars,atv,bikes, horses or any vehicle. It would help a lot!  9:Places to rest/sleep/fast travel to is just to far apart if u could buy a tent to take with u so u can sleep outside without having to fast travel to a camp it would make it way better.  PROS!  1: The game graphics is beautiful and feels well done! 2: The way you track animals is brilliant! The fact that u have to turn on your light at night to see the tracks just makes it even better. 3: Leveling system feels good and its interesting. U can choose from a large amount of skills and perks 4: Never had a crash or big fps drop "" You do need a ok pc to run at ultra "" 5: Missions is fun and a good way to make some cash to buy new guns and tools. 6: There is a good choice in weapons and tools to buy in the game. It can feel like a grind to get the cash to buy them at times but that just mean that you have to hunt more 7: This can be an awesome hunting game or u can just go on a killing spree if u want it up to you.  If u play the way i think its meant to be played it feels like a brilliant hunting game!  This game does not feel like its finished, not even close! BUT it is still an amazing game if u give it a chance. Its buggy at times, and i have to be honest i hate this game at times... But i know it has a lot of potential if the devs can fix some of the worst bugs and maybe add a few things to it. I'm gonna continue to play it and hope the game gets better.			"

												This is the best game about hunting, since it best conveys the atmosphere of the forest which is the most important.The game lacks only transport for example - a mountain bike and even more diverse types of weapons, maps, animals, birds for prey and ideally add fishing.Optimization for such graphics is the best, - 15 FPS maximum deviation from the norm.

												Still crashes after 2 patches on a GTX 1080, 1440p G-Sync monitor.This could be a really good game but there's one issue which ruins it for mouse+keyboard users, the lack of being able to move slowly. If you want to move slowly without creating max noise then you'll need a joypad, even then it's not great as there's such a fine line between faster speed and no speed, you can adjust some joypad settings but no setting to actually adjust sensitivity for walking. It also feels dumbed down, sure you can make things harder by removing glow for the tracks but it still feels dumbed down, seems to be over populated with animals, there's also a stupid feature called ""warning"", basically the creature will hear you and make it's voice sound. Why on earth have such a stupid feature, it's like the developers have said ok how can we make the player find the various creatures easily, stupid. I mean a creature isn't going to shout out a warning if you're getting close because you made too much noise, stupid and dumbed down.The game looks really nice, much better than the 1st game and runs great at Ultra setting but does crash some sessions.You basically level up through xp, buy things, do missions. As for competitions, if you're expecting them to be like hunter classic, forget it. It's poorly implimented, noone bothers with them, they're not global.Multiplayer is pointless without well run competitions, noone bothers with them.If you've never played classic thehunter then you might like it, but for those that played the ortginal you'll be let down somewhat despite the great graphics.I'll continue to play it and hope they improve things soon but can't really reccomend it as a successor to TheHunter because it falls short in many ways.

												I have played the game for 3 hrs. This is from my point of view, the game appeals to people who are into the hunting style game. Their are a few glitches that noticable, but not bad. The game is new so that is to be expected. The game makes you work to upgrade, but they are free you don't have to pay real money. The game is ment to be slowpaced, the sound levels are ment to be higher as real life simulation to scare deer.			"

												For those of you who really enjoy hunting in games like myself, this is a very good attempt at what it would be like to go out and hunt in the wild. Sure it's riddled with bugs (i've only experienced a few) But the feel, the sounds, the excitement of bagging your first buck is a feeling i haven't felt in a long time. I love hunting in games, it's one of my favorite things to do and this captures it almost perfectly. Though keep in mind, hunting is a very slow and methodical sport. You should deticate some time and effort to it, you can't just run everywhere and shoot deer in the head all the time. I mean you can, but thats not the point of the game and you wont get a whole lot of points for it.  Also while hunting doe isn't advised in real life, i would actually encourage it as they're much more common and you still get xp and cash towards new gear that is much needed. Those worried about licenses, i remember Primal needing you to buy licenses to hunt anything outside of whitetail but in my experience i can hunt whatever is out there with no consequence. It's a must-have for hunting fans.			"

												This might be the most beautiful game I have played so far on my PC. The environments are drop dead gorgeous. There are a few kinks to work out and I would like to see a larger range of weapons included but overall this is one of the best experiences I have had as a PC gamer who also loves the outdoors. It's as close to real as a game can get, still way simpler of course, but they do a decent job of simulating it. The world itself is HUGE and it takes forever to walk somewhere, luckily they have made the wildlife pretty abundant so usually you don't have to go more than a few hundred meters to start tracking down something. Night hunting adds a whole new level of challenge and I reccomend giving it a shot, even though in my part of the world it's completely illegal and extremely frowned upon.			"

												Great game, needs work but im looking forward to the future and the upcoming updates.Edit- After playing the game for longer periods, im starting to get frustrated with all the bugs, and after the announcement of the console port tells me that they are not focused on fixing the current issues.. rather they are focused on raking in some more money. At this time i am changing my review to a wouldnt recommend at this time atleast until more fixes become apparent and more content is available as this game is marked as a full release.			"

												Its a cool game, but its crashing all the time. It has only lasted once over 5 minutes in about 10 startups. It did last until I stopped playing in that once instance, but other then that its almost unplayable. I would love to play it, but honestly; if this keeps up I want a refund.			"

												This game is very fun and has many positive elements.  I would highly recommend the game provided you understand before purchase you are going to be waiting for bug fixes.  The core game of sneaking up on or ambushing prey in the wild is very solid.  The game has many, many bugs.  The firearms, beyond the starting rifle, seem like they need some improvements.  The bullets seem to matter more than the firearms.  It seems to me that penatration is king and so a 357 magnum with the pen bullets is much better than the more expensive 44 magnum with the soft bullets.  This may be by design but it makes progression feel a little wierd when you buy new guns and have to wait to use them till you unlock better bullets.  The most annoying thing for me is the rain.  I very much hope they either tune down how often it rains or add a volume slider for just the rain sound effect.  Rain is so loud you cant hear anything else if your on discord or listening to music, etc.  You could turn down the main volume but then you cant hear prey walking around close to you.  Multiplayer needs alot of work.  You can lock yourself out of being able to use outpost, even in single palyer, for fast travel if you click on flag poles in a multiplayer sessions and you did not have them unlocked in single player already.  This game is very fun but could be a AAA if they can get the bugs squashed and add a few improvements and some more content.  The dev team has something really special in this games overall design and execution and i'm really looking forward to seeing the game get better over time.  The game is a recommend at it's current price.			"

												habe das game jetzt ca. 4 stunden gespielt. nur im Multiplayer mit Freunden... leider musste ich feststellen das der Multiplayer nur für den Host ""attraktiv"" ist. Denn es ist nur dem Host möglich, die einzelnen Map-Punkte (u.a. ""Aussenposten"" ""interessante Orte"" und ""Aussichtspunkte"") zu erkunden. Die anderen Mitspieler können lediglich Jagen und dafür Punkte bekommen. Apro pos Punkte: Diese werden auch nur dann verteilt wenn man auf ein Tier geschossen hat, wenn dem nicht so ist, bekommt man rein gar nichts....Fazit:-) Multiplayer sollte ausgereift werden - alle Mitspieler sollten Waypoint aktivieren können.-) Gemeinsames Jagen sollte verbessert werden - Belohnungen beim Jagen sollten alle erhaltne, nicht nur wenn man draufgeschossen hat.-) Falldamage anpassen, da nicht realistisch. Man kann von einem Aussichtspunkt hinunter springen und man erleidet einen sehr geringen Schaden! Beim Springen auf eine Holzbank ist man tot. usw.-) Zielfernrohr ist manchmal verbuggt - das zoomen bei der Waffe funktioniert nicht korrekt, man sieht durch das Zielfernrorh und sieht dabei seine Hände und das Rohr ist extrem klein!-) Menü funktioniert nicht korrekt: Eine Auswahl ist manchmal nicht möglich, man muss 2-3 mal klicken.-) Muitionskauf: Man kann diese zwar kaufen, aber man sieht nicht wieviel Munition man gekauft hat. Nur wenn man aus dem Menü raus geht und die Waffe auswählt. Im ""Lager"" wird die Munition ebenfalls irgendwann angezeigt...-) Kein Zurück zum Haupt-Menü: Man muss andauernd das Spiel beenden und neustarten.-) usw. - ich hoffe die Entwickler sehen diesen Beitrag und werden diese Bugs ausbessern.... leider ist es mir nicht mehr möglich das Spiel zurückzugeben, sonst würde ich das auch machen!Für mich ist es eine Alpha-Versiojn und überhaupt nicht ausgereift! - Unbedingt Updates notwendig! - Keine Kaufempfehlung!

												The slow pace of hunting, the minimalistic UI, the sounds, and gorgeous graphics makes theHunter an impressively immersive experience that manages to be pretty relaxing and thrilling at the same time. The gameplay is in my short experience pretty simplistic, which is probably a necessity given that it's a pretty unique game. You find a trace, you follow it, you shoot the animal, everybody happy. It certainly has depth though, and the world feels very alive, despite pretty much just being you, the land, and the animals. I would attribute this to the AI of the animals combined with the mechanics of the world more than anything, as they'll pretty realistically react to noises, sightings, et cetera.My main gripes with the game seem to be things that will hopefully be improved upon in later patches. Namely, the tutorial is more or less just text boxes popping up every once in a while. Even though learning through playing might work, there's a good few mechanics that just aren't explained all that well and given how this isn't a common/mainstream type of game, a proper tutorial would really make it easier to get into the game.Secondly there's a slight lack of polish in some areas. Menus are a bit clunky and there are some smaller graphical bugs. The positional audio could use some work too, it would be an amazing asset to the immersion but there's just something off about it in terms of volume levels and direction.			"

Not sure if it has seen a recent update since i played it a bit, but the game fails to launch every time now and just instantly crashes.			"

												If Bob Ross was a FPS, he'd be CotW. It's slow. Really really slow. And that's fine. Because of the little fluffy clouds and the wind through the grass and the dancing leaves. And that's what this game is about 99% of the time played. That 1% left is about actually shooting something. Yes, there are bugs. Yes, the balance is not really well done. No, it doesn't matter of you're here to. just. slow. down.			"

												So I'm just about 10 Hours into the game, so first impressions I think are in order. A little background, for the longest time I wanted to get ""the Hunter: Classic"", but I wasn't interested in shelling out the cash that the reviews mentioned. So then this came along and I jumped on it. I had finally gotten the ""the Hunter"" experience I was hoping for; unfortunately, it also came with those things I've learned to expect from this industry. Those things you hate, you know, those dirty little bugs.  Anyways, while I applaud the devs for abandoning their previous pay-to-win business model and not succumbing to the ""early access"" model (that plagues the industry); they certainly shouldn't have released the game without some sort of heads up that it was in fact very much in early access stages. So with all that said I'm going to try and point out what I've noticed the devs did right and what they did wrong(In hopes they'll read this and patch this beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game). Pros:- The game is ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous.- The sound is pretty damn impressive, mainly the ambient noises(wind, leaves, rain, etc) and atmosphere they create.- Love the weapon handling. It can be a ♥♥♥♥♥, but it seems fairly accurate to RL gun handling.- Pretty fair price for content. The maps are massive, and you'll find yourself constantly being distracted while exploring them. - Good :/ AI. It's nice to see a studio that can manage at least getting the AI in a sandbox environment like this without it completely bugging out **cough** DayZ **cough**. When you are stalking animals you just can't go gallivanting through the woods and expect to ever find anything. I think last I checked around 6 hours in, I had scared some 600 animals away from noise alone cause I was just out running around trying to find the nearest cabins. You have to be all predator like and pop up being like BOOOOOOM HEADSHOT. No you should shoot them in the heart... it's more ""humane"" < better trophy. Cons: - Let me start with the most outrageous one of all. NO 'Back to Menu' button, that's right! HOW in the hell did you guys miss that one in said ""Beta"", the♥♥♥♥ how did you guys not catch that in Alpha. You mean to tell me, when I get into: a buggy game, a slow server/ host connection game, get stuck in the water, or want to switch from multiplayer to single player.... I have to exit and restart the entire game?!?!? Save us someone! We are going 1 step forward 10 steps back here. - Multiplayer in general seems to be a buggy mess. Bad D-Sync, characters stuck in walk, spawning in with no ammo, spawning in and immediately dying, awful hit registration, you name it they got it there it would appear. I have had a very minimal amount of bugs in single player. - In single player I've had interaction bugs, where I literally can't click on anything. I'll give you an example of how unbelivably frustraiting this one is. So I walked ALL the way to one of the northern most cabins to only find out once I had gotten there that I couldn't click on anything. I had to restart my game( ^ since I couldn't close to menu and spawn back in), and when I spawned back I was all the way at the southern most cabin. I would have to walk all the way back to that cabin to gain fast travel access since I couldn't claim the spot before the bug appeared. - Hit registration in single player seems to be an issue as well. I had shots that I just know I didn't miss, shots that were point blank, and I would hit nothing but air. No blood, not even a flesh wound.  "

												This review is for people on the fence about this game like I was. This has to be the most beautiful game I have played too date I mean when it's graphics are cranked up its photo realistic. The gameplay it's self is solid with easy to learn controls and a fairly large amount of things to collect and do. The animal AI is either super realistic or on occasions a deer in front of headlights but overall great AI. I see a lot of people complaining about bugs which I have encountered maybe two neither of which are game breaking and can easily be fixed by the devs.So would I recommend this game to the average gamer? Definitely, it's emersuve in the best way and you can spend hours just walking around the environment. And when you finally get the kill on an animal you've been tracking for the last 20 mins it's so rewarding. WARNING! This game is hard to run so make sure to do some research before you buy it to make sure you can run it. My system specs Rx 480 16gb ram AMD 8320 Windows 10			"

												Should be an early access game. Lots of unfinished descriptions on weapons. Unbalanced stats on tools and weapons. Broken hitboxes and bullet clipping (Shot a deer point blank in the heart, said I got his spine). Missing ""Return to main menu"" button (Lol?). Optimization needs some tuning. Ai needs some touch ups. But after all that, the game looks pretty in ultra, it has great potential, no micro-transactions, my entire map has become purple, get destroyed by three bears at once and can become robbin hood with my trusty bow. I suggest faster ways of getting around such as an atv or pick-up. Im sure devs are already on that. But overall I see great potential in this game.			"

												This game has met all my expectations and a little more even, yea it has bugs but the devs are working on fixes around the clock. first ill start off with the pros.PROS- Sound quality is extremly detailed and some of the best ive heard in any outdoor/hunting game (sounds just like real life imo)- The graphics are really good compared to classic- The environments and animals are incredibly detailed and super realistic- Animations look as life like as if you were actually watching a real deer- AI is decent although it could be better (for example the animals call way to often and ocasionally walk into trees and get stuck)- The missions are fun and keep you wanting to play more of them- The reserves are absolutely massive and it would definitly take a long time to have explored every inch of hunting area- One time purchase with no micro transactions whatsoever (A big improvement over TheHunter classic)- Leveling seems balanced although if you dont play some of the missions it will take significantly longer to progress- the animals act in the ways they would in real life (for example the elk are found commonly in herds of 15+ and stick together when traveling, the animals react to getting shot very realisticly too)CONS-The frame rate is a little low compared to what my pc should be getting ( i have a gtx 970, 3.5ghz 8 core processor, 16gb ram, 750 watt power supply and i get 50-80 fps on high)- It takes way too long to unlock new guns/equipment ( ive played 16 hours since release and ive only unlocked 1 new rifle after 80+ kills)-Their isnt as much veriety in antler variation as i would like (compared to classic atleast)- Its too easy to find large trophys, it should be more difficult to find the bigger trophys and smaller ones should be more common but instead its the other way around in this game- There are quite a bit of bugs as of now but they are putting out patches every day so its not a huge problemOver all i really have enjoyed the game and i would definitly recommend it to anyone who likes hunting or just wants a beautiful looking game to play. Sure its not perfect but its definitly worth the 29.99 and the devs are working hard on improving the game and are actually listening to the feedback they are getting. Cant wait to see what the future hold for this game!!!			"

												10/10 would walk 500 miles through a forest shooting wildly at deer and such again.  But for real this is one of prettiest games I’ve ever played, amazing environment and probably the closest you’ll get to actually stalking animals through the wild...But a dirt bike, 4x4 or more quick travel spots would be a great addition to this game, takes so long to get anywhere and also the lack of human AIs makes for a strange experience after a while. Feels like hunting in a radiation exclusion zone.The menu system is also clunky and buggy but usable.Looking forward and hoping for DLC. (dinosaurs, mega fauna or) it would be a shame to see such a great looking game not taken further, hint hint.   "

												Hello everyone! I really hope this review can help you wether buy the game or not, so lets get into it.theHunter: Call of the Wild has the potential to become the best and bigger hunting game in the market so far...I've been playing it for a while and I'm not dissapointed for the price.HOWEVER, there are still many small and medium bugs that need to be fixed in order to give the customer a proper game experience.How is that? I will explain it now.Some little bugs like sound glitches such as choppy rain effect when you are anywhere near a lake or river (10 meters or so) or the scope dissapearing for half a second when you shoot (only 2 out of 10 shots)The bugs that I'm more worried about is that the game GUI is completely unfriendly. I mean, I cannot change the mouse sensitivity since the mouse/keyboard does NOT have an ""Apply"" button, and when it comes to the loadout it's a little bit confusing or even sometimes the mouse click does not work anymore, so you have to close the thing and re-open it.Sometimes the animals will get stuck and will be an easy prey for you, or even dissapear (2 out of the 30 deers I've hunted so far had completely dissapeared, meaning that the tracks are entirely gone after a few miles of tracking, and it is kind of annoying)You will also have to invest many hours playing it, so if you are a busy person I recommend playing something less time demanding, since the game itself it is ment to be played slowly, no runnin n' gunnin' here mates.Now it has plenty of good things aswell...the atmosphere of the game its outstanding, the graphic its astounding, the lightning its well made, and the places are huges and not repetitive. You've got a story mode that kind of reminds me to ""Firewatch"", the voice acting it's really good, and if you are looking for a game to relax, give it a shot, it has been worth my time.Overall the game its pretty playable, and me being some kind of ""lone ranger"", I've enjoyed my time with it...I will come back later to make an update and answer questions of the people who are intending to buy it.Many thanks for reading and don't be afraid to ask.Peace!

												TLDR:The game is playable and enjoyable but riddled with bugs so much so you might mistake this game for an early access rather than an actual game release. The gameplay itself is simple but even then the AI of the animals is lacking in so many ways with pathfinding issues. I'd say that in my 300 ""harvests"" of animals that around 1/3 of those were from ""bugged animals"" which were either standing still, running in place or stuck on the terrain. I didnt buy a hunting game only to be shooting fish in a barrel.Running the game on Max settings GTX 1080 i7-6500 3.4Ghz 16gig RAM rig runs the game perfectly, suffer from random audio crashes that have yet to be fixed despite many people suffering from it.Single player missions are a joke, often asking you to take a picture of a deer but the quest itself is bugged and no amount of pictures or the distance you are to the deer will make a difference. With the latest patch the developers essentially ripped away whatever progression system the game has, the idea is that you hunt animals and gain EXP, weapon experience and money. The developers have made it possible to essentially have end game gear within hours of playing by drastically reducing the amouint of experience needed to unlock these weapons (seriously i'd say they reduced the amount needed by about 80%). So now i have the end game weapons and can kill animals easily from an enormous distance so now what? I could go ahead and try and hunt the biggest trophies in the game for the bragging rights on the global leaderboards like in theHunter classic? WRONG. There is a leaderboards amongst your friend list but thats it and even then it isnt even working right now and doesnt update itself often.The game is nothing like a hunting game, if you think you are going to be sneaking up on groups of animals, picking out the biggest trophy and taking it down then think again! The game as it is punishes players who just hunt for trophies as far as progression is concerned. It's actually more beneficial for to kill every animal you see no matter what size or gender than going for a trophy, the difference in rewards between a trophy and a crappy female deer is tiny, maybe a third less money and EXP, the game doesnt even punish you for killing an animal with the wrong weapon nor does it punish you for failing to track a wounded animal down and finishing it off. so it gets to a point where you just shoot an animal and if you find that its barely wounded your better off just leaving it and finding some other animal to shoot at.If the developers want this game to last longer than a few months then they really need to make some major changes to this game, which is a shame because it could be a very good game once they fixed all the bugs and actually made it feel like you were hunting rather than playing some arcade shoot em up with deers instead of zombies.WIll change this review once game becomes more playable but if anyone is reading this right now please save your money for now, watch this game and keep an eye on its updates and maybe even catch it in a steam sale a few months down the line.

												It's close. It's a game that they poured their souls into and built beautifully, but the publisher pushed the game out about a month or two early. There are some annoying bugs and the game needs more polish before I'll be happy with my purchase, but this game is incrediably fun, immersive and beautiful.			"

												Game looks Great and Ive had a lot of fun so far. I like the progession where you get skill points and money to buy gear.Hate the hunter classic pay model and this is way better. They do need a rack/trophy system as it is now the racks seem to be all the same without any difference between animals or each side. Seems to me people arent giving it a chance.. low game time and then bad review. Try playing it for a while. It is not the same as the hunter classic but then again the hunter classic progressed over years so to expect this game to be the same is just not right. The new engine is WAY better then classic. You can spot animals further out and tracking is good. I like how the grass lays down where you and the animals walk and the wind and weather is cool. If you played the classic and liked spotting animals in the wide open grass field because the engine couldnt hadle it and then walk up and kill everything without a challenge then go pay to play classic. I find this one so much more realistic. harder to spot animals and they spook at a further range making you actually stalk and come up with  a plan. You have to look at your surroundings and realize the area your in may not be a good spot due to limited view or bushes. not everywhere is a good spot like classic. JMO If you have a decent computer then its good. Ive had a couple of crashes on start up but never in game.			"

												This is a game in which changing from one map to another in singleplayer requires you to delete -ALL- character skills, leveling, bought items, discoveries.

Keep in mind that this is a game that features fairly complex stealth systems, somewhat complex animal AI, and so on, yet needs months worth of patches to get an ""Exit to menu"" button, which still hasn't been implemented, -in which debug menus show up for a split second when clicking on at least one of the buttons in the main menu, -in which animal call markers sometimes appear and sometimes not for no apparent reason, -in which there are no search filters, password protection or direct connecting in the server browser, -in which most menus are a pain to navigate due to poor design choices, -in which one ammunition stack always weighs the same regardless of its size, -in which there are red dot sights for shotguns mentioned in one of the skill menus despite the fact that there are no available red dot sights for shotguns and other discrepancies in the information provided to the player, -in which you can't buy more than 1 unit of ammunition at a time, -in which you can buy a seemingly infinite supply of the one ammo type that's free,-in which you can't interact with any of the unlockable hunting towers or land marks in a game you didn't host,-in which there at least weren't any animations for simultaneously walking and using animal calls the last time I checkedand yeah, I just discovered that unlike its predecessor your character info isn't tied into your account or anything, but into the singleplayer match you need to start the first time playing. And since there are two areas to choose from, you'd better host a multiplayer match if you want to play the other map because you otherwise need to wipe your only save slot, because why not? Keep in mind that it probably takes weeks or months of playing in order to unlock the later skills, perks, and equipment, so why does the save system work in such an awful way?Somehow, this is a recurring problem with Expansive World's games. There's always some insanely basic stuff that doesn't work or works in some astonishingly awkward ways that defies long-established conventions for no reason whatsoever. Having fun with this is task which currently demands a very high level of patience and tolerance for severely lacking functionality and polish, and I really, really don't understand how this trend can continue to persist within the games of a developer I'd think was experienced enough to make a keybinding menu that wouldn't completely break the control scheme if tampered with. This was fixed in an earlier patch, but yes, it was something that happened too.

I will write down some pros and cons.Pros:+Freaking beutiful graphics+Nicely done sounds+Weapon, perk and skills upgrade system (in my opinion balance is very good)+Amount of availabe weapons+Animals behavior (not running away from you straight line)+NO DLC+/- Tracking system (Has some issues, like direction showing difrent direction than actual footprints some times)Cons:-Game crashes sometimes-Animals still get stuck in trees sometimes-Blood tracks say for example medium losing blood rate and in map you can see your tracked animal, it always say low losing blood rate.-Not so much huntable animals (something like 8-10 difrent animals) It might maybe be cool if you would be able to shoot and harvest birds too.

												This game is something that I picked up as somewhat of an impulse buy, and for myself it is absolutely worth the money. Absolutely gorgeous visuals, provided you have the hardware to run it, and very nice audio work. I have had a lot of fun playing both on my own and multiplayer with friends. However, the game absolutely does have its issues, which honestly it shouldn't have been released with. Pros:-It is one of the more accurate hunting simulators out right now-Absolutely stunning scenery, water, animal animations, and lighting effects-The weapons are very satisfying, from the handling (which changes with different scopes, so a larger scope makes the weapon seem heavier) down to the meaty ""thunk"" of an arrow hitting its mark. All in all it does a much better job with the weapons than most FPSes do. -Very satisfying payoffs to effort put in. Making a difficult shot, finding a big bull elk after a long stalk, it's all fantastic.-Quick load times, for both single and multiplayer. The longest load times are generally when switching between reserves.-Very large maps with nice differences in terrain.Cons:-It is a slow paced game. Running generates a lot of noise and that scares the animals right off. -Depending on the map and location, you may go a long time without seeing an animal at all. Hirschfelden, in particular, seems almost desolate compared to the dense population of animals on Layton Lakes.-Unrealistic ballistics. If I shoot a deer in the shoulder within 20 meters, I don't care if it hit the shoulder blade first, I guarentee it would go through to the lung. Having a bullet stop short and ending up with a ""Flesh Wound, bleed rate Very Low"" is infuriating, especially when it seemed like an alright shot.-Bugs, so many bugs. So many, in fact, that I am going to detail them later, to avoid cluttering the cons list.-Not a whole lot of content, really. There are six trophy species on each reserve, and that's it. A LOT of content in theHunter Classic is not present in CotW.-Not well optimized. Even on more powerful rigs, if you're trying to play with settings maxed you're likely going to suffer some frame losses. Trying to play on a lower-end rig is not recommended. Some more detail on bugs that are present as of this review, as well as some older ones that seem to be fixed as I personally no longer experience them.-Frequent, inconsistent crashing. I sometimes go hours at a time without any issue, but the very next time I load up the game it crashes every five minutes. Very frustrating.-Animals in general are quite buggy on occasion, getting stuck on scenery, running in circles, standing completely still even when you approach, not being able to harvest an animal that is right in front of you, and likely some more issues I can't remember right now. -Walking uphill is incredibly frustrating, as it seems like your character is unable to pick up their feet more than six inches. It is also absurdly easy to slide down a slope on accident.-When fast-travelling to a location in multiplayer, if another player was standing in that location it would cause both players to die from, what seems to be, fall damage.-If an animal is harvested while photo mode is active, the cursor will not be visible and it is very hard to 'confirm' the kill to get back to hunting. -Sometimes tracks disappear into the abyss, which is incredibly frustrating when you've been on a trail for a long time.-Animals can spawn where they are not accessible. I made the mistake of shooting a few nice bull elk out on an island, where I could not walk out to as the water was too deep.-In multiplayer if another player uses a call, even if they are across the map, oftentimes the audio from the call can be heard as if you used the call yourself. Very startling to be stalking a deer and suddenly hear a distressed rabbit in your ear!Things in theHunter Classic that are not in CotW (that would be excellent additions)-Small game and bird hunting-Portable spawn points, like tents-Customizable blind and stand positions-Feeders-Trophy shot mode (Please, EW, put this in. I am so tired with not being able to get a nice trophy shot of a large buck because he died in a bush)-More variety. It would be very nice to have more species available, if not on these reserves than with added reserves.All in all, this game is a lot of fun, for me. I am alright with the sometimes-slow pace of it because of how stunning the visuals are, and it's a nice break from hectic life to play some hiking simulator. I love long-distance shooting in this game, and the weapons are incredibly satisfying. If your rig is lower end, I must warn you that somehow movement speed is connected to FPS and this will make it go from leisurely to an absolute drag. I have played other hunting games, and this is, despite its flaws, my favorite. I highly recommend watching videos on YouTube before purchasing to see if it's something that you'd be willing to put up with the flaws of. If it seems like a game you'd enjoy but the bug list is too long, I'd slap it on your wishlist and buy when it's on sale or just later in general, as it DOES seem like there are bug fixes going out decently often.All in all, Got stuck in a bush and died from fall damage, 10/10			"

												Good and fun game can be slow because you have to run around and actually hunt but I enjoy that but I know some people might not. Fun shooting the animals and tracking them down if you don't get the 1 shot kill. But good and fun game all around good graphics as well.			"

												Held off from buying this game on release due to the huge amount of bugs and game breaking crashes, however once they adressed these issues i can honestly say it is a very enjoyable game. Their's alot that still needs to be done as their are still bugs with animal trackings and movements. When these are fixed then they can acctually introduce real content to this game so that it can meet its potential.			"

												The game is absolutely gorges! Works like a charm!I don't understand why people are complaining so much.I admit I had one crash at the beginning of the game when I tried to access the Settings menu, but after I shot my first animal the menu worked just fine every time, no crashes at all!All the buttons which I tried worked.I also have some ambient sound problems for a couple of minutes if I'm going back and forth from the map, but other than that the game is very nice, very enjoyable, animal AI is really really well made, sound are great, environment is the best, night time is scary and beautiful.All in I vote a big YES to this game!

												theHunter Call of The Wild is a great game. It's beautiful and has a lot to offer. Hunting seems to be much more improved in this game than the previous hunter and it's nice that you don't have to pay monthly to hunt where you want and what you want. Although it's very hard to ignore the obvious bugs in the game. Sometimes your game will crash, FPS drops aren't common but they happen, your mission progress will get stuck and force you to restart your save, scope glitches when you fire making it difficult to track a animal after you shot, animals will sometimes get stuck, and tracks can completetly disappear forcing you to restart the game. The game is a lot of fun and has a lot of potential. Most definitetly a step up from the previous game. Much more improved mechhanics and several new weapons as well. If you're able to withstand the crashes and bugs this game has then I would definitetly say buy it especially if you're a fan of the previous game. When the game works as intended it's a blast to play and I don't regret buying it at all. Hopefully the devs keep to this game and don't abandon it like they did with theHunter Primal.			"

												I'm only about two hours into the game, but initial impressions are very positive.  The Good:Graphics are lovely, foliage density, lighting, weather--it's all on point.  I have brought my binoculars up multiple times checking if that movement in the distance is an animal, only to find a blowing branch or moving shadows. This really added to the immersiveness for me.  Branches and grass bend as you stalk past.  Playing the game with maxed settings (albeit at 1080p) with a constant 65fps, optimization seems solid, CPU/GPU temps both stayed well within reason.  intel i5 3.4GHz / gtx 980Sound is on point as well, highly directional, underbrush crunches, animals chirp, hoot, hollar and otherwise immerse you in the living environment.Core gameplay is solid.  Tracking, stalking, and shooting make for a fun formula.  I like that the hunting help (glowing tracks, directional assistance) are customizable, letting you play at the level of attention-to-detail you desire.  There seem to be plenty of progression options: weapon choices, different scopes, lures, binoculars; as well as a leveling skill/perk system.  And yet, the starting rifle feels plenty suitable for the game i've encountered thus far, so I don't feel rushed to level or worry about that stuff yet.The Bad:As some of the other reviews mentioned, the menu controls are kinda strange at times.  Either they occasionally hang so that you can't back out entirely, or there is some element of the selection that is somewhat tricky/unclear.  It hasn't caused me any major setbacks as a combination of escape and selecting the settings menu has allowed me to resume each time.  There don't seem to be many 'visual' character customization options.  Character presets  are pretty limited as are outfits.  This doesn't matter to me right now, but may become more important when I try out the multiplayer gameplay options.The To Be Continued:Haven't tried the multiplayer.  As that is the primary reason I was anticipating this game, I will have to update once I've had a chance to do so.   "

												Here is my opinion, after the first 10+ hours of the game.There should be no doubt that this game has great potential but currently lacks due to some bugs. Unfortunately, it's not something smallish and not so important stuff. Let me give an example. I have during my first few hours in the game already encountered numerous bugs where the animals are stuck in trees and rocks and keep running like they were on ecstacy, it might be fun to look at but after some time, you just get really annoyed about it. They might be easy to shoot - but they kill the overall feeling about being on a ""real hunt"". Another major flaw is the lack of greater depth in the multiplayer session. If you or your partner is the host of the server you play on, then it would be impossible for the other part to get certain spots on the map. Which again, unfortunately, sucks big time because of the distance between areas and places like ""save zone/fast travel"". They really need some kind of vehicle to reduce the distance to certain areas like this. Otherwise i think a lot of people would get tired of just walking/running from the other end of the map to another. Also I would like to see some more challenges online, not just those few they have right now, but something which could be a lot more interesting to do. Graphic wise, I think it look's really good. And the sounds are not bad at all. Small adjustments here and there would make this part of the game to be some of the best with The Hunter: Call of the Wild. Is it worth buying now? It depends on whether you are willing to invest in a product that possibly should have waited 2-3 months longer to correct some crucial bugs as the game crashes from time to time. (Something the dev's are working on right now). Even though this review seems negative, I just can't get myself to press the ""negative"" button. I think if some of those things i have written is going to change, then this game can get really good over time! At least im exicited to see what the future brings, hopefully more animals, new areas, easier level system, and vehicles.			"

												This game is a big step up from the theHunter Classic. First off you only need to pay once for the game, no other fees. Graphics are amazing, lots of details with the grass, water, and other things. Sounds are pretty on point and the timing of where you are and the noise level are pretty amazing. You still have a hunter score or leveling system(whatever you call it).This game also has some bad traits but, nothing that should turn away a person from playing this amazing game. Optimizing needs some work. I have an ok gaming pc, for example I can play Gta 5 online on high settings and do about 60 - 80 fps. This game I can only run on low settings and get about 20 - 35 fps. Animals do get stuck sometimes like on rocks on the side of a hill which gives the player a huge chance at getting the animals. The good news is all the downsides are pretty simple changes if they decide to do them. Another con is that when you shoot the weapon with the scope on, it will glitch out and you will have to re-aim which means if you got a bad shot on the animal then your probly gonna be tracking it for a while unless your fast and re-aiming and shooting the target. I still recommend the game because the experience is like no other game out there. Animal movements are pretty realistic and cool to see in a game. For $30 I recommend this game and this game just released, so many changes are going to happen. Keep that in mind!			"

												The scenery in this game is stunning. For the most part (release version), the game works and runs very well, and it is a great hunting game. There a some bugs that probably should not have made it past the beta stage, and I am sure the developers will fix these if they want the game to succeed. The GUI is functional, but not the greatest.Is it a bad game? No at all; a lot of effort went in the environment.Is it a great game? Not yet. It certainly has the potential, but there are some mechanics that needs to be looked it.Is this game for everyone? Hunting games are not for everyone, but if that is your thing there is no harm in picking this one up. It offers a great experience out of the ""box"".For people that expect a flawless release in every game they buy, maybe hold off for a few weeks until the devs plug the bigger holes.			"

I run this game with mostly everything on and ultra (some is on medium and I turned off some settings) and get about 60-80 fps. If you liked theHunter classic but did not want to pay for a membership, pick this game up it's only thirty USD. This game is beautiful and realistic. If you are any kind of hunter enthusiast then just give this game a try.. They will fix their bugs and soon the game will be more of an amazing expierence.			"

												Coming from somebody who plays a lot of open world video games, and has spent many hours in the wilderness, this game is super A+ #1 awesome.Honestly, a few bugs and glitches here and there, but nothing game breaking and honestly is barely took away from my overall experience. This is a game I will play for hours on end and not even know time is passing.Pros: -amazing environmental graphics and sounds (Trees/overall fauna is unbelievable)- Animal AI (needs just a little tuning but otherwise captivating)- Weapon physics/bullet penetration/animal penetration- Choice in weapons/ammo- Map size and scale, super realistic- Story mode and quests!!- Real sense of progression with skill and perk leveling systemsThings they need to improve:-Effectiveness of calls/scents are too high, they don't work that well in real life-Animal pathfinding/sticking on objects-UI needs to be smoother in the shop-Needs a buck point system-Prone positioning while on uneven terrain is super clippy. All in all, they can have this game vastly improved and damn near perfect with a few key patches. I recommend getting the game NOW, because it's very playable and immersive even with these minor issues, and by the time they have the game perfect you can have a leveled up character ;-)			"

												So add my review onto the pile of negatives. I see most of the positive reviews seem to be in direct response to the negative reviews and the which weigh in heavily on the Buggyness of the game in its released state. And most of those positive reviews are basing their positivity on the assumption that all bugs present will be fixed. I can say for sure that this is usually not the case, especially for a game released in full. They already have peoples money, they cashed in on the product. so even if they did want to polish it. They have little tangiable return guarantee to do so. Everyone should review a game (especially a full release) in its current state, not for what is planned or what could possibly be fixed later, because those are NEVER guarantees.This is my first hunting game, I played a couple hours of thehunter: classic as soon as I got to the microtransaction part (I like to play games, not money syphoning tubes). The first 6 hours of playing this game was fantastic. I completely forgot I was in my room on a computer. 100% immersion. Then, I found a bear. Bears are completely unfunctional. its as if they put the bear model, its sounds and 2 animations into the game a week before release. Half of the pause menu doesnt work with keyboard controls or any of the button prompts displayed on the bottom of the menu, This is something you fix in the first few weeks of development. I returned today into my game to do more hunting and found that none of the tracking indicators were workint, not even the direction cone when you identify a track. I had messed around with the tracking settings in my previous play session but that was to turn them back on. Sure enough, they were all on. I switched them of and on and this changed nothing, I restart my computer and this changed nothing. so one of the core mechanics of the gameplay is now bugged and my next step is to validate my game files which I will update when I do. This game is beautiful and runs well on my computer (gtx 1080 I7 6700)For those who want a good disconnect from life and a trip through the wilderness, $30 is quite modest. But expect to encounter sub alpha levels of bug fodder. And for a dev team who has a history in this genre, Its a bit sad to see.			"

												Keep in mind i really enjoy this game. But i'll say you shouldn't buy it due to the current state it is in. (not everyone can accept some of the game breaking bugs)Graphics and atomosphere are top notch in the game. You can easily get immersed due to the great sounds,lighting,and overall graphicsThe gameplay itself is pretty straight forward, you have a quest or two you can do if you want but overall you're just hunting which is great.Multiplayer is a mess, if the animals are not teleporting everywhere or invulnerable, they are running into trees and rocks and getting stuck ruining the fun of hunting. Many times you cant even harvest the animals you've killed.There are many gamebreaking bugs at the moment which leave me dumbfounded. Some of these bugs that i encounter all the time are        - Rifle scopes not working if you also have used a bow        - Waypoints have either not worked at all or will show you two places at once on your UI/HUD (lots of times both of them aren't even the spots you picked), also you can't delete them so you have to reload to get rid of them        - Tracking is pretty broken in many ways (leading you the wrong way, sometimes in a circle)        - Hit reg is really janky since the new update (double lung shots sometimes give minor wounds? wtf)        - Multiplayer is a mess Overall i love the game but I will never tell anyone to buy it due to the state the game was released in (patches have made it worse so far) "

												Wow, 80 hours already. I think this is also my first Steam review.I enjoy theHunter COTW. At the core it is a hunting simulator, and in that regard it performs somewhat admirably. The landscapes in both playable maps are expansive and beautiful. The game engine really brings out the beauty of these hunting grounds whether it's a clear summer day or moonlit foggy night. Seeing the jagged antlers of the buck you've been intently tracking for what seems like hours shimmer in the sun while it trots within the tall foliage is quite the sight to see. The sun's rays sometimes glow through the trees, creating an ambience that causes you to stop and just take it all in. Through numerous patches that have come after the game's release, the game is in, at least for me, a playable state. As mentioned in many other reviews perhaps these bugs should have been ironed out before release. I won't get into that debate as it seems to be the industry-wide norm. Bugs are minimal now, animal pathing and AI seems to be working more reliabely (though with some major faults, such as herd behavior). I haven't spontaneously combusted by walking between two rocks or two saplings in a long time. Sure, there's still some issues with terrain and how the player/animals interact with it, buggy/misplaced things such as grass hanging in the air, etc. With a map this expansive there are bound to be some issues and animals will eventually get stuck. This is part of the process and is something I can live with. However, due to my aforementioned herd behavior mention, if an animal as part of a herd does manage to bug out on a rock and get stuck, the rest of the animals will circle voilently around it until it dies (or you get trampled). This can lead to some funny/fruitful opportunities but as a hunting simulator it greatly detracts from the immersion. Multiplayer is bare bones minimal. The single-player questing system is absent in the multiplayer version, instead replaced with competitions you can start with other players. These include hitting an animal in the heart first, bagging 3 fallow deer trophies, etc. While it can be a worthy distraction it would have been nice to be able to quest with other players. Especially with those difficult missions (high level photos, gold star ratings, etc.). There remains the issue of connected players to a host server being unable to unlock new landmarks/outposts, etc. I personally never join a server if I play multiplayer as I always want the option, so I host. It explains why there are so many servers with just 1 player in them.My issue is that this developer seems to be following the trend. A console release has been announced recently and with the lack of updates it will only get worse in my opinion. A guise of two separate console and PC development teams is their only defense - just take a look at the patch note comments. The sad truth is that development for the PC version will slow until they get their cash flow from the console release. The game takes a modestly beefy PC to render the graphics at their ultimate potential, and a lot of people don't have the pcmasterrace in them.  If they get a console version that runs at 30 FPS and has full game pad support, a lot of people might hop on that boat. Why wouldn't they release a console version? Lotta money potential. And that seems to be their game - hey, it's a business. TLDR - Console development is a money maker. PC development will likely slow. I enjoy the game, but I can't support the business model as a consumer. I understand it though. Try getting the game when it's on sale. Or, you know... Eat a citrus fruit so you don't get scurvy, matey... 6.5/10			"

												Really good game WITHOUT micro transaction or PAY to hunt everything.ALSO there are as far as i notised no serious bugs or problems, and the game do not feel unfinished or like a Beta like many ""unserious reviews claim"".I think that many of the reviews sound kind of fake and are negative on purpose.( im so glad they desided to release ""the hunter"" game with one payment only, since the pay for this and that scared med away from the previous title ""the hunter"".ANyway im not expert in the past game the hunter, and i only played the new ""call of the wild"" for 2 houres.But so far i enjoy it and the changes.The game world is beautifull and there are many cool features such as the plants moving when a small animal sneak arround.The sound is really amazing and create a good atmosphere and will make you feel releaxed.THe game have a career/skill/perk system wich will allow you to upgrade different things over time such as tracking animals and shooting ect.I think this is nice, since you start as a rookie hunter and become better and better.I am not aware if you can start as a ""pro"" hunter with all perks and all guns as a kind of free world go hunting kind of thing, but the career thing i like so for me no issue.When it come to animals you can hunt there are like 8-10 big animals such as ""black bear, red tail, mose, fox, wild boar and other animals. And you dont have to pay to hunt them :-)Everytime you hunt down an animal you get awarded xp and money.The ingame money you earn can be used to buy new weapons, bullets and sometimes you even come across small buildings you can buy and use for hunting.The tracking of animals is like in the hunter, but i think it is a little more easy to see the tracks now.I think you can be hardcore and adjust the kind of help you like and how visual things will be.You can either go hunting on your own or with friends, and you also get  missions you can do, example hunt an animal and make a photo of it ( press p ).It effect the game how much you hunt in an area, and you can view this on your map as a purple colour, so try to not shoot everything you see, and do some different hunts all over the map.So far the only bug i found during 2 hour gameplay is that i fall down a mountain, and 5 minutes later I could not use any of my gear. But other than that, no big bugs that i notised.It run very good and smooth though the game world is huge and very detailed.Can i recommend this game.. YES i think it is really good, and I hope that they release some cheap dlc's in the future so people who like more animals or gear can buy example an weapon pack or animal pack.Ps. if you buy and do not like the game, then you can ask for a refund if you use the steam support system and play less than 2 houres.. So what do you have  to loose by giving it a try ;-)			"

This game is a Hunter Simulator set in european deciduous forests, made by Expansive Worlds, a quite experienced hunter-sim developer underpined by Avalanche Studios and their really astonishing APEX Engine. Multiplayer included.  Aspect Annotation   Graphics, Atmosphere and Scenery:☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OO  The new APEX engine is definetely meritorious, it offers some great visual feedback for the player: Wind Simulation, Falling Leaves, Curving Grass and Decent Texture&Draw Distance. Eveverything in the games looks real enough for the player to relish it.   Gameplay:☺☺☺☺☺☺OOOO It's kinda meh. The whole gameplay spins around following the trails of animals and then shooting them dead with deficient variativity. It's a notably protracted and tedious process, especially in late game. The Character is also really flaccid, and there are no vehicles in this game, and that convicts the player to spend half of his time walking from point A to point B on a really big map with the lack of fast travel spots. Multiplayer mode makes it much pleasant and fun though, but it still won't last for long.   Stability and Online:☺☺☺☺☺OOOOO It's really poor. There are lots of gamebreaking bugs and gliches from disappearing corpses to critical error crashes. Same applies to the multiplayer, where crashes and disconnects are a comming thing  Overall: 7.1/10 While TheHunter:CotW ensures some fascinating immersion and visual fidelity, the amount of systematic problems and a considerably wearisome gameplay mechanics might dramatically spoil the impression of the game "

												Ok not going to rehash all the other great reviews out there already but as of this time I have 82 hours in it and i havent even made it to the second reserve . I dont know how some of you justify bang for the buck but with that much game play in half the game its pretty hard to ♥♥♥♥♥ even with the glitches which are certainly better than when released and being worked on all the time. If you like hunting games bingo its a winner if you like walking simulators also spot on. The rare few who actually like both its about as good as it gets in that sense ,plus a level grind aspect that keeps me playing with a goal to achieve . The glitches mentioned before while annoying are not game breaking the disappearing tracks issue is the hardest to deal with but also getting better (my suggestion is to be dam sure before you let that arrow or bullet fly). I like many others have literaly spent hours tracking a less that stellar shot to make sure i keep my consecutive harvest bonus going and it just seems wrong even in the game world to just take pot shots at everything then let them die slowly out in the brush to rot. I find if i just pick an undiscovered spot on the map and walk ( not run sometimes even in stealth which seems agonozingly slow) there I will several chances to track seomthing or even straight out walk up on a clean shot situation.I dont find the hunting blinds all that helpful but they do work you just have to use the calls but it seems boring when there is plenty to hunt walking around. Running is only a means to get from point a to b not a method to travel and expect to hun. The wildlife will hear you before you even get a warning call from them and its like your on a deserted planet. If your a twitch pvp gotta shoot a hundered rounds an hour player keep walking this isnt your game. There is however plenty of beautiful scenery and simply walking to open up map areas is enjoyable if you have a 5.1 or better headset or surround system crank it up and head into the woods listen for warning and mating calls and stealth towards them its very cool. Keep in mind which way your scent is going as it will tip them off before anything else does many times. I love the direction this game is going and cant wait to visit the other reserve looking forward to some new reserve dlcs maybe a few more things to hunt would rock but still pretty darn good now. I would like the option to start a second data or more so as i go to a new reserve i can start from scratch while still having the option to bring my developed character to look for bigger game as well . I love the level asect of it for me i like to have a goal to work towards there is a good mix of xp grind and  money grind here to keep you motiviated. They cant give it all to you for free at the start or you'd get bored quickly. I do feel like having to start over from scratch on the consecutive harvest thing is a bit of a pain but not horrible. I mostly find it makes it impossible to jump in and play for short bursts because so much of the game requires you to get gold kills and that is ony going to happen if you have 100% modifier on consecutive harvest as well as quick kill and it needs to be basically mythical grade animal.Graphics are really nice sometimes i just climb a mountain to see the view from up there some of the waters edge shots you get as well looking out over a tranquil mountiain lake or river is beautiful. Dont judge it by all the negative reviews while the points are valid a lot of times, many have been addressed and i have found none game breaking aggravating at times yes but not gamebreaking. I have only had one or two animals that i got any sort of decent shot into that didnt result in a successful harvest with diligent tracking and patience.Almost forgot dont forget to try the bow I started this game thinking good lord I'll never get close enough to anything to kill it with a bow but you will and its a real sense of accomplishment when you take down a mythical level red deer lets say with your bow very cool. I hunt almost exclusively with it now but still break out the 270 as well ,sometimes you just want to make sure especially if your on a mission and have 100% harvest bonus and dont want to risk it.There it is all i can think of hope it helps i enjoyed this game enough that i didnt even mind buying it full price 30 bucks is not outrageous . I looked at the classic version and I would never enjoy it as much as this one even with the larger number of things to hunt micro transaction games just leave me with a bad vibe and the days of monthy subscription games are pretty much done. Thnx hopefully this isnt too gramaticaly borked a nice spell checker gramar checker would be handy here lol.  "

												I feel like the devs read my review of TheHunter, and took everything I mentioned about the first game, and made the second game based off exactly what I hated about the first. The Tracking System has been overhauled, and you can easily distinguish your animal vs all the other animal's tracks. The spawn rate of animals has been increased, so you won't go for hours without seeing anything. The movement speed has also been increased, so you can finally haul across the forest instead of slow jogging. Honestly, I was really skeptical about this game but it has impressed me so far. I think I'm going to enjoy playing this during real hunting's off season... Because come November I won't be touching my computer for a while...			"

												Like alot of people have stated this game is pretty much a beta. there are alot of problems that need to be addressed. i was hoping for a no micro transaction version of the classic hunter but all that has improved from the classic is the graphics. there is a lack of variety in the guns and you have to put in a crazy ammount of hours to unlock any. the missions are in no way progressive and it doesnt seem like alot of thought has been put into them which is annoying since there doesnt seem to be a trophy system. you can just shoot anyhting around to get money and xp leaving you with no real want to pick your targets carefully. there are shotguns with birdshot but nothing to shoot them with.either way ive enjoyed playing it to a point but with bugs and what not ive been really put off playing for now			"

												For the few hours I have played CotW I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a hunting game and doesn't want to pay extra for Classic.For people new to the franchise, I would start with CotW. It is the cheaper alternative and delivers for its price range. While Classic may have more animals, gameplay and community features CotW is a more inclusive system. Not nessecarily easier as it comes with its own challenges but the learning curve is more user-friendly.For people returning from previous theHunter games I believe it would depend on what you want. In a way, CotW is closer to Primal than Classic. There are fewer animals, less trophy diversity and fewer game mechanics but the AI is more advanced and the species don't feel like the same system tacked onto multiple different models.As for bugs I have only experienced one major one that simply required a game restart. There are several smaller ones that are more annoyances than game breaking, which I am sure will be patched out in the following weeks.As for the things I don't like, coming from Classic was a bit of a shock and while I know some people would be upset for the change, EW was very upfront that CotW would not be what Classic is. It was sold as a game that would not compete with Classic and some people seem to have forgotten that, or never understood what that ment. After a few hours of playing I grew to enjoy what CotW offers at this moment in time, however, it does feel rather empty. Such large maps with so little diversity.Despite this, I do think this game is worth buying. Be it now, or in a few months. If you are worried about bugs and missing features I would wait but definitely come back every once in awhile to see how the game progresses.Good luck and happy hunting!			"

												Before I start I would like to put it out there that I really enjoyed the the original ""The Hunter"" despite its pay to win set-up.Pros:-I think this game has a lot of potential for being good. -There is actually a sense of progression as you explore the map to find things and gain points to unlock perks, build hunting blinds, and buy weapons. -The maps seem very large although there are only 2 maps as far as I can tell. -The interface and UI are much better compared to its predecesser.-There are more factors to the hunt, such as , wind direction and sound levels-The graphics and sounds are better in this game but I have yet to hear a bleat from a doe I hear a bunch of grunts but no bleats, maybe that is something they will change in the future?Cons:-The game is sadly buggy right now, my first experience with an animal in this game is three doe coming out in front of me and one of them just trotting in circles. Every one of my shots but two led to a deer being stuck on something or running in circles as well.-A small annoyance to me is the fact that I can place a waypoint on the main map but it has not shown up for me on the compass or the huntermate-The crashed on me a few times-There are sadly less weapons than the original Hunter, it does not have crowsbows or anything, but I hope to see them added soon.In conclusion I think this game is definitely going to be good at some point but when is the question when. It has its problems but I think it will be the top hunter game if they put time into it.			"

												hello random people of the world!i just bought this game yesterday, i have played for two (maybe a little over two) hours.. and it is HELLA fun, i sat with a friend and walked around trying to kill everything.the graphics are beautiful, it runs fantastic.. though i have a beast of a pc and it can run anything i throw at it.. so... for people complaining the game is super laggy, doesn't run well, and just giving it negative comments because your pc isn't the greatest, stop, sure, it doesn't run well on YOUR pc.. but everyone else doesn't have YOUR pc.have a good pc, this wont be an issue.the hunting/tracking is a lot of fun, very realistic. i love this game already, though i've always been a hunting game lover!it takes a lot of patience, so if you can't stand slow moving REALISTIC hunting, then move on.. this game will not be for you. i however, find it great.i have no come across any bugs at all, besides maybe one black bear who was ""stuck"" on pretty much nothing and running in place.. though that fixed itself in less than 5 seconds and he continued to run away..BY THE WAY, what damn black bear would rather run from me than attack me?! even coyote? no way in hell those would run from me.. come on now lolanyway, fantastic, beautiful game.. i can't wait to keep playing it. hella fun!

												This review is written on 4.5 hours of playtime:To start, I love this game. Everyone's biggest issue with theHunter classic was that you had to pay (real money) for weapons and items. In CotW, you earn money to buy them by completing missions and harvesting animals. I love using the camera to take photos of an absolutely stunning visual experience.However, there are a lot of bugs, almost too many to mention and probably some that have not even been noticed yet. This is not acceptable for a full release game, if there is such a term anymore. It's 2017, developers dish out patches left and right to make thier games better, and I have a hard time believing Expansive Worlds will just up and give up on this game that they have been so passionate about.Verdict: If you want a hunting game, and hate microtransactions, this is the game for you. Otherwise, stick to the 'free' theHunter : Classic version for now. P.S. EW has voiced that both versions of theHunter will be living on, and that they are to go hand-in-hand.-Review will be tweaked as play time and patches go on-			"

												This is a working progress review. My first time playing a hunter game as my old potato laptop couldnt run the old hunter game. I have to say this game is really good so far. Ive only really hunted deer and foxes so far mind you.Pros: 1). The Graphics are amazing in this game from the scenary to the wildlife.2). The reserves are brilliantly done and are huge in scale.3). Sounds are brilliant also, from the natural ambience to the gun sounds. Everything that makes a noise in this game sounds like it should.4). The wildlife that are in the game look amazing (although thier eyes look wierd up close).5). Really nice weapon models.6). Single player and multiplayer/co-op.Cons:1). AI sometimes bugs out and gets stuck on things. And some of the animations aren't very fluid ect, when the bear stands up, it sort of telleports upright.2). After you fire your weapon sometimes your rifles scope bugs out. (not sure how to explain it).3). There's a few animals in the game you can kill but get nothing for, like rabbits and squirils.4). No trophy system (Yet).5). No leaderboards.6). Needs real bows not just crappy compound ones. And more rifles of different calibers.7). Should be more customization options for you character to make your clothing unique.8). Tons of bugs ranging from your guns going invisible and not being able to look down you scope without it being at a angle so you can see anything through it, to your game crashing alot (mines only started crashing after 15 hours playtime mind you).9). Not being able to collect your own trophies in a multiplayer session sometimes, although if you have friends you play with they can do it for you.So far ill give this a 7/10 and hope they add more animals to hunt and stuff to hunt with and mybe the option to build a hunting station where ever we want not just pre determined places. Once they fix the crashes at least i will have no problem giving it a higher score as i can live with bugs after playing arma 3 for so long.			"

												This is a great game, sure it has some bugs right now but they are mostly all about the UI.Game plays in 60fps for me on max settings 2560x1440p.The game totalt looks amazing the nature and the animals blends in so good. If you like hunting this is the game to go.Overall i would totaly recommend this even tho the few UI bugs i stumbled upon.			"

												I would like to start of by mentioning that this game looks beautiful, the sounds and feeling from the elements while going around tracking down game is something I have not seen in another game atleast not at this caliber. I'd love to give a really positive review, but sadly there are too many gamebreakers at the moment to try getting strangers of me to buy this game, unless you don't mind overlooking them.The first bug I encountered was the animals getting stuck between bushes and rocks, this one I noticed on my third kill of the game as a poor deer was running and running between a rock and a tree. After my current hours in the game I have seen this tens of times allready, but I wouldent call it gamebreaking, but it's a minus.In real hunting you rarly go for multiple shots towards diffrent games, but if you do in this game it seems like the tracking gets thrown of abit. Vital/flesh wounds on 'non' rare game not showing up & neither are tracks. A couple of times all tracks just disappeared all together and the only way I found to fix it was to reset the game, wich is a blunder when you are far of a outpost hunting(as in you only spawn in around the nearest outpost).The mission system is a good adition, but some of the missions are abit random to complete and some are better of leaving undone til you can afford and/or able to buy better equipment(ex. pictures of several animals of same race in a set zone). Some quests seems bugged, as they would not complete even if conditions are met(ex. killing deer at night).What I do like is how much of a grind it is to max your hunting skills and perks you can pick up.The real gamebreaker for me is the random and unexpected crashes, screen freezes with looping sound. Giving it a quick search just shows how many are affected by this and there has not been a single respons from the game developers about this yet. They seem to happen more and more depending on how much of a map you have explored, as I can play one of the zones without a crash for longer then the more explored zone(but what do I know). So for me when I am in the zone, focused to bring down game, take a shot and trying to track down the giant moose to see how big it actually was. And for it all to be a waste of time by a frozen screen and looping sound, meh I got better things to do then playing a non-finished game.My review of this game were from the last week intil today, 10/3-17. I might change my mind about this if there is a game fixing patch coming, but I would advice to wait to pick this up to see if they manage to change this visual pearl to a hour sandbox.			"

												Pros -1. Great feel to the game.2. Scenery is beautiful and intense3. Animal models look very very nice4. leveling system keeps u interested and motivated/5. Quests are a very fun addition which also keeps u interested.6. NEED ZONES - LOVE IT!!!!!Cons - 1. Animal model updates are awesome BUT U CANT TAKE TROPHY SHOTS?!?!?!2. When you get a kill, the game gives u a generic score for each kill...... just a number that doesnt mean anything substantial to you because there is no comprehensive scoring system anymore..... incredibly dissappointing....3. NEED ZONES!!! AWESOME BUT OH WAIT I CANT PLACE A TENT OR A TREE STAND ................................................. wtf is the point of the need zone then....4. HUGE MAP.... YUGE!!!!! But there is not enough fast travel nodes...... And i cant put down any tents (>_<).........so getting to the places u wanna be takes wayyyy tooo  looonngggg......------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion - Good game.... not great... if they had just taken the old game made it an RPG with leveling and quests......... fixed animal AI........... Updated Animal Models (what i have been begging to have for years..)...... and got rid of the obsessive amounts of pay to play store items.... this game would be amazing, I would go out hunt animals earn xp do quests buy ammo and guns place my tents and stands and have a ton of fun..... >_< ..... so sad... i was waiting for this.... hopefully it gets better.....

												Pros:-Looks good-Sounds good-Feels goodCons:-Buggy-Unpolished-Very arcadey features that can't be ignored or turned off such as perks, skills, XP, some infuriating woman talking to you, weapon 'stats', icons everywhere, information like a health bar, and a sound meter on the screen not even on the hunter mate, compass is again on the screen when it should be on the huntermateWait until it's fixed, in its current state it is basically beta.I'm unhappy about the arcadey stuff. I knew they were going to make it more 'accesible' which is never a good thing with games, but hoped all the rubbish like XP and perks would be optional, so far some of the visual clues can be turned off, as well as the annoying missions and tutorial, but you can't get around the XP and perks.I would love the devs to have two modes. One game like mode like it is now, and another simulation mode like the Classic Hunter.Honestly if this is the beginning of the end for this game then it will be a shame because the engine seems great and the environments look stunning, it has just been rushed and they're trying to casualise it to get new players. I know I have a low amount of hours in the game for now but I've played enough of the hunter 'classic' to judge it so far.Wait until the game is fixed and polished, hopefully the developers will sort the bugs out and listen to the community.Update 19/3/17: I'm glad the devs are working on the bugs and releasing patches but the game still feels very unfinished, I would wait still.

												This really deserves a much higher rating from buyers. If you're even remotely interested in the title buy it. Honestly wouldn't put it past special interest groups to buy the game just to run the rating down. Anyhow I can't figure out what most of the bad review are talking about.Breaking down into pros and cons....Pros- ran 60 to 90 fps without any drops on 1080 custom all ultra- in several hours I unlocked 1/5 of the map and explored maybe 1/20. It would take weeks to explore just one of the two maps completely. It is absolutely huge!- Absolutely gorgeous open world environment. One of the best I've seen in any genre.- Better animal AI than i've seen in any game.- Great rpg skill building. No just running out and shooting rockets on the first day. (ok rockets is hyperbole)-quite realistic tracking after wounding. I made a bad shot on one animal and tracked it for over an hour in the dark. Unfortunately the AI did just what real deer do. It circled back on its own tracks several times till I couldn't tell which way it went in the dark anymore.-don't worry it's easy enough to make a good kill shot with even the .243 you start with. I read one report that made it sound like it happened every time. Not sure what they expect for a starter rifle? 475 h&h maybe? That was only one of many I shot that turned out that way.-No da*n bango music. For anyone that remembers the hunting games where you had the volume turned way up to hear animals and bam, suddenly you forget when you pause it blares frackn banjo music.-I started on the European map. Pleasant voice acting. Very well done.-And the list goes on, but I'll stick to the basicsCons - One time.... One time a deer got stuck....- The store interface just felt a little clunky. Not really bad or game breaking. Very minor update would do it. Really it might just be a matter of preference like ford dash controls vs. volvo.This is one of a very few games i'd say absolutely buy it. It's worth the $30. But hey if you're the next warren buffett or something by all means wait for a sale. (ok i seriously doubt he's a gamer... just sayin) "

												First off i love hunting and do it alot. But this isnt hunting. this is a walker simulator with a gun in your hands, thats just it. Most of the time the animals dont even respond to your calls so you gotta go finding them, but their AI is so bugged they might run away while your a mile and a half away. The amount of glitches and bugs, this game should NOT have been realeased like this. they might as well have sold us an IOU note. The menus are janky and unstable, the AI is just bad, the guns break all the time, and the framerate is in the low 20 at medium. {Also an important note thats affecting me personally, The Discussion mods keep shutting me down for the stupidest things, like actually banning me for a question about a game mechanic i didnt understand. I asked in discussions about Zero Distance and what that is, and my post was deleted about 20 minutes after, than when i called them out on it they banned me for ""Causing a Ruckus""}All in all this whole thing is a pile of junk and i doubt it will ever get fixed properly.

												If wandering through a wood seeing no wildlife is your thing....wander through a wood seeing no wildlife, at least you'll get fresh air and exercise. This game makes little attempt to gently induct beginners; it has a poorly designed ""tutorial"", which says things like ""you should see some tracks"". You don't. Then you wander aimlessly, with the game randomly selecting a gun,or  a lure or binoculors without explanation, until you stumble on where the map is and a blue pointer then magically appears guiding you to a target. But it leads to nothing. Not even with binocuours 2 metres away.The binocular vison is blurred and it's almost impossible to pan, as you inexplicably have to hold down right click as you look for...nothing. I never really got started with this but then there was nothing to get started on even after an hour - that's an hour of my life I won't get back but thankfully Steam's refund policy means at least I'll get the not inconsiderable price of the game back.

												Totally unfinished game. So many bugs and annoyances, that I don't even wan't to start listing. Graphics have gone better from original The Hunter, but everything else is major step backwards.Edit. Maybe I do some sort of list after all:Map is next to useless. You can't recognize anything else than the biggest topographical variations. I would like to see normal topographical map. Animal behaviour is dumb. Normally animals stand still for very long periods of time. Not here, they just wonder endless circels and rarely stop for eating. You can see bear and deer walking 10m apart happily not caring each other. If you wound an animal, its very difficult to catch them ever again, because they run like hell dispite the injury. Scenery is really nice and atmosphere realistic. I really like the sound when you are walkin on small rocks :)I have played original The Hunter for several hundreds of hours and can't understand why to create another gameplay where you boost graphics very nicely and f*ck up all the rest?I'm sure that more patches are coming and they are going to fix many bugs. At this point this game is only for real enthusiasts.			"

												Pros:GraphicsVariety of biomes (Woodlands, swamp-ish, mountains, hilly, fieldful, valley)SoundsVariety of animalsAtmosphereSome realismAnimal tracking is pretty goodLarge mapHandles smoothlyCons:Not the realism I was hoping forGun sway is hella high (never had that issue irl even after a 5 mile walk/jog)% of bleed out is lowWalking into water makes more sound than stormy weathercalling tools suck fromk my experienceVery BuggyOverall, great game. Price is bit much for an unfinished game. If you thuroughly enjoy hunting IRL, you might enjoy more than me.BEST PART:I saw in the distance, down a mountain, a beautiful Whitetail Deer. Bushes rustling near it, with a little bunny standing still. I crouched, waiting for the perfect shot. I get a spine shot, instantly if fell over, and the bunny somehow managed to die. I was excited, so I walked 5 feet foward to get a better view to remember their location. I fell down the mountain. I was going really fast. So fast the ground couldn't handle my body. I went through the ground at Mach speed.5/7 would mach speed the ground again.			"

												This game would be very good, however the vast amount of glitches and difficult user interface makes it very unapealing im not sure who greenlit this to be able to purchase but they jumped the gun. The rifles are the only real weapons you can use in game, pistols are a joke because you can get close enough to even get a shot. The shotguns are pretty useless and they affer bird shot which there are not even any birds in game to use it on they just fall out of the sky and blow into a bunch of feathers as well are not even on the list of animals to hunt. the scoring is pretty usless as well, takes for ever to level up weapons, and again for the pistols good luck ever unlocking a new one because to get there you would litterally have to make skilled shots with iron sights and have to kill around 200 animals. For me and im not sure if it is for everyone else but i tried to do the first quest and it wouldnt let me advance through it. This game could have been great but it almsot seems as if they lost funding and just said screw it and released it with a ton of errors.			"

												This game has potential, but typical of an Expensive Worlds release, it's chock full of bugs. The hit detection is just awful.  Shots that would be kill shots in real life are flesh wounds in this game.  What is really frustrating is the misleading ""free gun and gillie suit"" promotion.  If you have both theHunter classic and theHunter: Call of the Wild, you don't get the gun and gillie suit for free, you get the opportunity to buy them.  Yes, you buy them with in-game money, but it takes a long time to earn enough to buy them.  As of right now, I can't recommend this game, and I wish I wouldn't have bought it.  Maybe after a few patches, and some more patches to kill the bugs they introduce with those patches, it will be playable, but right now, I'd stay away.			"

												theHunter: Call of the Wild,I'd give her 5 stars. Not entirely sure what all the hate and absolute disgust is all about, I have found nothing but greatness in the product.Yes, sure there are a few issues here and there, but nothing that patches won't be able to iron out. Right, just a brief reason why I rate COTW so highly with a pro's and con's list below.Call of the Wild has some of the most beautiful, calming and pleasuring forests, plains, rivers and mountains to explore, the ambiance the game creates in that regard is utter beauty.The animals themselves are really great to look at and stalk. Sure the Buck do not have the hugest varity of Antlers out there, but i am curious to see what the future holds in that regard. Thus far each hunt has been majestic in its own way. Each hunt has brought about its own challenges and adventure with it. From hunting Red Fox to Various types of Deers, some animals are in a herd which force me to choose wisely and play my tactics carefully if i wish to leave with the best scoring animal, those that travel alone are often very sneaky and sometimes downright genius, though with enough patience and technique, the hunt will reward you with the sight of beauty and the pleasure of the one shot kill. (To which I have noticed a lot of people complaining about 3 shots to bring down a buck.... I have yet to have such an issue. 12 shots fired. 12 hits, 12 kills.Anyhow onto the Pro's and Con's list.Con's:1) Small game and Big game create the same noise while passing through foilage/bushes which is hugely missleading or should i say somewhat confusing, I have caught myself doing 360s with the rifle aimed, looking for that deer that made that racket while passing through the bushes, to see only later that it was merely a rabbit. Very odd for a Rabbit to make such a loud crash through the bushes.2) A couple of glitches while in Map mode, You have to constantly zoom in and out to see the borders of various places on the map, which isnt very helpful while trying to complete missions, but by no means a game breaker.3) A few animals are still getting glitched/stuck on various rocks and or tree trunks, Thus far has only happend twice out of the 12 animals i have had the opportunity of taking down.That is really it thus far.Pros:1) The beautifully designed Forests, Plains, Rivers, Mountains etc etc are a sight for sore eyes. I have no issues getting lost in them and just strolling through watching gazing Buck stroll through the wild. 2) The ambiance in the wild is fantastic, it really makes you feel as if you are in the wild, from the birds chirping, to the foxes howling (Squeeking?) to the birds flying out of the bushes while you hastly run past. The wind that blows over the plains and the odd time Thunder strikes the silent evening sky behind you. Its brilliantly done.3) The Animals are very goodlooking, From the Rabbit through to the various Deers (I have yet to find myself a Bear or any other larger Game, thus i have to hold that comment). They act very well, and I have yet to have issues with them spooking just to stop a few meters later. When they spook, my god do they run, and stop very very far away. Have had some fantastic 2 hour marches following those Tracks.4) The whole feeling to the game is great, It is not elite hardcore, but is by no means like a Call of Duty Hunter. I see tons of complaints that the game is far too arcade like, but I cannot seem to grasp what that means. The hunts are by no means easy, You can spend a very long time tracking down your prey, very easily spook him off and very easily miss your shot. (Unless ofcourse you are using your rifle like its a machine gun and shooting every animal in sight... well then you have no idea what hunting is about).Thats about it for now, I will ofcourse update the review at a later stage.All in all,I will be spending tons of hours on this beaut of a game.

theHunter: Call of The Wild has the potential to be the best hunting game out there. It's a great foundation for the perfect hunting game. Unfortunately, that's all the game is at its current state. It's pretty much just a pretty landscape with everything else feeling rushed. When it actually works and you don't encounter one of the many bugs it's a really enjoyable and relaxing experience, but way too often do you find your immersion getting completely ruined by a visual bug or weird AI.Not only that, I feel like it lacks some critical content that you kind of expect from any hunting game. Here are two of the major things I think the game is lacking at the moment, to at least make it a complete hunting game and putting the glitches aside:1. Birds. You can hear them all around you. There are some oddly placed seagulls (or whatever they are) here and there that flies away by the noise you make. But there are no birds to hunt. I was really expecting this to be in the game at release, but knowing where the developers are coming from (the microtransaction hell that is theHunter: Classic) I'm guessing it will be a future DLC. Hard to say if the developers ran out of time or if this is an intentional decision. The shotguns are there to tease you though.2. Any means of transportation. The map is HUGE. It needs some kind of vehicles. And at the pace the character is running it feels even bigger. Sure, you can fast travel between the outposts but first you'll have to find them, usually by going to a lookout point to reveal them on the map and then walk to them to claim them and just hope that you don't accidentally stumble between two static rocks that somehow magically squishes you to death on your way there. Yes, that happened not only once, but three times. I remember playing Deer Hunter 3 back in the days and thought it was cool that you could get around with ATV's, snowmobiles and such. Guess this might be DLC too, concidering there are achievements for traveling ""BY FOOT"". Feels weird to state that unless they have some other way of travelling planned.Now those are just the features I feel that the game is currently lacking. As an addition to that it's riddled with bugs and some of the most horrible AI/pathfinding I've seen in a game. Which is a good way to completely ruin your immersion that you otherwise get from the stunning visuals. Squirrels gets stuck humping rocks, rabbits run in circles at the speed of light, deer gets stuck against trees and rocks and I've even seen a group of four different animal types running into eachother in a mess that looked like the queue line to the Noah's ark. I try my best to just ignore these derpy animals and move on but you see them way too often to just simply ignore them. I know it must be hard to code AI and especially animal like behaviour but I still don't expect to see these kind of situations in a full release of a hunting game. I've seen a whole pack of wild boars just running into an invisible wall forever. There doesn't seem to be any fall damage in the game, yet somehow you sometimes die if you get stuck between two rocks or try to climb them as I mentioned earlier. I even just flat out died walking on a flat surface at one point. The screen has gone completely blurry as if the field of depth was bugged and also completely red after I died once. These were fixed by just clicking ESC twice to bring up the menu interface (which can be a little bit disorienting at times when it comes to equipment and such) and then close it again. The smartphone is visible in some of the cutscenes, just floating there (sometimes upside down). I've found a hunting stand that was not buildable for whatever reason (surely the developers must have had time to test this once they put it down on the map?) and seen some weirdly placed street signs and poles. There was also this one pile of stones which gives you lore that had the trigger 8 meters underground so it was impossible to activate. I've seen some floating 3D sprites and trees that goes through rocks and some terrain deformities (with stretched textures), but usually you have to look really close for these types of minor glitches. The one visual glitch that occurs the most is the one with parts of the scope disappearing after you take a shot.With all this being said, I really hope the developers listens to the community and addresses these issues. I'm really looking forward to future patches and updates, it can only get better from here and hopefully we'll have our hands on the best hunting experience one can have on a PC. I tried to summarize my experience with the game so far in this review, for the developers and others thinking about buying it, just to let you know what you can expect from it at its current state. I have no complaints about the sounds nor the visuals, but as for now I'll give this game a rating of ""Not recommended"" until it gets some fixes.			"

												Welcome to beta testing 2.0/early access!!! (since we forgot to say that the first beta was just a joke and nothing was used from it!)This review will be changed when the game is patch to a playable state!!!!After playing the game for a fair amount of time i have had plenty of bugs and gliches.Con:- Crashing because who F***ing knows?!- ALT+TAB crashes.- Not able to claim trophys.- Not gaining money or xp from claiming trophys.- ""Spawning"" outside the map while still standing on campsites.- Tracks failing to appear.- Animal stuck on/in rocks/trees.- Scope not working on rifles when a weapon without scope is in your inventory.- Frame drops for no appearent reason.- Unable to claim an outpost in a multiplayer game (this fact is destroying my wish to play with friends since we can not all claim the same outpost only the host of the game can!)- No xp bar so its hard to know when you are going to level up next.- Falling to your death from a tiny rock.Pros:- The setting of the game is amazing! (PRAY TO RNGSUS everytime you bootup!!!)- Leveling isnt a must to kill pretty much anything in the game, a well placed shot or shots will do the trick.- Fantastic looking game.My pc should not have any trouble running this game on ultra. My pc specc:- MSI GTX 980 Ti- Ram DDR4 16GB 3000MHz- SSD 500GB 850 EVO- Intel i7-5930K- CPU cooler			"

												Week 3-4 update:  Looking like devs are making progress but the title still isnt fully polished.The game does run on some older machines but dont expect the world.  If you have crashes, its possible others are experiencing the same.  Devs had made it clear that if you document your bugs clearly & accurately, they will respond in return.   That may not mean your bug is fixed today, but you wont be ignored.I cant yet give this title a thumbs up, because there are still a number of bugs to be worked out.  Im hopeful, but not in a hurried kind of way.  In a couple of months, when its ready, the environments in this game will blow you away.------------------Weekend 1 review -- not reccomended.  Codebase appears incomplete and untested.  This is effectively a pay-to-play beta release, and it is quite broken.I suspect only the most elite high-end systems were tested in the undoubtedly brief QA cycle, and anyone using even remotely old hardware will be out of luck until many bugs are ironed out.For me, I have 2 systems that ran the orginal ""theHunter"" flawlessly at max settings, and i had hoped that with the same hareware at modest settings i'd be able to evaluate this new release.   But so far its no deal.  with my i7 2600k + gtx 570 the 3d engine will render 1-2 frames before it crashes. Pretty much crashes immediately after the logo screens.  Same exact result for my mobile i7+675gtx.This game obviously has promise and I'll be happy to give it a good reivew once its actually finished.  But for now, they appear to be funding their development cycle with pay to play beta shenanigans.Buyer Beware.			"

												This game was released a little early for my liking. It feels like a Beta and there are quite a few bugs. That's the negative. The positive is that the graphics is really great and the gameplay, which may not suit COD fans, is slow and deliberate. This is as close to real life as you can get.Am I glad I bought it? Yes, the bugs will get fixed. DLCs will come out with new reserves and gear. Bear with it. It's still great game with more potential the classic version. It was relatively cheap. Don't curse the Devs, no-one can write perfect code. It was a rush to market, probably for financial reasons. It's just as frustrating as real life when you don't take the time to get a perfect shot. Lots of work ahead, but it's still a great game.			"

												Never ever ever ever buy this game. Literally riddled with bugs. It feels like prealpha...Honestly, it should have been a $15 game. $30 is extremely overpriced for an unfinished product.Have to close to desktop if you want to change anything.Can get trapped inside of structures built in multiplayer.Random crashes.Tons of animation glitches.PDA can drop you to 0fps if you have too many tracks in it.Got trapped between a rock and a tree and took ""fall"" damage and nearly died.I could probably go on but I don't really need to. Maybe I'll update later after some new fun bugs.DO NOT BUY IN CURRENT STATE.Update: 5th crash of the night. Pretty solid game.Update 2: I hear they patched some crash issues. Hopefully tonight will be better.2/23/17 Update 3: I haven't had a crash yet so it's nice to see that's much better. Some graphics glitches have been worked on. Still plenty I would like to see fixed. Lots of multiplayer bugs encountered.			"

												While I would reccomend this game for the hunting enthusiast, I would caution casual or fast-paced gamers from playing. This game requires A LOT of time and effort to get anything done. Movement is slow, the game is quite demanding on moderate systems, and kills are very few and far between. Just today, I have spent almost four full hours of playing the game and have only managed to kill one deer. Yes, the game looks amazing and is very realistic, but it is certianly not something that the ""average gamer"" would enjoy. Where other games have long hours of grinding, where you're at least doing SOMETHING, this game has you walking (at an extremely slow pace to keep the animals from getting scared off) for hours on end with little-to-no signs of life for most of that time.While I commend the developers for making a challenging and realistic game, I would advise them to put options into the game to increase the spawn rate of animals in single player worlds and on multiplayer servers. To spend so much time in the game and get little out of it is not something that people enjoy. The game isn't difficult, it just discourages people playing it because of how little actually happens in the game.			"

												Would be a great game if it said ""alpha"" release. This game isn't even close to beta. It is riddled with bugs that will annoy you constantly. If you are willing to pay $30 to test a game for them, then go ahead. Otherwise wait till they fix the MASSIVE amount of bugs and it goes on sale. Then, and only then, will it be worth it.			"

I am deeply confused - what's this game supposed to be?Sandbox game? Hunting ""Simulation""? Arcade Hunter? Open World Adventure?First of all: Endless, purposeless tranquilityif you enjoy walking up a beautiful virtual hill for 15 minutes without any further purpose but to reach a viewing platform, then this game is totally for you and you should just ignore my review.Second: Oh my god, dem bugs. Others have mentioned it before, but this game is far from being ready for release. For early access the level of bugs and issues would have been acceptable, but still better to call it an open beta.The main problem I have with this, is that ExpansiveWorlds (Avalanche Studios) has a long-standing track record of releasing unfinished content and often never polishing it to perfection even way later. This is true for basically every update theHunter:classic received, but especially for theHunter:Primal - a game that was sold in some kind of beta-state (especially content-wise) and never made it any further.Third: Blimey, dem graphics!The game looks awesome! The vegetation, the scenery, the lighting, the animal models, the animations (well, besides the players hands, what the frog am I doing? Running in the praying mantis karate base pose?) - all looks terrific and stunning. The way you leave a trail of flattened grass behind is just cool. Ok, it looks like you're a Mafiosi that just dragged a concrete-cuffed rival to his favourite dumpster lake, but hey, it's still a cool effect. A shame that the graphics are the only outstanding part of this game. I am more willing to overlook less-than-perfect graphics than flawed game design or mechanics.Last but by no means least - the real review - what is this game meant to be and why did they get it all backwards?So you got theHunter:classic, a massive open-world hunting game with plenty of content and great game mechanics. It just suffers from a meanwhile rather dated graphic engine  (fair enough being already 8 years old) and a microtransaction-based business model that has met plenty of criticism. Yet the cash-cow seems still lactating, as they are still keeping the game alive.So what to do to lead theHunter into the future. Develop a successor and kill your cash flow of the old game? Much better to produce something slightly different that recruits new customers, fascinates your old clientèle and still doesn't stop them from spending on the old one. Much better idea indeed. If you're able to pull it off, that is.So why not make an open world hunting game like the hunter that still has a story line. Red Dead Redemption hunting themed, basically. Nice idea.But then why they got it all backwards? Why does the actual hunting feel like you're mowing down the imbecile cousins of some majestic animals you dreamt of hunting all your life? The actual hunting is no challenge at all, you just need to be in the right place, and the animals will be easy to harvest.The ""story line"" (in brackets, as I am not sure yet, there's any red line through the story - it might just be random bits) on the other hand is slow as a sloth. A couple of hours in and I haven't even proceeded much in the tutorial story line (it is supposed to be a tutorial, right?). All I did is wander lengthily through a beautiful landscape getting sidetracked by some dull hunting while trying to get to a lodge or view point or camp.I feel a good hunting game with a story line should be exactly the other way around: extensive, to some extend challenging hunting embedded in a faster paced, enthralling story line. That'd be an interesting cross-over game between an emersion-intense hunting game and a hunting-themed arcade/adventure game. This game is exactly the opposite. It got real dull real quick for me, and I am a sucker for a good hunting game.I'll probably wait for a follow-up of theHunter:classic. Or maybe even a similar product by a competent competitor that might be released in a rather finished state - one should be allowed to dream big.			"

												People are giving this game hate after 1 hour of playing. Do not listen to them. Yes there are bugs but what AAA title has not had bugs on launch day in the past 5 years. This is no AAA title granted but we as players of the old game have been funding this progression. If you left this game 3 years from now then played it again a lot of people would have opposite opinions to what thay have now. If you give this game time to evolve like thehunter classic then this will turn out to be a top notch game. The same is going to happen with this game. They have a base that they can now build on and improve with helpful feedback and make this game great over time.			"

												First game I have ever refunded.  Tracking Simulator 2017. I am a seasoned hunting game player, but this game needs some tweaks.  Spent over an hour tracking a deer I shot in the chest.  Went in a 1 mile circle crouching, going 1 mph upwind and then the tracks started overlapping.  Waste of time.  Deer should have died within 100 yards.  Has potential, but no thanks.			"

												Do not under any circumstances buy if you're on an Ultrawide Monitor.  I can't attest to the actual gameplay because it's pretty unplayable at 21:9 ratio.  I got the UI to show up totally by changing my resolution to a differant ratio but it looked terrible.  I can't attest to the gameplay for those on regular resolution monitors so I'd check other reviews for that.  I can say that in the first minute of being in the game other than it looking terrible I was stuck being prone until I found a fix for that.  Not really a good start.  This is a game I still plan on playing but definitely not right now.  I requested a refund as it's unplayable.			"

												Do not buy yet.  This is a beta game still.  Game runs great, no crashes, awesome graphics.  However, the reason I stopped playiing classic was the 220meter draw distance.  The new engine is suppose to draw farther, it does not.  You will get a mission early on to kill to fallow deer in some corn field.  When you look to the second field it is not rendered.  There are camp sites, rest areas, you will find and you cannot rest in them.  I assume we need a tent that is not in game yet.  WIth an up to date computer the game runs great, just paying $40 for a shell of a game is stupid.  I suppose they were out of money.			"

												Absolutely loving this game! I am not having any of the issues others have reported. I'm not having any backpack issues, store/storage issues, or not being able to escape out of menu issues. I do however have the issue of not being able to run the game in SLI yet. But that's not a deal breaker as it runs fine for me off of one GPU. Not 144hz fine but it's running at a steady 60fps fine, which isn't bad with G-sync turned on.As far as people complaining about not being able to escape from a menu, just click the map tab or any other tab to get out of settings and then hit Escape. Easy Peezy. Graphics are fantastic and the sound is pretty damn good as well. This game runs very nicely for the amount of detail in it. I am quite impressed. After reading so many negative reviews about bugs and such I was very skeptical going into this game. Well, maybe I'm just lucky. I have no idea, but I have been having a blast. No stuck animals yet either. Hell I tracked a bleading deer for about an hour and a half earlier. Would have been nice if it would have gotten stuck :)I would recommend this game for it's current price of $30. Oh and don't let my hours in game fool you. I have been playing quite a bit on my shared account as well.No graphical glitches on my end either.System specs for reference:i7-5820k @4.7Ghz2x Titan X SLI (Maxwell), can only use one card at the momentResolution: 2560x1440 @144hz32Gb 2400mhz RAMAMD systems may be the ones with most of the problems? I have no idea as I don't see specs in most of these reviews and I haven't tried playing this on one of my AMD GPU builds yet.			"

												This game is visually very beautiful. I forgot I was there to hunt for the first hour and just got lost in the woods. When It did get down to the tracking and shooting an animal the game really stands out, as did the classic. It felt intense as you stalked your pray through the bush, finally causght sight of it, lines up your shot and dropped in with a nice hit to the lungs. 10/10 would forget I was not just there to look at the pretty scenery again.

												This is an exceptional hunting experience. The graphics in this game are truly breathtaking and the animations of the animals is detailed. This comes at the cost of performance but it is well worth upgrading your machine just to experience this game on ultra the vistas are jaw dropping.Theres a couple of clipping issues with some rare holes in the mesh where you can see under the terrain at the water plane. I ran into choppy audio but I've got a feeling this is my processor stuggling to keep up. The game seems to be taking up above 90 percent of my processors resources and my graphics card only has 2 gig of vram. To enjoy ultra textures you will need at least a 4gig card but it's well worth it. One thing i did notice though is when i shone my torch at the animal it didn't spook. I don't know if this happens maybe the animal freezes up in shock from the light. Maybe have it realistically reacting to torchlight is a feature you can add.Recommended!			"

												Graphics are Great! Overall with little more then 4 hours in, I have not noticed any type of bugs nor issues with game play!     Multiplayer seems to be where the bugs are, most of my time is in singleplayer!    1- it is little bit of a grind since everything is a travel and things in the store are expensive which earning the currency takes some time!    2- This is a simulation game so it is not like shooting in an arcade even though there are moments it seems arcade like!     3-  It is seemingly better then what alot of reviews stated from my point as i am maxed out on everything with my system.   Some things can change and hopefully content will be added in future as more animals, areas so fourth! It is a grind and as you skill up your weapon and stalking/ambusher skills it will become better!    Here is an update at 19 hours logged!     -  As you skill up on your weapons and tracking skills, the game becomes more enjoyable. I have found very few bugs and nothing breaking the game or enough toi turn me away from it!      -  Unlocking outposts increases you vast area of where you can start from much faster and closer to different game!    -   Unlocking ""Need Zone"" rather bedding, feeding water, rest area greatly shows travel patterns and time frame to best hunt it!    - Callers are an all but must need to have some success!     - takes time to learn point of impact as for me still figuring out the bear claw lite!

The multiplayer is pretty good too, the large maps can let you have several friends and still be able to hunt by yourself. 8/10			"

												I am truly disappointed in this game so far. Looks so amazing yet the amount of bugs tells me they rushed to release. Not to mention the horrible gui. For gods sake get rid of that annoying beep while navigating the menu. Besides the game not being playable for me (buggy, not a system spec problem). While as visually appealing as it is. They have missed the mark. The entire experience is dulled by the Gui, and lack of customization. You start the game with no idea what to do. For me I was unable to see tracks at all until I installed on my other pc and then I was finally able to see the tracks glow. Then that quit working on that pc.  Sigh's after about 5hrs of gameplay I still have not found out how to buy weapons or change camo. Maybe part of this is because of my inability to play properly due to bugs. effects not working invincible animals etc.Or maybe just because the game has no proper gui and seems half done. If the dev's would read this then I would note that personally I love ""The Hunter Classic"" and have poored a large chunk of money into it.  So please, bring back ALL the things that made the original great...Things like the huntermate beeing used to track. An intuitive menu that allows for quick and easy access to all equiptment and customizations. All the amazing hunting types. Turkey, ducks, etc. With all that said, I think the reason I am so disappointed is because I feel very pationate about this game. I was hoping for at least what I was able to get from the original. Then after the failure of primal. I purchase a third installment and once again feel let down. Now at the game's current state I would not recommend this at all. Maybe a year down the road they may be able to get this working. Although so far they cant even get primal to save the game. So, yah for me you guys have close to $300 from me. I am am not likely to buy anything else unless I see some serious improvements in the direction of your games.			"

												This game is absolutely gorgeous. Everything about this game excited me from the first time I saw it. Coming from the original theHunter, this is a breath of fresh air. No subscriptions. No penalties for wrong caliber. This is really an open-world hunting experience that can be sort of mission based if you choose, or not. Pros: Graphics, Animals, Realism, Map, ""Noccys"" (Binoculars).Cons:Bugs, Glitchy Animal AI, No ""Back to Main Menu"" Option.I feel that at this price point, this game is a steal. 30$ may seem steep, but AAA titles like Madden and FIFA release the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game every year, riddled with microransactions and ways for them to make money... ON TOP OF A 60$ PRICE TAG. This game is worth the money, and with a few patches, it can definitely become a great game. Have patience: not only in the game hunting a bear, but with the development team on patching bugs.			"

												The game is a huge upgrade from the original ""theHunter"". They turned the game from a pseudo pay-to-win simulator into a grinding game that makes you want to keep playing. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the general gameplay got oh so very polished.On a side note there are still quite a few bugs here and there, while not gamebreaking they are still a pain and will hopefully be fixed as soon as possible.All in all for a 30€ game, if you are a fan of hunting, I would definitely recommend this gem.

												Great Game!I don't think I to date have ever played a game with a more visually appealing and realistic representation of the great outdoors!In-fact I am frequently placed in something of an environmental ""uncanny valley"" as part of me actually feels like the wind should be hitting my face, and the smell of the forest should be filling my nostrils.It's going through a lot of growing pains which I feel confident the developers will resolve in time, but despite its buggy state will still gladly recommend this game, as it provides a hunting experience and atmosphere like none other in a game!

												Absolutely loving this game! I am not having any of the issues others have reported. I'm not having any backpack issues, store/storage issues, or not being able to escape out of menu issues. I do however have the issue of not being able to run the game in SLI yet. But that's not a deal breaker as it runs fine for me off of one GPU. Not 144hz fine but it's running at a steady 60fps fine, which isn't bad with G-sync turned on.As far as people complaining about not being able to escape from a menu, just click the map tab or any other tab to get out of settings and then hit Escape. Easy Peezy. Graphics are fantastic and the sound is pretty damn good as well. This game runs very nicely for the amount of detail in it. I am quite impressed. After reading so many negative reviews about bugs and such I was very skeptical going into this game. Well, maybe I'm just lucky. I have no idea, but I have been having a blast. No stuck animals yet either. Hell I tracked a bleading deer for about an hour and a half earlier. Would have been nice if it would have gotten stuck :)I would recommend this game for it's current price of $30. Oh and don't let my hours in game fool you. I have been playing quite a bit on my shared account as well.No graphical glitches on my end either.System specs for reference:i7-5820k @4.7Ghz2x Titan X SLI (Maxwell), can only use one card at the momentResolution: 2560x1440 @144hz32Gb 2400mhz RAMAMD systems may be the ones with most of the problems? I have no idea as I don't see specs in most of these reviews and I haven't tried playing this on one of my AMD GPU builds yet.			"

												After 3 hours of playing i can say its a really great hunting game Are there bugs? yes most games out there have some bugs but the are fixing it ok :)  and if you shose not to buy because of that you gonna lose somting great when it comes to hunting game.Open world and scenery is beautiful i say just wow i run on ultra and high play around and find your sweet spot in the settings and give this game a chans. and remeber this is not thehunter classic yes the share some simular key features between them but this is a new game and veteran Classic players gonna feel at home :) Pros:  Open worldGorgeous graphicsGood tutorial and hint for new huntersNo licenses for animals, No pay to play for those that dont like thatand yes you can jump now i did missing that in classicProgression system is really nice with the xp and money and weapon skill thats how you become good in the game.You can run around for hours and just look with out hunting if so, and more Cons:  yes there are some bugs but the are fixing it thats great :)  tracking in game is  confusing first time you try it out but you learn how it works. small graphic errors/lag only have 1 so far but there are not much i can say that are bad about this game yes the are ppl that have some crash and bugs and erros but let them work even GTA 5 did have bugs from start those that give a bad review because of that thats worng in my opinion.

												I see alot mixed comments about this game. Has some bugs yes but not to bad, just launched so not to surpised. Graphics/Map. 12/10. The map is perfect. Allthough the placed deer stands and such, could have been placed better. Animals act pretty good. There is room for improvment, example. you fire of couple rounds the other animals are likely to come back after some time. Not likely in real life. The game needs more stuff added yes, Placable deer stands a big need! more scents, gun, Season added etc. For the money it is well wourth it. And with them having alot of stuff in there previous game free to play. I'm sure they will add plenty later on when they get the bugs out. Far as performance No issues at all runing the game. I am runing a 1080 Strix though Lower older card may have issue unsure. Been along time since I saw a huntting game wourth my time like 13 years long or longer. I gave it a shoot, And glad I did. I look forward to seeing how the expand to this game, The map just WoW all I can say! Best map ive seen in a game since I can remeber. I hihjly recomending Supporting this game. I'm not a big hunter fan And I love it. There things that could be improved like trophy seeing or bragging rights if you will. But for the money well wourth it..			"

												Mixed....since i dont think anyone wants to read an entire essay on this- i will make it quick.Pros:•Very nice graphics•One time purchase•Variety of maps•Variety of game to hunt•Variety of weapons to hunt with•Some sort of misson ""plot"" (didnt explore that fully yet)•Multiplayer•Has some nice effects (eg leaving a trail in the grass you walk)•You can basiclly hunt when, where and what you want•Not very un-realistic•...Cons:-Contains many bugs-Animal AI is not too great (at least what ive seen)-Animal sound are lacking of significance-No deployable hunting towers/stands-No default hunting towers/stands (please dont argue with those ""sheds"" which can be built up.....)-No truRACS system (racks of animals varie too little...theHunter : cassic does not face this problem)-Lack of animal significance (animals of the same species do not vary in enough graphical features)-The UI and settings can be somewhat annoying-Not enogh has been done since the first beta (yes i was part of that)-Animals sometimes survive as if they were invincible-Huge racks are nothing special...(in the hunter : classic, a big rack was very rare hence it was exiting to find one. Here, all deer and so have monster racks making those boring...)So yes, it has its flaws...quite many to be exact. But its only released since a day and we must give it a chance to develop a bit. Its recieving tons of input with bugs and suggestions, lets hope they are head of by the developers. Its quite fun to play and is a game with much potentiol.*adding on this as time goes by....			"

												They got me again.  Just to give you an idea of my backgrond in this game/studio I've been a paying member of TheHunter since 2011, I'm a bit of a fanboy of that game and I've bought about every weapon, clothing, equipment items that's in the store and spend like 80,000 EM$ or so. I was sort of disapointed when I heard the primal and call of the wild were projects just because I sort of feel like they are slow to implent bug fixes and requested changes but quick to release reskins to bring in more cash and these projects I'm sure will pull resources away from thehunter.When Primal was released perhaps a bit early it was full of bugs and I never felt like it really took off. I think maybe like me a bunch of people purchased it early to get the free shotgun in TheHunter and then tried playing it once or twice and relized it was too much of a headache to play. I can't imagine I have much more than a few hours played most of which I was tabbed to youtube trying to figure out what the point was or how to work around bugs. This game feels alot like the Primal release I mean my first 30 seconds in game I found a menu location that you can't exit and locked my in an endless loop I have to task manager kill the program to get out of. I have since found a work around but 30 seconds in to a released game I shouldn't be hitting stupid bugs like that. Next I releize the game is trying to fake out full screen by displaying widescreen and cutting off the edges mean I have no visability to the gps without pulling up a map, my ammo is half cut off along with my waypoints and direction heading. Haven't found a fix to this yet. Running around the game feels clunky as hell when it rains or you get to the top of a hill,  not  big concerns because I have all the settings to ultra and I'm not sure I have the queipment to run at the res but the FPS drop in certain situations is insanse. Many of the animals I've shot were stuck in rocks which is pretty lame. The game doesn't really flow but granted I'm only an hour in. When I can get my tracker on the screen it's completly transparent and useless. In some areas the animals seem to call nonstop for some reason. Animals seem to appear out of no where and don't seem to be easily spooked. So far I've only seen male animals so I'm not sure if you'll see heards of females like in TheHunter. Overall I'm thinking you should pass on this game for the time being. Its to much of a headache to play and who want's to play a game like that. It's pretty much primal all over again. Granted I will say if this was a prerelease game I might have recommended it as one to watch when it's launched but to say this is a store ready release is bull. I really hope this doesn't become like Primal where everyone is so turned off by the horrible launch they never try it again and it dies. "

												I have been waiting for a good hunting game for some time and since i am an old The Hunter player i was hyped about them making a Pay to play game, buy it once then have fun hunting.Right now i can not recommend this product, it feels like an early access game. There is alot of bugs, some tiny some big.The game requires you to be online on steam even though you play singleplayer.There are no bulletwounds on the animals, and the impact your bullets are making are inferior to the original hunter game.I hope to change this review at a later date, but right now hold on to your money until the patched it a bit.

												I played TheHunter classic and really enjoyed it. What draws me to these games the fact I can play to relax in game with decent graphics and an amazing environment. I am happy that it is now a one time purchase and I feel it has improved upon TheHunter Classic.         The dev team seem to update the game regularly with big updates every time. I am running SLI 980TI at 1440k and I am getting 60+ fps and the game is very stable for me.

												Beautiful and immersive environment. Don't have to pay for everything in-game. I've only played a few hours but I've really enjoyed it. At times I feel like it's too easy to get an animal, at other times I feel like it's too hard, and sometimes I feel like it's just right, which, as someone who hunts, is actually pretty realistic. I've only encountered one bug which was my items stopped working but I just had to go into the menu and switch items from there once and then everything worked fine again. Reading some of the negative reviews, there are aspects that seem reasonable to criticize so I hope the devs will continue working on and improving this game. Even as is though, at least as I've experienced it, I think it's a fun game that I feel comfortable recommending. A big issue for me, is that this game needs to improve on it's small game selection. I really hope they make the squirrels and rabbits huntable. As of now you can shoot them, they'll die, but then you can't harvest them. Bird hunting(pheasant, quail, dove, etc.) would be a great addition as well, especially if it gave using hunting dogs, pointers or retrievers, as an option. And this seems less likely, but it would be really neat if they also added the ability to hunt things like squirrels, rabbits, bears, etc. with hounds, though I'm not sure how well some of those would translate to the game. I imagine if they do add any of this it will be DLC rather than free, which is kind of disappointing, but I'm sure I'll end up buying it if it's reasonably priced.In short: Recommended. I've enjoyed the gameplay and evnironment and haven't really had crash or bug issues. Some of the negative reviews make some good points though and I hope the devs continue to improve the game. Needs more small game options.			"

												This has got to be one of the best, most annoying games I've played in recent years. The hunting experience is fantastic and the gameplay is a joy, however the constant 'quality of life' issues just make it a hassle to play.The maps are huge and detailed however movement speed is glacial and there are no vehicles. Fast travel is limited to a handful of spaced out locations that must be unlocked by spending hours walking to them.Huge amounts of grinding are required to unlocked better equipment, for some bizarre reason the developer has felt the need to restrict players as to their style of play, perhaps to add longevity, but I would have appreciated the option to just unlock everything, after all, I am the player and it is my game.There are some bizarre design choices, like the 'consecutive harvest' feature. In short, if you want to get high scores for your harvests you need to rack up multiple harvests beforehand for no apparent reason.The UI is awkward and unclear especially re movement speeds and noise as well as visibility (apparently using a controller is the best way to play, unacceptable for a PC game).Bugs are frequent, although the developers are working hard to iron them out, however as plenty of other reviewers have stated, the game should not have been released in the state that it is (or at least, for the price that it is).There is no steam workshop/mod support that I can see. This would be by far the easiest way to start fixing bugs and letting players customise their experience, and is the lifeblood of PC gaming imho that adds years to the longevity of any game.I've really enjoyed the hours I've put in so far, but I'm going to take a break until the game becomes a bit more accessible, otherwise I fear I will just grow to resent it.I would certainly recommend the game, but perhaps err on the side of caution and wait for a sale or additional patches to come out.

												I rarely do reviews, but I figured this game with it's current mitigated score could use a straight to the point review, I hope this helps you make a decision.First off a little about me, I'm no real life hunter and this is my first hunting game. I had been interested by the different games that existed before this one, but the general consensus seemed to be that they were all rip-offs, trying to squeeze the players out of their RL money with endless micro transactions and DLC's, etc.This game is gorgeous, they really nailed the outdoors feeling really well. I don't think I can name a game that has more beautiful trees/forests, it looks fantastic and the performance is also very good. I'm running it at high details (not ultra) and it's absolutely amazing and runs smooth on my mid-level gaming laptop (GTX970M, 16 gigs ram, i7 cpu).There are bugs though... LOTS of bugs, but so far, none are game-breaking. Animals sometimes get stuck in trees and rocks... There are bunnies or whatever that do a stupid amount of noise that doesn't sound natural. You can't walk up a 30% incline (approx). Your walking and run speed is affected by your FPS (this is most noticeable in multiplayer, reducing image quality will make you run faster). I could go on, the game kind of feels like it should be a beta or early release, they definitely still had a lot of ironing out to do before calling it gold IMHO, but despite all this, it's still an amazing game.So far, I'm getting my money's worth, there is no doubt, it's a unique experience, I really enjoy it.

												This will be a great game once all the bugs are ironed out. Currently its no further than beta stage. In some areas you can play for a while but in others there are completely game breaking bugs. This really should have come out as an early access product for 6 months before full release but it seems the publishers coul;dnt wait, as the game has only been out a month, still does not have simple options like 'Exit to main menu' (Currently you have to entirely quit the game and restart to switch between single and multiplayer) and they have already announced a console version.I wish I had waited a few months and not been blinded by the marketing trailers. Will reassess in 6 months after a lot more patches.			"

												Love this game. Quick to load,easy to play and damn hard to get a good kill with noobie gear. Lots of map space, POI's story line and quests. Lots of excitement every now and then. Gameply hunting wise is not linear, so you have no idea how long a low bloodloss  trail will last. You can run for ages after an animal and never get to it or it may just fall few 100m from the shot. Love watching Youtube clips on hunts and their comments / tactics. The main thing is its fun! Not a high stress game. Take advantage of bugs  where animals get sutck, guns and XP is not cheap. You pay for building of hunting lookouts. Ammo is not cheap! Few minor tweaks and it will be perfect. NOTHING beats the view and the fact that you can spot animals miles away! Sound is excellent but need few close-up tweaks.This is MY review, and I think this game is AWESOME! "

												How can you release a game this broken after having made the same game (in essence) twice already?https://clips.twitch.tv/DepressedBrightDiscKappaRossIt looks great, has great atmosphere but it has so many bugs in it I should be talking in Starship Troopers quotes.For €30 on a 'released' game I feel somewhat cheated out of my money. If they had put it on Early Access status, I would have been lenient. But they chose to put it on released, their choice. In my book that still means it should be playable or at least give the experience they advertise. Unfortunately my experience did not come near the one they advertise.Yes they put a few patches out, but they didn't even scratch the surface. I'll give the devs a chance, but they need to either start communicating more or putting out patches that actually fix things. Too bad they had a beta.. guess that first wave got swarmed since boy oh boy they got a lot of them left ...Don't get me wrong, it's a great walking simulator. Just not a hunting sim.Too much arcade things going on still... if you have seen a few deer, you will have seen pretty much all of them. Antlers all look the same, you cannot zero your gun to distances other than what they implemented in a skill(!) No choose grainload, ""Consecutive Harvest"", ... it's like a better Cabela game at this point... but that is really it.			"

												Okay. First of all, really good game, I just bought and donwloaded it a few days ago and I've already logged over ten hours. Second, this game is a tad bit broken. It has crashed several times on me and I am worried that I won't be able to play this anymore if this continues. I'll say it again, this game is really good. So just fix the crashing problem, please.			"

												If you plan on using mouse/keyboard don't get this game in its current state. If you use a controller you'll have a much better experience. Alot of the rage experienced is form mouse/keyboard users and I am one of those users. Luckily I can use my xbox controller on my computer when needed cuz the regular UI hates keyboard mouse. Besides that for gameplay itself its not too bad. there are some bugs, like I've seen animals stuck in terrain but it makes it an easy kill lol. Doesn't happen often but it does happen. A lot of things in the game have no tooltips or any explanation so sure you can tell me that I received no ""integrity bonus"" for a kill but without telling me what that is what am I supposed to do with that information?  Also avoid using special ironsights, they are auto unequipped anytime you switch out from holding the weapon which is all the time.  Game is slowly getting patches and it still fun, you can loose yourself tracking animals for ages but this game isn't meant to be a FPS where you lock and load, run into the forest and spray lead across a field and spend the next hour harvesting bodies. The is a patience game, a low key game. And it does that well. I can't wait for subsequent patches as it will make this game so much better. My only concern is if they release pay content before fixing the issues and interface.			"

												Awesome buy for $30 as is. Anyone that's ever done any actual hunting knows this is the best hunting game to date. Finally something better than Deer Hunter 2005 that isn't P2W. I'm hoping to see them implement a dynamic rack system, more animal types and models, and more weapons. But considering it's priced at $30 as a ""complete"" game, I'm not expecting much. Which is a shame, because a little more polish and this game could have sold for $50-$60 easily.			"

												Update: It's now been revealed this is in fact a console port, an unfinished buggy console port sold at full price in a beta condition.This is the worst gaming experience I have had in over 20 years of gaming and this is the first game I have deleted permanently from my steam accounts, I am done with this game.Kudos to those who allow themselves to be treated this way, I am not one of them.The forums are run by fanboys who delete and ban people for the slightest criticism of their precious little game, I was unaware people this weak minded existed.So go ♥♥♥♥ yourself AlfTupper, should our paths ever cross in real life the outcome will be very very different of that I can assure you.It beggars belief how this game was released as ""game ready"", little has been fixed with the patching to date and the unfinished state of this game is apparent every time you try and play, each patch brings with it new bugs to add to the ever growing Big Bug Report Thread, If you're happy to spend £30 to join a Beta program then buy it.This game delivers graphically but is left wanting in all other departments, I suggest you read the current bugs/unfinished features list before buying.http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/5/133258092257803156/Flawed AI, stuck animals, disappearing animals, broken caller animations, broken animal animations, missing animal animations, broken tracking, the sound balance and positioning is crude and undeveloped, The UI is an abomination of design and navigation etc, the list is endless and each subsequent patch brings more and more bugs to the game.Deathly silence in the forums from the Devs other than a few token ""marketing"" style posts, they are happy to sit back and watch the forum fall apart whilst spending most of their time on the review section posting ""damage limitation"" responses to negative reviews. 1000's of questions are asked but not a single one is addressed by the devs, the ""community"" is left to argue amongst itself.The forum moderators are hand picked from the original beta testing team so it's pretty clear where their loyalties lie, the forums are bias to the extreme, anyone criticising the game or it's developers are jumped on by the die hard fan base with calls of ""cryer"" ""whiner"" or ""your computers a potato"" resulting in flaming and threads being (conveniently) locked and posts being (conveniently) deleted.I can't for one second recommend anybody purchase this game in it's current state, yes the game looks good, yes it draws you in and immerses you into the environment, then it proceeds to slowly reveal flaw upon immersion breaking flaw to ruin the experience, If your gaming requirements are slightly above average you are in for a frustrating experience, if you like to run around a pretty environment oblivious of the bugs, shooting anything that moves, ""high fiving"" every kill and taking screenshots you will love it.Until I see active participation in the forums by the devs, I'm considering it a waste of time and energy suggestion improvements, these guys have their roadmap and everybody else is well and truly on it, just like their previous titles, do your research on Avalanche Studios and Expansive Worlds, put the hype aside and take a look at their track record with theHunter Classic, and Primal, these guys have a history of not finishing things.It's too early to give a detailed review because the game isn't yet ""game ready"".

												Ok I have been Playing for only 3 hours, and already I can tell you this game is awesome.  If you love hunting you will enjoy this game. As far as all these people talking about all these glitches I have no clue what they are talking about. I have tried and tried to cause these glitches. The only one I have found is the scope for second shot and the scope is back filling your screen before you could steady a second running shot anyway.  The menu works perfect and if you read it and look through it then you will have no issues getting around in this game. And as for not being able to get animals ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!!!! I have over 10 animals tracked killed and harvested in 3 hours!!!! 3 HOURS! If you can't get an animal did you ever think maybe you aren't doing it correct???? Also as for calls they work almost to well, hear an animal call and call back that they comes straight to you np even on a trot many times. I have a Fox kill many Roe and Fallow deer and also a blacktail from the other hunting area. have not had any animals just disappear on me. But did lose one cause I lost the tracks which is on me not the game glitching. Also remember in hunter classic if you were near the edge of the map and your tracked animal left the map all tracks went away.  I can say this game looks great and works great, Glitches are pretty unnoticeable. Again I spend about 30 min. of my 3 hours trying to make it glitch and to find glitches.  Enjoy the game and dismiss the haters.			"

												Very pretty game, intense hunting sequences broken up by a beautiful walking simulator. Unfortunately, it's totally broken. Purchased weapons don't show up in inventory, and I shuffled inventory on my hotbar and the game ate my roe deer caller for my troubles. The store indicates that it's ""owned"", but it's nowhere to be found in my inventory and can't be equipped. Same with the .223 rifle and jackrabbit caller I've purchased. Plus, the sound is buggy as hell. This one needs significant work before I can recommend it, but I really really hope they get it together because 90% of an awesome game is already there.			"

												Although visuals are stunning and the sounds are really good, this game has a lot of problemsGame has a ton of bugs, especially in multiplayer. For example, 2 people can't stand together in a watchtower, as they both die pretty much instantly. The animals ""warning calls"" seem really random, sometimes triggering when standing completely still with no visibility.My friend could hear my deer caller from 2km away, and it sounded like it was 1m away. This got really annoying.To make matters worse, we found out my friend couldn't see a certain deer i wanted him to kill, not even after i killed it and showed him where the body was. He didn't see any deers for 1 hour before this which makes be believe it's because he COULDNT see them.Sadly i played for 4 hours, so i guess i won't be eligible for a refund.			"

												Dear Devs and All,  this is an engaging game.  The landscape, weather and environment are really very nice indeed.  It is however currently let down by several issues which affect gameplay and overall enjoyment which SHOULD NOT be in this post beta release.  Namely: you change the music settings to zero and yet it still plays loud music(!)  The interface is very ropey, more often than not clicking or pressing ''escape' on the keyboard to try and leave the interface (settings for example) does nothing >.< grrr.  Deer, indeed herds of deer, caught up running around in circles or up against the landscape ad infinitum.  Walking/squatting or kitten crawling seems to make little change to noise or animals awareness of you.  Gear is so expensive. But lastly the most annoying thing is, it takes ages, absolutely ages to get from one area to another... As has already been suggested - a tent or 'camp for the night' feature would make this all much more tolerable.Cheers!			"

												First of all, nice game.While there are small bugs, like callers not working/water reflects looking awful/crappy map, most of the game is beautiful (I'm not even playing ultra) with a great atmosphere, and doesn't consume your GPU like a Witcher or GTA V.Of course you won't get to shoot at roes or deers as you can shoot pigeons at home. Patience is key in this game.For example I hunted down a deer I shot in the flesh (non-vital shot), I had to hunt him running away for 2 hours.I won't point out every good/bad point of the game ,others already did it.All I have to say is if you have time to spare playing a nicely developed game and you like hunting patiently your preys, I, from my 6 hours experience, recommend you buying this game.

However, if you are a long time vet of the original TheHunter game, hunt for real or like the idea of relaxing pace hunting games then you may like it. Getting tired of seeing these people complain about stuff that has nothing to do with the game, but how they play it. I was one of the lucky few to play the orginal before release and continued to play it almost 10 years later. Very challenging and realistic. There are some bugs, but after hours I have yet to experience the sheer horror that some of the reviewers ""say"" they have experienced. The UI is a little wonky, and Ultra graphics are not optimized. You will have to knock a couple of settings from Ultra to High, but it is nothing too bad. Feels very similar to the original, but does have some improvements as well. Though some of the things I am personally not a fan of, but I won't fault the game for that. I will say this. I do have top of the line hardware. I cannot give an opinion on what the game plays like on a low end system. Though I would imagine your experience may not be the same.			"

												Review of the game as it is on 2017 March 12.First day when I bought it , it was amazing, played 7 hours straight , no crashes, encountered only one bug (animal stuck on trees). Was super hyped to play it more. The next day I played few hours and game started crashing. It wasn't too bad as I crashed few hours apart. The third day I couldn't play. Crashed almost instantly or after maximum of 10 minutes gameplay. I don't know if it's my computer problem or the game but as I played first day without any problems I hope it's the game and developers will fix it because I really love the game. Because of this it really sucks I can't play the game I payed 30€. Buy it with caution.			"

												This is a beautiful game with lots of potential. I can't recommend a purchase, however, until the COTW_F crash is sorted out. After about 2 hours of play I'm no longer able to launch the game at all. It crashes before I even see a splash screen. There are numerous other ankle-biting bugs which are annoying, but crashing before it loads is a show-stopper. I'll happily change my review IF this problem is corrected with a hot patch within the next 72 hours. My review will stand otherwise because producers and developers should be held accountable for the state of their product at official launch. If this were early access I'd be more lenient.			"

												It just doesn't make sense to have an amazing looking game crash, and have this bad of a menu system. Here is the break down:The game is beautiful graphics wise when you crank it up to Ultra everything but when there are so many bugs it becomes unplayable.There is only one player profile across the board. What you do online is the same as if you play solo mode. (example: I dropped a gun online, it was gone in single player as well. (I create a New Game, it just resets my spawn point of my other game but I have same items skills etc...)The Menus are just a developers nightmear. They never work and 50% of the game you have to move in and out of the menus to change guns, ammo etc... I found myself using my arrow keys and enter key to navigate, and that only works like 70% of the time, but a little better then clicking with a mouse. MENU SYSTEM MUST BE WORKED ON before you buy!There is no leaving a game! Thats right, you can't leave a single player game or a online player game and go directly back to the main menu... You Exit to desktop every time! So if i am playing single player, and my firend gets online and is like join my game... I have to exit the entire game to re-launch it then go to multi player. Multiplayer is a bit buggy, There lag system is broken. Peer to Peer style play. I was just about to bag a nice buck and bam the host left the game, Here is the kicker, The entire game shuts down, Not a crash it ♥♥♥♥ing shuts down?!?! No ♥♥♥♥s where given!Deer and animals get stuck in rocks and♥♥♥♥♥♥all the time.Single player is way to easy to play, every second there is a sound from an animal or a trailMutliplayer is much more..... its a bit real, animals are harder to find and you need your actual skills to find♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not trying to bash this game its just not finnished, its more of a beta then a final game. Don't get me wrong, the game has its ups which would be graphics, I've never seen a deer hunter game look so great in my life. Till the game gets patched with the bugs and suggestions I made above... Its a hard hard pass.			"

												I wish I could give a neutral review. I really wanted a open world hunting game ever since I played one when I was a little kid. Cabela's never did it in recent years so when I saw this I thought ♥♥♥♥ yeah. The only problem was it was by the people who developed thehunter. So I sucked it up watched a couple videos and thought cool little arcadie but I'll still play it.The bugs are astronomical as to what other people have said and to my own experience. - Can't close the menu with escape in certain menus- You can't see waypoints you've set- When you open the map it takes your fov of the map to the outskirts of where you're hunting so you have to scroll back in.  - You can lay prone, crouch or stand up and have deer walk right up to you with nothing happening adding a nice bonus to killing a animal. - I'm pretty sure deer are set to a certain path I scared a couple off once and they kept running away from where my character was then running back to my character.  - If there was melee in this game I'm sure people would prone up to deers and kill them John Rambo style. - The game froze in the menu once for me and I had to turn my computer off to close the game.I wanna keep going but I'll just not recommend this game as it is right now and go to work. I'm going to keep this game also and continue to play it as I liked the idea of this game so far and have been looking for one of these for a while.Edit: New bugs I've found- I haven't been able to replicate it more than 3 or 4 times but after holstering your weapon and switching to the gps after running for a while makes the screen of the gps disappear- When you go to the store to buy things. The items you have unlocked scroll with the menu when you're looking through the store making it difficult to know what items you are trying to buy.Remember my downvote is centered towards *Do you recommend this game?* If someone really wanted a open world hunting game this is the game to get. The bugs aren't terrible enough to stop me from playing.			"

												Update: It's now been revealed this is in fact a console port, an unfinished buggy console port sold at full price in a beta condition.This is the worst gaming experience I have had in over 20 years of gaming and this is the first game I have deleted permanently from my steam accounts, I am done with this game.Kudos to those who allow themselves to be treated this way, I am not one of them.The forums are run by fanboys who delete and ban people for the slightest criticism of their precious little game, I was unaware people this weak minded existed.So go ♥♥♥♥ yourself AlfTupper, should our paths ever cross in real life the outcome will be very very different of that I can assure you.It beggars belief how this game was released as ""game ready"", little has been fixed with the patching to date and the unfinished state of this game is apparent every time you try and play, each patch brings with it new bugs to add to the ever growing Big Bug Report Thread, If you're happy to spend £30 to join a Beta program then buy it.This game delivers graphically but is left wanting in all other departments, I suggest you read the current bugs/unfinished features list before buying.http://steamcommunity.com/app/518790/discussions/5/133258092257803156/Flawed AI, stuck animals, disappearing animals, broken caller animations, broken animal animations, missing animal animations, broken tracking, the sound balance and positioning is crude and undeveloped, The UI is an abomination of design and navigation etc, the list is endless and each subsequent patch brings more and more bugs to the game.Deathly silence in the forums from the Devs other than a few token ""marketing"" style posts, they are happy to sit back and watch the forum fall apart whilst spending most of their time on the review section posting ""damage limitation"" responses to negative reviews. 1000's of questions are asked but not a single one is addressed by the devs, the ""community"" is left to argue amongst itself.The forum moderators are hand picked from the original beta testing team so it's pretty clear where their loyalties lie, the forums are bias to the extreme, anyone criticising the game or it's developers are jumped on by the die hard fan base with calls of ""cryer"" ""whiner"" or ""your computers a potato"" resulting in flaming and threads being (conveniently) locked and posts being (conveniently) deleted.I can't for one second recommend anybody purchase this game in it's current state, yes the game looks good, yes it draws you in and immerses you into the environment, then it proceeds to slowly reveal flaw upon immersion breaking flaw to ruin the experience, If your gaming requirements are slightly above average you are in for a frustrating experience, if you like to run around a pretty environment oblivious of the bugs, shooting anything that moves, ""high fiving"" every kill and taking screenshots you will love it.Until I see active participation in the forums by the devs, I'm considering it a waste of time and energy suggestion improvements, these guys have their roadmap and everybody else is well and truly on it, just like their previous titles, do your research on Avalanche Studios and Expansive Worlds, put the hype aside and take a look at their track record with theHunter Classic, and Primal, these guys have a history of not finishing things.It's too early to give a detailed review because the game isn't yet ""game ready"".

												Game is absolutely amazing and runs perfect for its high end graphics, yes there is some small bugs and quality of life things that can be better, but nothing to take away from this amazing experience as you wait for them to patch it.I play this everyday and attempt multiplayer with my brother where we have intense moments hunting together and tracking and cornering or pushing animals into each other and its the best experience we had to share it together!!!, then of course you crash when aiming  or about to loot your kill, but those things will be fixed soon.Please try the game or wait for a solid patch update, but you definitely want to try this title out if you want to escape reality and dive into one of the most beautiful worlds built for hunting with very smart AI!!

												Only played a couple hours so far , got 2 kills , very realistic game , gorgeous views , it's one of those games like GTA 5 where you don't have to do any missions , just sit and look at how beautiful the game is , the sounds and all . The day i seen this game , the very next d ay i purchased it !the map seems to be HUGE because i only been exploring a small portion thus far and it already seems endless .graphics - 5 / 5 Sound is 4 / 5  (because sometimes i do the Doe or buck sound and no sound is coming out , even repeatidly pressing the Doe call or the Buck call buth quite often make no sound i would say 8 out of 10 times i use them that this happens . Fun Factor - Definitely a slow game , but it's very enjoyable , if you like being a sniper in FPS games and waiting and spotting people , this game is suited for you as i love being a sniper in FPS games.This game is best suited for players who are doctors , because they have the most patience .

												--> THIS IS A STALKING SIM <-- Shooting animals is a minor part of the game.The entire experience is about moving slow, finding tracks, following the animal, and then setting up to take the shot. Sometimes you have to plan out a hunt. The point I'm trying to get at is, this is not CoD with animal enemies. This is a slow paced game that requires patience.			"

												It's a 50%/50 in my opinion Good  for spending time due to the type of game. Good graphic, but could be so much more. Lacks proper gamification or simulation. I would recommend it if they add some more gameplay/animation and point system/ranking. Currently It is fun to hunt, but feels pointless. Just run untill you hear an enemie, sneak towards it and kill. Then kill 20 more and get a gun, rince and repeate. Max animal draw distance just hurts a game with so awesome landscape and grahics. Some bugs, but that is being sorted out activly. Please dev's, Give it a major gamification update and it's a gold mine and perhpas bullet time or something. If it was early acces I would recommend it, but atm I am afraid just bugfixes and DLC stuff is on the horizon, neither changing the core issues.			"

												Good game but I'd wait for several bug patches before purchasing. There are far too many ""super animals"" here. Just tired of getting a ""vital hit"" on an animal, finding huge pools of blood everywhere, but the animal NEVER drops below 50% life and has the stamina of a marathon runner so I spend HOURS chasing and tracking it in circles around some lake. Can never catch it no matter what I try, and never see it again to take a second shot on it. Too many hours wasted for no pay-off. Go to the free to play version and play that while you wait.			"

												Though I am not a very good hunter  I still played  the Hunter a fashionable number of hours and enjoyed it very much, even though it had some quirks  and features like micro sales which I find unpalatable but still  it is lush and immensely enjoyable . So when I saw Hunter cotw I thought it would be  a very nice game to buy  and it was at first . I started a new hunter  and learned the rules through the lush wood of Hirshfelden  and grew quite fond of it  then I discovered  problems and bugs such as the animal falling  when hit ,  then starting up  again which prevented me  from  total immersion  animals caught in the textures and keeping running  through, stationarily  but ok  every games has its quirk and I should not complain about it  but still ... This game has a great potential and  is far from reaching it  and Sadly it is embedded in its structure. You have no save... let me explain  You have 2 hunting  territories Leyton lake and Hirshfelden  and you can't  use the same build  of character in the other reservation  worse than that. You'll have to start again in the previous one if you start a new game I was utterly dismayed  when I discovered it . When you  launch a game if you  level up through it  you usually know that your character is going to  be with you even if you start a new one or in the case of The hunter  you don’t lose anything when you start another game. I hope that  I made my point and  would like expensive world to add this particular feature (which is a save mechanism) in order to make the game really enjoyable  and longer lasting. Please consider what I said before buying it It is not a bad game of itself but it is  quite limited Have a good gaming and see you for my next review.			"

												I've held off from writing a review for this game until most of the bugs have been fixed, there are still a few bugs but none are gamebreaking in my opinion.The game is really beautiful, the areas are rendered wonderfully well. It also runs great, even on minimum spec systems, with plenty of options to be tweaked in the graphic settings.If you own a decent spec system (my system is a haswell i5 @ 3.8ghz and a gtx 1080) you can maximise the graphics and even run in enhanced resolution (dsr). I run this game at 1600p and it's stunning and maintains between 45 and 55 fps :)The hunting is fun and rewarding. You start off with a basic .243 rifle and basic ammo. As you harvest animals you get a monetary reward, xp and a score towards your weapon class.As you level your weapon class this enables new ammunition and weapon types to be unlocked, which are paid for by your in game cash.Xp goes towards levelling your character. For each level, up to about level 36, you get either a skill point, or perk point to spend.Skill points are spent towards things like tracking and spotting, using scents etc.Perk points are spent in your weapon trees, to improve things like breath control.All these ""upgrades"" to your character make perfect sense, after all the more you use a rifle the better you'll get with the weapon.There are four trees for your perk points, a tree for each weapon type.Rifles, Bows, Handguns and Shotguns.This enables you to customise your spec to whatever you get the most enjoyment from using. For me it's bows!The actual hunting is great fun, the tracking system works really well and is better (imho) than in classic hunter.There are two areas to hunt in this game and they are huge with more areas promised as dlc.This game is well worth buying and is gradually getting better, as bugs are ironed out.9/10 for me :)			"

												Loving the game so far. I have quite a few hours in the original ""theHunter"" and this game will blow the original out of the water when the bugs and other features are fixed/implemented. It's quite a grind to get what you want but it has me coming back for more. So used to the old game with stats and worrying about how much ammo I need per map. I'm at a low level right now so I don't have to worry about it yet but can't wait for it to be an issue.A couple hours into the game I ran into a herd of Buffalo and only had the .243.... Why not... I was dodging Buffalo for 30 minutes as they kept charging me at random. I definitely know the sounds of disgruntled buffalo now. 6 shots by the way... How many .243 rounds it takes to take down a single buffalo while dodging several and you can't shoot straight because you're stamina is so low from trying to get away.Based on playing theHunter:Pros:1. No micro transactions2. Killer graphics. I find my self running around just to look at all the scenery.3. Easily track animals. The tracks glow a certain color and pulsate.4. Chainsaw background noise in the distance was a nice addition. 5. Doc doesn't scold me anymore.6. Sounds meter shows you how loud you are.7. Windage is shown (direction) for free. 8. Caps lock is the move faster button. You can move faster in crouch position too.9. Map doesn't reset at nightime and there's a flashlight.10. Nightsights.11. Visibility meter always visable. No need to go to huntermate to check.Cons:1. No micro transactions - theHunter (original) could buy anything you wanted when you wanted it (real money)... Love hate relationship.2. Crashes quite a bit right now but I'm sure it will be fixed soon.  A. Alt tabbing out crashes for me.  B. Crashed when I shot a huge deer. It ran around in circles for a min then the game crashed. Sad I didn't get the points for it.  C. Tried changing the resolution and the game crashed.3. Can't shoot the rabbits. I know that will be coming as it was in the original.4. No mallard or geese... :(5. I don't like the animals scared stat. I run around to sightsee and have a bad stat because of it.6. Not that much documentation to know what you need  A. What camo is good for the area you're in. Scent/noise reduction? Just for looks right now?  B. Should I waste my credits on the .223? What can I shoot with it? Just the red fox? Rabbit for no points?7. Can't reload weapon while running or in crouch fast position.8. Music sound setting is reset after harvesting an animal. Good sounding but cann't hear the animals too well at 90.9. Could be my computer but the clickable areas are off in windowed mode. For example, you have to click 1/4"" below ""buy"" to click the link.10. Glow sights are taken off weapon when you switch to something other than that weapon (very annoying). Scopes seem to stick and don't have any issues.11.Occasionally when pressing the ""d"" key, you'll crouch and the only way to get out of it is to go prone and get back up.Is there a link to the game roadmap (what developers are working on)?Don't get this game if you want to just jump into the game and shoot animals. You could be walking around the map for 15 minutes and not see/hear an animal. If you like hunting and are patient, this is the game to get.			"

												Hey, I bought this on the first days, but still have many issues. I have an Asus ROG PC, but the sounds is awfully buggy. There is no voice for my steps, crouching nor running. Sometimes the voice comes back for 1-2 min, then muted again. The same problem apply to the callers too. Also this is the first game where I needed to manually configure same setting on my graphic card, else the whole graphic were blocky. So those who would like to play with a bug and annoyance-free game, still have to wait for a few more patches, othervise it could be a great game. I'm still playing with theHunter Classic instead. That works.Other game designers would call it Beta, I guess. Because all this issues giv a negative feedback, which will be valid until the games come to a better shape.			"

												~Looks like I got my Wish..... 8.5/10Ive been wanting a NEW version of the hunter with a new Engine as the Orginal engine was starting to look a little outdated but still did the job.....This NEW version of the theHUNTER is Simply Stunning! The Open Game world will take your Breath Away and is a joy to Explore and the Hunts are Challenging and rewarding with lots to do! I have Played many hunting games and this is the NEW Generation of Hunting sims/games and looking foward to seeing where theHUNTER goes from here! There are some minor bugs here and there but nothing so drastic that I wouldnt recomend it to a freind and it has X1 controller support rite out of the box from day one which was a surprise as controller support is not indicated on the Store page! If you are looking for not only a Amezing world to explore and on top of that be able to hunt with freinds in that same amazing world than stop reading this and grab it now! You will not regret it I promise!			"

												After playing theHunter classic for over 300 hours I was excited to try CotW. Let me begin by saying that the current state of the game is that it feels unfinished. A few more weeks of testing and bug fixing was not a bad idea.So expect things  like ui not working, game crashing, sounds sometimes not playing when they should. Game mechanics not working,animals getting stuck...that sort of thing.However, I feel this game has great potential to be a very immersive and beautiful (the graphics look fantastic) hunting simulator. The sim aspects are familiar If you have played theHunter classic ,you will know how it works. It's basically the same,stay downwind, dont make too much noise and hear the animal call to llocate it.I had some good fun hunting but the game definitly needs more work and lets hope the devs are up to it. If they manage to sort out the bugs this could be a great game			"

												After nearly twelve hours I haven't found anything game breaking in this ""broken, buggy, early-access game"". The bugs that I've encountered can be easily worked around. The game is fun, give the devs a chance to read feedback and answer questions. The game has been out for two days, don't down vote it simply because it isn't perfect and you're too stupid figure anything out on your own.- A HEEL review			"

												Okay. TheHunter: Call of the Wild™...is it any good? ehm...yes, it is...BUT, and this is the BUTTEST of BUTS, it could be great and it isnt right now.It is buggy. The controls and the menu's are doing weird things all over the place. The challenge is okay. Sneaking up on deer has not become TOO easy. Landing a good shot is still something that takes practice. However, there are a reasonable amount of animals around and they are not as easily startled as in the TheHunter classic. This is an understandable choice, given the different game mechanics, but it takes some getting used to.All in all, the gameplay could use some finetuning, the bugs definitely need to be FIXED as quickly as possible (it is a disgrace that the product is so buggy), but the game is generally fine.And this brings us to the best feature of the game. IT IS GORGEOUS. absolutely gorgeous. If you are like me and you spent many hours into TheHunter classic, you are probably okay with how the old game looks. Not great, but it works and it stills conveys the idea of a realistic hunt. But this is a new level of looks. the foliage and the grass bending away when you walk through out, the light breaking through the trees. It is so beautiful and gives a whole different esthetic to the game. Just yes. In this case, I would say, trust that the developers will fix the things that need fixing. They are a very community oriented bunch and they do listen to what the community says. If that happens, if the bugs get fixed and the gameplay finetuned, we have a mighty fine hunting game on our hands. Buy it. It works.			"

												Basically it is a good game, but there are still many bugs. Also some bugs are still in there from the Beta Test and many players discovered some other major bugs. It's not so bad that you couldn't play it. Sometimes it just a bit harder because of different bugs. All in all I can agree with some of the other reviews but this game is from graphical content so impressive that these little bugs should not stop you from purchasing it because they will fix it quickly and it's gonna be the best hunting game ever.Have fun out there hunters!

The game runs nicely on ultra settings on my medium-high spec pc. Some of the more gamey features have been tastefully added without affecting the realism of what is and should be a simulation game. Would recommend to anyone who wants a slow, fantastic looking relaxing hunting simulation.			"

												Huge disappointment - even though there are plenty of good things to say about this, the core mechanics are very flawed and the learning curve is more weird then the Hunter Classic. Pro's:Graphics are excellent, love the foilage and the animals, good variety in terrainA different approach, with several ways of balancing your own style, a good progression ideaHUGE world, lots to see and unlockGood difficulty in animals behaviorCon's:Starting area is so wrong, VERY dense, very frustrating that most animals are spooked before you even see themDifficulty is backwards. Since you start with no skill points, your like a freight train in a china-store. And since getting exp and kills are quite difficult without skills - go figure, you spend the first hour doing nothing but chase air...Shooting mechanics are way off. A point blank shot to the chest can leave you with a ""flesh wound"" and without a shooting range, i can figure out what im doing wrong or how my aim is off... The kills i get, dont make me much wiser, but there is a significant amount of bullet spread.Trophies and the hunting experience is arcadish. The trophy shot is just an x-ray of your shots and numbers. Big disappointment!Clearly already setting out for several DLC's - birdshot but no birds ingame... Come on...The tutorial is pretty useless. You have to dig on your own to figure out things in the codexUI and inventory is still pretty messy and often quite buggedMissions are still bugged even the same ones as in closed beta in december...I simply cant recommend this untill mayor improvements have been done, even though this is way better then the arcade shooters/hunting games.Should have been early acces or beta, doesn't seem finished			"

												Alright the game has been out for just under a week and i already have >20 hours time played.  This is a great follow up theHunter original - i would say if you enjoyed that game and your computer can handle the new engine then you will also enjoy Call of the Wild.  The environment and graphics are incredible.  The sound stage is great.  The improvments to draw distance were so needed and really breathe new life into Call of the Wild (draw distance was why i stopped playing the original game).  Overall there are a few glitchy things but i think the devs still deserve credit for a solid release.  Reading through some of the other reviews and discussions i think some people are definitely blowing the issues out of proportion.  I can recall a number of AAA titles with a $60 price tag in the last year that have had far far far worse bugs (i.e. AAA titles with actual game breaking bugs: falling through maps, blue screen of death, etc.) and i have not experienced anything even remotely close to that magnitude with theHunter.  There are a few hiccups in the menus (both start and in game).  The animal UI is suitable for now but also has some opportunities around movement patterns, behavior on steep terrain, and fleeing.Sure, there are a couple of things that need to be ironed out but the potential is CLEARLY here.  I have already gotten more than $30 of enjoyment out of the game over the first weekend.  I'd love to see some refinement to the bow hunting in the future, some additional stat tracking, and the inclusion of ATVs for getting around faster than walking.			"

For my Opinion this game has so much Potential to be The best hunting game ever created, But The way will be long. From now It is a beta. The deers have always The same antles ans size, the skilltree is crap and should be Implentet from classic, A Lot of Bugs and for my Opinion there are a Lot of guns and Equipment missing.. But beside all the negative aspects it is a lovehate ans cant stop play in this game. So i recommend this game The Player who doesnt Cafe for few Bugs because this game has real potential			"

												Massive fan of theHunter classic, Super hyped when i heard about this release.Was disappointed at negative reviews, so I went onto twitch watched some of the streams spoke with some of the streamers and couldn't see any of the game breaking issues some people have mentioned.So i brought the game, glad i did there will always be release issues with a game.I have picked up on some bugs but none of these have been game breaking, deer running at trees and some menu issues but these are easierly fixed. The game is a sight to behold beautiful and immersive, graphics and sounds draw you in, i can already see myself wasting many hours, if your are unsure go watch some streams on twitch chat to some of the streams find out for yourselfs don't get drawn into negative release reviews.Hunting at night is amazing slight issues with AI but again nothing that can't be fix and there have already been 2 updates fixes a day after release. Played over 12 hours and no crashes, amazing game, can't wait to see whats nextIf you like me are a classic fan than this is a must, can't wait to see whats to come.If you need to get your bonus content visit it unlocks it ingame but you still have to buy it http://cotwpromo.thehunter.com/#/ "

												As someone who has almost 300 hours in Thehunter: Classic this game is pretty much an upgrade to that game. The graphics and atmosphere are fantastic. Night hunting is a lot more tense than anything in Classic ever were. Took me first hour to get used to the keys and set my mouse and stuff but after that I was fully immersed in the game. Stalk hunted some roe deer and fallow deer and even a very hard red deer! So atmosphere, graphics and general feel are good.Animals are pretty realistic. Tracking is a lot nicer than in Classic and it feels more natural. You can find animal in every corner if you get lucky but for my first hour I didn't even see more than one so it can vary. Each animal give you score, experience and money. Score is based on the animals size and antlers, how quickly you killed the animal, did you use the right weapon and bonus from previous animal harvests. Each animal also has a rank from very easy to mythical. The harder the animal is, the better reward it gives when harvested.New equipment and weapons are bought with money earned in game from kills and missions. Most of the stuff are locked behind a level or a score so you need to play the game to unlock them. I don't know if I like this or not yet. Need to play more to see how fast can level up and gain money and score to determine if it's a grind to get them all.Haven't done many missions yet but so far they seem to be reasonably well designed. You can activate multiple and do them while you explore and hunt. Gives extra cash and experience and shows you around the maps, which is pretty great.So far the best thing about the game has been exploring. Maps are beautiful and full of stuff to discover. I was taking screenshots left and right all the time. It's a really, really beautiful game and sound design just enhances that feeling.the UI is pretty horrible to be honest. Inventory is a mess and pretty unclear. Huge icons on the screen for tracks and calls. You can't see your own waypoint in the huntermate until you are 100 meters away from it. Makes the navigating a bit challenging when you need to open a map to see where you are going. Luckily you can turn most of those things off so that's a plus.Most bugs that I ran into were sound or animation bugs. Background music in outposts is very loud. Animals can get pretty easily stuck on rocks when fleeing. Jumping and walking uphill is a drag. Somehow I lost almost all my health by jumping. The game ran smoothly on high/ultra with my machine (i7-2600, 16gm ram, gtx 970).TL;DR If you liked TheHunter: Classic but don't want to pay montly fees and you own modern gaming PC, this is the game for you. If you have never played a hunting game then I'd say this is a pretty good game to start with. I didn't find it that hard until I was chasing a mythical fox in the night which was impossible! The game will be updated and bugs will be fixed so if you are concerned about those then keep an eye and wait for bugs to be ironed out. If you want the best and most beautiful hunting experience available right now, get this game. It's fantastic at what it does.			"

												The game runs fine for me performance wise. The game runs smooth as can be on high settings on a 7 year old rig, and it looks amazing. However, the bugs are real. The dev team is already making progress fixing the wonky menu and the many ingame bugs though, so props to them for that, but this stuff really should have been ironed out before release, especially after getting beta tester feedback. As for the gameplay itself, it has lots of really nice features that make it really enjoyable. My favorite little thing so far that I have noticed is that animals make their own trails while traveling through the landscape. They crumple the grass they walk on, break branches they move into, etc. leaving visible trails. However, the game is missing some stuff from classic that would really help the immersion. TruRacs, the feature that gave every single animal on the map a unique rack of antlers, seems to be the feature people miss most of all (Doesn't bother me much at all, but I'm a fisherman first and foremost IRL, so I'm used to one species of animal looking almost identical, other than size, everytime I bag one). This experience is also much more casual. As soon as you spawn into the map you will be spotting animals left and right. It almost feels like one of those farms that rich people who know nothing about hunting, but just want to shoot something, go to hunt. Not necessarily a bad thing, especially since this is a video game. Just something to keep in mind for you hardcore hunters.Basically, the way I see it is: If you don't like the subscription based payment option of theHunter classic but still want a similar hunting experience, or just want to take a break from classic and try something a bit different, then this is the game for you. However, if you don't mind paying for licenses in theHunter classic and are perfectly happy playing that game, you will probably be better off just putting the $30 you would use to buy this game into gear for classic instead, and leaving this one alone for now until it gets some needed polish and more features are added. You aren't missing a whole bunch here except for improved graphics. As someone who doesn't mind paying for a theHunter membership, I find Call of the Wild enjoyable, but I'm not sure how long it will keep my attention before I just go back to playing theHunter classic.

												While I do recommend this game, I will have to stress that people should hold off on purchasing it for a little while.Personally I didn't notice all the same bugs that all these people are talking about, maybe I don't have a good eye, maybe I'm just lucky.I, myself, adore the sounds, the atmosphere, the way the game looks and feels, it's just such a calm world and a good step into the beauty of nature, perfect for people trying to get out of super hardcore shooters and maybe relax a bit with some good ol' fashioned hunting.Frankly I don't much care that you have to have experience built up with certain weapon classes in order to acquire better equipment and then have to rack up a bunch of money all the same, but I guess that's just their way of asking you to actually put a bit of time in before you get all nuts with your gear. I don't have a problem with the starter rifle, it's just I should be able to buy something new/better when I have the money, not just when I have the ""experience in Rifles"" for it.The hitboxes work all as well, you'll hit the heart/lungs when you aim for the heart/lungs, plain and simple.All in all, solid 8/10, bug fixes and AI are/should obviously be top priority. I'd say give it a month or two before grabbing it.			"

												This is one of the most immersive buetiful games i have ever played, Its almost photo realistic walking through these gorgous maps. Hunting animals is fun but its very very slow paced. The devs were aiming for a realistic hunting expierance. If you are the impatient type or play alot of call of duty this game wont be for you. Don't be steered wrong by the negative reviews, Yes there are some really bad bugs but its far from game breaking and im sure they will iron them out soon.  Also be careful with alot of these negative reviews. Apperently they made another call of the wild a few years ago with a cash shop and people that have invested hundreds of dollars into that old game ARE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥OFF They can't carry any progress over here, They are mad so they are slandering the game. If you watched the trailers of this and seem interested BUY IT! Its that good that you will overlook the bugs.			"

Now they have also made skill trees and you level up to unlock the better guns to buy and the better equipment now. The graphics are beautiful and my rig get a stead 30 fps with mostly high and some ultra settings on.They do need to optimize the game a bit better, as the fps drops in some areas are worse than others.But hardly anything game breaking.

												Do not be alarmed about all of the negative reviews.I'll rate the game off of graphics, optimization, and gameplay.Graphics 9/10. The graphics are stunning and a direct upgrade from theHunter classic. Sometimes you'll find yourself just standing there and enjoying the view.Optimization. 8/10. The minimum graphics card for this game is a GTX 660. I am currently using a GTX 750 TI and I'm running the game as fine as an ocean wave. However there are some bugs and issues that can make an annoyance; for instance, when I got a mission where I had to take a picture of an animal, the key for taking the picture was unbinded and I missed the chance twice, it was tedious really. The settings menu and UI in-game is a bit buggy as well. But I expect these issues to be fixed in the coming weeks.Gameplay 7.5/10. Tracking, hunting, and killing your first deer is quite satisfying really. However I did have some issues with the animals AI; for instance, There was a deer that did nothing but run in circles around me. It was humorous but annoying. I tried to put the deer out of it's misery but it just kept running as fast as it could. I ended up putting three rounds into him sadly, I aimed for his heart twice but the bullet seemed to just evaporate before it met it's target. I finally scored a penetrating shot and it got stuck on a tree and stared at me for a minute and then fell over. The AI in Call of the Wild™ is kind of an upgrade to theHunter Classic. There are actually feeding and drinking areas that animals will go to and you can sit there and wait for them to show up and take a trophy, but they are a bit buggy sometimes.      Another thing that stunned me was the map. Currently in Call of the Wild™ there are two maps: Hirschfelden and Layton Lake District. Hirschfelden is a map from theHunter Classic but the catch about this is that the map has been expanded by three times the size it used to be. The maps in theHunter Call of the Wild™ are enourmous and if you're in a multiplayer lobby and feel like hunting alone, you can go anywhere and everywhere. Finally this is important that you read this if you didn't like theHunter Classic.Are your ready for this?Are you sure?Ok here we go.THERE ARE NO MORE MICRO-TRANSACTIONSYOU DO NOT NEED TO BUY A MEMBERSHIP OR LISCENSIS TO HUNT IN CALL OF THE WILD™THIS IS A GOD SENDTHANK YOU EXPANSIVE WORLDSFor a total overall reveiw. I'll give it a 7.5/10The game is amazing, the bugs are the major drawback.If you don't wanna buy the game because of the bugs, that's ok. Just check back in the next few months for updates that fix these.I'll edit this reveiw when the bugs are sorted out.EDIT: UI ISSUES SEEM TO BE FIXED. IGNORE EVERYTHING I SAID ABOUT THE UI.			"

												   Wow.  Where to begin?  First off, this game was not ready for release.  I've been on The Hunter Classic from the start, the 75th person to join it.  There have been a number of issues with that game, but it's at least a decent game.  Too many bugs here to mention and finding new ones every time I play.  Today my binoculars just disappeared.  My Roe Deer call no longer has an audible sound, but still attracts deer.  Auto walk also changes what I'm carrying, sometimes, sometimes not.  Sometimes I can use my key bindings to change in use items, other times I have to go back to my huntermate and then to the weapon or call I want.  Now, today, I find that most of my prvious progress in Layton Lakes has disappeared.  I have no way to access a previous game, only to select a new game or continue the last game played so when I left Layton Lakes and went to Hirschfelden, I lost most of my progress at Layton Lakes but kept access to the outposts I'd reached.     One of my greatest pet peeves about The Hunter Classic was how every time I'd hop in for a quick game, it seemed there was a patch to download, time to play was wasted on updates.  This game had an update on day 2 and looks like there will need to be any more.Pros:    Great graphics.  Water puddles form when it rains.  Good thunder sounds.  Animals look excellent up close.Cons:     Too many bugs to count.  No purchaseable content.  (I would like to see some DLC for $ in addition to earning points for those who lack $)  Plays slow despite having a fairly powerful computer (4.2 Ghz hexa core processor).  Too many carry overs from Classic (I for one, would like to see a lot fewer of those lame 2d birds and instead have had a few well placed, well thought out 3d songbirds, maybe a rare bald eagle soaring over Layton Lakes)    Great idea, bad execution.  Hopefully they fix this one unlike The Hunter Primal. "

												I like the game, and will probably play it a lot. You really need to be patient when you play this game, so it is not a game everyone would like. Also, the level progress is really slow, so don't expect to be hunting moose in the first 10's of hours. There are a few critical bugs which really should've been fixed prior to the release. I'm hoping they will fix those. "

												Great game, will be chaning to positive as soon as moajor bugs are fixed. game looks GREAT its FUN been looking for a good hunter game for awhile BUT game crashes sometimes to desktop sometimes crashes pc which makes it unplayable atm, then theres 2 kinds of SCOPE GLITCHES have had them bot, 1. after you take a shot it goes to iron sight and then back into scope which makes it hard to hit a possible 2nd shot with the ""fast aim perk"" 2. you are looking into the scope from far away and shot will NOT be accurate, restart fixed that but appeared again another time. Last thing is it me or is there no back to MENU? have to exit to desktop to switch map? Also the inventory and backpack needs better layout it screams console.- cant recommend mainly casue crashes.EDIT : after patch 1.1 the crashes are far less 2 so far over 2 days, only to desktop no more pc crash caused. after 1.11 the scope bugs are gone, but between shots it still goes to iron sight for 0.1sec between shots with quick aim perk. still no back to menu option, still good fun and can def be played but still some really anoying small bugs hoping to get fixed in next round, rly wanna change it to recomended :)EDITEDIT: game still crashes just less frequent but still enough to not wanna play since it can happen anytime just as you about to complete something.

												Hi,I discovered this game yesterday on my personal queue, i was surprised the game was published today ! I bought the game for the environment design. Gorgeous landscapes. One of the Best vegetation in games i have seen recently.I apreciate the fact that the game doesnt force you into doing some scripted actions at the begining. You are free to do anything you want. If you like exploration, you are served.So i walked straigth for a few minutes, looking at the amazing environment, weather, everything, the atmosphere is just too good. You are there in the wild, and the camps are nicely positionned.Then i noticed some deer footsteps on the ground, so i began to follow the traces, a long time passed, 10-20 mins until i found a group of deer, im not even sure it was the original one that i followed i may have lost track multiple times and followed some new traces by mistake.This first contact with the animals was a great mess, missed the shots, scared them away. took me 30 more mins to find my first trophee. :pIve seen the post with the list of animals, for the moment i met a rabbit, a fox, some deers, a ram, i heard a boar, didnt see him, im definitely going to spend many hours and hunt them down.I used to play Far cry for the hunting/exploration part, If you like hunting, you should buy this immediately.

												Beutiful game kinda annoying at the beginning becuase the .243 is underpowered and wont take down a deer in one shot unless u neck it.  but the only major downside is there menu is so horribly optimized it may lock up your computer too explain this i run this game at 45-50% cpu i have a 4570 i5 and when i open the menu and try to click things too fast it jacks my cpu up to 99-100% locking up my computer ive never seen any damn game that when opening up the menu it takes twice as much cpu to do so.  Untill they fix this game breaking problem i cannot recomend this game			"

												I love original game 'The Hunter' but this is just a buggy mess. - Crashes- Sound bugs- Performance Issues even on high end machines- Sometimes Scopes dont work- Animal Behavior is horrible (Sometimes they just stack in one place and you can shoot every single one of them Call of duty style)- Animals dont respond to shots from a far distance and when you get close they are just dead-The graphics are good thoughIn this state, the game should not have been released. If all bugs get fixed i would love to come back but now its just a waste of money imo.			"

												O novo the hunter tem de melhor mesmo é gráfico, embora haja alguns recursos melhorados como: sistema de mira. No geral em minha opinião ele é bem inferior e possui alguns aspectos negativos como: as informaçoes não sao computadas no hunter maque; a bulsola fica sempre visível; se desabilitar os recursos virtuais é praticamente imposivel de jogar, tornando o hunter maque quase obsoleto; outro aspecto negativo é o fato de nao haver o movimento livre da cabeça, isso torna o game mais injeçado. E po ultimo o posiçao de descanso da armae bem chata de se ver, deveriam ter colocado como no the hunter antigo.Em fim eu recomendo este jogo, pois creio que evolua muito ainda, vale apena esperar.

												Love the Scenery and attention to detail, the game is really fun! I have been hoping for something open world since deer hunter 2005.. ♥♥♥♥ cabela's... Anyays to the point. Type of ammo should be displayed somewhere, eg.. A seperate ""equip"" menu where in which one could apply each individual item on his persons before the hunt day. Since I can't seem to be able to choose between the 2 different .243 rifle rounds. also, after collecting the trophy i noticed the trajectory marker on the harvested animal is not exactly accurate.  It's a great game with tonnes of potential, just 2 things i have notice thus far that would imo make the gameplay slightly more user friendly.			"

												Hi all!i just want to write a quick review about the game. i play the game every day no crash issue at all graphic is awsome it's running on high and ultra settings as well whitout any problem i use high settings. Cpu: amd 8350 fx black edition 8 core, Gpu: XFX ATI 7970 3 GB, Memory: 16 GB G-Skill 1860 mhz No problems on running nice and smooth. the xp gain is all right im lvl 13 now the money as well i collected 80000 all ready after 3 days i think is good enough. Rifle score i like it because it's no easy and i can't unlock all the items after one day gameing. Sounds rabbites are too loud rain as well and sometimes just stack i know in next patch will be fixed. Animal groups i think have no any problem with that the game is not boring and if you have a look in the real life you will see the same 10 or even more animals in group i like it. All together i recommend for eveyone who like hunting it is not an FPS game where you kill everything what is moving on your screen Then this game is not for you. Bigger trophy more xp,money and rifle score as well and don't forget the distance longer shoot mor point. Finaly yes worthy to buy good job devs keep up the bug fixings i love the game.			"

												I'm a big fan of the classic theHunter game and was pretty excited when I saw the trailers for Call of the Wild. Unfortunately, in it's current state the game is subpar. Even if we ignore the bugs that are currently in the game (no sneak for non-controller users, buttons not working and graphics and settings resetting), the game still doesn't compare to theHunter classic. Firs of all, the animals are everywhere, and the AI is stupid, blind and will ignore a player 2ft from them. No challenge. Lot's of times the animals will be stuck in terrain and you can run up to them and pop them from point blank range. I've read that for a lot of people the game has frequent crashes and is unstable, however I have only experienced one crash in ~10 hrs in.Now onto the good parts of the game: The visuals are great, landscape, weather etc feels really nice and immersive. Sounds are pretty good too, if not a bit loud. (can probably be adjusted in menus). The starter weapon is pretty good, as it was in classic, and you won't need to upgrade it for a while if you manage to place your shots correctly. I haven't had too many issues dropping white / blacktail, roosewelt elk or black bears. Haven't tried moose yet.The devs seems to be adressing bugs and patch the game, and I do have faith in them, but overall I think you should stick with theHunter classic a while longer if you want a genuine hunting sim. As it stand, theHunter: Call of the Wild is too arcade for my tastes, although some people will enjoy this. I will recommend this game, but if you want an upgrade from theHunter classic; this is not it just yet.			"

Just exit and relaunch I guess. The more I play the more I seek the perfect hunt. I love this game in its current state. Peep it out.			"

												Well...I played the hunter classic since 2012 and i still play it and enjoy it.I had really high hopes for this game,but in the end I did someting i never tought i would,I requested a refound.And here is the reason why(If you don't feel like reading all that I would ratie it 5/10):-Countless bugs and glitches-Animals are too common,so you don't really care for killing one-No trophy shots(yea there is a camera but it's just not it) or leaderborads-There isn't really a lot of equipment-No small game(ducks,goose,there is rabbits but they aren't harvestable) *Probably will be added in dlc-The graphics are really beautiful,but sometime times it looks like the original hunter-(Many people don't find his a problem,but i do)Animals are too easy to kill,in the sense that if you hit just one lung it 90%of the time dies on the spot or runs like a few meters.I really hope all these issues are going to be fixed,until then i will probably spend my 30$ on the hunter classic			"

												I'm an avid player of theHunter and was excited for this release, but I have to warn everyone to NOT BUY THIS! In its current state it's completely broken. There are dozens of glaring bugs which cause crashes, inability to join friends in multiplayer, animals glitching into terrain, the server browser not working correctly and many more issues.On top of that there are issues which are just terrible design and should be patched out immediately. There is no option of exiting a single player/multiplayer game to the main menu, you have to quit to desktop and reboot the game. The Lake District map is literally crawling with deer, it's like a shooting range. Animals don't appear to react to gunfire unless they've been hit with a bullet, you can shoot 6 deer without the others in the herd caring.Wait and see if they fix the game with patches before considering purchasing this.

												From a developers standpoint I am sure it is impossible to test every setup for every type of computer, and clearly many devs wait for the feedback from buyers to get rid of operational bugs for some rigs, (if the buyers are sharp enough to send their specs to the deves so thay can be patched). It seems that many times though a negative review is given for an outstanding game because it does not work 100%, (as it should!). I don't consider my system a super system, but I have NEVER had any game fail to work properly for me, and I own a lot of games. This one is particularly grating, as the negative reviews are hammering things that I have not seen, and do not experience. All I have had is a fantastic time, so far, playing this exceptional simulator. No glitches, no problems with the menus, the animals are spaced out and seem to behave within realisitic limits. All of the tracking aids can be turned down or off, for realism's sake. The graphics and atmosphere are exceptional!    I am giving this title an enthusiastic thumbs-up, and I have never played the ""classic"" version, (I have a strong adversion to free games that pay as you go..no thank-you :)  )  If whatever your system is meets the requirements give it a go if this type of simulation at all interests you. I hope you would be as satisfied as I am.			"

												So it's not the early access.Although it feels like it is.Here's what I've got: on the first try:


Although there's 4:3 ratios resolution, not everything of the interface fits in the screen. I call it poor planning. 
A Screenshot of theHunter™: Call of the Wild
By: Licopolis







Deep personalisation of a character. gender and ""skin tone"" which is actually whole ""character model"" 
A Screenshot of theHunter™: Call of the Wild
By: Licopolis




The game is very hardware-dependant, so I had to tweak graphics settings in the middle of an intro. Guess what I've got? Menu closing button didn't work, and the only option to quit that menu was quitting to desktop.UI doesn't fit in 4:3 ratio screen.Sounds start missing randomly (not all of them but frequently animal calls, callers and footsteps).Starting new singleplayer game doesn't reset your ammo. So effectively you could waste all and then start from scratch with 0 bullets in the middle of nowhere. Some players have reported buying option is not working for .243 - I'm yet to test it.Just've seen tech issue reported by some lucky XB controller user: ""keyboard users cannot sneak"", Brilliant.Finally (that's what I asked for refund after) I started a new game in Lake District. I had quit the game after getting stuck in the textures and met empty main menu on restarting, meaning it has become totally unplayable.I now understand why they haven't started with pre-order. I can just hope that some day bugs will get fixed and game will be redesigned.			"

												It's almost a shame that I love this game so much.. It's a beautiful game, with atmosphere out the wazoo... But as per usual with new games these days, there are issues..  I would love nothing more than to say ""I recommend this game""... These kinds of games have always fascinated me, and theHunter:CofW is no different. And it performs well.But it has to be a ""No"" on recommending it. And here is why;1: No ultrawide support. Menus and popup boxes end up outside the screen along with ammo count etc. But I did end up lowering the resolution and got to play it like that. Shame really, it's 2017 after all.2: Random UI malfunctions. Suddenly you are standing there without weapons, or any of the other dibs and dabs you are carrying around with you. And no matter what you try, nothing happens. At first I thought I had holstered the weapon, but no... The weapon, nor lures or anything else works at that point. And then you have the blinds that you are unable to interact with (suspect this has more to do with the interact prompt being outside of the screen relestate, but I have had this running it at 1920x1080 as well... so perhaps not.3: Random game crashes. The game ran fine up til Scheenberg (or whatever its face), but after I made it there I have had three crashes putting me back to the previous camp, ending with me having to try to track up to the camp up there just to get a fast travel point, but so far I have had three of these crashes without making it to that darn camp :(As always, your milage may vary, and if you dont have any of these problems: Congratulations! Like mentioned I'd love to recommend this game, but in its current state my suggestion would be to wait. I have my fingers crossed that they will infact be able to fix it, in which case its going to be a ""Yes"" instead of the ""No"" it currently stands at.In either case, I'll continue to try to get to that damn camp a little longer, so wish me luck!Edit: Good news everyone! Made it to the camp! And not had another crash after that. Fingers crossed for being allowed to play more.			"

Game is gorgeous and I'm looking forward to relaxing in the woods some more.Update: Played some more and wow this game is beautiful and really good. Cranked everything up to max and the game comes alive. Performance is good enough for me, don't have a counter for fps and don't really care as long as it feels good and it does. Maps are huge!

												The thought of a realistic hunting game was what made me buy this game. And Although they did a decent job at creating a wide open world with beautiful animals and nature in it, they failed to keep the player in mind designing the mechanics. Walking around is horribly slow (as is the general way of doing things like putting the binoculars to your eyes) and stalking an animal feels a bit like you're being toyed around. With only some blue highlighted tracks and droppings to look for, you're just hoping that at some point the actual animal will appear. Even more so, the game still is quite glitchy and off in weird ways. My first kill was from point blank range on a deer that was glitching out against a rock. Not the best way to get your first kill right?!I get the whole realistic approach for this game but it just couldn't keep me entertained for more than an hour or three. After only 24 hours, I had to conclude that this has to be one of the worst buys of recent years.... Refund please...			"

												Stunning, astonishingly beautiful, gorgeous, mind blowing visuals.Performance is perfect, a smooth 82fps + (For me at least)If you enjoy patiently stalking your prey and travelling on foot across a massive landscape, then you'll love this game.  (50 square miles! - You CAN fast travel)Two massive and detailed areas to play through, with missions, special requests like photograph certain genders of species etc. Or you just ignore all that and crawl through the bushes slowly, stalking your prey until you are ready to take the shot. Slow paced and incredibly addictive. The weapon options, varieties, ammunition types etc creates plenty of replayability. A few glitches with the interface, when changing equipment and doesn't play perfectly with a controller. But other than that, it's spot and is so worth the £29.99 price tag.Awesome.			"

												I would not reccomend this game YET, it's all worth it to be called a ""Early Access"" but not a full released game at all.There are so many bugs that needs to be fixed before you can really enjoy the game as a ""Hunter simulator"" the settings menu does not save your current settings or at least it does, for 2min. As well, when u zoom in and shoot with your first ability that you can shoot a 2nd shot your scopr seems glitched out and in again. Not smooth at all.in Multiplayer the walking animations are horrible the legs are glitchy as f* I've finally found a rare dear (albino) with white fur. Shot it, and wanted to ahrvest it. Game crashed. great :) well.. not at all. I mean please guys, this game is FAR better than the ""TheHunter"" with the 350$ microtransactions. But why do I can't watch my trohpies? why is there still a bug that Deers cant be shot through leafes... I don't know, I really enjoyed thisa game for about 3hours even with some crashes but now im kinda in this moot. Fix this game or it will be a placeholder in my libary... sad to say. could be such a great game.			"

												If you want a real time walking simulator then this is the game for you.If you want a game where you can track a single animal for over an hour (in actual life) to never find it or to shoot one at point blank range and have the bullet entirely miss then this is also for you.Graphics and sound are beautiful. Gameplay needs improving massively unless you like following tracks that don't end up in you ever seeing an animal.Needs more animals and the whole idea of unlocking guns is a PITA to be honest. If I've earned the money to buy a gun, let me buy it.Played several hours and in that time have shot 2 small deer. Mostly spent time walking around in circles getting bored.			"

												As of release. It's extremely buggy and should have been labeled early access. Better yet, it should have not been released at all yet. You can't even exit back to the main menu. You have to quit the game, start the game again, just to change servers to go play with your friends. It's very unfinished. I do not recommend it in this current state.			"

												At the time i am writing this. The game has been out for a few months and we have had minimal updates, only a few species of animals, and many many bugs. This game is no more than an unfinished alpha. This is a very good example as to why games are released before being sold as a ""full game."" So it can be tested and fixed before people go buying it expecting a complete and working game.			"

												I cannot understand how a game with as many issues as this one gets a full release.I am aware that the game is still undergoing patches as I've followed it before purchasing but some of the issues I've noticed seem like they should have been taken care of before release.Like the Game controls not saving properly. Reverting back at times during play.Some other issues I've noticed is the headlamp will not turn of when I tap the default L key. The light just flickers.It auto turns on at a certain hour and upon daylight it seemed to stay on until I hit the L key again at that point it turned off. Seems that in the night time I cannot turn it off.But what brings me to downvote this as of right now is my issue with the flesh wound animal tracking.Tracking a flesh wounded animal, just to find the trail dead ends and the animal disappearing. The two times I've experienced this was when I flesh wounded a Fallow. Both times in daylight.Tracked for about 20-30 minutes both times to come to a dead end trail with no animal.Waste of time and gamebreaking.Until this is fixed, thumbs down. "

												This game is frustrating, slow, difficult, and exactly what someone would want from a hunting simulator! This game is not a salt-lick simulator. It takes time to travel around the map and to explore different areas. It takes time to track down animals and sometimes you can go fifteen or twenty minutes without seeing any huntable game. The environment is one of it's greatest features. If you're crawling you will have trouble seeing over the grass, and if you're standing you'll be easilly spotted. The storms that come are amazing. The sounds are incredible even if they don't always match perfectly (warning call vs mating call). There are a few bugs such as animals behaving erradically. I'd say 95% of the time it is bug free and an amazing hunting simulator. I've never had any lag problems or frame loss. I've listed my pc specs belowSpecs: 4.2ghz 8core amd, 16gb ddr3 2133, gtx 960 2gb.			"

												I'm a fan of The Hunter Classic, to me it's a great game and i love it.Now The Hunter : Call of the Wild is a whole different thing, it is gorgeous you can play very casual and still enjoy it alot there's quite some content to play, the details, the animals, the maps, the cabins, the ""historical"" or points of interest, hunting towers, and to me the most amazing thing is all these things with the sound and music put together, The Ambiance is breathtaking.Now there are many many thing in need of improvement, tweaks, and further developing. I do agree with people when they say this should have been in Early Access, it SHOULD.To me things that need work are.► Game needs to be optimized, i think there is ALOT of room to improve in this particular subject► Animals need improving in their behavior, I didn't play the game enough to be sure, but so far i've noticed that animals tend to wander towards you if you stay still. ► I LOVE the sounds in this game, but there is a particular sound that bugs me, it's when animals go through thick bushes or tree ramifications,  it sounds like a ""ZIP"" sound, 


YouTube™ Video: Zipper Noise Sound Effects 

			Views: 13,306		

			The sounds of zippers.		

 something like this its very weird. it just make the same sound as you the hunter fully clothed rubbing on these bushes.► The AI needs huge work, it's clunky and bugged.► Also i think the UI that shows when you harvest an animal could have additional info when you hover the mouse above some of the stats, to let you know what the score is for, it would be beneficial for New Players to know what the numbers mean.That's it i really hope they listen to the community (IMO the team behind The Hunter Classic is pretty good with regular content updates and bug fixes) so if CotW team is as good we should have the game much more steady in some time.Please don't scew this up :D  "

I was really loving my first couple hours on the game, getting a lot done, but ever since the new update I've somehow lost my game save and it is so frustrating. I had gotten so much done, and I hate strating things over again. I have no idea why my save was lost, and there is no support contact as far as I know for this game yet. I would reccomend it if you enjoy great looking games, but if you are one to hate starting over, be warned. It could happen to you too.			"

												So I started the game choosing the dutch reserve, did some missions etcAnd then with my mates, we played on Layton District Lake reserve. But, I coudn't fast travel on rest area, even thoses that I discovered myself in multiplayer.Annoying. So I ask on forums, to players that I met etc. Was tell to go check those rest area in singleplayer.But you can't do two reserve at the same time, so I had to create a New Game. Which I did.Spawning level 1, in single, and multiplayer.Instant uninstall. Which I could refund after more than 2hours.^this + all those bugs that I met before like, stucks animals, animals running in loops, can't find animals and tracks even after 5km, inventory bugs, harvest bugs that give you 0 xp and 0 money etc etc etc. "

												Absolutely fantastic game. Enviroments are beautiful. Weapon handling is smooth. My game runs absolutely stable (unlike most of these negative reviews, I actually know how to BUILD a quality pc). I run Arma 3 ultra and get 50-60 fps. This game doesnt even come close to taxing my system. But it sure just look like it should. I've seen ONE deer get stuck on a tree and bushes..that's less than I've seen IRL. lol seriously. I can't FIND a glitch in this game. Its smooth.This game makes the the first one look like a $5 indie game. Open world is truly open and the regions are massive.The ONLY complaint I can think of is the cost of upgrades in game. You'll have to lay out plenty of animals before you get the more desired of rifles.This game is underhyped, atm. Majority of negative comments are coming from plebs playing on emachines.			"

												Its okay so far. looks nice on my 2 year old MSI gaming laptop (i7, GTX970m, 1080p). Looks really fuzzy when moving through foliage but when standing still it looks amazing. Noticed that you cant adjust the AA? Why? Also, my GPU is only running at about 50% utilization, 53fps on max/ultra but is hitting 84*c... thats not right. normally it stays in the 75*c range and hits 100% utilization when playing other games.I have theHunter classic and the in game world looks pretty much the same, minus the fuzziness. (im not talking about the UI or menu options, just the game world)I purchased just to support the team. Im sure they will fix the issues in no time.EDIT***Im going to be honest... theHunter classic looks about 90% as good and its really old. The only real difference is the GUI and menus. (they suck balls by the way in the new game) The graphics look REALLY close if you compare the two side by side. After palying for about 16 hours now I have seen a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of bugs and issues... (really bad fps  when it rains, animals dont spook corectly, blood trails vanish without a trace, skill/perk points, money, and xp keep poping up after harvesting but dont really have them... and many others people complain about) The only thing I dont see is the crashing. But it does run SUPER hot! (84*C even with a laptop cooler) And thats at only 50% utilization so something is waaay off.Edit #2 Bugs are just getting worse and worse. Lost all of my progress... all my money, skills/perks, weapons... everything. Had to start over even though I didnt want to. Such bullsh!t.			"

The braking point for me was it doesnt save your points you spend when leveling up. I erned 2 and spent them. Quit the game and came back on later, and both where gone. WTF.

Pros:-Very nice graphics and two very large maps. Clearly most of the work has been put into these.-A bit hard at first, but a fairly balanced hunting experience overall-Quest system gives you something focus on besides just wandering the forests.Cons:-A lot of very annoying bugs in basic things as menu, settings, inventory. Really amateurish.-Inventory is very clumsy and confusing. -Gameplay bugs such as animals getting stuck, tracks not showing, scopes bugging out, etc.5/10 game due to the boat load of bugs that require you to relaunch the game every 30 minutes to a few hours.

												Update: Tried playing after 1.2 patch. game goes about 2min before crashing. Do you guys evne test this stuff before sending it out? Terrible quaility control,First off, loved theHunter classic. But this this steaming pile is not worth the time or money right now. Animals are bugged among other things. BTW ""P"" is how you take pictures. Wasted a lot of time trying to complete that quest. NOTHING says the ""P"" is your camera. The braking point for me was it doesnt save your points you spend when leveling up. I erned 2 and spent them. Quit the game and came back on later, and both where gone. WTF. OH and the big slap in the face is the 2 exclusive items you get for buying stuff in the classic, well you need to buy them in this game too. Stay away form all games by this terrible company.			"

												The game looks beautiful and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but I feel like they worked more on that than the hunting aspect. I was just crawling my way around through grass I couldn't see through when I came across a deer. It was just sitting there, doing nothing. I stood up, took out my shotgun, and still.. it did nothing. I went to it's side, lined up a shot for it's heart and fired.. or at least I tried. As soon as I clicked, the game crashed. And here I thought I was gonna get a free kill... The best moment I had playing the game was my first kill. I was on top of the lookout where you start and I killed a deer with one shot from like 4 miles away. It just instantly dropped. Other than that though, the game is pretty buggy.			"

												If you have a SICK computer with a TITAN X, you will find this game amazing with beautiful graphics, but for us without OP computers we will find it rather ugly and annoying (you'll have to play the game to see what I mean) but even on low-medium graphics  settings I personally found this game fun and addictive. It is a HUGE improvement from theHunter (original game which was pay2win). It has an AMAZING open world and intelligent AI, It is a very stratigic but slow game, but thats what hunting is! I love it so far, lets hope they don't screw this up!!			"

I have fun just walking around looking a the amazing environment, and not just the visuals, the sounds are amazing. Then, I am sitting in the nook of rock wall overlooking a hay field, with the moon rising in the evening sky. I sat there for approx 6 minutes, and all of a sudden, to my left, I heard rustling in the bushes. It was literally scary. Well, I am done, going ot play the game now. DWM			"

												Great game even thoug I had a very rocky start. For the bad part first, this game would constantly crash on me every 5-90 minutes, I had changed from ultra to lowest possible graphics settings to no avail. After the latest patch I thought the developers would fix this problem. Well still constant crashes. So I decided to go another route, and look a bit more at my hardware. I installed a utility that came with my graphics card, and lowered the clock speed down and limited the temperature, LOW AND BEHOLD success!!, So I looked further and noticed the graphics card was getting a bit high, not really out of the norm for cards nowadays though. A little further testing and I ended up changing the speed of my GPU fan to aggressive. This game is now rock solid on ULTRA setting and getting over 30fps. So just a note to others about crashes, you may want to look in your own backyard a little like I did.NOW FOR THE GOOD. I'm not a hunter at all in real life. But this game is relaxing and fun. I really like the missions as they get you motivated to explore and as they progressivly get harder it takes more concentration and patience. I'm glad that I get to enjoy the game now without the fear of a crash, so I can take my time esploring and looking for outposts, and other POI's. I'm only level 20 but I'm having a great time. Keep in mind that I got 70+ hours in this game even with the constant crashes I had previously, that has to mean something! I can't wait to unlock more items to play around with. I thought bow hunting would be hard but I was happily suprised that it was not a whole lot harder than a gun. I can't wait to see how far my lonest shot will be eventullay and what kind of trophy kills I can get. So much to do. :)I want to thank the developers of this game and I can't wait to see further improvements and DLC's in the future. "

The only problem I have is that since I am color blind it can be hard to tell if the track I am looking at is a track that I want to track or a track that I am already tracking at a small distance. The other tracks your not currently on are white and your track is a light blue it looks like.			"

												A great improvement on TheHunter Classic. The graphics are better, the sounds are better, the environment is better, and the animals are better - especially the rabbits hiding in the underbrush. It's just better. There are also visible trails of bent grass where the animal you're tracking travelled, which is awesome and makes tracking much more intuitive than the search patterns you probably learned to do in theHunter Classic, and the render distance isn't capped. That's right you can shoot out beyond 200 meters now - there's even a 400m kill achievement!At release the menus are pretty clunky, but you can work with them. I haven't experienced any major bugs except having to switch to the map screen to exit a menu. Once they patch it up this will be a solid title.If you're a stalker-type hunter, like me, you'll probably want to know that if you use a controller with analog sticks there is a range of movement speeds that will allow you to move while walking and crouching without alarming nearby animals. If you use a M+K setup only the WASD keys have you moving at maximum speed and you'll alarm the animals even when crouching. I use an Xbox One controller to stalk then switch to my M+K to shoot because aiming with a controller is way too hard. Hopefully the devs add a movement speed toggle for M+K, but until they do stalking is really only possible with a controller.			"

												I have to write an review and try to change this mixed review.I tried this lets say at a buddys place yesterday before i made up my mind to buy it. I played like 2 hours yesterday and with no bugs and on highest settings at 2560*1440 reso and it looks really good. I really like the enviorments and the size of the 2 maps. Im really looking forward to unlocking more wepons and already bought the bow. Today when i bought the game (1,7 hours) ive encountered 1 bug and that was when i shoot a bear and he died but was still standing when he was dead but killed like 3 bears and 2 deers and 1 coyote before that with no problem. Would really like something like an option when you bagged it to see and follow the bullet from rifle to hit and think it would be really nice but only after you got to it and bagged it. I love the sounds and diffrent environments and the feeling to shoot but havent really got an chance to try lures and such yet.Devs seems to listen and trying to fix bugs and of course its gonna be bugs with these kind of games and hey its not a 60 euro game, its only 30 euro.

												Ok so after watching a dozen  review videos about this game I just had to get it. Now I'm going to say this as a real life hunter I tend to play hunting games as I would hunt in real life. Now after saying that this games visuals are stunning. The mechanics are a little wanky at times but with some patches and updates I feel like this will be the best hunting game out there. The animals AI is great for example. I on my first play through which you have to spot track and kill and animal I spotted a Fallow Buck through some brush. Now I was downwind so he did not smell me but I did hit into a branch while getting closer. The Fallow Buck heard it and looked right in my direction before taking off. Thats what happens in real life. I spotted it a 2nd time and was able to get the kill. After that i did not realize i was play for almost an hour. I Think this is going to be a great game. Here are some Pro's and some minor Cons about the game. Pros: Stunning VisualsAnimal AI is great No more P2P (in  game money system when you level up and get cash from killing animals) Perk SystemHuge MapConsWhen you crouch the sound meter stays high but this will be patchedNot enough different speices ( a game update will prob have more) I would like to see treestands and decoys etc. prob in an update. No Trophy Camera pictures. (my Favorite thing about the orginal hunter. I have had no issues with crashing or anything i have seen in other reviews. I recomned this game to anyone who likes to hunt and is a fan of hunting games. The game is a week old they will def do updates to it down the road look at the Hunter 8years and still do patches and updates.  and you can go wrong for $30.			"

												Recently I have been questioning if I actually enjoy most of the games I play. I thought about what games I actually have fun playing, then theHunter came to mind. It made me think, 'maybe I should really rethink my gaming life..' A friend bought me this, otherwise I might have passed it by. I am not going to mark that I recieved it for free, though.. Nothing is free. We take turns buying each other games. We could both start marking all the games we buy for each other as free and never have to buy a game ourselves ever again. I could then tell my gf that I won't buy any more games for myself, then when she sees games were bought at the end of the month I can say, 'well, technically I didn't buy those for myself. I bought them for a friend who in return bought them for me. Don't worry, my games are free this way, honey!'On a serious note, this game is one of the most immersive games I have ever played. I get chills from the weather system because how realistic it is. Other game Devs should take note.			"

												I really quiet like this game. First let's state the obvious - you will probably not have played a better looking game up to you having played theHunter: Call Of The Wild. The graphics are beyond amazing and make you stop often to just take in the scene and take some screenshots. In no game so far have I seen a more detailed, lush and life like depiction of nature. 11/10 on the graphics for sure.Sound design also is very very good. Everything is athmospheric and blends in nicely with the visuals. Those two things together make for an absolutely beautiful and immersive experience.The gameplay is nice, easy to grasp and challenging. I like that there's progression in terms of levels, skills, perks and equipment. The two available hunting reserves are MASSIVE. Stalking your prey and waiting for the right moment to get the perfect (screen)shot is challenging and fun.A lot of people mention having a lot of trouble with bugs. So far I have been spared by most major issues. The issues I had were mostly minor ones like not being able to click ""apply"" in the graphics settings (restart of the game fixed it). Or the deer AI being somewhat confused and frantic but most of the time everythings seems to be working as intended.I haven't tried the multiplayer yet but I'm looking forward to it. I hope this game will receive lot's of patches and content updates.			"

I think they should also add like a tracker to shots (unless they have one but i havent unlocked it) because I blasted a deer from far af but couldnt claim it because I lost it when I ran to it. So If they fix the small bugs it is well worth it.			"

												Holy smokes Batman! This game is simply stunning and overwhelmingly beautiful. I have to commend Expansive Worlds on the amazing job with the graphics. The music is very atmospheric and helps to take you into the immersion of the game. If you are at all a fan of hunting simulation games or the real thing this is a no-brainer. It's an amazing game to destress to in comparision to something like Counter-Strike or Battlefield as well.This is very easy to reccomend with the single time purchase price which I felt was the achilles heel of the original theHunter game.The in game purchase pricing does seem a bit steep especially for ammo but I think that's merely a minor thing considering you can just buy unlimited .243 bullets for free.9/10			"

												As it currently stands, I cannot recommend this product to anybody, I will keep this short and sweet, I don't often leave reviews but I feel I need to in this instance.This game should be early access for the simple fact that it is impossible to play for more than 20-30 mins without a crash the majority of the time and in a game like this, where it often takes 20-30 mins to move from one area to the next, by the time you actually get to a mission or a place where you wish to hunt, the game will crash and you will start right back at your last outpost when you restart the game, which essentially means, you have wasted 30 mins of your time doing nothing.Irrespective of settings, configuration etc, this isn't a user error, this is an error with the game and whilst I understand the developers are trying to fix this issue, the truth is, it should have never been released in this state.If the crashing problem gets fixed then I would be happy to recommend this product as the graphics are sublime and the gameplay is enjoyable (bug and gameplay quirks aside) but I really feel like, at this point, it should be early access and the truth is, should have never been released in this state.

												This game is beautiful every where you look, way more in depth than the old hunter animals see better smell and hear better. All the negative reviews complaining about bugs and all those things me and my friends played 2 hours straight not a single problem. I honestly think all these reviews complaining about crashes is not solely the game but your computers may not be able to run this game and all its glory.			"

												The Hunter Classic includes more depth, thoroughness and seems to be overall ""tougher""The Hunter CotW seems to me more Arcady - faster paced, not so hard hunting. If you want a sim, go with hunter classic, if you want some quick bucks, go with CotW			"

												As it currently stands, I cannot recommend this product to anybody, I will keep this short and sweet, I don't often leave reviews but I feel I need to in this instance.This game should be early access for the simple fact that it is impossible to play for more than 20-30 mins without a crash the majority of the time and in a game like this, where it often takes 20-30 mins to move from one area to the next, by the time you actually get to a mission or a place where you wish to hunt, the game will crash and you will start right back at your last outpost when you restart the game, which essentially means, you have wasted 30 mins of your time doing nothing.Irrespective of settings, configuration etc, this isn't a user error, this is an error with the game and whilst I understand the developers are trying to fix this issue, the truth is, it should have never been released in this state.If the crashing problem gets fixed then I would be happy to recommend this product as the graphics are sublime and the gameplay is enjoyable (bug and gameplay quirks aside) but I really feel like, at this point, it should be early access and the truth is, should have never been released in this state.

												Holy smokes Batman! This game is simply stunning and overwhelmingly beautiful. I have to commend Expansive Worlds on the amazing job with the graphics. The music is very atmospheric and helps to take you into the immersion of the game. If you are at all a fan of hunting simulation games or the real thing this is a no-brainer. It's an amazing game to destress to in comparision to something like Counter-Strike or Battlefield as well.This is very easy to reccomend with the single time purchase price which I felt was the achilles heel of the original theHunter game.The in game purchase pricing does seem a bit steep especially for ammo but I think that's merely a minor thing considering you can just buy unlimited .243 bullets for free.9/10			"

												The game looks amazing and it is fun af but some of the glitches suck, some times if an animal runs away from me they get blocked by a bush or something and just run in place the whole time...I mean it is an easy kill but whats the fun in that. I think they should also add like a tracker to shots (unless they have one but i havent unlocked it) because I blasted a deer from far af but couldnt claim it because I lost it when I ran to it. So If they fix the small bugs it is well worth it.			"

												I really quiet like this game. First let's state the obvious - you will probably not have played a better looking game up to you having played theHunter: Call Of The Wild. The graphics are beyond amazing and make you stop often to just take in the scene and take some screenshots. In no game so far have I seen a more detailed, lush and life like depiction of nature. 11/10 on the graphics for sure.Sound design also is very very good. Everything is athmospheric and blends in nicely with the visuals. Those two things together make for an absolutely beautiful and immersive experience.The gameplay is nice, easy to grasp and challenging. I like that there's progression in terms of levels, skills, perks and equipment. The two available hunting reserves are MASSIVE. Stalking your prey and waiting for the right moment to get the perfect (screen)shot is challenging and fun.A lot of people mention having a lot of trouble with bugs. So far I have been spared by most major issues. The issues I had were mostly minor ones like not being able to click ""apply"" in the graphics settings (restart of the game fixed it). Or the deer AI being somewhat confused and frantic but most of the time everythings seems to be working as intended.I haven't tried the multiplayer yet but I'm looking forward to it. I hope this game will receive lot's of patches and content updates.			"

												So many people these days go into a game that just comes out and play like 5 hours then come out and write crappy reviews because they dont understand what early development and early release really mean. They make it very clear there are bugs yes but thats the whole point of having the community help them as they improve the game, not have idiots go play 2 minutes and go write♥♥♥♥♥♥reviews to try and destroy the games name before it ever gets a chance. Its simple yes the game has a few bugs i have noticed but none of them have made the game unplayable in the slightest. I have enjoyed playing the game very much and would like to take this chance to say thanks to the people who created this game and im looking forward to everything we have coming to us in the future with the game.

												This game is great looking and the sounds are amazing, I have been enjoying walking in around in the forest and really feeling the weather and the ambiance. There hasn't been a new huntig sim in a long while and this game captures the feeling of hunting. But there are quite a few issues that should have been sorted out before release. For example you cant back out to the main menu from in the game, the noise indicator is maxed almost all the time, the quest system is lacking a bit. You want to unlock the better weapons and upgrades but to do so you have to kill a massive amount of animals with that weapon type, which feels very un huntery. You end up just shooting whatever you find which dosn't feel good. The multiplayer experience had some mayor issiues, alot of crashes and there isn't a good shared xp system. If you hunt together and one in you party gets the kill nobody else gets any xp unless they also hit the animal. Well I've still put alot of time in this game beacause it's very fun and relaxing to explore and hunt in the beatiful envrionment Avalanche has created. I just hope they keep working on the game.

												Concept is good, but couldn't play the game because the bugs wouldn't let me. At one point, I couldn't select any of my equipment, not even when reloading the game. The save file was corrupted. Even though I didn't get far into the game, I have no willingness to go even further when I know my entire save game could just ♥♥♥♥ me over.That this game is not in early access truely baffles me. The bugs completely ruin the game. If it didn't have the bugs, it could be one of my favourite games. But making it literally unplayable just makes it a 30 euro's net loss for me.			"

												How did they screw this up so bad?All they had to do was take the systems from theHunter and carry it over into the Apex engine and that would have worked just fine but no.No they had to turn it into a Ubisoft game clone complete with lookout towers to unlock hidden sections of the map and then litter the map with pointless unlock points.You want another skill point?Well then you better read this poetry stone because everyone knows reading poetry makes you a better hunter!This is a very casual game made and marketed for a younger crowd and not the typical theHunter player base.The whole experience comes across very shallow and and it feels more like a platform for dlc then a complete game.Pros:+Nice looking thanks to parent company Avalanche Studios Apex engine.Cons:-No tracking skill required.Just click on the first track and follow the blue trail.the direction of the cone is pointless you have a glowing blue line that leads to the animal.-To many animals-Pointless level system.Apparently it takes hours of study before you can use that upgraded set of binoculars.-You can tag (spot) animals with binoculars just like a third person shooter and they will glow blue for you.-No trophy shot system just a silly Sniper Elite x-ray ripoff thats very jarring and out of place for a hunting game.-Cringeworthy mission writing.Hope is a survivalist that has been living off the land for years when something ransacks one of his camps and steals some of his food.With all his tracking skill he still has no clue what type of creature he is dealing with so he calls me for help.Me:Those are boot prints mate.Made by um...a human.Hope:Im glad you came along and helped i never would have made the connection.The bottom line is its a very easy game with no sense of direction that makes me believe it was rushed to meet a deadline and left empty so they could fill it with paid dlc later on.Wait for a deep deep sale.

												It's great so far. I was skeptical, like so many others, from both the mixed reviews and the arcadey looking YouTube videos. I've also played the Hunter classic for a long time and have invested many hours in it. I know some of what I'll put here has already been said, but I feel the game deserves another positive review.The main issue that caused me to hesitate on purchasing was the arcadey look. It mainly comes from the videos having every single visual clue turned on, all of which you can disable. If you simply disable the visual audio clues, and change the track clues to just glow and not the bouncy animation - you are basically right back at the Hunter classic in terms of play. You don't even have that cheat mode of seeing the animal call on the pda and then clicking in the area.  You need to determine from sound direction alone where the call came from. These 2 elements basically remove the arcadey feel just by themselves.Not sure of all the bugs people claim to be having, I have encountered only a couple in my 12 hours of play and none of them were that serious. One of them required a restart, but that was after 3-4 hours of straight play with no issues. The tracks disappeared.Graphics look great, it's awesome that the clock just keeps going and you can go all through the day and night if you choose or rest to speed it back up to your desired time. The night time with the moonlight is especially nice.Don't want to keep going on and on, but again, if your main reservation is the arcadey look - it's worth taking a look for yourself to see, I didn't want to pass it up simply based on other's reviews and I'm glad I didn't.

												It's alot better than the last one, graphically and technically. And the main improvement is the removal of the microtransactions that were necessary to do anything in the older game. But it still takes way too long in my opinion to unlock all the better weapons and equipment, you need to hunt small game for days/weeks if you want to unlock new rifles and stuff.Other than that its a great hunting simulator.

												This is my first theHunter game, and right off the bat, i gotta say it's a ton of fun.It does have a couple issues I've noticed in the 3 hours I've played the game, the most pressing is a simple graphical issue after firing the starting rifle where the iron sight splashes onto the screen for a couple seconds. Other than that and some rather thick hit boxes on some objects, it's so far a pretty complete game. Oh, and taking a picture of the fallow deer is a nightmare, it's very finnicky so don't forget to delete the 50+ pictures you'll end up taking to complete the mission.Other than that, I'm impressed with the atmosphere the game provides, both during the day and at night. The sound design is amazing, other than the simple complaint of really close animal calls being quite loud. I haven't had the chance to experience multiplayer yet as I would like to learn more about the game first, but I'll update the review here when I have. "

												For a first day buyer, this game was for the most part bug free for me. From a man running a FX 9590 with a GTX 1070 on everthing maxed out, this game gives me an about 90+ fps average. I had a little trouble with freezing cache/store menu, aside from that everything for the most part ran smoothly. I recommend you buy the bow and callers and take what you can get. FYI if you are going to hunt with a bow there is just about no way possible for you to get close without a scent eliminator and crawling while prone. I must've scared about ten bear off like that, and don't even attempt going for an elk with a bow, those douches run off before you can get within a 62 mile radius of them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.If you are ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the price, I would buy it off a♥♥♥♥♥""like"" site for the $20-25 they're selling it for instead of the $30.

												Let me first say the game does have a lot of bugs in it but the game is very playable. The scenery, how the vegetation moves, the look of the animals are all excellent and top notch. Now I haven't hunted for almost 30 years but the animal behavior in relation to wind, sound, smell etc seems to be very realistic. The main problem I have with the game is a combination of the game crashing, not enough fast travel and the inability to save when and where you want to. Some missions require you to walk a VERY long way, I mean you literally spend 15-20 minutes walking to get there if you don't have a fast travel spot unlocked closed by. Then if your game crashes while you are there, guess what? You get to make that walk all over again. My work around was to spend several hours just walking around unlocking fast travel areas, totally ignoring the hunting until I had a few unlocked. The menu system is also very wonky, like if you go into settings you can't escape out, you have click on another option then hit escape. For me the music also cuts out a lot . But all in all it's a very fun game to play and it's certainly worth the price.			"

												The best deer hunting game I have ever played.....Period. As close to actuall hunting as a pc game can get.The large fallow always seem to be hiding in the bush behind all the other does,just like in the real world.In haven't seen a monster yet,but hear them.The fallow grunt in this game cranks and sounds real (wich worries me,as most other deer have crap sounding grunts,meaning they do that in real life,glad I hunt fallow.....lol)PRO's= Excellent graphics,sound,terrain,weapons,perks,SHEDS YOU CAN FIND BLOODY SHEDS!!!!!!!!! I'd have been happy with a shed hunting simulator,so this was the icing on the cake,being able to run around of a night,shooting wildly into a mob of fallow,and find sheds,just like real life....lolCons= Yeh yeh a few minor bugs after download and into it straight away,but my computer is playing it better today than the day I downloaded it.Sounds in callers working,exit menu no problem.Most of the minor stuff has gone for me by itself.If you wound a fallow,and run after it of a night,DON'T blame the AI if it runs off a large cliff,just suck it up and laugh,then go and collect.System i5 6600k             GTX1070Everything ULTRA,as high as I can make it.My system doesn't break a sweat and I'm thinking of going 2k for it when monitors in that range drop in price.Deer season starts here in 2 weeks.This is just the sort of tonic required for the non season times.Trust me.I cannot say enough good things about this game.If you remember Deer Hunter 2005 (and all before it), GET YOURSELF THIS AS THE TRUE UPDATE TO A DEER HUNTING SIM/GAME.No cabela's sh$t here.

												I would recommend this to any hunter loving fan havnt played much but already saw a couple of bugs not really game breaking but for example:a running around deer in circles,and sometimes you dont get the trophy even when you know it was your kill and you see the body in front of you...another thing is the game feels i have to say ""too easy"" i was expacting it to be harder to find animals and that they can hear you from much further...i played like an hour and killed like 4-5 and shot about 10 animals..its too easy for me but judge yourself..im very mixed about this game if you want to buy ill say wait abit till the fix some bugs and hopefully they can add an option to decrease that spawn rate of animals or something...EDIT:There seems to be alot of crashes with the game and poor opt for some people even with high end pc cant run on 60 fps...i would hold off for this game for the time been untill they will fix the game			"

												I strongly recommend this game to whomever is reading this, and to help the game progresses you have to help them with its shortcomings, such as every time I load into the Hirschfelden map I am stuck on a island on the bottom right corner of the map. This stops me from progressing. I don't know much about programming but if you could fix this or add a fast travel point at the start of the map it would help me very much as I would be able to get off the island and stop it from being a problem i the future. And again I still recommend this game and regard it very highly as it is hands down the best game in its genra.			"

												I came from theHunter classic. This version of theHunter is great. No crashes for me. And no.. I don't work for Avalanche Studios. I did encounter one deer getting stuck against a rock. One thing I noticed is that it's more difficult to take down a deer in COTW than Classic; most of the shots I make only do a Bleed Low level. Maybe because the rifle I am using in theHunter COTW is weaker compared to Classic. Which leads me now to my question to Avalanche Studios. Will you be bringing in the Anschutz riflle to COTW? The rifle does heavy damage and is very accurate in Classic. Love that rifle. Thank you.			"

												This is an amazing hunting game. The ability to track down any prey, or predator (i.e. whitetail and blacktail deer, jackrabbit, coyote, and bear) is quite impressive. The overall graphics, ambiance, sound effects, weather effects, and overall presentation is possibly the best hunting simulator I have ever played. There are no vehicles to use (which is perfectly fine by me) and the map is impressively huge. Animals behave very realistically, in most circumstances. I know that patches and updates will resolve any bugs that occur, which the developers are actively making sure that the game is running like a top and smashing bugs when they are found, etc. Great game in my opinion.

												(THIS IS MORE LIKE A NEUTRAL REVIEW) So far the best looking hunting game available. Its almost perfect but there is one thing that makes it so annoying and its the mouse input... im 100% sure its not raw-input and that makes the mouse movement choppy and it feels like its correcting my movements and that makes aiming a nightmare. Game owns a great fun story and the freeroam is just amazing. I have played for few hours just watching the views from top of mountains etc. the graphics are just gorgeus. And what comes to performance? im getting about 50fps with medium/high to ultra settings. With those settings my cpu usage is bout 50% (optimization issue?) while gpu is 100%. My rig is running an i5 6600k and r9 390.			"

												Graphics are absolutely stunning. The best forest representation in the whole video game history. Gameplay is now possible and quite immersive. There are glitches, especially with animal blocked by hills/stones, but it's quite good right now. It also has huge potential and I mean not only the game itself, but also the apex engine. It will be huge, just don't screw this one up please!			"

I'll admit there are some bugs but the biggest ones that i noticed got fixed withing a few days of me buying the game, so at least they are fixing what is being found. The game is one of the most beautiful games Ive played, from the music to the back drops even the details are great, but the game requires patience.			"

												I do recommend this game because it does have its good sides, open world hunting, bullet drop (Big one for me), Good ammount of game to down. But there are critical flaws, Like multiplayer is absoutely messed up and not worth it, the server host is allowed to fast travel but it's an issue when everyone else needs to walk 3Km to get to the host, multiplayer loves and I mean LOVES to just crash or drop everyone, and weapon variety can use some improvement, like more shotguns, different bows (Like crossbows and speaking of bows the 3rd person model is messed up and doesnt even look right), different shotguns, and some mroe pistols, Then AI needs some improvement, like I had a herd of Roe dear, shot 3 of them, and some of them pretended like I wasnt even there and putting bullets into them, You can buy this game and play it, just stay away from multiplayer until thats fixed. Multiplayer is shameful for a game on final release.			"

												Pros:-Amazing graphics, sounds, animations, and lighting like never seen on a game before. Makes you feel like you are really in the wild!-Ability to turn off things that might seem arcadish like, missions, tutorial help, animal call visuals,  glowing footprints, beacons, etc.-Two huge maps to explore with lots of ambient wildlife and huntable wildlife!-Easy to access photo mode with zoom (press P) to take a lot of beautiful pictures!-Many missions to complete, leveling system to unlock new gear...no more buying gear with real money!-Deer have many variations in racks, and it is still a challenge to find those trophy bucks like in the TH:C-Night hunting!Negatives: -Some bugs, but I have not experienced as many as others seem to have. Also they are working on them often.-Not a big variety of equipment right now, maybe dlc packs in the future?-No waterfowl, upland birds to hunt maybe they are saving this for a dlc also?Conclusuon:If you love the outdoors and hunting or photography get this game!

												Don't let the negative reviews keep you from this game.  I was a little hesitant at first but am very happy with my purchase.  Yes they're some minor bugs but they will be easily fixed once devs know of them.  Game is absolutely gorgeous!  Photo realistic at times.  The audio also is amazing only thing I noticed as a negative about it is the small animals running through the brush is much louder than it should be, almost scares you as if a bear was running up on you.  So hope that can be tweaked but not the end of the world.  If you have any interest in hunting or just like the outdoors this game is for you.

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME It is fantastic ... graphics are phenomenal ... gameplay is great, difficult but not too frustrating  ... missions and progressions system are compelling and addictive.BUTAfter putting 82 hours into this game it suddenly lost all my progress for no reason ... all my hard won weapons equipment, cash, skills and perks .... ALL GONE.And when I contacted the developer I was told there was nothing they could do and I should be physically saving my files after every session. They couldn't even buff me with some XP and cash to get back to where I was. This game makes you grind to earn stuff, which is fine but I can't play this game anymore knowing that everything could be lost at any time.This is so disappointing because it is damn good game ... but it broke my heart :(Don't not buy unless you like having a broken heart			"

												This game is Early Access in disguise. Tons of gamebreaking bugs on release and until now it's not fiixed.Random crashing sound loop, that happens frequently once you get to higher level.Now you can't play at all because the game will crash randomly losing hours of progress.Lots of scope bugs where you can't see anything in your scope, crouching while scoping and moving forward will switch to iron sight mode while the scope is still attached. Lots of minimal bugs that can easily be fixed yet takes weeks or can even take months with their current patching process.The environment and visuals is one of the most beautiful thing I have seen in a game.Stay away from this game until they fully fix the major crashing issue in maybe 6 months to a year. Even if the store page does not say the game is in Early Access. The devs actions in fixing this game to a release standard is Early Access model. There is no urgency or info on when the random crash issue will be fixed or even what causes it.A good game ruined by ineptitude and lies.			"

												400+ hours in classic, and I knew this wouldn't be the same. It isn't, but it's still great.Pluses:+still a fun time stalking and killing prey, with a decent challenge level+graphics are acceptable/good+animal animations are excellent, if not a little glitchy at this point.+sound is phenomenal+missions don't get as annoying as I thought they would.+no microtrans like classicMinuses:+they skimped on the textures, or at least the ability to maximize them in game.+lack of stat system to track number of kills/leaderboards etc. This gives it more of an arcade feel, and I think they struck out with this design decision.+hunting without lures is a drag, especially when you're noisy as heck in the bush from the start.FINAL VERDICT:A good game, and one I would recommend. I look forward to graphical improvements/optimization for those with older systems than mine. Also, incorporating the community of hunters at large in game will be what keeps us coming back to this one, rather than burying our collective nerd hunter heads in classic.			"

												This game looks just absoloutely beautiful no doubt about that. In my OPINION this game is great right now and yes you should buy it. There will obviously be more features, bug fixes, and UI updates added in. Yes the UI is a little clunky and hard to navigate, there aren't any deployables but I'm confident in the developers that they will add it. But this game and follow its journey. I love how they added perks and skills that was a great addition and lets you customize your character to focus on what you want.			"

a list of bugs made by another player which shows gravel on some roads going over others... typical indie style...but in all fairness, they are updating the game still (even though not marked as EA, hence the 3 points..) Worth only if you got the £30 to spend (worth around £10-£20 atm)edit 1: 0/10, BSoD my system after full system crash, custom built, 8-core, 16 gb ddr3, etc etc, OP as balls, yet made such an error on my system windows explorer would freeze every time i plugged it back into the internet... this has caused some damage to my system with regards to constant restarting, so no, i will NOT give this game a thumbs up due to some people not knowing how to get this fixed, (took me a day or so)... until this is fixed and is playable without damaging ANY system.blow me if you want to downvote this review, dont care, its what happened to me, its happening to certain people (hell even i thought ""aaa thats just props their system"", but nope). no Alternative facts from me snowflakes.

												TL;DR; Disappointing bugs and instability, but promising game.Let me start off by saying I've played the original theHunter A LOT, before it became the pay-to-play/win disaster that it is now. I played the original right when the game was released and only had one reserve, so I'm very familiar with the basics of the game and the team behind it.That being said, I saw this game being reviewed and was fairly excited as it looked good and seemed to have taken a more mature turn.However, the game in its current state has quite a large amount of bugs that (in my opinion) prevent me from having a fun experience. My main issue is that a lot of these bugs are super simple things that are obvious right from the start, so I'm surprised this hasn't been caught by QA,For example: map marker will never show up in the location you try to put them in. I'm fairly sure this is tied to the fact that the engine doesn't have proper widescreen support (like the original) and scales the UI improperly (circles are ovals for me). Also, if you do place a marker, 100% of the time the marker will not show up currectly in the game until you reset the marker and add it again. Something that's incredibly annoying and it's a mystery how such an obvious issue has not been addressed.Furthermore, the ""tutorial"" part is... a little bugged? I didn't find any tracks at all, until I was a good mile into a random direction, even though the lady announced ""there's a track nearby"". I've seen the same happening in a YouTube review of the game, so I'm not alone.There's also voice lines in the wrong order, which is confusing at best.My game also crashed a few times while playing (I refunded the game, so I haven't played really more than 2 hours), which to me is a show stopper. You simply can't release a crashing game in my opinion, and I'm also not the only one for whom this happens.Either way, I can totally see this game being great for some people already that might not have these issues and I'm more than willing to give it another shot in the future after patches are in place, but unfortunately my experience has been very bad so far and can not recommend this game.

												This game is overwhelmingly fun, the single player and missions over all are fun and enjoyable.  There is times where it is a little tough, but the road to finishing some missions can be very interesting.This game is a really big (better) upgrade from the previous free game.  The best part is that you unlock weapons and buy them with in-game currency, that's a win in my own opinion.  You can now progress and hunt more things without having to pay more money to do so.I recommend this game and I also recommend bringing a friend along with you, the multiplayer is a great way to have fun with friends and compete to see who can kill the biggest animal.Lastly, you can expect bugs as it's a new game, but the devs are updating it and making it better, you can wait to buy the game if you want to play a game with ease, but if you don't mind a few bugs and glitches that can give you a laugh at times, I'd recommend picking up this game soon.Pros[+] Graphics are amazing[+] Enjoyable game with a lot of missions[+] Multiplayer is fun and not laggy [depending on the host ;)][+] Loads of places to explore currently[+] Devs are working hard to make the game better.[+] A lot of animals to find a kill (they sometimes roam in large groups)[+] Animals can hurt you (you actually have to fear that now, isn't that cool?!)[+] Realistic hunting simulator[+] Skill points and other sorts to make your character a better hunter. (Example; Skill points put towards certain things makes tracking easier)[+] A lot of other things that you should check out!Cons[-] When you play multiplayer you can't interact with monuments, outposts, and outlooks.[-] Some fps bugs, but you can restart the game and you'll be fine.[-] Some interface bugs, but easily bypassable. I can't think of much more cons as this game is really great, I recommend picking it up and bringing a friend along with you! ;)EDIT:I thought I'd add in that the game is a bit time consuming with walking a lot, here is a suggestion.[+] Add some sort of vehicle, like an atv, but nothing to fast, but just something to get you to a place just a tad bit quicker.  It would make getting from one place to another when hunting in certain areas.  Also, make them two seaters or so, that way if you and a friend play you can also let them hop on the back and you can both go and hunt together.			"

												I will start with this.   Many improvements made over the former game.  Micro transactions are not there, which is a thing of beauty.  The game requires you spend time learning to hunt, how to search explore etc.   It would be foolish of me to attempt to review this beyond a ""wow looks beautiful""  ""I am glad I bought this"" currently.  With more time spent I will update my review.      I have not yet encountered any bugs or graphics issues and I find myself constantly staring off into the distance looking at the lighting, listening to the sounds etc.  It is... gorgeous.  Update:Pro: Huge landscape that takes a long while to explore and unlock.   Intuitive marksmanship. Great skill tree. Amazing sound. when the immersion hits, it hits hard. Con:  The audio is really wonky in several ways.   One being tiny critters like squirrels and rabbits etc are extremely loud.  Loud as a full grown man running through the bushes.  While this does not scare the game, it does scare the headphone wearing user. (when  said immersion has hit). Also the audio will just cut in out of nowhere, some aspect that was not there a moment prior.  Sometimes wind, sometimes crackling grasses etc.   Just recently I didnt hear the sound my guns were making.     There is a bug with the weapon sights and they require fidgeting with to equip at times.    There are a number of challenges this game faces, however the devs have been forthcoming and keep us up to date with regard to status of patches/plans.   Overall, I still suggest buying the game as I have gotten my moneys worth out of it already.    LOVE IT			"

												After spending almost 60 hours so far, and going through several patches and updates, the game is still full of glitches. The glitches do not effect the game play much and are minor, but thats no excuse for the release. The current state of this game is at best, of beta quality. Things like blank in game hints that do not go away, equipping newly puchased sites, and lack of weapons/clothing to buy makes this game sub-par. The previous TheHunter game is in way better condition with better content. The best things this game has are the graphics are very nice, and I personly like the way the animals interact within the world. Animals are much more frequent than the previous TheHunter, but not to the point that its boring and arcade like. All in all, this game did not live up to the level of the previous title. To do so, the devs need to have deployable content like tree stands, feeders, trail cams, and more animal species to hunt. Not recommended in its current state.			"

												Ok, so first of all, i want to state that it is very hard for me to post a review about this game.  The reason being that i have so much to say about it, making it hard to put it all together or organize it into one conclusive review on the game.  I may review this review multiple times and change or add things to it.Moving on to the actual review i would like to say, being a hunter in reality, that this game is trying its best to meet my expectations for a realistic, interactive hunting game. The graphics are absolutely incredible, I can walk almost anywhere on the reserve and either admire the view of far off areas, or simply enjoy the placement of the brush and trees in my immediate vacinity.  I admire this game for its graphic attention to detail.  The graphics are not the only thing i admire, as they do not make or break a game.  The gameplay and game mechanics are impressive as well.  The pause menu in the game impresses me for several reasons. I enjoy the design of the map and how the waypoint placement works (although a problem with previous waypoints interfering with current ones until removed is slightly annoying), the map works well and i like the ability to fast travel between discovered cabins. I enjoy the fact that missions are implemented but not essential.  I enjoy that the devs focused on both main styles of hunting, ambushing and stalking, and the available skills for both styles. I enjoy that with certain skills you actually have to activate them to use them, and that some have a cool down time. Personally i think it makes it more challenging, and makes you think more.  Moving on to the animals in the game... I like the fact that different animals react differently than others.  Not all animals react the same to sight, smell, and sound as others.  Implimenting those differences is attention to detail that i appreciate as a gamer and a hunter.  The only constructive criticizm i can give, is that i hope they plan to add a massive about of different species including different game sizes. An example being multiple small game type animals having their own scoring.  Moving to maps... I truly enjoy the detail put into developing both of the maps.  They are both huge and there are so many different areas to explore and new sights to see.  I have no complaints about the maps that already exist.  The only thing i coult hope for is that they add several more, just as intricate maps, from all over the world with scores of different species for each area.  Overall i think this game is amazing.  It is the game i have been waitng for since Big Game Hunter.  The ""Perfect"" hunting game.  Although they are onto an amazing start, i think there is always so much more they can add to eventually make this the most amazing hunting experience available without actually going into the woods with a gun.  If i had to add one suggestion to the game... It would be this...  I think it would be an amazing idea to add a trophy room to the game.  It should be a building you have to find in each region.  When you locate this ""trophy room"", and claim it, it should display a spot on the wall for each species in the area.  Each space should contain a mount of the largest scoring animal you have harvested of that species.  Along with a list of every other animal you have harvested in that species. Every time you harvest a bigger scoring animal of that species, the wall mount should be replaced with that animal.  This game is amazing.  Overall i have no complaints.  I look forward to seeing where this game goes and i am sure that i will enjoy it regardless.			"

Ive tried reinstalling the game many times and trying all these tips online of how to fix it but they don't help and it still always crashes at the loading screen.

												With many things needed to be smoothed out, the UI is a bit buggy where I cannot exit it sometimes by pressing escape. simple fix. I've found many animals all bunched up on eachother. I killed a 10 point at 208 meters and he clipped into a tree and slowly rose up the tree. A few bugs but i love it already. Gonna end up with about 1000 hours in by the end of the year.

												This is my gaming profile with regards to this game:-Not a hunter in RL- have an account of The Hunter classic but never really played it past a few hours because of the pay model.- My computer exceed the recommended system requirement.First of all, this game has by far the best graphically reproduce forest I have ever seen. The graphics are amazing especially during sun set. I only have about 6 hours of play yet but so far on my computer I still have to encounter any major glitches or issues.The game is smooth on very high setting on my computer which makes me believe they might be some hardware compatibility issues to be fix in future patches because a lot of people are complaining about the game being unplayable. Not the case on my computer.Yes there are some bugs, the UI could be much better and there are some animals behavior that are arguable but nothing that can't be fix. Overall I have seen a whole lot worst than that for launch. It is not a perfect game but it is half the price of a full AAA game, the developers are listening to us so far and the potential with future DLC is amazing.I recommend this game for my part if you like or think you would like hunting game. Be responsible, make sure your computer fits the bill and be patient or wait a little longer until the game mature more before getting the game if you are unable to stands the smaller amount of issues.

												Looking at others reviews, and the mix crowd, I will definitely agree that this game could use some 'fine-touches'. The one-time-purchase of this game's price tag of $29.99 might be steep for those who are unsure if they want it. My advice is don't, unless you know what you will enjoy about it. Try the original, The Hunter (think its called The Hunter Classic now if I'm not mistaken). If you like what's in there, the free part of it that is, you may like what's in here. Do note that this game will have in-game currency to allow you to buy and upgrade, much like EA's other title: The Hunter Primal, a title you may or may not have tried, but if you do then I advice just getting this game since it is looking far more promising. I have played both, and enjoyed them. With friends its more fun. So should you get this game? Ask yourself, do you like hunting? Do you like trekking? Do you like the outdoors? Do you just want to shoot something? Do you like steak and the smell of cooked meat over the fire? That last question doesn't have context to the game, but if you said yes to all those questions then, yes, you may enjoy this game and should get it!Now my experience with it so far:Barely playing up to the hour, this game is a step-up and a new future into the genre of hunting game. The sound effects are well done, to my taste. The visual is good. I don't have a heavy duty gaming PC, so I won't be playing on Ultra settings, however, the game is still enjoyable to play (perhaps much better than The Hunter Classic) minus the faulty shader/shadow bugs on my character's hand... but that stopped bothering me 5 minutes into the game. I have yet to play a little more, but I like it so far! Forgetting all the possible things you can enable and disable to allow your ""challenge"" of the game, this game so far, have live up to my expectations. I have not dwell into the game far enough to know if there are ""too many animals"". At the start of the game along with the tutorial I only manage to spot a red fox, a roe, and some bunnies! I'm eager to try this out more when I have my friends along.This is a long awaited game that's worth the wait, especially when you have some friends rearing to go. Let the trigger-happy-go-gunners commence!			"

												Exeptional hunting game, there is none out there at the moment like this one.The goods: NO MICROTRANSACTIONS, thank god, thank you!!Graphics are beyond beautiful. 10/10 - Rain effects are the best i'v seen in an open world game. Sound design is also fantastic 10/10Animals are good and far better from most hunting games, but they have some flaws. (Get stuck, don't react to the player)Open worldQuest/mission system is really good and the whole game got this fantastic vibe. I know people want vehicles, but finally a game were we don't drive and dive the animals. Endless stunning forests and open fields you can watch while walking around.Night gameplay is really intense. Cons:Prices of gear you can buy in this game is insane. The American hunting ground seems very broken. There are animals all over the place, i came upon 5 moose, 3 bears and 5 + Deers at the same area. ruined it for me so i switched over to european hunting grounds. Animals have no ragdoll animation To get some of the ""Scents"" you need to reach level 39. what?GIVE ME THIS GAME IN VR!If you like hunting. This is your game. 9/10			"

												I've played a 3 hour long sitting now and didn't experience any bugs whatsoever. Maybe i'm just lucky but i think all the bad reviews complaining about bugs are the vocal minority.I've played classic on and of since back in 2009 and enjoyed it, except for the subscription / pay-for-everything model and the insanely short draw distance of animals. Both are fixed in this release with an added layer of story missions and leveling progression. Personally i think it's great and adds another level of reward besides the joy of taking down a big buck, but the gamification of the most realistic hunting game on the market might not be for everyone.This is now my go-to version of theHunter whenever i feel the urge to hunt.

Product received for free
												A game that rewards patience, skill and a certain about of inititive.Initially beginning, for myself, a little bit quiet, one rather quickly learned that in order to get anything from the game, he would have to adapt his amateurish attempts at rushing through a forest and hoping to stumble upon an animal.Once you temper your desires thus, the game enters a period whereby you are thouroughly rewarded, and the thrill of chasing an animal through the undergrowth, utilising a mixture of your own inititive and common sense as you negotiate your way through the undergrowth and scenery in a careful manner, lest you disturb the animal and prolong the chase. When finally you take the shot and the reward is yours, it is most certainly a rewarding endeavour.Many different hunting weapons and styles are available, by utilising either a handgun, rifle, shotgun or even a bow - each comes with different ammunition available, allowing for a high degree of customisation.TL;DR,Fun game, rewarding, apply common sense.Recommended highly!

												Pros:1) Beautiful game, best immersion and wild life environment I have ever seen.  Scenery and animals are gorgeous looking.2) Realistic AI.

												I'll start this off by saying that if you want a full, complete, bugless game, this is not for you. However...I have to say this is the best hunting game I have ever palyed. It's beautiful, it has co-op and although the ui is a bit buggy, all the most important parts work near flawlessly. Likewise, the last few days have proven to me that the devs care at least a little about fixing these bugs and glitches, especially on multiplayer. However this game still has a lot of bugs and glitches, nothing game-breaking so far but still annoying. Thankfully most can be solved by quickly quitting and launching the game again.			"

												This isn't an easy review. As the game still has several bugs and a terrible UI. But the UI is manageable if you are somewhat presistent. It takes a bit of fiddling in order to figure it out. My main annoyance was the fact that I couldn't figure out how to replenish my ammo. Highly annoying in a game where bullets play a key role. Yet in the end I managed.The rest of the game is great. While the scenery is great and the animals behaviour feels realistic, I like the fact that you're not being help by the hand. All hints and tips can be disabled and the game leaves you alone to hunt. That is exactly what I needed on a grey saturday afternoon. Just let me walk and stalk a whitetail deer for 15 minutes, and focus on taking a kill shot. In the same line, the game gives feedback on your shot and hunting skills but again without smashing it in your face. After collecting the kill, you get a type of score board with all the information. Perfectly ignorable, not advisable if you want to become good and are sick of following a blood trail.All in all, I've decided that I like this game. The required focus and yet the casual manner that you're allowed to play in make this a game for casual players and people that really want to master it. I would recommend this game as one of the better hunting games currently out there. But we'll have to be honest and agree that the competition isn't that steep. Adjust your expectations to average and you'll have an enjoyable experience.			"

												This game has a decent base to progress from, but in its current state is lacking a little. It feels like an early access game with all the bugs and i feel like it could greatly benefit from adding some sort of fishing element. Perhaps even the ability to cut your own tree's as another resource type, or to build a temporary lookout/hut/boat. You NEED to be able to unlock things whilst in multiplayer because your endless walking and hunting feels unrewarded. Or at the very least be able to teleport where your friends have unlocked so you dont have to run forever to find your friends. The levelling/progression system feels a bit harsh, i don't think it should be easy to unlock new items however the current way of levelling feels a little too steep. Graphically it looks really nice and the sounds are for the most part great, apart from ridiculously loud critter movements. This game should have been about half the price it currently is, or held back for half a year or so to iron out the bugs and lack of content / in-game systems. Pros: GraphicsHunting is fun despite lack of animals Huge mapMultiplayer, although bugged, could be amazing. Has great potentialCons: Bugs, Menu systems and lack of in-game content/things to do other than shooting.. (e.g give us the ability to build things after cutting wood etc) Multiplayer is too strict in terms of spawning location and not letting you unlock outposts or points of interest. Feels unfinished Not enough animals Leveling system is too slow			"

												TLDR; The price tag of $29.99 is steep for the current state of the game and it feels like we are in an early access game that is ridden with bugs. With that being said, it is a beautiful game and I really enjoy it but the bugs do take away a lot of fun. I would wait for an update to buy it. I can not currently recommend it unless serious changes are made to the game.-----Full Review-----I am pretty frustrated because this game has so much potential. This is a gorgeous game and the concept is simply amazing. The devs really should be hiding their faces in embarassment at the moment. It truly feels like a very long time was put into the creation of the game and then they ran out of money and released it as an unfinished product. I encountered my first bug within seconds of playing the game, where the screen was unbareably blurry for the first 7 or 8 minutes of gameplay.A primary issue - The pathing of WildlifeThe pathing is completely ridiculous. Often times when you fire at a game species they freeze in place after you hit them. I am not referring to a shocked hault, I am referring to a glitchy sudden abrupt freeze of the animation. They stay there for 3-5 seconds until you shoot them again and might take a step or two. I also noticed that after you shoot an animal, they run in a 10 x 20 area in the woods in circles, and you can walk straight up to them and keep shooting at the ground and they will just keep running in circles. This is very frustrating.A second issue - The death of the WildlifeWhy do animals die standing up? They are frozen in place and sometimes hovering off the ground. There is absolutely no transition between a stationary deer and death at times, this is especially frustrating.A third issue - The hit registryI was able to walk up on a 12 point buck and get legitimately right next to it (due to the glitches and terrible pathing of the current state of the game) and I scoped in on my rifle and took a headshot at the buck (because there is an achievement to kill a certain amount of wildlife with headshots). This was an extremely easy shot because the animal was stationary. I put two headshots at point blank range in the deer and then he randomly galloped off and I had to go on an 8 minute chase where he proceeded to take two more body shots and finally collapsed (in a terribly awkward and buggy position).----- Final Thoughts -----Why was this game that has so much potential to be amazing released with so many bugs that simply make this game unplayable. I can not even complete some of the missions such as taking a photo (with the in game camera) of the Fallow Deer, because of bugs. This game is no where near ready to be played by the public. It should be labeled as early access or an open beta and the price tag should be dropped to around 10-12 USD for the current state of the game. I would love to recommend this game to my friends but I simply can not with the current state of the game.Developers ----- Fix these game breaking issues and save your game before it is too late. You should already be ashamed that you released such an unfinished product. "

												I'd like to say I love the idea of the game. However, I do not recommend it because it just isn't playable.After 40 minutes (!!!) of moving around I finally got my first kill. I understand that a hunter needs patience, but this is just ridiculous. There should be many more animal spawns and they shouldn't be able to detect you so easily.. They run off and it's impossible to catch up to them. There's too much grass/brush/trees in the maps that scare them off when you walk. Either minimize the sound you make when walking through them or stop filling the maps with them... I hate the fact you have to walk 24/7 whilst playing the game because if you run they will run immediately. Sooooo boring.I also hit a deer in the head and it still started running away? Wtf? I had to chase it for 5 minutes before I found it dead on the ground. In my opinion a headshot should be an instant kill, at least on a small deer.I honestly think the game is broken (and therefor, boring) right now. Takes way too long to find an animal to track and once you do, there's a large chance of it just running away as fast as you get near it. Please fix this because I'd love to start playing this game 24/7.			"

												I don’t understand theHunter: Call of the Wild. That isn’t some philosophical remark, I don’t understand how to play the game. I don’t understand how to hunt effectively. I don’t understand how to stalk an animal properly. I don’t understand why animals want to mate even after having just been shot. I don’t understand why the game is so buggy. I don’t understand how it could have been released in the state it is in. theHunter: Call of the Wild is a bad hunting game, and it doesn’t have anything else going for it.https://tiny-spaceship.com/2017/04/03/thehunter-call-of-the-wild/ "

												A game that rewards patience, skill and a certain about of inititive.Initially beginning, for myself, a little bit quiet, one rather quickly learned that in order to get anything from the game, he would have to adapt his amateurish attempts at rushing through a forest and hoping to stumble upon an animal.Once you temper your desires thus, the game enters a period whereby you are thouroughly rewarded, and the thrill of chasing an animal through the undergrowth, utilising a mixture of your own inititive and common sense as you negotiate your way through the undergrowth and scenery in a careful manner, lest you disturb the animal and prolong the chase. When finally you take the shot and the reward is yours, it is most certainly a rewarding endeavour.Many different hunting weapons and styles are available, by utilising either a handgun, rifle, shotgun or even a bow - each comes with different ammunition available, allowing for a high degree of customisation.TL;DR,Fun game, rewarding, apply common sense.Recommended highly!

Reaslism is great and all but come on man the foot steps are so loud that everything within 200yrds just takes off running with one step. So now let me just crouch and crawl in prone for 3hrs to try and get a kill. Its rather annoying. so unless you have all sorts of time to sit down play this game crawling for hrs I wouldnt recommend it.			"

												While it has it's issues, like animals getting stuck (ATM) it is still very fun and rewarding. I myself only had 2 animals get stuck ever. But when it doesn't bug out it is fairly real, animals move well and act realistic. If it gets shot in the leg it will be slow and limp, if you hit its head (and miss brain) it will hold it's head down. If it's bleeding out it lays down. The only thing that is slightly strange sometimes if you don't move does will walk up to you. But hey honesly where I live they do that, haha. I think it will be fixed, the good thing is though animals don't all run when you breathe like in many sims it takes a little bit to spook them if they don't bug out. Tracking and bagging feels more fun and real to me than classic. It may have bugs, but honestly it is still fun and very good looking ( if you don't have a potato) Remember, this is a pretty much updated thehunter with wayyy more veiw distance and way better foliage. Don't forget this, if you don't havea decent pc stick to the old one. It will be patched for the amd users though they said I think. If you like hunting or just pretty areas this is for you, the graphics all in all are very pretty and the sound is great. I feel like I am in my woods when I see those sun sets and rises. I think if we keep giving the devs input and they work with us, this will be the best hunting sim I have tried, this is up there by far as one of the best even with the bugs. I have disliked some stuff they did before, but this is very good and can be the best if we keep working with them.			"

												Well here goes for my first ever review.... 22nd of the 3rdHonestly as soon as i began to play this game i felt it hands down needs a good thumbs up added to the reviews section!TheHunter Call Of The Wild is such a supurb game, although i dont have stacks of hours yet since i have not long had the game, it gets me hooked for hours on end!what i really love is how incredibly amazing the world looks, from the different times of the day, sun position with god rays beaming through tree lines, golden hour at the end of the day as you slowly make your way across an open cornfield to the dense forests with heavy downpour... It all looks so incredble and then as you are making you way through the land you have all the ambient sounds that sound so crisp and real, i found myself many times just walking, taking in the scenery and listening to all the ambient sounds, the wind gusts, birds chirping in the trees, the crunch as you trudge through the different types of ground. i get so lost in the atmosphere and kind of just zone out on what im actually meant to be doing...... and then you hear a warning call and some footsteps from one of the many animals in the game and you instantly get your game face on, trying to move slowly and silently towards the direction of the sounds you are hearing while trying not to spook the animal into running away. Binoculars out trying to get a tag and some information about what you are about to shoot, you crouch down and get your rifle out, line up your shoot through your scope waiting for the animal to turn broadside for that perfect shot on the lungs/heart and you squeeze the trigger to hear one of the best gunshot sounds you will ever hear in a game, honestly! the crack roars across the landscape echoing into the distance while you watch to see if you dropped the animal on the spot or if it still has some fight left in it and begins running off and then you start to track it to its final resting place to claim your trophy.I honestly have hardly come across any flaws in this game except for when an animal is trying to run they will sometimes get stuck in between two tree's running on the spot, while it gives you an easy trophy you somewhat have to feel bad for taking such a cheap shot. other then that this is an amazing game and definitely worth investing the money into the game, it will satisfy you greatly.It can be a bit slow at times but that is all apart of it, dont expect to be just running flat out everywhere shooting everything you see. Because the animals as you know it have much better hearing and sight then you and will forever run away from you and you will leave empty handed every time, patience is the number 1 key in this game and when you finally get that kill it is so worth it and satisfying.There is a great range of weapons and items to choose, from rifles, handguns, compound bows, shotguns and then you have your different types of ammunition to many types of animal callers and scent sprays to lure animals to you when sitting up in a tower or ground hide. You also have standard binoculars which you can upgrade to a range finder and then a set of binos with a range finder built into them.There is plenty of content to work towards and unlock so you are insure many hours of gameplay, plus all the skill and perk tree's to unlock and help you track animals that bit easier.Definitely recommend this game 10/10Ignore the bad reviews saying it is a buggy game and it runs really bad because it seriously doesn't at the time of writing this review			"

Inhale. Hold your breath. Fire.  If you are performing well the beast dies then and there, if not expect a mad dash through the forest to catch up and kill it. It's as close as you can get to a genuine, FUN, realistic hunting experience without leaving the comfort of your chair.But note that This is NOT a game for the impatient, for people who need to run and jump, for people who get bored easily, nor is it a game for the 'angry reddit neckbeards' who find fault in everything and demand the game is changed for them. This is a game that needs a lot of patience, and a calm manner - just like real hunting.			"

												This game is amazing. This might sound really off topic, but I'm a huge Skyrim Modder and I always loved adding hunting aspects to that game. I know the games are completely different, but one of the things I love in games is being able to explore and get lost in the world. This game really does an amazing job of letting you just get lost and lose track of time. The graphics are insane and when I got caught up in a thunderstorm late at night I actually jumped in my seat it was so immersive. The hunting is also amazing of course. I love being stealthy and I feel a high sense of achievement when I claim my trophies, track down animals and react to animal calls. I've been using Rifles and Bows the most. I look forward to sinking hundreds of hours in this game and for only 29.99, the game offers you enough content. It exceeded my expectations so far. Haven't personally noticed any bugs. But I also haven't been looking for them.			"

												12 hours in singleplayer, loving it. Game looks and sounds awesome and only bug that I have noticed so far was some animal being stuck. Could use an ATV for moving around long distances. And I miss the treestands and blinds from Cabela's hunting games which you could set up anywhere, here we can only use the ones that are set around the map and some of them seem to be in bad locations.+ Looks great+ Sounds great+ Gun handling+ Sounds- No freely placeable treestands or ground blinds or other similiar equipment- Lack of bird hunting- No vehicles(ATV? Bikes? Bicycles?) but we do have roads- Sound related bugs (sometimes sounds like gun shots and animal calls don't play out)- Animals stuck few times- No winter/winter maps- No exit to main menu, only desktop8/10 Will hunt again			"

												This game is addictive!I havent played any hunting games since back when the cabelas hunting games were half decent ie. outdoor adventures 2006. This game even with all its current flaws is F*%$ing Awesome! Stalking down an animal and finally getting that kill after a bloody long period of time feels so rewarding! There are many bad reviews on here but alot of them are from people who have invested themselves deeply in the previous game and where expecting EVERYTHING to be absolutely perfect or as it was in the previous game, typical spoilt humans lol. Ive played for 20 or so hours and enjoyed every second of it!If you are looking for a huning game that is well made with a few glitches here and there, looks absolutely amazing and has the potential to be the best hunting game to date with future dlc and updates i suggest you buy this game right now!10/10 will be spending many more hours tracking down animals and pumping them full of lead!

												Very good game but still lacking many features.  Wish it looked better on an Ultra wide monitor though.. It claims it supports the resolution but it still seems streched out.  Have to throw in my old 16:9 monitor when playing for the game to look great.  The price is a little up there for the current build of the game, but you sorta have to have a little like for hunting to enjoy the game.  Excited to see the future, as long as the devs listen to the community and work with us! :)			"

												I really enjoy this game, it has an awesome tracking system, I like that there are missions and objectives, trinkets to collect, a MASSIVE (maybe to big) map and lots of different animals. There are plenty of flaws though. For instance everytime I've shot a bear, it charges, gets in my face, and turns around. It repeats this cycle until I finally shoot it enough with my wee little .223 for it to die. It'd be cool if there were some sort of Trophy Room like I used to see in the Deer Hunter games, or better yet, a cabin you could customize? Hint* Hint* Nudge* Nudge* development team I'm talking to you. Anyways, there is lots of walking involved and fast traveling from what I can tell is only available to be used to Warden outposts. I've only put a couple hours in and will probalby edit this if anything new is found out. All that said. I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME.			"

												Great sim, true to the original in most respects.   A few minor bugs, but nothing that ruined my 4-hour long hunt (at least not until the very end, but more on that later).   Nice graphics, an environment that pulls you in and a nice change of pace from fast-paced shooters.   Was in a tower and shot downwards at a really nice buck, missed his vitals and spent the next couple of hours stalking him.  Finally got him well after dark, what a task.   It reminded me of the original game in that you really felt like you'd been on a hunt and had created a memory that you want to share with others that play the game.I only experienced these bugs, and most didn't create any issues in playing/enjoying the game, as I know they will be fixed soon:- My gun makes no noise when fired, you see the smoke and the recoil and it hits the animal, but no sound- My animal calls/lures only make sound once every 5 or 6 times they are used- There was a thin line on my GPS in the map and when I approached it there was an invisible wall I couldn't pass.  At first I thought maybe I had hit the edge of the map, but it was close to the start.  Had to walk along the invisible wall for about 20 feet before it let me pass, then I went back to see if it was still there and it had cleared- The only bad bug (that would affect gameplay in a major way) is when I hit around midnight in-game all of the animals froze.   I was trying to call in a buck that I'd heard and I saw his harem first (the does) and they wouldn't move.  The buck kept calling and I waited several minutes before I figured out that they were stuck.  I approached them all and they could look around, but not move in any direction.  Luckily, this was at the end of my 4-hour initial session.Despite the early flaws, this game is fantastic.   I had been waiting a long time for a new version of this game and it was worth the wait...			"

												Honest review? If you are a classic player and you like how it is set up dont buy this... I have been playing classic for over 3 years now and I will never ever EVER even compare these two games. Yes I know it is supposed to be a different style game but they legit shoved their hand up the Cabelas hunting games butt and pulled out COTW. Sure you can turn off some of the tutorials and stuff but its still not the same. I have a decent PC and could only run this game on medium/high with anywhere from 30-70 fps. Hands down the worst game I've hyped up in a longggg time! Have fun if you end up buying this junk.			"

												UPDATE AS OF 2/26/17... the latest patch fixed my crashing/game breaking bug for about a full day of playing.  Same as before with the bug beginning very irregularly, but progressing to the point where I am unable to play 5 minutes of this game before freezing up my PC and having to shut everything down.  Would really like to play devs.UPDATE AS OF 2/28/17...10 days after launch and still cannot play.  Good news is they pinged me with a live stream announcment so I can watch the game i cannot play, that I payed money for, that i cannot run past 60 seconds after loading in.  Great.Ok guys Im going for the honest no salt review here.  I will also start with the bad because Im hoping it all gets fixed.  Its not a totally negative review so keep reading.THE BAD - I cant play.  At about ~24 hours in I had found some bugs, most it did not take too much effort to find work arounds but at that 24 hour mark it tanked.  30 minutes into a play session I had my first major crash... game froze, audio loop playing the same half second of audio over and over, and I couldnt even exit to the desktop or use task manager to shut it down.  Had to turn off the PC completely and fire it back up.  The next playthrough the same thing happened in about 5 minutes... rinse and repeat this until I could get ZERO time in before locking up.  I uninstalled/reinstalled and this got me through about 3 hours of gameplay and then all the previous stuff I mentioned happened all over again.  Like I said, I cannot play.  I have a nice set up and really the only thing different from my rig than most others is the SLI.  Im at a loss on this one and its frustrating.THE GOOD - This game is a plesant mix of sim and arcade.  There are enough moments of ""nothing"" to make it seem like a sim, but theres also enough going on to keep it from getting boring.... to all the hardcore sim guys out there, hunting for a week in real life not killing anything is still entertaining, doing it in a game is lame and no one would play that.  The graphics are not ground breaking but the lighting, effects, and scale of things make it seem more polished than it probably is (its pleasant walking through the forrest).  As far as the hunter classic went I thought that was a garbage game, I thought it looked like trash, played about the same, and the pay model was a complete rip off.  This game on the other hand is worth the asking price as long as they fix what is above.  Not that it has much competition but it quickly became my favorite hunting game.THE MEH - The sound, no surround option, why WHY!?  Random light glitchyness and mildly annoying bugs.  The menus, specifically the loadout/store menu is really unpolished.  It also wont save my settings.  THE I WISH - I wish there was a visual difference in the animal racks, not just small and big along with an arbitrary ""trophy score"" once you harvest the animal.  I wish there was 4wheelers.  I wish small game hunting mattered (cannot harvest upon killing/no XP).  I wish guns were more true to life with their penetration instead of the arcady ""weapon balance"" to make different calibers arbitrarily matter.  I wish there was a hardcore mode so the sim guys could get their fix along with much more of a challenge.  I wish there was waterfowl hunting... and upland birds... and hunting dogs, please give us some quail and grouse.			"

Found deer droppings. 10/10 would cover face in deer dooky and eat the little brown M&Ms again.But no seriously, I am enjoying the game so far. No game breaking bugs encountered yet. It can be difficcult to track down an animal, but I'm just starting out and there are skill points to use to increase the stats of your character, just like in real life where with practice you get better at hunting and tracking. :)Runs great with settings maxed at 1440P, but that is on a god-like rig.

God only knows what crap systems these devs are using but its clearly not a modern setup they say they have I think been working on this title for a few years now Im not sure what they've been doing in that time but it isnt making a game that works on modern setups. BLOODY GUTTED but not surprised now i will await the patches which i hope will soon get this game working.			"

												It feels like an early beta. You have to edit config files with a text-editor to have your audio/video settings saved.Basically it feels just like the old theHunter classic they released a few years ago for free. The graphics are fancier, though I would expect more performance and better optics these days. Take witcher for example. High performance combined with pixelperfect graphics. Even animals seems more realistic.To adress only some bugs: misbehaving animals (sometimes large groups that seem to collide with each other and trees), missing inventory from time to time, invisible/unusable tools, no ammo even though you had some, missing or unrealistic soundeffects, heavy weather effects, random crashes, random weapon unequiping, sometimes traces to follow, sometimes no highlighting of traces, multiplayer laggy, missing basic UI elements (e.g. you cant go back to main menu, there is no option for it - even in multiplayer you have to quit the whole game and start it again), rifle scope becomes unusable after using bow zoom, ...I would recommend you to not buy this game until the developers fix some bugs.But I have to recall a little and admit that it still is fun. It's hard to oversee these bugs but it's possible.			"

Additionally there needs to be an additional way of quickly traveling around the map.

Developers are quick to patch the bugs that others have already reported. It’s a shame that those who left negative reviews will likely not return for another chance. People are so delicate these days and expect perfection on the first day.			"

												I haven't experienced any gamebreaking bugs so far. The only bug was that my character was aiming to the air at all time according to my coop partner. The graphics and sound design is great and helps build a living world which I see myself spending multiple hours in the upcoming weeks. Other than that I think it's a very immersive and calming experience which definitely is worth the lower cost of the game.			"

												This is a really basic hunting game. It's on par with the ps2 Cabela's hunting games. Except  with more glitches. Honestly, any of Cabela's games would probably be better as they are generally more polished. The only catergory this wins in is the tracking and open tag hunting. Maybe pick it up on sale.Oh and don't even think about alt tabbing as when I did, audio totally broke even after a game reload.			"

I had to wait 5 days after i bought it before i could play, i dont know what took them so long to actually fix that. 3. Playing multipalyer? AWsome, untill you cant harvest the animal you stalked for 30 min. 4. Pathetic forum admins. 5. No respons what so ever from devs. 6. Spend you money on something else.This game is just too damn frustrating atm. Wait some months.			"

												DO NOT start a new game, just DO NOT DO THAT. You will loose any progress - money, xp, lvl, bought equipment. The only advise I have is buy another game and delete this if you have it already, best advise. They wont help you with your problem either, they realy just dont care about gameplay. Play the old thehunter instead if you realy need to play this game. Way to early for release and they are being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to fix issues, clearly dont care about users and gameplay at all. Makes me ♥♥♥♥ing sad and annoyd. Refund it if your under 2 hours of gameplay asap!			"

												The scenery is gorgeous in this realistic hunting simulator! It pulls you in to a certain state where you're so intensely focused on the task at hand that you can't think about anything else. Getting close to an animal is an adrenaline rush!Living up to the simulator genre, don't expect to bring anything down when you're first starting out. Kills require patience and understanding of the systems (weather conditions etc) and the game encourages you to hone your skills.			"

The thing is that i don't have the patient to look for animal.Into the game for 1hrs and 10mins, only killed 2 blackbear and miss a shot on the deer.which is kind of disappointment. there is barely a bug or a glitch i not sure about. i was going to close the program but i was stuch on the middle of the river.I hope they can have a voice chat on multiplayer as well, but i think that just gonna distract other gamer's gaming exprience.All around the MAP where you want to find animal, you either found most of the ' PooP ' or ' FootSteps '.Graphic is SUPERB. got to say this LOUDLY.

												I'm not happy with the game to be honest. I spend 90% of the time just walking. I'm really annoyed. There is also something wrong with the sounds. I hope there are more updates coming because if it stays like this then it's just useless space in my pc and I'd rather unistall it. Sometimes I call a deer then it rains and I can't hear the deer's steps closing snd so it runs away and just a lot of time wasted. It requires not to walk into small bushes to not make loud sound while the whole place is full of them. I have to squeez my eyes to spot animals and then my head hurts. Pressure points put more pressure and annoyment on player. Can you make the sound of a fleeing deer louder. More open places so I can actually see something. Before I play I'm excited and it always end up the same. Just walking walking and more walking !!..Did you mistakely name it the hunter but the original name is the walker? Yea that's how much♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm.			"

												I crouched around the the map from 30 minutes, encountering no animals, which was extremely fun and a great usage of my time. Also, the lack of fast travel spots is painful, as if i ran out of ammo i had to leave my location to go back to the starting lodge and then be back to where i started.			"

												Read any other negative review to see why I'm not recommending. Plus there's a reason it's tagged walking simulator. You might argue that a hunting game is a walking sim because you pick a direction and walk in it and hunt any animals you can find. Except you're given tasks, and if you want to get to the location of the task you have to walk there. Bam, hello 10+ mins of running. And you can't fast travel to any hunting structures you've built, which only adds to the annoyng walking. E.g., when you start the game you spawn at a lodge you've 'claimed', then you can fast travel to any other lodge you've claimed, but then you still have to walk alllll the way to wherever your task is.

												This game worth the 30 eur as a walking simulator only. Seriously... just take a look at my screenshot library: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198144640735/screenshots/There is a significant ammount of bugs yes, but the devs are working on it to slowly but surely make the game much,much better. If you can't stand bugs at any level, you can skip this for now. Wait another 2-3 months, and then buy it. But if you can accept some little annoying bugs, and love nature/sight and hunting, i recommend you to buy this!I'm playing pc games for like 15 (or so) years now, but this is the most beutiful and realistic open world map i ever saw. Seriously! You can see for yourself, that the devs are worked their asses off with the design, and the whole map(s). That is already worth the 30 eur in my opinion. Sometimes i realise that i played for 1 hour and doesn't even shoot one bullet... but that 1 hour not passed away with boring walking. Rather walked with excitement and open mouth, and shoot some nice pics :) And i played for 50+ hours just on Hirschfelden (one of the 2 maps). Of course the hunting aspect of the game is good too. Rifles(all guns) have realistic recoil, and aiming. There is no penalty (so far at least) in the game. So you can shoot at anything you want. There are plenty of animals to shoot, and enough present on the map when you are actually in the game. So you don't have to worry about getting a ""walking simulator"".If you are not interested in beutiful sights :) But belive me, this game is absolutely worth a try!			"

												My specs: 16 Gigs RAM/Aero GTX 1070/ Intel i7-7700kUpdate: So the game after playing over 100 hours still has bugs. But they have been putting out patches frequently to fix the bugs but sometimes fixing the bugs makes other bugs so it has been frustrating at times having things happen that break the immersion of hunting. I still am going to be positive about the future of this game and still say I like it. I mean walking around in 4k is just wonderful as I am all for open worlds.Consumers: But if you want a working game you may want to wait a month or two to see how this game develops and see if the devs can fix the major issues with the game.Old review:Bought the game today. Played 4 hours and the game ran well. The only issues I had as of today was some texture issues which I would think will be fixed eventually. Overall, my experience was fine though. Playing with friends will be a whole lot more fun than playing alone. I am not really a hunting fanatic. I just like playing hunting games for simple fun. If you like hunting games buy this.Not sure why the downvotes but here is video to show game play and there is more on my page.

												HIS WILL HAVE TWO PARTS PVE AND PVP.PVEso i got the game. make a toon it has 1,2,3,4, pages of making one. then time to give it a name. name i want is taken ok but... it backs me out to page 1 and i have to repick everything for my toon again. this took like 15m as i really wanted a variant of that name. so now i get to long into game. befor i even move using w,a,s,d, i fall thro the floor of the viking area into water. ok its a new game so i relog get back into game now i am on a floor and i am able to use w,a,s,d, and read all the tool tips. now this part of the game i loved the graphics looked good, sound was great. i leave the main town i am atked by and npc right near the exit of the main town. i ran not knowing what lv the npc was and the town guards killed it. the controls are close to mount and blade warband and so is combat. i join a guild all nice guys and gave me a few tips. also i read a bit about the game befor i got it so i would know how to spend my str, dex, hp, points. so i was told i should go at lv 1 and kill lv 1-9 npcs near town i did but i found a lv 23 when i was only lv 2. i was able to kill it and i had 75% or so of my hp left. only do this if you are good at mount and blade warband as the exp is well worth it. so imo pve is greatPVPok so i goto a town with pplz from my clan we atk said town it had no players that i could see. a few npcs. we break a few gates with our spears and swords and take said town. i get paid for helping kinda like a mini quest i guss. then i goto a tournament where if you die you lose nothing ok great good way to get exp and test my skills. haha lol. its 19 vs 21 we had the 21. so its what team can get more kills in say 10m. its was 13 to over 100 near the end of the tournament my side lost. the lag i went thro was bad. i would be hitting someone and think i am doing great next thing i knew i was on the floor dead while the person i thought i was atking had little to no dmg. so imo PVP needs a lot of work befor its worth anything and since its the main part of the game well to me anyways i would say wait to get this game till they fix lag also i would say game is worth as is 10.00-15.00 so wait for a sale.

												Well i used to play TheHunter Classic a lot and COTW is very much better in graphics, I had a crash but not anymore after I Dl the last driver.. :)  The bad thing about the game in its current states is the animals getting stucks to clif, and mountains.. So I play only in the forest far away from the clif and then i dont enconter any buged animals. Maybe a better animal detail is needed, they look kinda ugly once dead. But yea enjoy the game, they patch it often :)			"

												Very fun and addicting game. Minor bug fixes that need to be fixed; waypoint is off, animals will randomly get stuck, lures sometimes work, this game should be at an ""early access"" yes. this shouldn't and I hope isn't the final game, only 3 hours of play time and I am hooked already, could be some other minor bugs I haven't picked up yet, but great overall game so far, keep up the good work!

												First off this game does seem similiar to what you would expect in an early access... regardless I still recommend this game. I'm going to start with the cons then transition to the pros I find in this game.Cons:a) Many bugs. The scope will sometimes bug out and it wont actually scope in and there is NO fix other than restarting (this applies to most bug's solutions). The terrain can be buggy in certain parts of the reservatins, mainly in the mountains because you can prone and see under the map. There are more smaller ones but those are the ones I encounter frequently.b) Multiplayer is near useless. If you want to get the full experience of the game I think the multiplayer actually TAKES from the experience. Only the host can interact with things on the reservation. The game has no tracker for who has the highest trophy score at the moment. The only semi-fun thing you can do with your friends is the multiplayer challenges. c) I'm not 100% sure about this but I'm pretty sure the game is poorly optimized. There are areas in the reservations which fps drops to hell, these points wont even make sense why it's dropping (I've gotten fps drop looking at the face of the rock). If you encounter a herd of deer and they all begin to trot or run at the same time the game can completely♥♥♥♥♥♥itself, I've had some friend's games crash because of this.Pros:a) The game is beautiful, I don't think I need to elaborate.b) Guns feel great, it definitely has a pretty good selection to choose from. The integrity mechanic regarding the guns is a good way to incite diversity in your hunting. The grind that it takes to get better weapons is also fun imo, some people may shy away from grinding but it's nice to not run through a game in < 20 hours.c) Every patch makes this game almost 2x better. Their polishing the gameplay and fixing bugs each patch and I'm assuming they'll move on to more 'fun' additions to the game. The developers are listening to the community which is nice, the changes are coming and that's all I really need to know for the future of this game's development.Verdict: Basically early access but worth the price. Not for the impatient players.			"

												As an avid Thehunter classic player way back from 2010 -2011, (600 hours)   I was very excited to recieve an email stating that a NEW hunter game is coming out, sadly i didnt get into the beta BUT i was able to get the game after release, Below is just a quick list of Pros/Cons and a few reccomendations.First we start with the pros as of 3/8/2017- Graphics are pretty, im only on high/medium and get stable 50-60 fps- Load times are pretty quick.- The animal sounds and gun sounds are amazing, i cant tell you how i love the sound of the handguns.- Wind direction told to you for free on the compass instead of using a wind spray like in hunter classic.- Now with the new movement and sound system, Stalking is a breeze that has a good flexibility in gameplay.- Calls sound great.And now the cons,- THE RAIN!- The loudness of the rain and wind is deafening on a headset.- The music is cool at the start but quickly becomes annoying in stalking and is ridiculously loud even on the lowest settings.- There is a bug causing crashes thats been plauging me, not sure of the cause. In fullscreen i would have to restart my computer because there was no way to close nothing would respond, but im windowed i can force close it.- Animals running in circles when you call them in.- The perks and skills need a little love, the later tiers are really underpowered.- The ammo is super high priced, unless your an amazing shot you dont make alot of money using the better guns.- The guns are hard to unlock and take alot of grinding. I have 46 hours played in less than a week.- Bison are uncallable.- The missions are really hard sometimes and rely on pure luck.- Missions using the ""take a picture of (x)"" missions are buggy and annoying to get the right picture that it will accept.- 65% of things in the store are still too expensive.Now this is not an indepth review, just a quick throw out for anyone browsing the reviews thinking to buy. Things im noticing at this exact moment.At this exact moment i will give this game a 7/10, Would love to see more guns added a better variation of game and more variety of furs and patterns on the animals.

												Do I recommend this game? I'll say ""Probably, but not yet.""theHunter: COTW does many things very well. It's much more polished in many respects than I was anticipating. The gameplay is relaxing and fun, so long as you have reasonable expectations going in. But as of this writing, there are several very serious bugs (and even more less-serious ones) which make it hard to fully enjoy. The dev team seems fairly active and responsive to feedback, and they've fixed several bugs. But there are a lot left, and that makes it hard to recommend. If this game looks interesting to you, put it on your wishlist and come back in a month or two. If they've fixed the major bugs at that point (and haven't released a thousand nickel-and-dime DLCs), then it will be well worth the purchase.			"

												After 50 hours of gameplay I can make a review not based on emotion. TLDR: If you like hunting games, or want a different experience from the action games / FPS, buy it! Graphics:The game is beautiful. Landscapes are gorgeous. Lighting is awesome. Wind is awesome, leaves flying with the direction and strenght of the wind...animals are beautiful too...Everything about graphics are great in this game. I've been playing video games for 30 years and this is the first time I really enjoy not doing anything but looking around. My PC is not high end (i5 4460, 8GB, GTX 970) and I can play with good FPS on high, average on ultra. Gameplay:The game is hard. At least until you understand what is a hunting game, you'll probably get frustated. You will have hard time finding anything to shoot. And if you find, you'll ending doing a poor shot, because of the physics (they re very good). And the game is slow. Not the movements and stuff, but hunting is a slow down experience...You cant go running all around. So if you want a different experience from high speed FPS like Overwatch, CoD, BF, etc, this is a good game for you. I'm really enjoying it. A lot. I see me playing this for like 1000 hours at least (if the game receive updates for more content). With the actual content, I guess I'll have like 100-200 hours of fun, because is kinda hard to get exp and money.  "

												Not quite a hunting simulation, but very fun. Aesthetically, the game is gorgeous. The dense vegetation, sun rays, shadows and textures make for a very immersive experience. The sound is done very well, although I wish there was a slider for certain sound effects like rain, which can get quite loud. Gameplay-wise, the game is good, but not fantastic yet. The ui and certain features and menus seem quite rushed. The animal and their behavior is overall pretty solid, but I am disappointed there isn't a deep truRACs feature like the original thehunter where trophies were unique and all the animals were different. With this system, you simply have a ""trophy score"" added to get your final overall score after a harvest.The game is more arcadey than the previous thehunter (called classic now) There are many more animals, the score system is not as refined and deep, but it makes for a good game you can pick up and play for about 30 minutes and still have a successful hunt.The game does suffer from several technical bugs and crashes and should have been released as an early access game, but once the kinks are ironed out I think this game can be great. So far the early patches have been excellent in this regard. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of hunting, but also to anyone who simply wants to be immersed and experience the thrill of hunting and tracking.  I recommend having a very solid gaming PC, however, because in my opinion the biggest draw to this game is being immersed in the large maps and vegetation, so if you don't have a great PC and would have to run it on low settings I couldn't recommend it.

												This game is a lot of fun.  The graphics are amazing.  That being said there are a lot of issues that need to be ironed out.  So far the developers are providing patches on a regular basis but they tend to break things that were working.  The UI needs a lot of work, the animal AI (and graphic quality) need a ton of work (wrong sounds from animals, etc), the menus are not intuitive, etc.  However, i still recommend the game with the assumption that the developers will listen to their customers and make the necessary adjustments.If you aren't very tolerant of released game bugs then perhaps you should wait a few months but i do highly recommend the game.  It is fun and addictive.			"

												I may have 3 hours clocked on this game so far. But damn man. I love my all time favorite hunting game, Deer Hunter Season 2005. I dispised the microtransactions of theHunter which is why I didn't play it for very long. I've been waiting for Expansive Worlds to wise up and make a stand alone title of theHunter and my patience paid off. This is a wonderful game for anyone who loves hunting experiences. It's a beautiful game and shooting feel really damn good.Don't buy if you like to shoot something every momentary second. Buy another FPS if that's what you want.You will-1) Run around2) Probably not see anything for a long duration of time3) Hear an animal and ask yourself 50 times where it is4) Chase squirrels5) Miss your shot and curse6) Have to track a deer that is running a marathon across the map7) Start to pick flowers and get high on pixel life.In other words, just buy the damn game.

												At first I found it a lot like a hiking simulator, but then I realized it is not. Animals are common, but you have to be stealthy or else they are probably long gone before you get there.It is extremely realistic an detailed a mst have for any hunting fan.

												TL;DRIf you are patient, enjoy wonderful scenery, leveling up really slow but like to have a goal that takes forever- then this is your game. It's wonderful to look at, but graphics are better in the gameplay-trailers- Which I find a bit misleading.Besides that, it's all about being patient and taking your time.It's not worth it's full price, but DO buy this if it's on sale.-----PLEASE NOTEI played this only on Hirchfelden Reserve and the review is based on Singleplayer The Story isn't important and it's no problem straying from your given tasks. Not only is it optional but you don't get pressured into doing anything at all. They mostly sound like friendly requests, and that's what it feels like as well.They do get more challenging the further you go. In terms of challenge, this goes for aquiring equiment, shooting challenging pictures and game.I didn't really concern myself with the quests, but they do maintain a certain aspect of interest of the game. Both visually and gameplay-wise.You do unlock lore by discovering/visiting places in the game. As since the reserves are based on real places,- the lore you discover is just as real. It's easy/interesting reading and you'll have something to do while waiting for an animal to pop up. Performance and Graphics It's just a whole-lot of wonderful scenery and beautiful landscape to take in. If you keep moving from place to place- you never really get tired of the visually striking environment. For some reason, I have experienced multiple FPS-drops on different places. I don't know why but it's barely noticeable.Animals ranging from bears and hogs to deer and rabbits- they all look fairly good looking and behave accordingly. Animal reactions to your presents and actions are quite realistic. Both you and all animals leave a trail on the ground, pushing bushes and grass aside to leave a mark of where you've/they've been. Details like these make it look and feel just so good.Besides the fantastic graphics that some would mistake for real life, it's a downer when you are at the corner of a big cornfield watching for a fox or a red deer- that the drawing distance falls off. Beyond 100m, objects like corn and rocks gradually disappear. There are windmills east of the reseve. If you watch them from far away - these do not have blades on them.My guess is that this is a camouflaged option of optimizing the game's FPS and balancing it with draw-distance. This reminds you that it's a game and kill the realism of it. Gameplay As mentioned above, there is a draw distance in the game and this is actually a problem for a achievement that tell you to hit a animal from 400m. Because at approximately 400-405 meters, the animals disappear from your screen. If you move closer to it, it reappears (about 380-390m). Beyond 350 meters, animals no longer react to gunshot sound either, and both of these factors can kill the thrill of the hunt.I've encountered a few other problems during my travels. I'm just gonna list some examples:* Track-highlighting and animal outlines gradually stop showing when transition from day to night. Reappear once transitioned to day again.* Animals get stuck in trees, rocks and other obstacles while running. Easy but boring kills do occur.* Fast traveling sometimes remove explored animal-need-spots, like drinking spots or places they sleep. Uncertain if this is intentional.* Rain does not show through riflescopes.* Sound indicator rarely correspond to the given sounds you make. Sounds that sound noisy actually isn't. When standing still on certain places- like in a bush or next to a tree but look around you, you generate alot of noise but it doesn't show on the indicator.* Loud sounds like thunder or powerful wind does not decrease/cover the sound the player make.DO NOT let this scare you! It's the small things that bother the most picky persons that hunt for both game and details. The gameplay itself if wonderful and intense.When you hunt for anything particular and stick to a spesific game, that's when it starts getting seriously fun! Find tracks, estimate where it is, move slowly so it doesn't see you, thinking of the wind direction to avoid it smelling you- and so on. Once you hear it calling out, closer and closer, your heart start pumping faster. If you are lucky, it's walking your direction and you can hear it rattle the leaves and bushes. Rain dripping on your clothes and dense vegetation that decreases your visibility in the foggy forest start to feel extremely real at this point. All you can do it sit and wait with your rifle aiming it's direction until it shows it's feet or antlers. It's noisy, but everything feels more quiet until you take your shot. Even I got scared of my own shots multiple times.I shot it just where I hoped it would, but it's running away. I start picking up the trail while reloading the rifle. Blood splatters indicate a vital hit and it's bleeding alot. just 3-5 minutes later, I find that beautiful creature and harvest it. Leveling, points, perks and map It's a REALLY slow process to level up, gaining perks and skill points. I don't know how it works, but I think it's like that you get perk points from lvl X and skill point after next one. When exploring, you can find collectables like antlers as well. These increase your XP and is a good addon to modestly increase the fun-factor of exploring.Trackhunting, discovering new places, spotting animals and hunting them is the way to earn XP. If you are bad at hunting, then you'll have a hard time leveling up.Perks increase spesific weapon-usage like the rifle and skill points increase your overall skills as a character. Skills have alot of variation, but I feel the perks lack alot more options per weapon.The map is big. Really big. It pinpoints locations and points of interest for you to discover and it's actually fun exploring it. Alone or with friends, you can place markers on the map for you to follow. Those markers will also tell you how much time it takes to walk there and the distance to it from your current position. The map is sadly not as detailed as I would prefer. The problem with this is that small details of the terrain do not show on the map, and doing a precise marking of something is hard to do.Pros:* No DLC's! Good job with that!* Not too bad arsenal of weapons, lures and scopes. I guess you could have more but I don't care.* Slow-paced.* Extremely big map and LOT's of hunting grounds* Beautiful-looking game* Fantastic sound-effects/quality* Intense moments happen alot when tracking down your game, making everything really exciting* Perks to increase e.g. tracking skills. This system feels realistic in terms of knowledge and experience you gain from hunting and harvesting.Cons:* Slow-paced. Sometimes feel like nothing ever happens (this can be a good thing!)* Stressing to find games to hunt and KoS- kills the joy of the game and makes it boring.* Leveling up is based on kills, harvesting, spotting new places and building places to hunt. It takes a LONG time to get a high level.* You are stuck with limited equipment and won't be able to aquire more unless you level up.* You can get stuck and hurt yourself on objects, rocks etc. When crouching, you can't climb as well as when you are standing- meaning hunting in close-quarters near steep ground end up like if it's a invisible maze around you.* ""Applying"" changes to resolution sometimes does not work for some reason.* Player-markers, track-highlightings and wildlife appearances needs work as since they glitch/get stuck/don't appear after long-time traveling or transition from day to night. The only way to fix this is by fast-traveling or restarting the game.I highly recommend this game to everyone.It's slow paced, rich on details, and have alot of joy for hunters. I dare say that it's close to the best hunting-simulators there is.			"

												If all the bugs were removed, this would be one of the best games I've ever played!Pros:The game has superlative realistic graphics and sound! You should see it on a 4K display! It requires some patience to play, similar to true hunting. Generally beautiful game!  Cons:Several glitches! Deer get stuck running in their places. Or sometimes go in circles. Or sometimes, they just stand still; even looking you in the eye as you shoot them in the face! And when they decide it's time to move… they charge at you like they are possessed! They tend to be invincible sometimes as well! I emptied full 6 rounds of .357 in to the cranium of a stand still dear… and it decided to ram me as soon as I was done; killing me instead! Seriously?! After several hours of game play… the tracks disappear! I can't find anymore footprints or blood spots of any kind! Even when an animal walks past me, or I shoot it and try to look for it… no more tracks what so ever! I have to restart the game to ""temporarily"" get the tracks back until they disappear on me after a few minutes of gameplay!I get killed if I sometimes walk through branches, or walk against a branch! A bison may run me over and some of my health is depleted… BUT WALKING IN TO A BRANCH IS LETHAL!   Sounds, though realistic… seem to be sometimes buggy as I play on… they cut out and come back, especially during the rain or wind. I never have any problems with other game sounds but this…I'm not able to play this game anymore. I hope I didn’t waste my money on it, cause at its present state… it's unplayable! But hopefully more patches will be made for it. HOPEFULLY!			"

												After tracking down a moose with a low bleed, ended up on the last blood drop... And no more drops. Not just that the game isn't drawing any more tracks from any animal, even with every option on the game refuses to draw any more when it reachs a certain amount of tracks examined. For two straight kill shots, one a moose, and one a blacktail deer, this game is a loss. What a waist of Money!			"

												Hoo-boy, where do I begin.This game is loads of fun, even if you don't like hunting.While the original ""theHunter"" was, well you know, it was what it was, this one is good.I'm quite early in the game, but vehicles would be nice, or horses to ride on.As of bugs, there are a few. The falling damage is bugged for me or something, I just randomly die when falling down/sometimes don't.Also, some of the animals like bucks can be bugged.I've couple of times found a deer or buck stuck on a log, which breaks immersion.It also annoys me that I get credits for killing it.Weapons are nice, and if you get bored of hunting you can always do missions or try to complete achievements.I highly suggest buying the game. It is only 30 euros, so it's a fair price for what you get.I wish I had friends to play with this, so far I've only played the single player, but the single player is also fun.The game gets a rating of 8.5/10.

												Just a couple thoughts on this game. First, this is probably one of the best hunting games out right now, it feels like there's been a dry spell for these over the past few years. Understandable since it's a small fan base I'm sure. Nonetheless, this game is quite fun and enjoyable to play solo. A couple thoughts after putting in 12-15ish hours:- The game is quite slow paced, I saw a joke of ""walking simulator 2017"" and it's not far off. I'd love to see an ATV or the ability to fast travel to blinds/stands/lookouts.- This one time, I shot a doe in the head and it ran away. When I eventually tracked it down the shot tracker basically showed the bullet going right into the center of the skull and said ""flesh, skull, jaw"" So yeah...that happens- Personally, I think putting guns behind a level-up wall is BS. At least give me some other options. - Also, I have yet in my life to see a single-shot 7mm Magnum that someone actually takes hunting.- More guns plz. Seriously, there's like 9 rifles. - The stealth system could use a little more balance. For example: I want two speeds of crouch walking (toggle crouch, hold shift to move a little faster). Then walking should not producer the same amount of sound as running. You can walk quite softly through the woods IRL- The UX is strange. It took me 10 minutes to figure out that items in the store scroll left to right- Speaking of store, the text on the guns and stuff moves really fast, be nice if the space for the text was a little bigger so it didn't have to scroll. Please don't take my critisism to mean it's a bad game. It's not at all. In fact I've quite enjoyed the few hours I've put in. I hope it gets some updates and changes in the future. Definetly recommend if you're into the whole hunting genre.			"

												Absolutely beatiful game. Several glitches and bugs with animal AI and terrain objects but 42 hours in and the game still hasn't crashed once, guess I'm lucky. Looking forward for new species, particularly small game and birds. Some toughts though:- Weapon zeroing should be a default instead of a skill you can learn.- Shooting birds, rabbits and squirrels could give some cash/experience/weapon score.- Integrity bonus based on caliber is a bit strange. State of the hide and meat comes down so much more on the shot placement and cartridge.			"

												So before I begin I would like to say that I really love this studio. I am a big fan of theHunter and have put a long time into playing that game. That being said, this game is currently unplayable for me. There are so many bugs and crashes that I simply cannot look past them and enjoy myself. But before I list those I would like to list what I do like so far.PROS:- beautiful world, graphics are simply stunning- audio ambiance and SFX are amazing - skill and perk trees are a cool addition - no microtransactions (which i did not mind in theHunter)- your in-game money is actually worth something in the store - cool story based missions and side missions- unknown points on the map to encourage you to explore the area- buildable blinds at some points of interest - wounded animal animations, this is something I thought was missing from the last theHunter CONS:- not a large variety of equipment - outfits says they have no effect on whether or not animals can detect you? - whats the point on spending 12k on an outfit then?- using callers seems to be pretty ineffective - although they are large, there are only 2 maps- there is much less to hunt it seems than theHunter - no dynamic bullet wound textures on the animal- very poor bullet penetration- with all its bugs and limited equipment it feels more like an early access or BETA rather than a full game- the original theHunter set the bar so high that this game pales in comparison, I would still much rather play the original even if this game had 0 bugs BUG LIST: (after a pretty short time playing)- MULTIPLE HARD CRASHES!!!- when starting game, background blur does not go away until openeing a menu- earned experience/perks/skillpoints are displayed at the top at incorect times- tracker sometimes displays nothing- animal tracks sometimes do not show up after resting or fast traveling - nav points show in multiple directions - animals run in circles- animals do not interact with other animals - spooking one type does not seem to spook other animals near them - after opening a menu, it takes multiple presses of ESC or BACKSPACE to exit the menu- storage/backpack menu are very glitched - the same item is displayed multiple times in the store - animals get stuck on rocks and trees very easily- player can get stuck in water very easily - many tracks below the surface of the groundIn summary, I really want to like this game and continue playing but as I said before, the bugs make it too frustrating. The amount of time you must dedicate to a hunt only to be foiled by tracking bugs or hard crashes is absolutely infuriating. While I will not play this for awhile, I do hope the devs fix these problems so that I can come back to a fully functioning and beautiful game to play in the future. I hope this is helpful to some who are on the fence about this game. Buy and play the original theHunter, and wait for them to complete this one.  "

												One of the best looking games out there. I Grew up on deer/elk hunter, cabela's, etc, so I was pleased to find a game to bring that nostalgia back. The gameplay is solid, and is fun to crack open a few beers and hunt with friends when we just want a chill type of night. There are bugs, but nothing gamebreaking by any means. My only real complaint is the amount of grind work you have to put in for any sort of progression, especially with them continuing to up ammo costs. 8/10 great but not perfect.			"

												If you like the old Hunter then you will most certainly love this one. Even though you need to grind a lot to earn fancy new weapons, it's great to play. The maps are huge and beautiful. A few bugs occur now and then but that doesn't stop me from playing and following the game development. Furthermore the game has no microtransactions unlike the older Hunter. About the bugs, they're not too bad so I don't mind waiting for a few fixes.			"

												I was a little nervous getting this game, as many reports problems with game crash, lag and freeze. Guess i am a lucky one, as i never encountered this at all. It really runs smoothly even on the highest settings. I run the game on an MSI Intel i7-4720HQ, 16GB RAM, NVIDIA GTX960. This is the most beautiful game i ever played where you walk in an astonishing surroundings. You just cant help but stop frequently to enjoy the view. The animals also looks good with nice animation. If i should put my finger on anything, the lake / ponds could maybe have a better texture.The sounds are good and with no problems to hear where they coming from. But at some random events, some of the sounds dissappear or turns in to noise. Not the best thing when using earplugs.You have the option to start in two different maps, Central European and North-west American. Both maps are huge with so many places to explore, you could easily play for houndreds of hours before you been on all the places. The animals however, seems to need more work. As it is now, there are some issues. An animal trying to run away from you, can end up being stuck if a tree or rock stands in their path. I also seen animals getting stuck in a loop, such as an animal chance direction when hitting tree A, and turns towards tree B, so it chance direction to tree A again and therefor chance direction again to tree B. In the tutorial, they tell us about hunting pressure and animals would avoid areas where you just killed. This isnt true at all. Animals doesnt seem to care about this for a second and would gladly walk in to an area and stand besides their fellow mates who just got shot. There are a dozen number of animals to hunt, and some of them is to be expected to attack you in defence. But if i stand only 6-7 meters away from a black bear or big moose and shoot but only get a flesh hit, i am still not attacked. The only time i got injured from an animal was when standing at its running-away path, and was runned over. And since animals are running away from you, not towards you, this is obviously not something you need to worry happen often.I have also come across animals who just stands there frozen. This is at night, so i guess they are sleeping. But if i shoot them without getting instant kill, they just run 2-3 steps before they stop and freeze again. It looks very weird. One thing i noticed first time i played this was how slow i walk. Its realistic, as you are hunting and wouldnt like to make noise. So crouching should be slow moving. But normal walking are just as well slow and walking up the stairs to a watch tower reminded me of walking with my grandmother. So it all ends up with me running around. Thats actually not so bad. Its extremly noisy and scares animals around you. In this way i can find out if there is any animals around me at all and if there is, where they are from their warning calls.The game have a nice earn money and skill system making you work to improve and afford better equipment.All in all, this is a game i enjoy and would keep playing. You need a little patient, just like in real life. But is nice and relaxing game to play when you have no time pressure upon you. The only downside for me is the animal behaviour and running path that needs an improvement. This is not an alpha game, so i am not shure it will ever be fixed.			"

												After 50 hours of gameplay I can make a review not based on emotion. TLDR: If you like hunting games, or want a different experience from the action games / FPS, buy it! Graphics:The game is beautiful. Landscapes are gorgeous. Lighting is awesome. Wind is awesome, leaves flying with the direction and strenght of the wind...animals are beautiful too...Everything about graphics are great in this game. I've been playing video games for 30 years and this is the first time I really enjoy not doing anything but looking around. My PC is not high end (i5 4460, 8GB, GTX 970) and I can play with good FPS on high, average on ultra. Gameplay:The game is hard. At least until you understand what is a hunting game, you'll probably get frustated. You will have hard time finding anything to shoot. And if you find, you'll ending doing a poor shot, because of the physics (they re very good). And the game is slow. Not the movements and stuff, but hunting is a slow down experience...You cant go running all around. So if you want a different experience from high speed FPS like Overwatch, CoD, BF, etc, this is a good game for you. I'm really enjoying it. A lot. I see me playing this for like 1000 hours at least (if the game receive updates for more content). With the actual content, I guess I'll have like 100-200 hours of fun, because is kinda hard to get exp and money.  "

												So i've played 2 hrs of gameplay so far. even if i wanted to refund it i couldn't now. Heres my review:The graphics are amazing, this is one of the best hunting sims i've ever played. The tracking system the game has in finding your kill is on point, but there is one issue, gets a little  confusing when your following the trail/blood when you end up coming across another set of tracks from another deer, then you get veered off following another trail not knowing it. I ended up back tracking and finding the correct tracks. I ran into one glitch when i shot a bear he did not drop, he kinda got stuck standing up on his 2 hind feet, so i shot him a couple more times (doubletap)I also like the stat system and how equipment/guns are unlocked. on another note... so glad this is not a pay to play game like ""The Hunter"" Fu** that game, it should not be on steam biggest money racket.  that game can eat a bag of Coc*ks			"

												Do I recommend this game? I'll say ""Probably, but not yet.""theHunter: COTW does many things very well. It's much more polished in many respects than I was anticipating. The gameplay is relaxing and fun, so long as you have reasonable expectations going in. But as of this writing, there are several very serious bugs (and even more less-serious ones) which make it hard to fully enjoy. The dev team seems fairly active and responsive to feedback, and they've fixed several bugs. But there are a lot left, and that makes it hard to recommend. If this game looks interesting to you, put it on your wishlist and come back in a month or two. If they've fixed the major bugs at that point (and haven't released a thousand nickel-and-dime DLCs), then it will be well worth the purchase.			"

												Not quite a hunting simulation, but very fun. Aesthetically, the game is gorgeous. The dense vegetation, sun rays, shadows and textures make for a very immersive experience. The sound is done very well, although I wish there was a slider for certain sound effects like rain, which can get quite loud. Gameplay-wise, the game is good, but not fantastic yet. The ui and certain features and menus seem quite rushed. The animal and their behavior is overall pretty solid, but I am disappointed there isn't a deep truRACs feature like the original thehunter where trophies were unique and all the animals were different. With this system, you simply have a ""trophy score"" added to get your final overall score after a harvest.The game is more arcadey than the previous thehunter (called classic now) There are many more animals, the score system is not as refined and deep, but it makes for a good game you can pick up and play for about 30 minutes and still have a successful hunt.The game does suffer from several technical bugs and crashes and should have been released as an early access game, but once the kinks are ironed out I think this game can be great. So far the early patches have been excellent in this regard. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of hunting, but also to anyone who simply wants to be immersed and experience the thrill of hunting and tracking.  I recommend having a very solid gaming PC, however, because in my opinion the biggest draw to this game is being immersed in the large maps and vegetation, so if you don't have a great PC and would have to run it on low settings I couldn't recommend it.

Its one of the most beautiful games ive ever played, and certainly one of the most difficult. The game has its short comings. But it's well worth the money you spent on it.CONs for the Devs, the choice of guns is too limited, the price of the ammo is preposterous. The fast travelling situation is annoying, lookout points should be fast-travel compatible. Finally there should be more diversity in the amount of species one can hunt per park. Besides this the game is a masterpiece, dont stop improving it!			"

theHunter™: Call of the Wild

By: Gankdalf




theHunter: Call of the wild is really a bittersweet experience. The landscapes and forests are some of the best that I’ve ever seen in a game. Nothing so far comes close to the beautiful scenery in Call of the wild. It’s very relaxing & the gameplay itself is what you can expect from a hunting game. The gameplay is slow and needs a lot of patience. The ambient sounds and weather effects are all excellent & really immersive. The animals look great and the animations look good. Now the bitter part. theHunter: Call of the wild plays and feels as if it’s an early alpha. It’s riddled with bugs and quirks that really screws up the fun. The main thing that screw it up are the random crashes. There doesn’t seem to be a correlation between them and there’s no way to avoid it as far as I know. I even had my stats, inventory and cash all reset back to default after several hours of playtime. In multiplayer, there are a lot of bugs as well. Simply by clicking “multiplayer” in the game menu it will randomly kick a player from my server. It does not save progress in terms of your current location & if you disconnect while you’ve  taken part in a multiplayer competition on the server it will count as if you’re back on square 1 once you reconnect. It’s all very annoying little bugs that feel like something you could expect from an incomplete early access game. But a full release? Unacceptable. The game is amazing while it actually works though. I hope that the developers will sort these bugs out soon. If you’re looking to buy this game I suggest you head over to theHunters discussion forum & check the latest news for the game & see if they’ve recently patched it. If there’s a lot of complaints about crashes & whatnot then I suggest you wait. Once they fix these bugs I will edit my review & give it a thumbs up.Edit:

As you can see by the developer response to this review they did sort out the worst of the bugs, namely the random crashes and they are working on fixing some QoL stuff related to the menu which is much appreciated. Multiplayer is still wonky in terms of progress not saving, joined players cant save outposts etc but at this point I feel like the game deserves to be recommended. As a single player experience it's a solid game & certainly the best hunting game that I have played.			"

Get it on SaleWell, it's a hunting game. Nice atmosphere, huge map. Forests are interesting, and the landmarks are quite well crafted.Honestly, the game is great as an idea, the current execution is bad though. Audio sorces are flipped (ie you see things in front of you, they make noise behinde you), there are some awkward places where you can get stucke in the world geometry as well as having a somewhat poor customization choices.Some mechanics are questionable, examples being of skills that should be passive, but are active, as well as silent hunting weapons such as a bow, spooking half the forest.Finally, there are some glaring AI issues. Simplistic animal logic aside, they sometimes completely break and sit in one place. The game is absent of a food chain. Bears and Deer, Coyotes and Elks, they are one big happy family waiting for you to slaughter them.Maybe in 10-15 updates game will be awesome, as it is now, it's a 6/10.			"

												So before I begin I would like to say that I really love this studio. I am a big fan of theHunter and have put a long time into playing that game. That being said, this game is currently unplayable for me. There are so many bugs and crashes that I simply cannot look past them and enjoy myself. But before I list those I would like to list what I do like so far.PROS:- beautiful world, graphics are simply stunning- audio ambiance and SFX are amazing - skill and perk trees are a cool addition - no microtransactions (which i did not mind in theHunter)- your in-game money is actually worth something in the store - cool story based missions and side missions- unknown points on the map to encourage you to explore the area- buildable blinds at some points of interest - wounded animal animations, this is something I thought was missing from the last theHunter CONS:- not a large variety of equipment - outfits says they have no effect on whether or not animals can detect you? - whats the point on spending 12k on an outfit then?- using callers seems to be pretty ineffective - although they are large, there are only 2 maps- there is much less to hunt it seems than theHunter - no dynamic bullet wound textures on the animal- very poor bullet penetration- with all its bugs and limited equipment it feels more like an early access or BETA rather than a full game- the original theHunter set the bar so high that this game pales in comparison, I would still much rather play the original even if this game had 0 bugs BUG LIST: (after a pretty short time playing)- MULTIPLE HARD CRASHES!!!- when starting game, background blur does not go away until openeing a menu- earned experience/perks/skillpoints are displayed at the top at incorect times- tracker sometimes displays nothing- animal tracks sometimes do not show up after resting or fast traveling - nav points show in multiple directions - animals run in circles- animals do not interact with other animals - spooking one type does not seem to spook other animals near them - after opening a menu, it takes multiple presses of ESC or BACKSPACE to exit the menu- storage/backpack menu are very glitched - the same item is displayed multiple times in the store - animals get stuck on rocks and trees very easily- player can get stuck in water very easily - many tracks below the surface of the groundIn summary, I really want to like this game and continue playing but as I said before, the bugs make it too frustrating. The amount of time you must dedicate to a hunt only to be foiled by tracking bugs or hard crashes is absolutely infuriating. While I will not play this for awhile, I do hope the devs fix these problems so that I can come back to a fully functioning and beautiful game to play in the future. I hope this is helpful to some who are on the fence about this game. Buy and play the original theHunter, and wait for them to complete this one.  "

												Just a couple thoughts on this game. First, this is probably one of the best hunting games out right now, it feels like there's been a dry spell for these over the past few years. Understandable since it's a small fan base I'm sure. Nonetheless, this game is quite fun and enjoyable to play solo. A couple thoughts after putting in 12-15ish hours:- The game is quite slow paced, I saw a joke of ""walking simulator 2017"" and it's not far off. I'd love to see an ATV or the ability to fast travel to blinds/stands/lookouts.- This one time, I shot a doe in the head and it ran away. When I eventually tracked it down the shot tracker basically showed the bullet going right into the center of the skull and said ""flesh, skull, jaw"" So yeah...that happens- Personally, I think putting guns behind a level-up wall is BS. At least give me some other options. - Also, I have yet in my life to see a single-shot 7mm Magnum that someone actually takes hunting.- More guns plz. Seriously, there's like 9 rifles. - The stealth system could use a little more balance. For example: I want two speeds of crouch walking (toggle crouch, hold shift to move a little faster). Then walking should not producer the same amount of sound as running. You can walk quite softly through the woods IRL- The UX is strange. It took me 10 minutes to figure out that items in the store scroll left to right- Speaking of store, the text on the guns and stuff moves really fast, be nice if the space for the text was a little bigger so it didn't have to scroll. Please don't take my critisism to mean it's a bad game. It's not at all. In fact I've quite enjoyed the few hours I've put in. I hope it gets some updates and changes in the future. Definetly recommend if you're into the whole hunting genre.			"

												The Hunter: Call of the wild is what the previous title of The hunter wished it was. The hunter: Call of the Wild is beautiful, you explore the two regions of layton(pacific northwest hunting reserve) and hunt in the forest of germany. Now the graphics are definatley there but the gameplay isn't 100% it has minor glitches from what i ave experienced with the sound cutting out and your weapons not coming up, buit when it does work it's a wonderful experience. in its current state wait for a sale but if you really want it have it. I will also note 0 microtransaction except for maybe in the future dlc's.			"

												One of the most beautiful enviroments I've seen in any game, I get distracted taking pics more than the hunting component. Definately one of the more relaxing games to play. My only annoyance is the pure cost of items, have to go on a farming spree just to kit up (338 the bullets can cost more than the kill :S) and I look forward to more variety of rifles and bolt on options becoming available. Top work for the game so far, looking forward to more packs coming out.			"

												The game is an incredible openworld game.The audio is from amazing quality and I have not seen any other game with such realistic sounds.The graphics are also very amazing and from high quality. Due to my graphics card I couldn't run the game on ultra.The gameplay is very slow but fun and intreresting in the beginning.Due to the games gameplay being so slow it takes a long time to walk a great distance.Finding and then sneaking up on an animal also takes quite some time. There are hotspots where you can wait for animals but there is no fast forwarding on spot. You can however sleep till 30 minutes before the animals eat or rest and then go to one of the sleeping or feeding spots.Sneaking up on animals can also be very hard sometimes. When an animal is far away it takes some time to crawl close to it. And when you are finally there you shoot and miss and you would have to spend 15-30 minutes to find a new animal, crawl towards it and then shoot it.If there was some kind of career mode it would have been kinda more intreresting. I would say this game is worth €15 for the gameplay. With a career mode or something in that direction it would be more fun. Maybe give some more hints. Make difficulty modes like (easy, medium, hard, realistic).This game is like an early release. The base is there but it misses some gameplay and its also very slow gameplay which I do not like that much.If you like shooting an animal once every 15-30 minutes waiting and crawling go ahead and buy the game.

It's a hunting game so you will see more animals in one hour of game time than you will see in 2 months of walking around in the wild in real life. It's 30 bucks give it a try.			"

												Ok they are actively patching the game and have now fixed the main game breaking issue that I had below and the game is now playable with mouse and keyboard. Overall I find the game very beautlyful and engaging, however, I just seems like they released an unfinnished product. Smaller game largely is not encorporated into the game. There are a few such as rabibbit which are animated but they just freeze when shot and there is not stat tracking or trophy screen. I have yet to notice any huntable fowl what so ever. There are a ton of bug fixes mechanic tweaking and playteasting that still need to be done. I am loving the game even in its current seemingly unfinished state but it still falls short of expectations. Will give a favorable rating once they bring the polish level of the game UI and mechanics up to speed and add more content.**Previous Review**Picked up this game it was alot of fun until I got to the more challenging game and found that I was unable to walk quietly without a controller. Furthermore the UI needs alot of imporvment.Its a shame because I was really enjoying the game but now I'm unable to progress.			"

theHunter™: Call of the Wild 
A Screenshot of theHunter™: Call of the Wild
By: Gankdalf




theHunter: Call of the wild is really a bittersweet experience. The landscapes and forests are some of the best that I’ve ever seen in a game. Nothing so far comes close to the beautiful scenery in Call of the wild. It’s very relaxing & the gameplay itself is what you can expect from a hunting game. The gameplay is slow and needs a lot of patience. The ambient sounds and weather effects are all excellent & really immersive. The animals look great and the animations look good. Now the bitter part. theHunter: Call of the wild plays and feels as if it’s an early alpha. It’s riddled with bugs and quirks that really screws up the fun. The main thing that screw it up are the random crashes. There doesn’t seem to be a correlation between them and there’s no way to avoid it as far as I know. I even had my stats, inventory and cash all reset back to default after several hours of playtime. In multiplayer, there are a lot of bugs as well. Simply by clicking “multiplayer” in the game menu it will randomly kick a player from my server. It does not save progress in terms of your current location & if you disconnect while you’ve  taken part in a multiplayer competition on the server it will count as if you’re back on square 1 once you reconnect. It’s all very annoying little bugs that feel like something you could expect from an incomplete early access game. But a full release? Unacceptable. The game is amazing while it actually works though. I hope that the developers will sort these bugs out soon. If you’re looking to buy this game I suggest you head over to theHunters discussion forum & check the latest news for the game & see if they’ve recently patched it. If there’s a lot of complaints about crashes & whatnot then I suggest you wait. Once they fix these bugs I will edit my review & give it a thumbs up.Edit:

As you can see by the developer response to this review they did sort out the worst of the bugs, namely the random crashes and they are working on fixing some QoL stuff related to the menu which is much appreciated. Multiplayer is still wonky in terms of progress not saving, joined players cant save outposts etc but at this point I feel like the game deserves to be recommended. As a single player experience it's a solid game & certainly the best hunting game that I have played.			"

												Update after owning for a few weeks. despite the review I wrote below, at the time I cant recommend Call of the Wild.  This game should have been labeled in alpha/beta until they ironed out the bugs, which are TOO NUMEROUS to mention.  From animals getting stuck, or stuck in a loop, to fatal crashes, to simple things like custom sights not staying attached.  Game has a potential, but I will leave a negative recommendation until they prove they are commited to fixing the game before trying to make money off community generated advertising, paid DLC, etcHaving been interested in a previous theHunter game, but being turned away by pay to play, I decided to pick this up.  Decent price point to start with, which is good, because I wouldnt have payed 50+.  The graphics are amazing and the environment feels extremely realistic, from the trees and leaves falling in the wind, to the excellent sound design.  The terrain has a great variation of areas, and tiny details such as bats fluttering around at night make it really shine.  Even just as a walking simulator it would feel very fulfilling, but add the thrill of the hunt makes it even better .  The maps are huge there are two of them, which would probably take an hour to walk across.  Granted I have a beefy video card, but all the visual effects are super nice.  Night time is dark, but not TOO dark, giving you nice godrays from the moonlight through the fogSome bugs they need to work on though, such as animals getting stuck, rare crashes, broken multiplayer.  Other annoyances include EXTREMELY loud water, clunky menus, and other HUD issues.  Also one of the cricket sounds can be extremely loud, and sounds exactly like my smoke alarm when its low on batteriesOverall I think it was worth the $30 as a gesture of good faith, I just hope they listen to community and keep working on this, rather than moving on to making the next game. Dont expect to run and gun deer, it takes time to creep up on them ... this is a simulator, not COD hunting. Happy hunting			"

												This game doesn't feel like its complete. It has amazing graphics and is one of the only decent hunting games in modern times. That's it for the pros, now for the cons. Prepare for an arcade adventure, because if you try to play the game as a real hunter would, then you're in for a sour taste in your mouth. A seasoned hunter knows to properly take down a deer, you aim for the chest to hit the heart and lungs for a clean kill. In this game, if its not a headshot, its not a one hit kill, and even then, it has to hit a sweet spot in the ear, other wise you're chasing said deer for three miles just for the ""disapearing tracks glitch"" to take effect so you can never find the body or track anything else until you restart the game. This game has more glitches than content, and I am not exaderating. There are many species of animals to hunt, but not so many ways to hunt them. You have about 7 rifles, 2 shotguns, two bows, three handguns, and there you go, a single lure for most kinds of deer or small game, and a single scent for most game. This game feels very empty, I still enjoy it, but it is far from complete and not worth full price. I'd be more than happy to give this a thumbs up if they'd fix more than a single bug and added more content, but until then, wait this one out.			"

												I've been having fun with this game for a little over two weeks. I like it a lot and would recommend it.  I'll just give you some pros and cons rather than some tl;dr in depth review.PROS:Beautiful enviroment with immersive weather and day night cyclesAccurate, and immersive sounds from the environment and surrounding animalsDecently Realistic animal behaviors and senses, including smell sight and sound awareness.Option to vary the degree of realism (offers the choice of toggling various visual assistance effects)Landmarks and Lore points throughout the map add depth and interesting information.Good weapon mechanicsFairly indepth tutorialGood choice of weaponsAwesome X-ray view breakdown of kills to show shot placement and anatomy effectedEuropean and American Pacific Hunting worlds availableMaps are EXPANSIVE. Lots of places to go.Multiplayer CapableActive Dev team making corrections oftenCons:Honestly, the only real con I can think of that isn't just a subjective opinion  would be the Bugs. There are several bugs, the most of these occur in multiplayer. Nothing gamebreaking per se, but some that can be quite irritating. (I would personally like there to be even more types of animals to hunt, ie, Rams, Caribou, Grizzlies, Turkeys, more species of deer)Quick Bug list and frequency of occurrence as of 4/2/2017: 1) Animal AI not initiating properly leading to helpless game standing still. (Occasionally in both SP And MP) (in 2 weeks of playing, iv'e seen it 4 times)2) Animal Entity State failing to update properly, leading to animals running in place after being shot, and then being non-harvestable after being killed.   (In MP, Occurs Frequently (~30% of kills)  *NEVER occurs in SP.* ---Possible Netcode issue)3) Deer Bleat call can be heard loudly by the player when being used by any other players on the map, regardless of location or distance in world. (Always/100% bug rate. MP bug only)4) Animals Struck by Player weapon leaving no tracks or blood trails whatsoever. (Rarely happens on both MP and SP) (Happened twice in 45 hrs of playtime once each on MP and SP modes)5) Certain Animal call lures will glitch when you crouch while they are triggering their animation/sound file, causing the player to be unable to use the caller again until after switching between active items. (100% with certain callers both MP and SP) --minor irritation.6) Tritium (glowdot) iron sights auto-unequiping from rifle when switching between items. (100% MP and SP)7) Scope sights removed from backpack and left in storage still equipable. (100% SP & MP)			"

												This has the potential the become the ultimate hunting simulation. It is beautiful, realistic and satisfying. More content needs to be added and bugs in tracking and pathfinding need to be eliminated. I had only one crash in over 50 hours.Stay far away from microtransactions, improve the game further and Cabela can pick up their♥♥♥♥♥♥and go home while your company will sell games for decades!			"

												One of the best looking games out there. I Grew up on deer/elk hunter, cabela's, etc, so I was pleased to find a game to bring that nostalgia back. The gameplay is solid, and is fun to crack open a few beers and hunt with friends when we just want a chill type of night. There are bugs, but nothing gamebreaking by any means. My only real complaint is the amount of grind work you have to put in for any sort of progression, especially with them continuing to up ammo costs. 8/10 great but not perfect.			"

												I would recconmend this game BUT REMEMBER, THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A BETA!!!There are some issues with the stability with the game, some objects have no physics (you can no-clip right through them)The gameplay however is amazing, as an actual hunter I can say that this is fairly accurate - but still there are some differeces as it is a game.  I find after a shot, animals don't scatter as much as I can find another animal is the same area I just took a shot in 3 minutes ago - still it's game and it would probobly be alot less fun if the animals where too hyper realistic.  Laslty I would like to note that this game is still under heavy development - this is not the final game and you can expect new features, new relms, and allaround changes made to the game!I would rate this around 8/10 - its alot of fun!

												I would love to recommend this game because it has an enormous potential in my opinion. Graphics, ambiance, sounds, gameplay mechanics, hunting lore... everything is just perfect. OR... to be honest, it could be perfect, if it wasn't so buggy. in its current state, it is nearly unplayable. Various annoying bugs and glitches ruined my game. (like shooting and injuring an animal from a hunting stand and after exiting the stand, EVERY animal track (not only the shot animal's tracks, every single animal's tracks) in the game dissappearing for no reason) Also, I played this game on a gaming laptop with i7 4700hq and gtx 780m, and according to the recommended specs my pc should be enough to play the game on medium settings with smooth 60~ fps. But instead, i got 20 fps in low-medium settings and when i lowered the settings to the bottom, it just increased to 35. i am nearly sure this is an optimization issue.Despite its current state, if you liked the hunter, you will love his game, when the bugs and glitches are fixed and the optimization is completed.

												I do like this game but if it's yes or no, right now no. Game is not marked as controller compatible, yet in order to move quietly you NEED a controller. Walking speed, even when crouch or prone on keyboard makes max noise pretty much. No variable speed there. Also apparently this game had a beta but when you fire a scoped gun still it will phase through the scope and you can see your ironsights. I saw videos of this a while back and it still happens.I feel the 3d audio needs to be a bit better if I were to play this with the assists off. I have a Skyrim mod that is like HRTL or something audio, and it is the BEST 3d audio I have ever used on a headset. No fake surround crap, it is real audio positioning.What else? Oh, being able to know what the base zeroing is on your gun would be good. When I zero a real optic I don't zero it for stupid numbers like 1.0002. No more like 100 meters, 200 meters, yards whatever. Same for these weird♥♥♥♥♥optic zoom levels. One of the scopes is like 8.000 something. That would be 8x or 8 power if you were to read it.A lot of the tutorial message text is cut off as well on the codex page.Would be nice to know how detailed this ballistics system is. Can I shoot through leaves or small limbs on trees? I had a difficult shot ingame but it missed but I can't tell if that's because you have NO CLUE WHERE YOU ZEROED YOUR OWN GUN, or if the ballistics are really sketchy.EDIT: Walking speed has been fixed. All good now.			"

												The game plays very smooth, it is really good looking and the user interface is well done, but this game misses on the most important part, rewarding players for proper shot placement. At this point in the game you will make a well placed shot and the animal will still run for miles a lot of the time, occasionally the animal will only run a shot distance but usually not. also there is no effect of the energy transfer from the bullet into the animal as well as no consideration for arteries. Yesterday i took a shot at a moose from a front facing left angle and a slight elevation and i passed harmlessly between the lungs barely missed the heart and hit the bottom of the right lung, then the animal proceeded to lead me on a 3 mile chase because i was frustrated and just chancing it. In real life or even most other hunting games that shot would have lead to a very quick kill and not what was treated as a  ""flesh wound"" essentially. Your best bet in the game right now is to go for spine shots which most hunters i know find to be an unethical and irresponsible shot that you shouldn't take. also the penetration most of the rounds in this game have are quite unrealistic lacking the penetration to even reach the heart from the side let alone the other lung.Also for a hunting game where is the 30-06 or .308 you know what are probably the two most popular hunting calibers there are in NA?this came has awesome potential but it really needs to clean up its most important aspect i think.

Then the adventure began, coyote barked at me for a warning, I didnt like that because he scared off my deer i was tracking, so spent the next while tracking this coyote determined to earn him as a trophy for what he done, 4 bullets later, 1. 3 miles later 40 minutes later I got a 130 meter shot for a lung shot avoided all animals and tracks to get this bugger, fully immersed would recommend to anyone.

												Not as bad as people say, but still some things you worry about. the menues is kinda anoying, and your settings have an habit of chaning on their own, hold down mouse 2 to aim for example jumps between hold and click all the time.Also the reward for playing is kinda weak, you get money to buy new weapons sure but the animals seems to be pretty much the same. No bucks with big antlers to go after, or boars with big tusks. A female seams to give as much reward as a male and the weight and such dosent seem to make any diffrence. This make you kinda shoot at everything that moves just to get money.things i miss in this game is Leaderboards, competition and diffrent values on the animals like rare size antlers or tusks that give more points, the fealing you know that you can find that very speciel animal out there and theres a reason to hope to find it. Sadly as it often is in the gaming world its verry hush hush and you get no confirmation what will come in the future, will there be competitions, trophyshots, rare animals and such or is this it.I also miss smaller animals, birds, rabits and so on, but agin might not be worth adding if you only hunt for your self anyways cus you will get bored to quick when theres no competition to the game. what i fear is that everything fun will still hapen in the classic game and this will just lay around like primal, but i do hope im wrong cus the game has big potential.

												Update:After another 4 hours or so and playing multiplayer with my brother, it is apparent how quickly the tires fall off of this game.  The connection between us randomly drops.  We had to both exit the game then come back in to get reconnected.  I had several UI related bugs reference losing my entire HUD.  Couldn't see or use any of the weapons/calls.  After about five tries, we got reconnected and were able to play for several hours.  During a long hunt, we tracked a male moose high up into the mountains.  We tracked him for at least 40 minutes.  When we found him, it was in a clearing on top of the mountain.  There was some kind of AI tracking bug, that caused the male moose, a female moose, and several deer to just run around in a circle and back and forth in this glade.  We just stood there and mowed them all down.  Not the way I envisioned such a great tracking experience going at the end.  Kind of took all the fun out of the hunt. It is apparent now that the company rushed this to market, charged a premium price and is using that money to re-invest development time into the game based on such user feedback. Pretty pathetic.  If they did have a Beta cycle, it was clearly for show.  I would recommend waiting to purchase this until the re-earn the communities' trust and put some real effort into filling this out.Original:I've got just under 5 hours of play so far.  I have had no game crashing bugs or major playability issues.  Most of the bugs I've encountered are UI related.  I bought a Bow and intended on putting it into storage, but then I could not get anything out.  I've had issues with the Store and buying things being flaky.  At any rate, I'm not sure why the development team did not get the UI and related functionality solid before moving onto more important things.  UI is User Experience.  If that is broken, playability suffers upfront.  That's really unexcusable in my mind.  The description of the game says it's based on 7 years of the Classic game's experience.  Well that must be in the hunting features and not UI creation.  Provided they fix the UI issues, I really have no major complaints.  The hunting experience has been really good so far in my play.  I've not tested the Multi-player group hunt stuff yet, but so far, I've enjoyed it, as have my kids.  I just wish they'd get the UI working properly, particularly when it comes to buying things, using the menus, etc...			"

												I love this game. The graphics are amazing and the patches cleary shows that the devs are dedicated. Some bugs are still in the game. But overall the games works great, the map is big and lots of places to explore. What i dont like is the mission system, but its possible to turn it off so its not something that stops me from playing. I also started streaming this game and for some ""weird"" reason people actually come and watch me hunt. Its not a 10/10 game but its getting there :)Ive only had 1 crash to desktop during my time with the game. So can i recommend the game? Yes and no. If you are a former Cabela player this game can be boring. But if you like a hunting game with a big open map where you can hunt and walk around freely then this is the game for you. I also notice that the devs take their time to answer the negative reviews is great. It surely means that they are dedicated and proud of their game which is Hard to find these days :)			"

												So actually after the first patch the game is much better now! It's getting more realistic since the A.I. updates, also everything else looks to work smoother. I just hope that missions and Lore unlocking will work soon in Multiplayer! Also I think everyone would like to see more variety of animals, like birds for example.Still, a lot of potential in this game!Old Review:I'm a huge fan of The Hunter Classic and I was playing it from the beginning. Also I was looking forward for his one for a very long time, but they released a totally unfinished game with tons of bugs. In my opinion the worst bugs are:-The game is crashing when you open up the map ar trying to select something in the options.. Disabling Steam Cloud doesnt help(This is the recommended solution to fix crashes)-AI is totally stupid. If you shoot from the big distance, they wont even hear the shot. Sometimes if its a herd and you shoot one of the animals, other animals doesnt seem to care a bit and just keeps wandering. Also all animals always make a warning call when they hear you, so you can sprint all over the map, and get sneaky only when you hear a warning call. If you hit an animal, it will run for like 20 meters and then goes back to what he was doing, sometimes returning to the same place where you shot it. Also if you find a ""Need zone"", the animals keep returning there very soon even if you spook them or shoot them.-The multiplayer has no modes at all, but two modes were promised. Competetive and Cooperative. In online mode noone can take outposts, do missions or construct a tower. Only a host can do this. Also there's no competetivity since there's only a small feature to make a competition like ""Who shoots a buck first..."" etc., which often make your game crash and disconnect all your friends if you are the host of the server... -The storage doesnt work for all the items, for example you cant put the bullets there. So if you bought too many(like I did, since starting bullets are free), they will definitely slow you down, and you wont be able to do something unless you shoot them all in the air...-You cant construct all the equipment which you find on the map.-Animals doesnt seem to care if you switch the lamp right up their face.-Animals gets stuck in the enviroment so often that it became very common thing. Also sometimes they just stop and freezes, only moving it's head or not moving at all. It has some good features too. -The graphics are awesome! I play it on 2k and it looks amazing, the sounds are perfect except for the rabbit and squirrels since they are the loudest animals, I mean seriously, they are the loudest...-The maps are huge and gets different smoothly while you travel, the openings of lands are breathtaking.-Hunting at night is even more awesome than at daytime, the atmosphere feels perfect with all the sounds which differ from day and also the moon!...-Feed zones, rest zones etc. are awesome addition!-Rendering distance of animals is very big.-The grass is dynamic and you can see the animal trails on it, also your own and your friends if you play online. -You can make more sounds and animals wont spook when the wind gusts or rain starts, which is really realistic.It's a very promising game, but it is near to be unplayable at all at this state and it was definitely not ready for the release. I just hope it won't be an arcade hunting game, since we have lots of those and they are all crap. The Hunter Classic is still the best hunting game out there.			"

												                                                            Great game. Great potential.Recently bought it and instantly got treated with a patch. The devs covered many good things up and this game can be one of the top hunting games ever.But on considering the map size, the movement speed is a pain. Is the guy limp or something!!An annoying thing happened to me was that i shot a white tail, blood tracks told me ""BLOOD FLOW: Very Low"". I thought it would die in some time and i kept on tracking it for over and hour and it did not stop. It kept going round and round and roung a large lake and i never got the chance to catch it...SO PLSSS, CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT SPEED AND OTHER SMALL PROBLEMS AND MAKE IT THE BEST HUNTING EXPERIENCE EVER.

												EDIT REVIEW:After about 13hrs gameplay and some bugfixes from EW I can now recommend the game. If you can come along with a somehow weird XP system for unlocking and buying stuff and don't give a damn about leaderboards and competitions like in the classic version, then go ahead and buy this game. It is a pure hunting game with great graphics and a promising look into future patches and updates. There are still some bugs (not gamebreaking) but it looks like that they will be fixed soon.---- end of edit ----After this short time of playing (1.8hrs) I can say that there is a big potential in the game but also a lot of bugs which bring you down to typical EW reality.IN THE CURRENT STATE I CAN NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE OF:Small bugs I experienced:- in the menu (no return with ESC, no saving of sound settings for next gameplay)- the inventory (not possible to change between store and storage, freezing menu, not possible to change items from backpack to sorage and vice versa)- the menu itself looks like from a console game and is very complicated to go through- graphic glitches (when you crouch on uneven terrain you can see the 'underworld', sometimes you can see the red color of forgotten textures on objects)- when you change in permanent moving state (key 'G') with empty hands (key 'H') from running to walking the arms still swinging in running state- sometimes when walking with empty hands the mobile phone style Huntermate comes up with no screen (only the frame)This things will bring the fun factor down rapidly and leave you behind with a shaking head.I played the classic version since the very beginning and faced all this problems there. Bugs evolved over the years and piled up till today.The same will happend here I guess. It looks like that this game has not been tested properly before release and now this small bugs will stay there for a looooong time and the customers are fooled again.But that seems to be the politics and normal state with EW.What I not get is that there is a huge community willing to help with beta testing and still EW is not able to do it right. Not even after the mess with the classic version.If you do not have to, than do not buy this game now. Wait for a couple of months and some bug fixing which will hopefully occur....			"

												This game has a lot of potential, but it has a few bugs and is in mostly recommended for Console. I really didn't have any problems with the game at all but a few crashes here and there which made me restart from the very beginning. There aren't very many bugs like people say in the comments except for simple fix ones like, ALT-TAB out, or Graphics Card Crash. I'm just going to skip to the Pros, Cons, and Suggestions I have for the furture.Pros:-Beautiful Graphics -Smooth Gun Mechanics -Realistic Hunting Aspects-Runs good on High-end and low-end comuters-A Very Slow Paced Game-Fun to Play but You need to take the Time and Play It-Easy Controls-Multiplayer is fun if you have friend to play with-A Lot More You Need to Find Out Yourself!Cons:-Unexpected Crashes here and there-Not A Wide Selection on Weapons-Bullets do not penatrate through bones hitting Vital Organs (That I know of from my expirence)-Running is very slow-No Usual Updates for PC version (This Game is Mostly for Consoles)Suggestions:-Update the game more for PC!-Fix the Bugs-Add more DLC-Vechicles (It's a pain to have to slowly run everywhere)-More Varity of Weapons and Items OverallIn conculsion, this is a fun game overall but lacks a variety of espacts to add to the game. Just remember this is a game that was just released and they are still working on it, I understand! I would recommend this game if you like slow-paced and immersive games like I do!Cheers! -Xpheire			"

												Soooooo, this game. It looks damn amazing. The controls are solid and the aiming, shooting, etc. are competently done. But the reviews are mixed, so what gives?The big problem this game has at the moment is issues with animals getting stuck in terrain and you getting killed if you get stick in a little ditch in the ground.There's other issues too, for example I'm missing a decent form of transporation in the extremely vast maps. Yes there's teleport to outposts you discovered before, but getting there can sometimes take a very long time.Where's my Bullet cam? I know it's not realistic, but I loved having good shots rewarded with a satisfying Sniper-esque slowmo bullet-following camera. Sadly this game doesn't have this at all, not even as an option.Unlocking the various items can take a bit of time, with some of the objectives really testing your patience.The bugs are the major negative as far as I can see. The game is gorgeous though, the two environments are well crafted and positively massive in size. The sound design is a 9/10 with some individual sounds sticking out from the mix more than they should, but overall it's a beautiful experience to roam through the forest in this game. Some of ambient bird calls aren't exactly correct for a supposedly german forest, but I'm nitpicking here. The weapon sounds are realistic and satisfying. You only get two maps though, as well as a handful of weapons. The animal variety also isn't too great. However it's only 30 Euros at the time of writing, and the devs were smart enough to provide a skill and perk system to help with long term motivation. If you're a fan of hunting games, or enjoy realistic renditions of nature in games, this is a solid game. No microtransactions, what you see is what you get. Could do with bugfixing though. The issues don't happen all the time, but they're there.Overall, considering the price and the quality of the environments, and the otherwise solid shooting mechanics, I give this one a thumbs up.

												I don't really have much to say that is negative. Be prepared to walk. A lot. No, I mean a LOT. Luckily, I'm rather enjoying the strolls when the world looks as good as it does. Sound design is pretty fantastic. My only issue is that rabbits sometimes sound like they're a bear coming through the bushes to kill me. Other than that, I've yet to encounter a real bug but I have had one CTD on startup. Again, only 4 hours so far.That said, I'm iffy on whether or not to recommend this for anyone not super interested in playing a game about hunting. Sure, you don't have to sit in a blind nearly as long as you would IRL, but you will find yourself becoming impatient if moving slowly and being mindful of the wind isn't your thing. I would hope there are some additional ways to squeeze performance out of this game, but I'm lagging behind with a GTX 770 at this point, so I've got nothing really to complain about there.My only peeve is the UI. I find it somewhat cumbersome and the menus dont seem to flow fantastically. Beyond that, not having a way to quickly switch my ammo type without having to jump into the menu is slightly aggravating. All in all however, its a pretty solid game. WAY better than that F2P nonsense with more microtransactions than almost anything I've ever seen that they made previously. The lack of those micro's means this game flows much better. If you want to go hunting from the comfort of your gaming chair, or whatever it is you sit in, this is it.			"

												Overall great hunting game. Beauftiful environment, animals and sounds (minus weird noises from moving through brush sometimes,) animal AI is decent. Some issues with tracking not working as it should from time to time. Most realistic hunting simulator I've played******Warning: If you're playing with a keyboard and mouse, in its current state, you can't play very realistically because of the sound/stealth 'glitch' that many will have mentioned. Basically you can't move without making max noise with a keyboard, regardless of stance, so impossible to stalk properly. You can tap W to move forward (super annoying) and MAYBE get away with not making AS MUCH noise, but good luck keeping up with anything you're tracking unless it's at a needzone.*** Hopefully this is fixed in the very near future as I hear movement with controllers is great.

												Having played the Classic and enjoying it, I thought I would give this a go as keeping up with my price of the original is pretty hard going. After a few hours in I can say that the game is absolutely beautiful. I have had a few issues with bugs but what is there to expect? I had a stressful but fun time trying to track down my bear which I shot 4 times, in the end it was no where near I originally shot it haha.Hit reg could do with more work, sometimes shots do not count even though your scope is on the animal. Dropped from 100% accuracy to 60% just trying to shoot one animal. Also the reg when you do hit the animal needs work too. Example; I shoot the heart area but the animal limps away and then I cannot find it.One other thing that needs tweaking is the sound that you make when you move. It's extremely sensitive and nearly impossible to hunt anything because they all have super hearing. Animals are hearing me from 300m away.I would recommend this game though, even in it's current stage. I would say that I paid the right price for it.			"

												This is my first time leaving a review on Steam. Like many others I felt compelled to write a review to help others decide if this is worth a purchase in it's current state. After a considerable amount of play time, here is what I think so far! The first thing I noticed was how amazing this game looks! From lush forests to open strawfields to rocky mountains and lakes the maps provide a nice variety of scenery. The sound effects are very good and really help to immerse you in the environments. The weather system is also very good with effects like fog and cloud coverage changing lighting. The game mechanics feel good. Plenty of variety of animals. The progression system has been changed since launch making it much more accessible but somewhat challenging. Now to the ugly! This is the buggiest bugfest of a game I have ever played! Regular crashes, broken multiplayer, buggy menu icons, buggy animals, not being able to click and unlock things in the game and the list carrys on! With all that being said for me personally this game was worth the money. The developers seem to be working hard to fix issues and overall, issues aside, this has been an enjoyable experience. This game has a lot of potential.			"

												You have to respect development teams who cater so such a niche audience. It's really hard to find a decent hunting game now. The only one's that come to mind are Cabela's and the last game I (and many others) played from them magically stopped launching after about 30 hours. Call of the Wild is a flawed gem, though. It has some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen in a game. So beautiful that I often find myself surprised that it runs at all on my hardware (750ti, i5 7700k) With a huge map, day and night cycles and varying weather systems the game boasts a deeply immersive atmosphere that is only broken by the often buggy behavior of an animal you're hunting. I'm giving the game a positive review because I'm enjoying it, and I am confident the devs will fix the animal behavior/pathing.			"

												The Hunter: CotW is a beautiful game. Wonderful visuals and sound. I am a big fan of this creation. There are definitely some bugs that remain in the game even after the latest patch. But I still have a big amount of respect for what the developers are trying to achieve.I want to play this game for hours on end, but it feels as though the game (coding wise) is telling me not to. I have a computer that is more than robust enough to handle nearly all games on high to ultra settings and there is no reason this game should crash as much as it has. I really hope that the developers can continue to fix known issues for all the fans who have supported this game. I recommend this game to potential customers in hopes that these issues will be solved. However, be warned that before you purchase there might be some heartache ever so often. Cheers			"

												ive been kinda debating on doing a review so here we go ill start with the positives.-the game is beautiful and everything runs super smooth. (atleast for me)-super fun game even better with freinds-the ai are stupid but dont get stuck on twigs and trees like in classic the hunter even in dense vegetation-animals leave trails in the tall grass which to me is  amazing.theres a few others but i cant think of em atm but time for the negatives since people say there isnt game breaking glitches.-sometimes glitches and you cant claim any kills but your freinds can as long as they are in the area-you clip underground at times-animals take bullets like they are wearing bullet proof vests even with vital hits with the exception of yotes and foxes and-animals instead of comming into calls play ring around the rosie with trees intill you move up on them.(watched a buck do it for 5 mins so if you are wondering where your deer is hes probably doing that)-when i switch reserves atleast in singleplayer i get teleported outside the map and cant teleport anywhere.that covers most of it.is this game worth buying? yes----update. they have released a patch that fixed 90% of the issues.  so gg expansive worlds			"

												Got charged by a bear after I shot her babyThen I shot her and killed herthen I sold her fur in order to buy more ammothen I used that ammo to finish of her baby.Jokes aside, this game, while I've only played it for about two hours at this point and I have yet to try out multiplayer, feels great for what it promises to deliver.With (extremely) beutiful scenery and graphics this game immerses you heavily into the mindset of a hunter, and while some of the hunting aspects are a bit clunky, like a deer being able to hear you crawling in the middle of a thunderstorm 60 meters away, the problems i've experienced are relatively minor and should be fixed very soon.+No microtransactions, they have been replaced by gaining money from selling your kills; A quick and clean kill on a buck might yield you 1500 funbucks, and a new gun will cost you around 20-30k. The first gun is not bad, however, and its ammunition is free to refill.+GRAPHICS+Tracking, while simple, is a nice mechanic that I believe is unique for this game series.+The new tracking system includes ""need spots"" where you can stalk out your prey, for example: One need spot might be a drinking area for a herd of deer, they'll come back here during the time that is stated, and you can simply wait for them to fall into your trap.+A new trophy screen, where it will show you where your bullet hit aswell as a picture detailing the trajectory of it, and how much damage/how lethal it was on a % base, allowing you to learn where to aim next time. I, however, only aim for the neck, because there's nothing quite like paralyzing an animal and then simply walking up to it and finishing it off (thats ♥♥♥♥ed up).+THE GRASS PARTS IF AN ANIMAL (OR YOU) WALK THROUGH IT+The map is HUGE.+The sounds are very nice, and immerses you into the feeling of being in a real forest...except for one of them...-Theres this one sound that sounds exactly like something rubbing up against your jacket. This one sound has made me almost♥♥♥♥♥♥myself atleast 3 times in 2 hours played. I've narrowed it down and I believe it's the sound the rabbits make when they run through the underbrush.-The weather system is out of whack. One minute you've got perfect sunny weather, the next you've got a thunderstorm on your hands which deafens and blindens you (and only you, by the looks of things).-A glitch I've encountered after every 1 shot kill, the HUD of the scope will dissapear, leaving you staring through the plastic edges of a scope as if somebody removed the magnifying glass.-The menu system is crap and needs a total rehaul. The buttons dont respond half the time and esc doesn't actually back you out of the current menu, leaving you struggling to get back in the game just in time to see a bear charging you because you dared exist in a 2km vicinity of her.+-Relatively few animals, however this can be explained by the fact that they're trying to bring us a realistic biome, where every animal on earth doesn't actually live in the same park.I'll try to remember to update this review after I've tried the multiplayer or after the next patch, whichever comes first. However, as it is now, I would recommend this game for anybody who's not gonna get bored of walking through beutiful scenery where you get maybe 1 minute of action for every 10 minute walked.EDIT: Having put a few more hours into this game, it has become clear to me that it is an unfinished mess. While the scenery and all the positives I listed above still apply, the negatives turn this otherwise enjoyable game into a chore itself.Not only do your graphical settings reset if you do ANYTHING other than walking (fire your gun? Your POV is going back to the default 60) but the menu you have to work through in order to change it is, as mentioned above, a pain.I've also noticed a painful unfairness in how terrain affects you. The animal you are stalking can and WILL see or hear you through that mountain inbetween you, and you'll never see it again.While the removal of microtransactions is a good thing, the fact that I have to level up my rifle skills in order to get anything other than the default rifle, sort of makes the same result.They replaced the buying of guns with hours upon hours of grinding.As of now, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. Wait a few months for patches.			"

												                                                            Great game. Great potential.Recently bought it and instantly got treated with a patch. The devs covered many good things up and this game can be one of the top hunting games ever.But on considering the map size, the movement speed is a pain. Is the guy limp or something!!An annoying thing happened to me was that i shot a white tail, blood tracks told me ""BLOOD FLOW: Very Low"". I thought it would die in some time and i kept on tracking it for over and hour and it did not stop. It kept going round and round and roung a large lake and i never got the chance to catch it...SO PLSSS, CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT SPEED AND OTHER SMALL PROBLEMS AND MAKE IT THE BEST HUNTING EXPERIENCE EVER.

												Many Bugs! In 9 hours i played i noticed several of them. THEY JUMP YOU IN THE EYES! Unbelievable the devs not has recognized them. Thats the thing i don´t understand. Only a half day of playing the game for recognizing and locating the biggest bugs. The worstest: -No ESC button works in Menu. -You also cannot go to Main Menu. Only to desktop. -MP with friend: You only can kill animals like in an Shooter, nothing with doing the Quests together.-Key and Mouse-Bindings - totally crap. -Animals run in circle when you shot them. Stuck on ground or stones. -grainy graphics for the trees.and many more...I give a better Rating if the biggest Bugs are resolved.Edit: Biggest bugs are resolved. - Like			"

												EDIT REVIEW:After about 13hrs gameplay and some bugfixes from EW I can now recommend the game. If you can come along with a somehow weird XP system for unlocking and buying stuff and don't give a damn about leaderboards and competitions like in the classic version, then go ahead and buy this game. It is a pure hunting game with great graphics and a promising look into future patches and updates. There are still some bugs (not gamebreaking) but it looks like that they will be fixed soon.---- end of edit ----After this short time of playing (1.8hrs) I can say that there is a big potential in the game but also a lot of bugs which bring you down to typical EW reality.IN THE CURRENT STATE I CAN NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE OF:Small bugs I experienced:- in the menu (no return with ESC, no saving of sound settings for next gameplay)- the inventory (not possible to change between store and storage, freezing menu, not possible to change items from backpack to sorage and vice versa)- the menu itself looks like from a console game and is very complicated to go through- graphic glitches (when you crouch on uneven terrain you can see the 'underworld', sometimes you can see the red color of forgotten textures on objects)- when you change in permanent moving state (key 'G') with empty hands (key 'H') from running to walking the arms still swinging in running state- sometimes when walking with empty hands the mobile phone style Huntermate comes up with no screen (only the frame)This things will bring the fun factor down rapidly and leave you behind with a shaking head.I played the classic version since the very beginning and faced all this problems there. Bugs evolved over the years and piled up till today.The same will happend here I guess. It looks like that this game has not been tested properly before release and now this small bugs will stay there for a looooong time and the customers are fooled again.But that seems to be the politics and normal state with EW.What I not get is that there is a huge community willing to help with beta testing and still EW is not able to do it right. Not even after the mess with the classic version.If you do not have to, than do not buy this game now. Wait for a couple of months and some bug fixing which will hopefully occur....			"

												Edit after Patch 1.1:First of all i now did change my rating from thumbs down to up and here is why.The developer has addressed many issues i had with the game, mainly the interface and menu problems which for me are all gone but one thing, i could not change my resolution anymore because the apply button next to it did not work, but i am sure this will be adressed quickly since it did work before 1.1When it comes to gameplay issues and bugs caused by the environment i know these will take time to adjust since its such a big game and i for myself do not expect that this is done overnight.I will however say i do not like the ui they chose in the store and inventory, its so different form everything else you are used to as a gamer and it is not intuitive, but once you get the hang of it it works.Overall i recommend this game for everyone who meets the necessary minimum specs,especially considering the price, which is only half of what has become the standard price for games today.I hope the developer stays on track with the patches and if anything major game breaking happens in the future i will edit this review again.Inital review:This game is clearly in an unfinished state, mainly problems with menus and keybindings, graphic glitches and so forth.I was hyped for the game for a long time since i have 400H played in the hunter classic.In this game like in so many other as a day one buyer you feel like a beta tester thats a real shame, at least mark it as early access then.I will change my review when the game is in a playable state since you could get a lot for your money here when it finaly works.EDIT: Since this review somehow made it to the top of the reviews i kinda feel obliged to add a little bit more so people see more then just a day 1 rant for their first review.Like stated above the games menus and configuration is what causes the most problems for me those are things that are easily fixable however and might depend on what hardware specs you use so here a mine for a little more insight. My pc is build by myself and is all new from January 2017CPU: i5 7600K @ 5.0GHZ MOBO: Asrock z170 Extreme 4 GPU: Powercolor Red Devil RX480 8GB RAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance @ 3000 CL15With that pc i do not have any problems running the game in 1440p fps wise but i still encounter random crashes that can not be attributed to anything in particular, sometimes when i press esc sometimes when i just press E to respond to a call.The mouse sensitivy setting seem to take no effect i got a logitech G402 but other people have also brought up this issue in the steam forums.Keybinding is a nightmare its unresponsive and never unbind you mouse buttons or you cant restore them unless you scroll down to the end and do a reset to default, if you want to bind mouse 4 or 5 (side buttons) the game crashes instantly.The animal AI is not very clever, the pathfinding is just not done well enough, they run into things all the time and get stuck, also once they run away from you they will only remember your last postion, so you can make them flee into your arms when you spook them a second time, kinda funny but anoying.Also HoorCairs a well respected community member did say on his Youtube lets play that the best way to shoot deer is to run trough the woods an go after them when they flee since its the easiest way to track them, thats true and shouldnt be like that.The first rifle with the default ammo does nearly no damage at all, and searching and finding a wounded animal is hard since the ui is so overloaded with informations from other animals.I do see why they did that since you need to have a reason to justify the other rifles but they overdid it on that one in my opinion.I could list more game mechanic issues, but just refere to the steam forum of the game and you will see them, so i'm not going to list them all here since this was never meant to be such a long review in the first place, i only want people to be aware that at this time the game feels more like a beta then a finished game.And as always you are welcome to disagree, especially on the gameplay elements, but please also respect other peoples opinions.

												So yes, I know I only have 2 hours in game right now but hey... I like this game. This game is BEAUTIFUL when it comes down to graphics and its deffinatly a game that you would play to cool off from another game, or if you just wanna relax. Now the crappiest thing thats happened to me so far, was when I found my first buck... I was about 150 meters out, lined up the shot... BOOM! Shot him right in the lung. He took it like a champ and took off running. So I tracked his foot prints and blood trails for nearly and hour (yes, half my in-game time was tracking a deer). The wounds that I would track said that the bleed level was 'very low', but for him to bleed for roughly an hour is insain, but I kept going just to find that his tracks kept going. After nearly discovering more than half the map searching for him, I called it quits, he got away... :(   Mabye some other day Ill get him.			"

												Ok.. this game has excellent graphics. It is quite impressive as far as graphics go and is extremely well optimized. Is alot of fun but if you have played Hunter Classic this game is totally different in gameplay style. Classic has Tru-Racs which make you patiently wait for that elusive huge trophy, but this has a generic looking trophy antler system and dosnt have the same big trophy feel. In Classic i tended to let alot of animals alone, while really zeroing in on that big one. This one i pretty much shoot anything that moves with a seemingly underpowered weapon to get the money and xp to unlock the guns. If this had Tru-Racs and a bit easier cash, this would definitely be the one and only hunting game worth playing. It had alot of bugs at release, and these seem to be getting fixed which is good. Hopefully tru racks gets put in and i will spend a lot more time in it.			"

												If you're not sure if you want to buy this game, just do it. This game has the best scenery and god rays of any hunting game. The fact that the game is only $30 USD is a steal. Granted there are issues every now and then but they are working on fixes. I haven't had any major issues with the game (i.e. crashes, major fps loss, etc) the only time my fps drops is when I've been tracking an animal for a loooong time. That could've been avoided by just taking time and wait for a cleaner shot. Nonetheless, that is problem that should be fixed ASAP. Other than the game is wonderful 10/10 would recommend.PC Specs:AMD FX-8350 cpu (non-overclocked)16 GB Ram (2400 mHz)Sapphire R9 290X 750W PSUmy average FPS i would say is around 55.i play on everything on high with motion blur off, and filtering on 2x.

												I personally hunt in real life, and I've always enjoyed hunting games. Yes, it's not completely realistic, but it's kind of close. The deer can glitch out and run in place making for an easy kill, the deer don't recognize you as quickly as they do in real life, and some deer can run for miles in the game with a bullet in their lung. But, I'll start talking about some of the good things that this game has to offer. there's a nice selection of weapons in the game (In my opinion), though you need a certain ""Rifle Score"" or ""Handgun score"" or ""Shotgun score"" to be able to buy them (the scores need to be in their respective categories. So for unlocks some rifles a higher rifle score is needed etc...). That needed score can need to be quite high to be able to buy some of the guns, and it'll take a while, but I have fun in the game. There is also a lot of animals to shhot. I personally am still using the gun the game gives you at the start because I like it, though you might need some more powerful guns to take down some bears, and moose quicker (the starting gun is still pretty good though). Yes, some people might say ""He only has 9 hours into the game (Currently), why should I listen to his opinion?"". My answer: you don't need to listen to my opinion if you don't want to listen to it. That's your decision if you want to listen to me. I could write for a long time on this game, and I haven't listed all of the things that this game has to offer, but I'll update this when I get further into the game. I would like to see this game have some vehicles added to it because running 5 miles is not very fun, and it takes a VERY long time.			"

												Game looks awesome but I guess I don't have the newest gear so I play this game in slow motion! It takes an eternity to get from one place to the other! Also I don't know if anyone else is having this issue but it seems every once in a while when I press the auto walk button (G) my gun fires? There's nothing like taking an hour to stalk an animal and all the sudden KABOOM, my gun fires for no reason other then to scare the crap out of me and any animal within a mile! I don't know if it's just my lack of gear power  or if this is occuring throughout with any who play? Also when I set a waypoint in a certain spot I've noticed the way point shows up where I placed it and also exactly 180 degrees behind me! The waypoint behind me shows the distance is greater heading towards it and It doesn't show on my map but just on the game screen while I play! It's confusing and irritating! Also I noticed while crawling that I have the ability to crawl through objects such as rocks the size of a recliner! I haven't logged a lot of time with it yet, just a few issue's I've noticed along the way! Other then the few irritations I've encountered this game has stunning beauty and there's a lot of exploring to do! Tracking an animal is really fun and there's definately an art to it! If you like to hunt and explore the wild beauty this game is the ticket.			"

												So what do I think of this game?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;dr version:Overall I give it an 8 / 10.Should you get it? If you are worried about bugs/glitches then I would wait until they get some patches going to make the game more stable. Other than that, I say get it and enjoy it. It's amazing!The new-release crashes/issues are dragging down the experience a bit (though this is of course temporary until they get it fixed) and the somewhat limited amount of animals and gear (compared to my experience in Classic) means it has some extra efforts needed to be put in to give a higher rating.On the positive side it has amazing graphics, fun gameplay (easy to get into and find animals to shoot) and a progression and mission system which allows you to forget the time and stay in the game for hours. The developers have shown in the Classic that they always keep adding content to the game. I am confident they will do the same for this game.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First off lets take a moment and realize that the game is fresh out the door at time of writing (currently patch 1.21), and some of things I will be mentioning in this review may be resolved in the near future.The positives Amazing graphics. Game looks absolutely stunning. Progression system (listing this as a positive) which gives you a sense of accomplishment when you can afford a new gun or afford new lures and so on. Skill / perk system that allows you to fine tune your hunter for your preferred hunting style. Easier to hunt and kill animals (compared to Classic) which makes it more available for average / casual gamer. Mission (quest) system which encourages you to explore the mapThe negatives (most of these are related to current issues and content, both which I am convinced will be improved upon in future). Crashes/freezing is a big one. Personally I can play singleplayer without issues, but multiplayer freezes me up after about 10-15 minutes in. Expecting this to be resolved in very near future. Animal AI can sometimes be a bit silly. I can spot 2 Roe Deer, shoot one, immediately use the Lure Caller and the 2nd Roe Deer will wander right back in mere minutes allowing me to shoot it. Animals should be a bit less... well... stupid? Animal pathing causes them to get stuck. Not uncommon to see an animal that is 'glitching out' as it has become stuck between two rocks, or two trees or something similar. Some UI issues, e.g. no Exit to Main Menu (only exit to desktop). Some settings do not stay saved, e.g. changing Aim (through scope) to Toggle rather than holding down RMB will reset back to holding down button after awhile (seems to happen after harvesting a kill)For the Classic hunters!So how what is missing compared to the Classic? First off there is not too many animals in the game (yet). About 6-7 animals on each map. This is about same as for a single map in Classic though, but it means the total variation of animals is a bit smaller. Fairly modest selection of weapons and lures where in Classic you a huge selection of weapons, callers, lures and equipment. No bird hunting in the game (although you often find birds sitting on ground who then take flight when you get close) No small game hunting (besides Red Fox / Coyote). You can find rabbits and squirrels running around (and even shoot them) but you can't harvest them for points. No placeable equipment such ground blinds, tree stands, feeders and such. No doggies.What I am hoping for in the future:More animals (small game and birds especially)More weaponsMore equipmentDoggies!Placeable equipmentAll of these things I am sure will be coming in the future though. The Classic game has had many years of regularly adding content to the game to expand it to the huge hunting game it is now with such a rich and varied amount of content.I have complete faith in this game as well and trust the developers to be adding more and more content to this game over the coming months and years ahead to make this new hunting game just as rich and amazing as it's older brother.Stay with it and great things will happen!

My pc is build by myself and is all new from January 2017CPU: i5 7600K @ 5.0GHZ MOBO: Asrock z170 Extreme 4 GPU: Powercolor Red Devil RX480 8GB RAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance @ 3000 CL15With that pc i do not have any problems running the game in 1440p fps wise but i still encounter random crashes that can not be attributed to anything in particular, sometimes when i press esc sometimes when i just press E to respond to a call.The mouse sensitivy setting seem to take no effect i got a logitech G402 but other people have also brought up this issue in the steam forums.Keybinding is a nightmare its unresponsive and never unbind you mouse buttons or you cant restore them unless you scroll down to the end and do a reset to default, if you want to bind mouse 4 or 5 (side buttons) the game crashes instantly.The animal AI is not very clever, the pathfinding is just not done well enough, they run into things all the time and get stuck, also once they run away from you they will only remember your last postion, so you can make them flee into your arms when you spook them a second time, kinda funny but anoying.Also HoorCairs a well respected community member did say on his Youtube lets play that the best way to shoot deer is to run trough the woods an go after them when they flee since its the easiest way to track them, thats true and shouldnt be like that.The first rifle with the default ammo does nearly no damage at all, and searching and finding a wounded animal is hard since the ui is so overloaded with informations from other animals.I do see why they did that since you need to have a reason to justify the other rifles but they overdid it on that one in my opinion.I could list more game mechanic issues, but just refere to the steam forum of the game and you will see them, so i'm not going to list them all here since this was never meant to be such a long review in the first place, i only want people to be aware that at this time the game feels more like a beta then a finished game.And as always you are welcome to disagree, especially on the gameplay elements, but please also respect other peoples opinions.

												This game has a lot of potential, but it has a few bugs and is in mostly recommended for Console. I really didn't have any problems with the game at all but a few crashes here and there which made me restart from the very beginning. There aren't very many bugs like people say in the comments except for simple fix ones like, ALT-TAB out, or Graphics Card Crash. I'm just going to skip to the Pros, Cons, and Suggestions I have for the furture.Pros:-Beautiful Graphics -Smooth Gun Mechanics -Realistic Hunting Aspects-Runs good on High-end and low-end comuters-A Very Slow Paced Game-Fun to Play but You need to take the Time and Play It-Easy Controls-Multiplayer is fun if you have friend to play with-A Lot More You Need to Find Out Yourself!Cons:-Unexpected Crashes here and there-Not A Wide Selection on Weapons-Bullets do not penatrate through bones hitting Vital Organs (That I know of from my expirence)-Running is very slow-No Usual Updates for PC version (This Game is Mostly for Consoles)Suggestions:-Update the game more for PC!-Fix the Bugs-Add more DLC-Vechicles (It's a pain to have to slowly run everywhere)-More Varity of Weapons and Items OverallIn conculsion, this is a fun game overall but lacks a variety of espacts to add to the game. Just remember this is a game that was just released and they are still working on it, I understand! I would recommend this game if you like slow-paced and immersive games like I do!Cheers! -Xpheire			"

												9/10The good: Very relaxing, low-paced, gorgeous hunting simulator.The bad: I am a little bit dissapointed with the performance of this game; I have an i7-4770K with GTX970 and 16GB of RAM  but I still have to lower a few settings like shadow quality and water quality ( among others ) to run at a playable 60fps.

												I like it.I thought it will be more buggy and crash every 5min as some ""trolls"" say. I havn't single crash.However minor bugs are in game.  Stuck animals, loop sounds in rainy day at lakes, loadout setup changes without reason and  so on. All are rare. FPS drop is only when you track animal realy long and your PDA is full of dots.All issue is nothing in comparison what you get, views, enviroment, challenges. It is amazing.Ammo price is ok. keep in mind that some weapons has lower prices as before. You can shoot elk with .270 as well as with .30-30. it does not kill instant but if you place shot in a right place animal do not run more than 100m. Bison need ~2-4 shots with 0.270It is simulator. it is not a run and shoot game. Go play cs:go if you do not like it.			"

												New patch just came out today and it shows the developers are listening to feedback and acting upon it fairly quickly.  This is huge and is why I am here righting a review.  This still feels a bit like a beta launch and there are more kinks to work out but overall the game is progressing nicely.  Its a lot like the orginal but much improved visually.  Some of the changes in feel were hard to adjust to but now are growing on me.  Overall I still recomend the game but know its not quite fully polished.  Biggest problem, and this is going to kill the game if not fixed IMO, we need multiplayer competitions that you can play accross the entire game, and we need this sooner rather than later.  These competitions are the only reason why myself and so many others continued to play the orginal Hunter and are vastly important to the longevity of the new game.  The current single server comps are a good adition but are still a bit unrealiable and are no where near a replacement for a real comp system like the original.			"

												Love the game great mechanics and all, however. ♥♥♥♥ my life the photo missons are absolutely broken, I have just spent the last maybe 15 hours in real life trying to get a photo of ""2 bears"" in a certain area of the map, thats not a problem I have found maybe 3-4 groups of bears and I get as close as I can maybe 25-30 meters, I take hundreds of photo's and not a single cvnting one registers. so I want my 15 hours of my life back trying to complete this stupid mission. other than the missions if your not bothered about doing them you can just shoot stuff.. The other mission which made me restart a whole new game because it was buuged is ""kill 2 whitetails at Night"" that again took me about 10 hours. so the majority of the time ive spent playing the game is doing bugged missions!!! not FUN!Edit: passed the bear mission submitted feedback on the bugs/issue reporting page. still really enjoying the game			"

												Short review: game is pretty good, but I crash on high settings, pretty sure I would be able to play on high, look at my specs:nVIDIA EVGA GEFORCE GTX 970i5-6600k 3.5GHz16 GB of RAM or Memory500GB SDD Main Drive, 500GB HDD Secondary Drive, 1TB HDD Backup550W Power supplyZ170A ASUS MotherboardThink the CPu is a little low, but other than that i should be able to play on highish settings, but I crash a lot on high, so im forced to play on medium and I downloaded a mod that ""buffs"" the graphics. ITs called reshade, theres a guide on steam: 


How to make the game sharper and less blurry 
A Guide for theHunter™: Call of the Wild

			A quick guide on how to improve the visuals by adding ReShade.		


 check it out, play with some of the  graphic things. Id rate this game a 8/10 so far.			"

												All IN All Good. Complaints,What's with the Gun and bullet choices? They border on inhuman, what bullet at 10 feet to the head could not kill a dear outright? I end up shooting them 4 times and they still get away. It would be nice to have more guns choices, muzzleloader, .30-08, .300 WIN Mag, 300 ultra win. These are more common than an odd .273 is it? Never even heard of that caliber! Only need one of each, unless you open to the community and users can reskin. Why all the polymer tipped ammo? Why am I allowed to hunt at night? I don't think any state allows night hunting maybe of certain species but not deer. Also shooting assistance, tripods, monopods, different positions maybe including sitting! I can't see out of the buildings when I'm crotching, and I doubt any hunter stands and shots when they can sit and use a pod. Also The Hunter has tree stands, I would like that can maybe some mobile concealment. Other than that this game is fun, it's like hunting. Super slow and boring. "

												It's hard to give this game a thumbs down. There's a lot to love, but there are also an unacceptable amount of bugs and some missing features (fowl hunting, mobile outpost, equipment variety). Now that they announced the development of versions for PS4 and XBone, PC gamers are concerned how dedicated EW will be to fixing their broken product. They claim they won't give up on us, but only time will tell.Edit 4/18/2017Happy to change review to ""reccomend"" due to the progress made in the past few patches. Still hope to see some added features, but I'd be willing to pay for them as DLC.			"

												I love this game with my heart and soul. Only problem is the fact that there is a bunch of really stupid main quests. Not only that but the travel time is horendous so I love this game, but I still can't recamend it because it has some parts to it that I think are stupid and beyond pointless.			"

												I've had a great time playing theHunter call of the wild. A huge improvement over thehunter classic. Way more immersive,beautiful, enjoyable. I recommend this to anyone who was in love with the original hunter game, and people coming new to this series. They do have some bugs here and there, but nothing was game breaking for me, i binged hours on end in weekends, the experience was very enjoyable. The devs are constantly working on patching the game, and i trust they'll make it right for the community they have built around this series. No other hunting game provides the same level of depth and realism for me. I'm really excited for when they'll add duck hunting back into the game and see how it plays out.I recommend trying this out for 2 hours, experience the beauty of the reserves and the gunplay. If its not for you, just refund it.			"

												I really enjoy this game. REALLY! The objective sounds basic and simple: Track down animals using a tracking device and shoot the animal. Except the game is a lot more difficult and slow paced than it sounds. It has taken me more than 20 real mintues just to kill a single black bear. But after playing an intense game of Rainbow Six Siege this game is perfect to relieve yourself. The graphics are great and it is super fun to finally kill an animal after such a long track. In my opinion, most people who think negatively against this game are people who are too impacient or do not have a computer who can run the game well enough. NOTE: If you are a bit impacient you may not enjoy the game as much as others. But anyway, i have had a lot of fun and cant wait to keep playing it.			"

												If you like running around an open world, and don't mind having to be patient, or take 30 minutes to properly stalk an animal with a bow, this is the game for you. As of right now, there are still bugs here and there, but the number has been greatly reduced since I started playing, and none have been game breaking for me.			"

												UPDATE:   Check out the new game coming out in June, called Hunting Simulator on Steam.  Happy to see there is a chance we will get a good hunting game this year.  This game feels and plays like they rushed it on us, because they knew this other one was coming.  Wait before wasting your money on this, chances are great that Simulator will be alot better then this mess.They Lied to us about this game being done, it is a early alpha at the best.  I have played more stable and more fun pre alpha games before.  And it has been a few months and it is just as bad as the day it came out, it seems, based on comments about bugs.  I played it for 35 hours but with the bugs and missing gameplay, game was a vary big disapointment.  I uninstalled it till it is much better, way it is looking, that may not happen for a vary long time, if ever.  So please save your money for a game other then this, you will to be missing anything, by not getting this one.  Maybe if it was 75% off.  No, not even then....  at this time. Thank you			"
