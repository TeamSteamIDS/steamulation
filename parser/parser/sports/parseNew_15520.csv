												Here is a game that loses its appeal in about 30 minutes. Sure, the first 5 or 10 minutes you think the game is kinda cool, but by minute 15 you will have decided the game is a bit boring and repititous, by minute 30 you will have decided the game is no longer fun to play, and after 2 hours of game play you will think there are far better uses of Harddrive space than AaAaAA!!!  - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.

												This game is like crack......not for everyone but if it's your thing you're gonna have a hard time stopping.I get the negative reviews for this game; it has indeed been superseeded by an improved version, (but if you're limited by  old hardware like I am this version has lower system requirements), and yes it is in a sense repetitive.... but it's a base jumping game, I honestly don't know what more people were hoping for. You jump off things, gravity takes over and you steer, as with actual base jumping.This game isnt rocket science, but it is challenging and although as stated above, it is the same basic action and objective in every level. However, the levels are massively varied and theres a few extra things thrown in, (hand gestures and spraypainting buildings with the mouse). Above all else this game is immersive and a huge ammount of fun, one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time.			"

												This is one of those games that you probably pulled out back when Steam used to do their sales events. Then you put it back away for a very long time. I don't blame you. It's fun for about 15 minutes, but then you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. There's only so much fun you can have in a game about jumping off buildings. Well....maybe that's not true, but there's only so much fun you can have in this game.You start each round by jumping off a building. Points are scored for getting close to objects without hitting them, interacting with people (thumbs up or flipping off), flying through certain gates, and sticking your landing. This gameplay can only interest you for so long. The controls work well enough while falling, except controlling after deploying your parachute can be a little awkward.The visuals are bright and intense, but not all that interesting. There are lots of flashing lights which could be problematic to some people. The music is fast and somewhat entertaining. Maybe the best part of the game.I could not recommend this game for more than a few minutes playtime. Fire it up if you got it in a bundle, but you will quickly put it back away.Grade: D+			"

												I really enjoyed this game, mostly because of its originality; most games aren’t about skydiving off buildings. I’ve come back to play it for a while, I want to say I’ve got about 2 hours into it. At this point, I need to replay some levels to get more points to unlock more stages, so I doubt I’ll play it again and beat it, but it was fun for the low price of whatever I got it for. Overall, I would recommend this if it’s cheap enough.			"

												An extremely simple concept, which often leads to very addictive games. Short description, you jump of things and try to hit the landing zone in one piece. Doing that is generally achievable. Doing it with high points, a bit more tricky, and therein lies the fun. It's kind of hard to describe, look at their promo stuff, they're not lying, it is a fun game. For the price, definitely worth it.			"

												Clever title, clever mechanics, clever bits of story/extra material. There isn't too much more that's good about the game. While it's fun to play for a bunch of the levels, it slowly decends to a kind of perfectionist/point ♥♥♥♥♥ style of gameplay where you can only advance if you play previous levels to excess to get more teeth (in-game currency) and allow you to unlock more levels. I wouldn't mind so much if the teeth values for most levels were significantly lowered, but having to play and 5-star the easiest level 200 times to unlock the next level is tedious. Other than the occasional ARG content, it's not worth playing past a certain point mid-way through what's available and leaves much to be desired.If you really want to play it: unlock all the little extra videos/audio content first, then see how far you can get. The extra little tidbits are genuinely hilarous by virtue of surreal humor. Generally: give this a miss.			"

												AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! – A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a game in which you play a virtual basejumper who jumps through a series of maps attempting to rack up points by staying close to obstacles, spray-painting buildings, flipping off people who dislike you, and breaking plates with points on them while still landing safely. The levels are mostly very stylized (with a few which are meant to mimic natural landscapes). The game is very entertaining for the first bit, but is best experienced in bite-sized chunks. Once you've done a few levels, take a break and come back later - it can get repetitive rapidly, and while the later levels definitely add a lot more to keep track of, the core mechanics remain consistent.It's a pity, because the later levels are the better ones in the game, but ultimately, since the replayability is based off of the levels you've unlocked it doesn't feel like there's a great deal of depth beyond what you see on the surface.I had a good time with it. However, I've only played about 5 hours and I feel ""done"" with it - I don't have any particular desire to go back into it. If you're looking for a neat, stylized experience? Hard to do any better. Just don't expect a whole lot of play time for your dollars.			"

												accurate and heart-wrenching videogame adaptation of The Bridge, a 2006 Britsh-American documentary film by the acclaimed visionary Eric Steel. in AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity the player takes the role of an unnamed jumper reliving his leap off of the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge in purgatory, unlocking his way to heaven by falling down stylized levels while flying near buildings (hereby believed to be the game's way of portraying the monumental, almost skyscraper like undertaking of preparing for death) and flipping off spectators (perhaps a representation of the filmmaker's own Jungian psyche) among other objectives. It is the deepest game of the 21st century and is easily the greatest example of storytelling in any medium, the Citizen Kane of videogames, proving that interaction fiction can truly become art. Robert Ebert once remarked that this game made him reconsider his views on mortality and also jumping off of buildings. playing his game was a life-changing experience and immediately after playing i conspired to jump off a building with a parachute while trying to flip-off everyone i see on the way down.10/10 it's ok			"

												First of all: The title is awesome and it's a great example for the kind of humor that Dejobaan Games stands for. Now, what is this game about? There's no real story to speak of. You are some guy, who does BASE jumps from very large buildings. Don't mistake this game for some sort of simulation though, you don't just jump off of real skyscrapers, but rather interesting and fictional constructions and there is quite an array of things to do on your way down. The game is very highscore oriented, so the most replay value comes out of reaching the best score you possibly can on each level and while that could sound dull to some, I really enjoyed playing it.

												My Take: A frantic paced game where you attempt to reach perfection on each level and will not rest until you have five stars. Rude gesture to all the protesters out there.	Graphics: Simple polygons, but everything is distinctive enough that you can make out what's what during high speeds.Sound: Enough entertaining noises to distract you from how annoyed you are.Music: Not good enough to listen to on its own, but well suits the pace of the game.Controls: Standard look and movement bindings, but I should figure out better bindings for the other actions. I end up accidentally pressing a wrong key at inopportune times.Did I Finish It: Not 100%, but I got to the end.Will I Play it Again: Depends on how much content is in AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!, which I have yet to play. It's is supposed to have the same levels remastered, so I'm going to say no.Should You Buy It: If the above holds true, they're the same price so don't bother.			"

												AaAaAA!!! is a strange and unusual game. The premise being simple, score points by being wreckles while you base jump from floating structures. The gameplay is simple enough, control your decent, gain as many points as possible by ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" strucutres, hitting scoreplates and flipping off protesters.Part of AaAaAA!!!'s charm is that it's completely tongue-in-cheek as far as ""the man"" goes. It's a strange game that no one else has really managed to pull off with a correct mix of apathy for political agendas.Even the title theme gives a good hint as to the attitude of the game. While it may be oler, it's still a great experience to hop on every once in awhile and stands out as a shining unique experience.			"

Despite being palpably absurd, the aesthetic of the game manages to be believable in its own right, in a vein similar to Death Race 2000, perhaps, or Hackers.  In an alternate timeline where the fluke discovery of ""polystructures"" has radically changed human technology, culture, and society, the jaded and apathetic Gen Y crowd (undoubtedly much more so in this parallel world) apparently go in big for hurling yourself off of buildings and navigating floating metropolitan structures, all at risk of death.

												I had already played this game a bit before the Potato Sack promotion, but due to said promotion, I have finally had a chance to put a decent chunk fo time into it to make a recommendation. AaAaAA is a pretty fun - if sometimes frustrating - game which involves BASE jumping from the tops of skyscrapers, floating platforms, mountains and more. It is not a ""realistic"" BASE jumping simulation, though. The levels are crazy-insane and the game is rife with a twisted sense of humor, which all comes together to make AaAaAA a very unique experience. While some levels can be extremely challenging, failure usually leaves you with a ""just one more time"" feeling, rather than outright frustration. I thought AaAaAA was well worth the price of admission, and recommend it if you are looking for something completely fresh to kill some time.			"

												Pretty crappy.

Hope you're proud of your perplexing design decision because it ♥♥♥♥ed me up.As for the game itself, some levels have a bit of a super meat boy vibe of short levels with challenging manuvering, but sometimes they make the levels long so it's hard to practice them, especially the end of the level because it's hard to get to it.  Also it's a little needlessly unforgiving, such as falling on a 1 degree plane counting as falling onto flat ground, and catching the very corners of things should damage you sure but it just anihilates you instantly.Another really messed up thing is that they're offering a one-time-only achievement.

Motion sickness, the game.The title of the game is accurate. There's not a whole lot to say here - it's a well designed, simple concept that's extremely fun. I don't see myself playing this to the point of obsession, but I will definitely play until I unlock everything and see what else I can do with it. For those of you who are like me, and entirely too afraid to actually participate in extreme sports like base jumping, this will confirm your belief that you're really not cut out for it. You will be perfectly satisfied to sit in your chair, breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth, and imagine yourself floating to the ceiling. A fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has enough silly humor to make you smile - note that you won't laugh uproariously, but I don't believe that was the point of this, anyway. Gameplay is top notch, soundtrack is fun and funny, and I will definitely enjoy any time period in which I play this game, but I seriously doubt I will get addicted to it. One of those rare gems that's worth anyone's time, even iff you just have a few minutes to kill. I, personally, enjoy games that don't require a huge time investment in order to understand what they're about and have fun with them, and this is definitely the type where your boredom will die for a bit. Plus, after you play for an hour or so you'll exit and still feel like you're playing it. Neat. 8/10.(Small edit: I mean it's not very addictive. I meant to say that it was fun, but I don't see myself getting addicted to it. Fixed.)			"

												Its a skydiving score attack game. Rack up points by scraping by building by the skin of your teeth. The game gets repetitive quickly as most levels are similar, and you will have to replay levels many times to get a perfect score to unlock more levels. The game ends up being a one-trick pony.			"

												A lot of people seem to like this. I have no idea why. It a freefalling game where you have to do 'stunts' to gain points really. Except, it doesn't look like a freefalling game. Yes, you have the feeling you're falling down, but that's it really. It's all in first person perspective so there's no actual character involved as well. The idea is cool, but its execution is kind of poor. It would've been so much cooler to have a realistic freefalling game. Like the realism of Mirror's Edge and the freefalling/parachute gameplay of Just Cause 2. But that's all just in hindsight. So all in all; it's ok. There aren't a lot of games with this sort of gameplay so I can't really recommend any better alternatives.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												""A Reckless Disregard for Gravity"" is a game based on a simple concept: jump off a high point, do some sick tricks to earn points, and land on the ground safely. Despite many positive aspects, the game is marred by several technical and aesthetic choices made by the developers.The Good:* Unique use of humor.* Excellent sound track and sound effects.* The base-jumping mechanic is a new, innovate way of playing games. It is a joy to jump from your starting point and hear the rush of the wind blow across your avatar's ears.* Flight controls are good enough to seem realistic but forgiving enough to let you make a few mistakes and have fun. * Plenty of unique ways to score points: getting close to objects, staying close to objects, giving spectators a thumbs-up or an obscene gesture, and spraypainting graffiti were all things I found within my first hour or two of play.The Bad:* For the world's first base-jumping game, the game feels remarkably NOT like base-jumping. Rather than zooming along the side of tall skyscrapers and landing on the ground, the player instead navigates an obstacle course of abstract, floating blocks that stand to ""represent"" buildings and lands on a final circular block that is meant to represent the ground. If the player overshoots ""the ground,"" he continues to fall. Yes, you can actually miss the ground. Interestingly, the levels that feature base-jumping off a mountain feature a well-modeled and detailed mountain that actually resembles something like a real mountain. (If you are going to use aestheticized shapes to represent real-world objects, why not do it consistently?)* Every aspect of the game, from the UI to the action portion, looks and feels like a first-generation iPhone game. From the big, finger-friendly buttons conveniently placed on opposite corners of the screen, to the simplistic level design, to the generic graphics.* The simple level design gives the game a very low difficulty level. I understand the point of the game is to score points and not just to reach the bottom of the map, but I wish there were a few more levels where it would be a challenge to reach the landing pad.* Although there are several dozen levels (80), the variety of them is lacking. Each level is essentially the same as the last; none of them seem more or less fun than any others.* No backgrounds in any level. Every level has a simple color gradient for a background. How about at least a simple sky wallpaper?The Ugly:* The game has a horrible name. There is no way I am going to talk to my friends and be able to mention this game by name, which hurts word-of-mouth recommendations. It's as if the developers chose this name because they wanted to come first alphabetically, and then later released  ""1...2...3... Kick It"" when they realized that numbers precede letters in Steam's alphabetizing system.Verdict:Watch a few videos of the game online. Wou will have more fun watching other people play the game than doing it yourself.			"

												Very quicly loses its appeal. Nothing stands out in terms of gameplay, sound, graphics or replayability. Gameplay is even fickle at times, it's tough to say what will cause you to lose the level or what you will ""bounce"" off of. Played for as long as I did to try and unlock all the levels, but I had a really hard time trying to force myself to play. Not willing to go back to previous levels to get more in-game currency to unlock variations of the same mechanics copy and pasted across a wall of cubes. Not even sure if the game is ""beatable"", I'll be placing this title in the ""abandonware"" category of my library.			"

												A freestyle falling game where you're trying to score points by getting close to (but not running into) buildings. There's some interesting hidden things in some of the levels that you can try to collect, and the speed and difficulty increases as you unlock more levels. It's sort of mindless and you can zone out while playing. I wouldn't call it a stellar game, but if you have a few minutes to waste then this can work well enough.			"

												If your the type of person who would jump off a cliff if someone asked you to, this might be the game for you.The game is all about base jumping on a acid city replica of Boston, Massachusetts, some natural mountain landscapes and even places which look like they have been ripped out of the movie '5th element'.The object is simple 'don't become a flattened pancake'. The other objective is to get a 5 star high score so you can earn 'teeth' the in-game currency (that's what we going to use when we run out of paper?) which you can spend to unlock more levels. Each level you complete you get treated to some funny news announcements or instructional videos. One video teaches you the do's and don'ts of accidental time travel, another video teaches you grandma's secret ingredient in her choc chip cookies being human remains and the list goes on. Most of these are either novel or groan out loud weakly executed attempts of humor.There are a number of ways to build up your score. The main one is to kiss a building (get so close you can plant your smackers on it) and to hug them (free fall down at a constant close distance), but you can also do other things such as give a two fingered salute to red spectators (Mr Bean is Professional at that) and a thumbs up to blue ones, you can also graffiti tag certain buildings on your way down, smash into a bird, hit various glass colored plates for money, or perform the very tricky thread a needle move.Most of the time you will struggle to do any of this as you will be too busy in a g spin of certain death since the controls are ridiculously hard to master. Hit a building and you become a human pinball against concrete flippers. I dare you to smoke a joint and try this with rift. You will be vomiting up your lungs as your characters nasal passage begins to smell the back of his brain thanks to the constant concrete jungle your treated to.With all these things going on and it's unique game style you would think that this would be thumbs up material. It ISN'T. The game gets tedious and laborious fast. It gets too difficult too quickly, you might get 5 stars on two of the levels if your lucky. While it is possible to get 5 stars on the other levels, still you will soon discover that you will need to spend this life time, and your next reincarnated life time, or your next eternal life on a paradise earth, or your next life time being burnt alive forever and ever, but look on the bright side least you don't have to get five stars on this anymore.The other reason it's thumbs down is because there is another version on Steam which is exactly the same, but contains more content with more 'polished' controls since it uses a different game engine. The other game is called 'AaAaAAAA!!! - for the awesome'. So if your interested ""Go! .... Go Jump off a cliff!.... What are you waiting for??? .... JUMP!!!!""			"

												Not bad. Fun for some mindless time filler.Also, pretty amusing and clever level names and descriptions.In short:You fall off buildings and--on the way down--try to score as many points as possible.You get points many ways...the main ways being ""hugging"" buildings (AKA flying close to them), ""kissing"" objects (AKA, touching a building), and landing within the outlined circle.Not hard to learn, but a little tricky to master. Fun to play when you're waiting for that burger to finish cooking and don't have time to open a ""big"" game.			"

												I dislike Dejobaan games, very much. They feel cheap and ill-maintained, as well as little consideration to practical functionality. On the other hand, that can all be overlooked with this one. Sure, the menu system is terrible, sure it takes too much effort to organize - but what a fun little game!The objective is basically to hug buildings, survive and land well; in that order. Hugging buildings is very fun - it can get tricky at times but that's the challenge really. The levels are a little short and I haven't unlocked the bigger, harder (?) ones - but for now i'm satisfied. Surviving is however easy to make it for yourself; those high points only come from kissing/hugging buildings (their terminology, I promise you). It takes some practice and a few quick-thinking moments but you can rack up those numbers. There's even 'bonus' things to smash.Lastly is landing safely; relatively easy to get it into the landing area.In summary - a great little mini-game, lazy developers.			"

												Having played through most of this game, I can safely say that I didn't enjoy a single minute of it.The idea of base jumping through futuristic, laser-skyway cities has some definite appeal, but when it amounts to simply traversing around elongated blocks at a steady pace with some retro acid-trip inspired background trying to compete for eye focus, the product leaves you wanting.The humor is 'LOL so randum XD' and the devs shamelessly plugged themselves into a number of levels. The game is basically built around high scores, in the same vein as classic arcade games. But when the leaderboards are dominated by hackers (a million points in the tutorial level? Please) with no moderation in sight, that takes out the possibility of an ePeen simulator.One positive about this game is the level design. Some of the courses are really cunning, and I like game designers that twist and bend the rules of their own game to make a variety of new experiences.			"

												This is the greatest game I've played since Super Mario Bros. 2. It features a foul-mouthed degenerate who enjoys jumping off buildings and landing on the hard pavement below. The game features some of the best voice-acting I've heard in a video game, but what really stands boner out is the games ability to give you a massive gamenema. I enjoyed this game because it is a good suicide emulator for people who like to jump off high places and flip off walls. Game gets a 8/10 for having large amounts of falling and that's about all. Also, there is a level where you have to catch falling babies before they hit the pavement, but it's impossible because they have rockets attached to them pointing to the ground below.I got kicked in the groin alot by the big dinosaurs and uniformed japanese officers. This game has everything, even a game inside it, it's a game within' a game, kinda like Pokemon Puzzle League. To quote a great man ""Game is good game""Get it.			"

												My Rating: 3 out of 4Replayability:	YESAchievements: 7Multiplayer: NoWhat is this game about?	This is a base jumping simulator where players earn points for performing tricks across eighty unique levels. There are seven achievements with their own varying difficulty to attain. The only involvement with other players is the leaderboard. Storyline is told through in the level selection by the stoner radio host. In the level selection there are options you can choose that either tell you facts or show acid-trip cinematics with odd stories.Is it fun?	Yes, the game will keep you busy for hours, but doing the same tricks on various layouts of levels will get old. "

												There is something unholy fun about diving through crazy floating cities, smashing through glass plates, and flipping off the haters. It's just... amazing when you dive through a gap, swing way off to the side, then back to bank some points, then plunge through another gap under acceleration, and pull it off flawlessly. Try it sometime.			"

												I know this Dejobaan game came before Drunken Robot Pornography, but I played DRP first, and amazingly, that game was actually easy compared to this one. Despite the fact that this game is frustrating as hell, it is still amazing. Graphically, right from the first spit second of the menu screen, this game is a thrill to play. Unlike DRP, this game says exactly what it entails, and that is the sound you'd be making if you were the protagonist in this game. You jump off a building, you scale buildings for points, you meet score quotas to earn stars which, in turn, earn you teeth which you use to unlock new levels. Again, like DRP, Dejobaan proves that you don't have to be complicated to be an amazing game. Just pair stunning visuals with great music and COUNTLESS levels. I've been playing this for a hours and i still haven't unlocked them all. And for a game where all you do is fall, that's pretty damn good.			"

The fact that this game puts you in the shoes of a free faller is great, and this is by far one of the most classic and memorable indie type games ever!			"

												AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is an average game built on a fairly unique concept of doing tricks while falling off fantasy suspended structures.  While the game does feature a wide variety of playmaps and modes, and the unlocking and teeth currency system are welcome, the game has some pretty noticeable flaws.  First and foremost is the lack of controller support, which given the twitch nature of the gameplay seems like a must.  Secondly, the game does not feature any interesting music and the sound effects particularly for the parachute are quite poor.  I had fun with this title for a few minutes, but the tedium grows as these flaws repeat over each game session.  I would recommend this game only to action fans who want a novel concept but caution others to stay away.			"

You fall and get as close to buildings as you can, hit scoring plates, sprayaint buildings, wave to spectators, insert mechanic etc. All that and the developer's strange sense of humour all builds to something which is pretty engaging if a little repetitive.

												This is a delightfully absurd game. When I really get in the groove it is great to zoom past buildings getting close without hitting them. The game revels in its own strange world. If you don't already own this, I suggest getting AaAaAA for the Awesome, which contains this game, more levels and VR support.			"

												Achievement progress at time of writing: 5/7 (71%)This is more like a puzzle game, with stages in which you need to base jump, get close to structures, perform actions, and land within a target. It's pretty simple mechanically, though it wasn't very engaging. There is almost zero story, just something about it being the new sport of the future.What you see in the trailer is pretty much the game. I personally did not enjoy it all that much.			"

												This recommendation is especially for those who frequent /r/trees.  As someone who has sky dived and has no fear of heights I can honestly say that this game does a fantastic job of replicating the feeling of falling.  You can almost feel the wind or your cheeks and a sensation of breakneck speeds are guaranteed.  Fall for this game, I did!			"

												It's about time I summarize this one.Had it for awhile now. Bought it a couple years back.A friend had gotten it first, and I tried it out.It's pretty great if you're under the influence of anything. Also good at over stimulating yourself. The achievements aren't really tough, but take real long to get.Good for a distraction, I liked the soundtrack, as well as the bogus jokes.For it's price it's got a lot of replay time.It's a stellar cliff-jumping experience, if you're not into the real thing.

												I bought this game a long time ago but never reviewed it. My problem with this game was that you couldnt look where you were supposed to go without speeding up. And controlling your speed was critical. .....So the game is simple; jump off of a building, avoid obstacles, direct yourself though bonus areas for points, or just follow the fastest route. .....Unfortunately, looking in a given direction moves you in that direction. So you have no control over your body, just your head. So if you look straight down, so you can see where you're going, you accelerate down. Faster and faster until you can't change direction fast enough to survive. Looking up or to the side slows you down, but then you can't see where you're going......On the other hand; while you can't control your body, it can kill you. For example, you are directed to skirt certain objects for bonus points, but if you got too close, your body would hit them and you died. The margin for error was tiny, and extremely frustrating. .....I have this game listed under those games that should have been fun, but weren't.			"

												There is not much to say about the game. It's a well-meaning little arcade experience. The mechanics are simplistic, the graphics likewise and the sound design is passable. I would normally pass off such a game as mediocre, and yet somehow it all comes together in an engaging and compelling manner. It's not the sort of game you'd spend hours upon hours playing, but it's a nice diversion from time to time.			"

												A dropping/dodge buildings game. As you fall you must move out of the way of the buildings while collecting various items. Not much to this game but is extremely difficult due to the amount of effort required to move. Taking cures from gravity and such, pushing in one direction will slowly move you that way. The longer you push the faster you will move and the longer it takes to stop or change directions. Game mechanics work well if you know that you just cannot move around like other dodge games. Other than that, there is nothing more to this game.			"

												If you've ever wanted to base jump off a huge building than this again for you. It puts creativity to falling from the sky. The graphics alright. The music is really unique. It just has a charm that keeps you coming back for more. While falling you can give gestures to onlooking fans or give the bird to onlooking protesters. You can spray paint buildings on your way down. It's a very enjoyable game to relax to. The levels are very unique in style. There is much humor in this game and if you enjoy these type games then you won't regret buying it. A must-have for any wannabe skydiver!			"

												I dislike Dejobaan games, very much. They feel cheap and ill-maintained, as well as little consideration to practical functionality. On the other hand, that can all be overlooked with this one. Sure, the menu system is terrible, sure it takes too much effort to organize - but what a fun little game!The objective is basically to hug buildings, survive and land well; in that order. Hugging buildings is very fun - it can get tricky at times but that's the challenge really. The levels are a little short and I haven't unlocked the bigger, harder (?) ones - but for now i'm satisfied. Surviving is however easy to make it for yourself; those high points only come from kissing/hugging buildings (their terminology, I promise you). It takes some practice and a few quick-thinking moments but you can rack up those numbers. There's even 'bonus' things to smash.Lastly is landing safely; relatively easy to get it into the landing area.In summary - a great little mini-game, lazy developers.			"

												Dream Entry 235 It came back. I thought I was rid of it but it dragged me back like some horror movie monster. Once again I was falling. I was hugging and kissing buildings. I was rude to random people I didn't even know. Worst yet, I think I killed a bird. That feeling of dread when your body is plunging towards the earth, that rush of pulling the rip cord and letting your feet touch the ground. I hate it. It is too loud, too disjointed, just too much. Why where there people there watching me fall like it was some kind of spectator sport?If there is a merciful God out there, he will end these nightmares of sky and wind. He will stop torturing me with the pain of the bright lights and sounds. He will end the pointing and laughing of these perverse strangers and not make me the death of that poor bird.

												I know this Dejobaan game came before Drunken Robot Pornography, but I played DRP first, and amazingly, that game was actually easy compared to this one. Despite the fact that this game is frustrating as hell, it is still amazing. Graphically, right from the first spit second of the menu screen, this game is a thrill to play. Unlike DRP, this game says exactly what it entails, and that is the sound you'd be making if you were the protagonist in this game. You jump off a building, you scale buildings for points, you meet score quotas to earn stars which, in turn, earn you teeth which you use to unlock new levels. Again, like DRP, Dejobaan proves that you don't have to be complicated to be an amazing game. Just pair stunning visuals with great music and COUNTLESS levels. I've been playing this for a hours and i still haven't unlocked them all. And for a game where all you do is fall, that's pretty damn good.			"

												It has an awesome name.  What more do you need?This is a game for people who are obsessed with maximizing their score and topping the leaderboards, or at least topping yourself.  The game is entirely about navigating an artistic representation of an impossible city as you jump from the tallest building and weave your way through the concrete maze to land safely at the bottom.  On your way down, you'll collect bonuses for staying close to buildings as they whizz by and smashing through targets.  That's about it.  As you unlock more levels, the challenges get tougher, but this is a pretty fun distraction if you've got a few minutes to spare.			"

												This game is good for people that really enjoy the indie game genre. When you look at the title ""AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity"" they aren't kidding. This game has an amazing techno - trance/rave soundtrack that always keeps you on the tips of your toes. The fact that this game puts you in the shoes of a free faller is great, and this is by far one of the most classic and memorable indie type games ever!			"

This is a base jumping simulator where players earn points for performing tricks across eighty unique levels. There are seven achievements with their own varying difficulty to attain. The only involvement with other players is the leaderboard. Storyline is told through in the level selection by the stoner radio host. In the level selection there are options you can choose that either tell you facts or show acid-trip cinematics with odd stories.Is it fun?	Yes, the game will keep you busy for hours, but doing the same tricks on various layouts of levels will get old. "

												Game aims to recapture extreme skydiving. It fails. Game gets the silly idea that skydiving would be more interesting with floating buildings... it just makes the game seem less immersive. The graphics heavily distract from the game, and don't add to it at all. They tried too hard to look hip, anot not enough time trying to be good. Game would have been significantly better if instead of going through the tricky level design, if they had just grabbed some 3d data of the world and made base jumping in famous locations. I can see their reason for their ""floating cities"" (to make their base jumping take longer) but if they're going to try that, they should at least make their floating cities look like floating cities above distant ground and not shipping containers being thrown at you by a wall of neon lava.I'm not normally one to complain about graphics (look at my other reviews if you don't believe me) but the graphics and level layout in this make the game horrible.

YouTube™ Video: AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity PC Steam Review 

			Views: 649		

			If you rolled the skydiving game from Pilotwings in LSD and sent it hurtling into the future, you'd surely end up with something similar to A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.		

If you rolled the skydiving game from Pilotwings in LSD and sent it hurtling into the future, you’d surely end up with something similar to A Reckless Disregard for Gravity. The game is set in a psychedelic, alternate-reality version of Boston, Massachusetts in which buildings are nonsensically scattered throughout 3D space. This convoluted landscape provides the perfect playground for base jumpers with a reckless… you know. You play as one such base jumper from a first person perspective. Each level sees you taking a leap of faith from the tallest building, navigating your way through an architectural maze, then gracefully landing on a platform at then end. On your way down you rack up points by maneuvering dangerously close to obstacles and smashing through glass panels. As you progress you’ll unlock other abilities such as flipping off protesters and giving your fans a thumbs up. Snaking your way through a deadly obstacle course while chaining together the appropriate gestures is incredibly satisfying. It takes some time to get used to the controls, but the payoff is worth it. I would have liked to have seen joystick support, and the menu system could use some serious work, but otherwise A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a clever game with a fun sense of humor that will leave you itching for one more jump.

												Dream Entry 235 It came back. I thought I was rid of it but it dragged me back like some horror movie monster. Once again I was falling. I was hugging and kissing buildings. I was rude to random people I didn't even know. Worst yet, I think I killed a bird. That feeling of dread when your body is plunging towards the earth, that rush of pulling the rip cord and letting your feet touch the ground. I hate it. It is too loud, too disjointed, just too much. Why where there people there watching me fall like it was some kind of spectator sport?If there is a merciful God out there, he will end these nightmares of sky and wind. He will stop torturing me with the pain of the bright lights and sounds. He will end the pointing and laughing of these perverse strangers and not make me the death of that poor bird. But I know he won't. That sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. "

												This is the greatest game I've played since Super Mario Bros. 2. It features a foul-mouthed degenerate who enjoys jumping off buildings and landing on the hard pavement below. The game features some of the best voice-acting I've heard in a video game, but what really stands boner out is the games ability to give you a massive gamenema. I enjoyed this game because it is a good suicide emulator for people who like to jump off high places and flip off walls. Game gets a 8/10 for having large amounts of falling and that's about all. Also, there is a level where you have to catch falling babies before they hit the pavement, but it's impossible because they have rockets attached to them pointing to the ground below.I got kicked in the groin alot by the big dinosaurs and uniformed japanese officers. This game has everything, even a game inside it, it's a game within' a game, kinda like Pokemon Puzzle League. To quote a great man ""Game is good game""Get it.			"

There's no in-between when it comes to simplicity, really.That being said, if you ARE interested in a base jumping game like this, get AaAAaaaaa - For the Awesome. But get it during a Steam sale. It's apparently just like this game, but more recent, nicer looking, and has more levels to play. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought this one. But it was less than 2 dollars when I got it, so I don't feel much of a loss.Now if you'll excuse me, I've got five star scores to go and get now. >8(			"

Also, there is a level where you have to catch falling babies before they hit the pavement, but it's impossible because they have rockets attached to them pointing to the ground below.I got kicked in the groin alot by the big dinosaurs and uniformed japanese officers. This game has everything, even a game inside it, it's a game within' a game, kinda like Pokemon Puzzle League. To quote a great man ""Game is good game""Get it.			"

												A huge digital adrenaline rush running on the sheer frictional energy generated from having its tongue planted firmly in its own cheek. A great premise, giggle-inducing writing, hypnotic visuals and some pretty great music adds up to a really awesome experience. A definite must-play for fans of arcade gaming, skydiving, and the sound that the human body generates when it collides with a building at terminal velocity.			"

Quote:A simple concept executed brilliantly.Discovery:Helps you to think and react fast. Exercises the mind, pushing the limits of your memory.Intro:It’s so simple that it hurts not to play this game. Good/Bad:You fall, you get points, and you land. Rinse and repeat. I feel as if the game has made me enjoy falling in my dreams. It’s literally a falling + parachuting simulator that’s all about racking up the points during your finite fall and ending it with a stylish landing! Summary:Falling has never been this fun! I enjoyed every drop. Every. Single. Meter. Every. Single. Inch. Had. Been. Truly. Entertaining.Worth: Unless you have a fear of heights, this game is a must buy, especially for skydiving enthusiasts!Last Thoughts: You will fall in-love with this game.			"

												There isn't anything in this game to hold your attention for an acceptable amount of time. It's fun for a brief few moments, but you'll just be doing the same thing over and over again. It's one of those games which doesn't really grasp the concept that fun isn't enough to support an entire game. Its entire draw is that the core gameplay is fun, but everything else is utterly lacking. There's no story and nothing to hope for as you progress through the game. You won't find yourself wondering if new game mechanics will be added. You won't find yourself wondering if a new upgrade will change how you play the game. You start the game, and then you have the option to keep playing forever. If you're a REALLY big fan of the engine and place no value in your time, then you might get more enjoyment out of this game than me. But it's 10 dollars! Don't spend that much money on a game like this! I can personally recommend a dozen flash games that will give you a more rewarding experience. Especially considering that they released a better version of this game which COSTS THE SAME AMOUNT!!They're trying to fleece you. That's the best way to describe this. You're given a little bit of fun at ten times the price it should be. The product that you're given isn't meant to stand the test of time at all. It's only meant to be good enough to keep you from complaining.			"

												A dropping/dodge buildings game. As you fall you must move out of the way of the buildings while collecting various items. Not much to this game but is extremely difficult due to the amount of effort required to move. Taking cures from gravity and such, pushing in one direction will slowly move you that way. The longer you push the faster you will move and the longer it takes to stop or change directions. Game mechanics work well if you know that you just cannot move around like other dodge games. Other than that, there is nothing more to this game.			"

												I like this indie game, real trippy, amusing and requires some skill. Beware of seizures. :)			"

												An odd game that is equal parts adrenaline and frustration. It's a nice little break from the ordinary, but it's not something I can play for hours and hours.			"

												Game has a charming kitch to it. Still looks good, thanks to the 90s grung styling.			"

												A fun falling simulator, AaAaAA offers many different falls as you try to hug and kiss every surface before landing in the designated spot. A good grab if you are into those kinds of games.			"

												This quirky and ""meemish"" experience, AAAAAAAAAAA is one of the most original indie games I have ever played. This unique take on the classic platforming genre will have you hooked from your first jump. (Don't forget to stroke your lucky mouse ;) )   "

												The title's long and it looks wierd (or cheap—so much Impact), but I've had a lot of fun falling past buildings, flipping off observers, smashing through glass plates, and stitching between air-car traffic in ""AaAaAA!!!"" This game puts me on the edge of my seat often, leaning in sympathy with my free-falling player character.Cheap thrills—in a positive sense.			"

												Freefalling through point boards and hugging the sides of buildings is pretty damn fun. The real winner though is the game's sense of humor.			"

												While simplistic I find that this game is increadbly fun. The continus movement combined with controls to deface buildings and gesture to NPCs provides a satisfying reward loop.			"

												Good game to waste a bit of time. Didn't engage me for too long, though. I probably wouldn't pick up any of the extra levels. It is worth the money if you get it on sale.			"

												I bought this game 7 years ago when it first came out; and I think it is pretty telling that in that time I have not even touched it once after the first few hours.			"

												Played for one hour to get 22600 points in the 'Mash Face Against Mountain' level. Interesting concept, might play it again some day. It takes a while to figure out the controls and mechanics. The graphics aren't that excellent but they do their job.			"

												The game is fun and unique. It's not super fulfilling and most of the stages are basically the same thing. That being said you'll probably play it for a couple of hours at least, if not more. The game is always on sale so don't pay more than 2.49 for it.			"

												You know how taboo♥♥♥♥♥♥always seems more appealing? Forbidden fruit and all of that, but after you've done it you're all meh. Well after this quick, but mildly entertaining game I probably won't feel too excited to commit suicide by jumping from a building when the zombie apocalypse hits. I also probably won't want to play this again either.			"
