								Someone mashed together tower defense and shoot 'em ups. It's hard not to like. Despite the chaotic appearance, it's intuitive and immediately fun.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is incredible! I played it with the developers during an Extra Life charity stream. I loved it so much and had such a blast with them and my friends that there was no way I could pass this game up. It's a ton of fun and I greatly look forward to playing it more now that it's released. One BILLION stars!			"

Early Access Review
								Awesome game that has alot of great potential if taken in a good direction. I think this game is rly good at its core and how it is currently. Although it`s only in Early Acces it has alot of content in my opinion but the only thing that buzzkills is the fact that you can only play with people in your region. Fe. if i lived in Europe and wanted to play with a friend from overseas like Australia or America then it would be impossible. Other than the fact that its regionlocked a game id rate 9.5/10 for Early Acces			"

								There's a Necrocorgi in this game! Nuff said... If you love tower defense, shoot em ups and rpgs then you'll love this game! It has so much character and originality, you can really tell that the developers put alot of heart into Necroball! I look forward to following this through early access and watching Necroball evolve!			"
