												1. Click the Drop Down Menu Under Fight and Choose Skirmish.2. Then Click the Heads Icon Near it and choose 2 vs 2.3. That way you'll find and join 4 player games and not be stuck in a 16 player que waiting forever!4. THUMBS UP this Post so New Players can see!Also Game needs improvements ofc but I had a lot of Laughs and Fun.Pretty Hilarious beating on a guy when he's down on the ground or Knocking someone out with a Cardboard Box!

								""Hooligan Fighters is an online multiplayer game that in our opinion will live for years so""I don't think so, Tim.8 people playing on launch day. Game is terribad. You get to pick from three attacks. It plays like some kind of weird flash game, complete with terrible music, graphics and gameplay.Thanks to Steam for the refund system, otherwise I'd be stuck with this one forever.			"

												I really like the idea behind this game since i'm a martial arts fanatic, but the gameplay is awful. I hoped for a refined battle system with actual moves to execute, but... there are no moves, just combo, and ultimately this one is a button mashing game. It gets boring after a couple of matches.  Not recommended.			"

												Nah.P2W drinks which replenish most of health, 100% stun on next hit, Double damage for a short time... all behind 5000 in-game cash, which you do like 300x match... or obviously buy with real cash.Just no.(moreover that combat feels sluggish at best)			"

												So, this project started out as a 3D version of the successful game ""Hooligansgame"" made by a Polish company in Łódź, who were also known to release ""Ultras Online"" back in the day. The developers of THIS game wanted to piggyback off their success but became a sad attempt after all, starting out under the name of ""Hooligan fighters"", later ""Hooligan Warriors"" naturally the people expected the developers to add actual club insignia and perhaps an overworld. When the developers realized it was too much work, they gave up on the concept, made it a generic fighting game and renamed it ""Street Warriors online"", which already in itself tells you how much they care about their fanbased compared to how much they only care about a quick buck.While they did put some effort in motion tracking to make the fighting moves realistic and while the maps are beautifully designed I really, really urge you not to play this game due to the developer's crappy mentality that only goes after money, unwilling to listen to any feedback the users give them. Believe me, I gave them a shot, I tried to make them listen but to no avail. The fighting in itself is really generic, stale and requires no skills at all. And instead of doing something about it, the developers, yet again, fail to listen to constructive criticism and instead make a salty post on Facebook simply calling everyone a hater and begging people for thumbs up.

												It's a simple left and right click beat them up.A few added weapons lying about, a special attack when your meter is full.I enjoyed myself so I will give it a thumbs up. (Easily pleased)Shame about the lack of players.			"

												This game is what happens when you try to make an online fighting game but forget to make it goodPROS+Always lots of people to play with+Decent amount of fighter cusomizationCONS-Combat is very basic and has very little strategy-Melee weapon attacks can be spammed and take away most of your health-Secondary currency-Pay to win-Frequent game breaking glitches-Fighter will often face the wrong way when you attempt to blockDont waste your time with this game. It may be improved in the future but for now, avoid it.OVERALL: 4/10			"
