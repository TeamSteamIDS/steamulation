												If you've played Trials then you know what to expect, but it's really more like a modern Excitebike. Looks good and plays good, give it a shot.			"

												Not my favorite genre, but still i love this game. My last motogame was like gravity defied on old mobile phone, and like on old days this game is all about ""easy to learn - hard to master"". Pure fun also included, try this out.			"

I recommend this game to every person who loves dirt bikes and loves games filled with energetic racing! I very well do reccomend this game!			"

												I like it. It's a trick filled Trialslike game earning nitro boost as you do tricks. Be prepared to race each track multiple times to learn the track in order beat it and unlock the next race. Nice graphics, nice sounds, good competitive AI. Pure Arcade fun! Also compete against other players scores and ghosts, not live action, but still fun trying to move up in the rankings.Worth the full $20 price in my opinion.			"

												After I started playing this game for 5 minutes, I immediatly got hooked. It was fast, fun, exciting, and it takes skill and fast reflexes to beat this game. It still has bugs and glitches, but these can be patched. Overall, I'd say buy it and definitely buy it if it's on sale.			"

												Hard to get used to at first, but when you get the hang of it it gets really cool and competitive even if playing agaisnt bots. Doing all the tricks and at the same time not falling on your head is pretty challenging! Also, but not least important, the graphics look astounding!			"

												Game looks awesome and plays great! ... except there is only one camera view from the left side of the bike ..which is just horrible and lame ... maybe will try it again if a helmet cam or at least a chase cam were added, hopefully they will update it.			"

												I figured this would be more like MX vs ATV with a first person cam and steering involved but everything except tricks and balancing is all automated, its definietely not the worst game, just not really to my taste, i guess i was seeking more nostalgia in HD			"

												think of Trials Fusion but with tricks and racing. This game actually gives you a reason to do BA tricks during races and rewards you with nitro. Very fun MX game and I would reccomend this game to anybody who loves those challenging mx games where you have to go from point to point. This game also has more than just racing! A very highly reccomended buy, definitely worth every penny!			"
