Early Access Review
								Really miss virtual sailer, which wasn't VR but was the best sailing game out there.I jumped in to have a look at VR Regatta and like the other reviews,  I know it has great potential.If this game goes MP, I'm in. Everything worked nice. A bit tiring on the steering as for a tight turn, you had to move the stick a metre but I'm sure that will all change.I got a little sea sick, but nothing I couldn't handle. Funny thing is, I stay on my boat 3 days a fortnight and never get sea sick but some VR games just get to me.Comfort rating would be a 6 out of 10. Great work. Stick with it. "

								I like sailing, and I love the idea of a VR sailing game. I mean, it could be an issue with motion sickness for some people, but it's a cool idea.This is pre-alpha though. Don't expect anything else. But I can see it could form into something pretty cool! It needs lots of work first though.Observations:-Boats have no momentum and will turn on the spot. Makes tacking weird, where you don't need to gather speed before making a tack, nor does carrying speed seem to help.-No way of knowing the direction of the wind, no gusts (dark patches on water, arrows over water, etc)-I rammed someone while on Port and didn't need to do a 360/720 (BONUS!), this is a feature.-The guy I rammed proceeded to push my boat underwater with his epic downwind power, like an asshat.-No mainsheet/jibsheet, but fair enough for simplicities sake.-Switch of hands with tiller doesnt work.-Downwind/running is like 5 times faster than upwind, should be 0.2 to 2 depending on how much of a bathtub you're sailing.-Reaching is slower than running.-Hmm, actually, change the last 2 points for no apparent wind mechanic.Regardless, I appreciate the free content, and wish you well on your development!

Early Access Review
								Having played this a week or so prerelease, I have to say this early access version has improved this experience no end, it's a really immersive sailing feeling now.With the free to play price, I can't really complain, it's quite relaxing if you ignore the race, and quite fun if you are into yacht racing, however the textures and models are pretty mismatched and it could do with a bit more content (I really want to throw in a line and fish - or have some islands to sail around in relaxation mode) if it wants to be taken seriously.At the moment it is a fine free experience, and well worth a try, but has real potential if kept updated in the future.

								As a novice in actually sailing this sim is pretty darn fun. Needs a bit of polish but I enjoy what exists at the moment.  "

Early Access Review
								VR Regatta is a fantastic experience!  Realistic water and sailing mechanics with smooth frames. This is still early development but I really like what they have for a base. The Devs are very receptive and are clearly looking to flesh this title out. I highly recommend trying this. It's a free demo right now but if they added a bit more content I could easily see this get a full release. I haven't experienced any sea sickness yet, so don't worry about your sea legs. I highly recommend standing for this game though. Feels much more captain-like. I can't wait to helm the pirate ship!			"

Early Access Review
								Nice proof of concept. It is quite relaxing.  I can\'t tell if this game makes me sea sick or vr sick.  Something about the way you are gliding over the water unsettles me.  If there were actual waves causing an up and down motion I would surely vomit within the first 2 minutes.  I would recommend this game to people who enjoy sailing because the maneuvering seems logical, I don\'t know if it is accurate because I\'ve never been in an actual sail boat, and there is definitely a strategy to this game though I have struggled to figure it out.

								Please note: At the point of writing this, this is day one of early access of this game (and it shows). The potential here is fantastic but a lot of work needs to be done.  The premise is simple. You sail a dingy. You can race or sail in a relaxing manner. The mechanics work well if not overly realistic (water is rarely that smooth). However the simplisic graphics (and whales floating above the water) let the game down. Much better visuals would do a lot for the game (especially in relaxing mode). If the game remains ""as is"" then it's great proof of concept idea. VR sailing could work well with the right styles and enviroments. If however the devs keep working on the game then you've set up some intersting foundations for what could be a very interesting VR game .  "

Early Access Review
								I so want a good sailing sim in VR.  Hoping this becomes someting good. At present it's really crude and the boat feels way to big. So the motion control movements are way to big.   Other things I just don't get (a floating whale?).  I'd rather the boat be smaller - more like a sunfish, because it feels like sailing a picnic table in a cargo box. I can't recommend it now, but it's free?  so why not try it and show some support.  Also I'm not into the purple, orange boat colors.  All shades of white would be more realistic.  And isn't the goal of a sim to be as realistic as possible.UPDATE 10-14-16.  I had given this a  ""I can't recommend review"" ABOVE...  the boat has been reduced and redone and is outstanding. we now also have a main sheet.  It's quite fun has a real sailing feel...  needs work - but I SURELY can recommend it now.Changing from thumbs down to thumbs up - KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! I think it's better than some of the other 2.99 VR titles out there. Maybe 4.99  Getting there!			"

								I don't want to click 'No' because it's free and there's no reason not to try it. It's not unpleasant. It just feels like it was thrown together in an afternoon and there's really not much at all to it. It has flying whales though, so if you're into flying whales, it's a must have.			"

								I have this tendency to kind of sway back and forth a bit unconsciously when I'm just standing in one place for a while. Doing that while in this game made me feel like I was actually on a boat in the water, which was an amazing feeling. It's free, it's relaxing, and it doesn't make you sick. Try it!			"

								Fun little sailing game which gives you a nice feeling of motion without feeling sick (at least for me). Being that its free you might as well give it a shot.			"
