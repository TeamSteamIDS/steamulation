												Played a set with a friend in the 2 player mode by swapping the headset between us.Reminded me of real minigolf, but it's so much better.For instance:-I can stand on air, it's terrifying and feels so wrong, but I can do it-When my ball flies into the pond I'm not out $10 on hole 2 because I can't putt for crap.-I can make my ball shoot out of cannonsUnfortunately it's still close enough to reality. It still takes ten putts to get it in the hole once you're right next to it because you keep hitting it just to the side of the hole.			"

												UPDATE: The new course editor is fantastic.  Creating courses is actually fun, and showcases the strength of motion controllers as tools for creation.  It also eliminates the shortage of holes.  The workshop support has been integrated throughout the game and mkaes this an easy recommend.Played a full round of 18 holes with my friend online.  Probably one of the best experiences I've had with the vive so far.Pros:  - The physics and atmosphere are great.  - Fantastic as a social multiplayer game.  - Course editor completes the gameCons:  - The physics can be wonky at times.

												Cloudlands is a game where all you really have to ask yourself is whether or not you like minigolf. The motion controls are pretty much perfect, and this is probably the closest you can get to actual minigolf without leaving your room. The courses are another matter entirely; some of them are pretty standard, like the usual 3 or 4 par traditional courses you'd see on a real mingolf course, but some of them are enormous sprawling 40+ par courses filled with ball cannons. rotating obstacles, half-pipe curves, and more that are really fun to play with a friend. It has both online and local multiplayer, with the local play involving each player playing the course and then passing the headset to the next player. It may not be the most exciting game on the Vive, but if you've got friends who are up for some minigolf you can get a pretty good time out of this.			"

												Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is a game that I bought excited about a multiplayer game that you just pass the HMD to the next person. That is not in the game yet but will be coming with a future update. I still enjoyed the game although I don’t really have the patience for it and some of the holes are frustrating. Pros:After hitting the ball you can press the trigger button and instantly warp to your balls current location. This is perfect and necessary for a game like this. Controls felt good, after a couple test swings I felt like I knew exactly how hard I need to hit it. The haptics on the controller were spot on as well. Good course design. I personally like the simple wholes like you would find at an actual minigolf place but if you are a fan of wacky and difficult this game will cater to you as well. Graphics are well done. Cons:Frustrating at times, I played hole that had a Par of 42??? It was fun for maybe the first 5 or 6 hits then it was just annoying and I was swinging like a madman trying to finish it. It may be I don’t have the patience for it, I am sure some people will love it.   No spectator mode: If you have people that are trying to watch your game on the TV/Monitor it will only show what the person playing is looking at so it ends up being really shakey and not enjoyable to watch. I am not sure how they could fix this maybe incorporate a 3rd person spectator mode.  TLDR:The game is fun don’t get me wrong. I recommend it on a sale, but personally I only like about half of the holes. The simple ones are a lot of fun but holes that are just crazy and have par 42 were not enjoyable and made me lose my patience. There is not a whole lot of content as of writing this review but I hope with future updates and free DLC more content and courses are added. I think if the Devs made the courses more like 3D Ultra Minigolf it would be fantastic, I think it would be cool to have multiplayer where you could use powerups and such it would make it an insane party game.

												Very fun to play with friends and family, although a bit annoying having to switch the headset around. Not the games fault though haha! Not sure if this is a feature by now, but I would like it if when you play multiplayer local, that one person can finish the entire map before switching to the next person. Makes it a bit less tedious when switching the headset around.			"

												I don't like mini-golf games that have massively long and complicated holes, because it's not as much fun nor as impressive an achievment to get a 41 on a par 42 (yes, this game has a par 42) as it is to get a 2 on a par 3, yet both count the same on your scorecard.That being said, this game is good enough to get my approval anyway. When the eventual additional courses and course editor come out I'll also be able to choose to play the kinds courses I prefer.			"

												Needs optimisation as it had some stuttering that i haven't had on any other vr game so far. Also actually getting the club to hit the ball requires some finesse as you can easily end up ghosting right through it. Also the physics are bugged, with the ball reliably bouncing backwards away off a gentle slope. Not the best vr game out there, needs work, but at its core it's still fun. the bugs just push it toward the edge of frustration. Still did all 18 holes. You'd be better served going to play it in real life. That said, i'm sure there'll be updates and fixes.			"

												Works nicely, it feels quite real to hit the ball. Looking down a lot, as one would in a game of mini golf when preparing the next hit, doesn't work as great as it should with my Vive (even when I pull the straps really tight), but that's not the fault of CloudLands.			"

												Short time playing it so far.  I find that the vive has a lot of trouble with making you stare at your feet, which is core to the idea of playing golf.Courses seemed fun, although many are much much longer than necessary.Physics feel pretty good, but they need to loosen up the hole a bit as it is particularly frustrating compared to the rest of the course which is moderately forgiving.The game is fun, but not well tuned to the headset and the price feels high relative to the experience.  I'd suggest the demo.			"

												Great little crazy golf game, which has some very crazy courses indeed.

												With the release of the course editor beta, this game has gone from fun to addictive. I just spent a couple of hours building courses and playing with the tools. The editor is really simple to use and powerful enough to make some very interesting courses. A few extra props would add even further to the diversity, but as it is, you can basically make any course you can imagine.Strongly recommend this game.

												Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is a great casual golf came with minor frustration. It's often hard to automatically position yourself above the ball and I found that I walked in circles quite often (which in turn tangles the vive cords).

												So far this game has given me the best bang for my buck. There are a lot of great VR games out there but Cloulands has the highest replay value thus far.The controls feel spot on, although, staring down at your feet can start to give you a bit of a neck cramp if you play this game in long sesssions. The game has an online mode but at the time of writing this it is a ghost town, so don't expect too much competition. I'm looking very forward to the course editor which should add even more replay value to this game. Bottom line is, if you're going to spend $20 on a VR game this is the way to go, a lot of games for the same price out there feel more like a proof of concept and not a complete game.Warning to any achievement completionists out there, this game has a few bugged achievements that I cannot get to unlock no matter how many times I complete the criteria.

												+ Courses look great, fun to walk through+ Controls are solid, easy to pickup and play+ Putting is acurate, ball seems a bit slow tho+ Enviornmental sounds are great (when music is off)- Music quickly becomes maddenning (you can turn it off)- Textures disapear for no reason- Grass / Leave textures look really fake in VR- Courses are unfair if your trying to get a competitive score- Course design neglates player hovering in air / standing in objectsOverall I think this is a solid putt-putt game, but it's not nearly as engaging as some of the other titles. It probably won't get nearly as much play time on my list. Maybe with more content it will get better.Edit: My intial impression was low because 1) the music put me in a bad mood and 2) I had placed a controller on my desk without turning it off, which meant the grid was up all the time and caused some textures to disappear. This is really the best putt-putt game I've played. As a golfer, this is very realistic, to the extent that I curl up my toes as the ball inches toward the hole. I only wish I could disable the texture disappear ""feature"" that is so distracting.			"

												Great atmosphere and a very enjoyable experience, especially if you play with a friend who has another vive. You can play on one vive but you'll have to switch the headset a lot. If the developer is reading this, I suggest in addition to asking the number of players, have an option to play XX amount of holes before switching, i.e. switch every 3 holes and player 1 plays holes 1-3 and then player 2 plays 1-3. Or 5 or 9 or whatever. I think this would make local multiplayer less tiresome.Create your own miniput levels, so now I can prove my 12 year old self right when I had said I'd be able to make the best miniput holes.You can play other people's creations which are up/down voted by the community and make your own custom courses with them.Par 42 hole? Yup it's there. Cannons, fans, bumpers. Different club lengths appear to have different speeds so you can choose the one you like best to get the best feel.Sometimes there are physics issues where you hit it in a way you didn't expect but these don't detract much. Graphics are beautiful and simple, very relaxing.Pro-tip: Disable the music in the settings. You will thank me.Another suggestion for the developer: Maybe have a zoom function in the editor to allow you to work with bigger pieces, unless it's there and I'm blind. Sometimes it's hard to work with when they're small. We have a minimum 2x2 meter space, let's use it!!EDIT: There is a zoom function, labelled 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x on the left side, I just didn't see it. Though it would be useful to be able to drag your entire creation, but I'm not sure how to do this. I built mine accidentally into the edge of my playspace.			"

												Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is aiming to be the Virtual Reality minigolf experience. Boasting a solid put mechanic, intuitive room-scale and click-to-teleport locomotion, this game is definitely up to par. I have not tried any user generated content yet, the official course has kept me more than happy. The gameplay feels very realistic, though getting your stroke down can be a bit trying as you don't have the weight of an actual club. This game delivers on the familiarity of minigolf while adding elements only available in a digital format- such as moving blocks, cannons, fans, and other obstacles that would be either impossible or impractical in the real world.Pros:+Great headtracking, room-scale, and click-to-teleport locomotion.+Official course is very well designed and a pleasure to play.+Feels like the real thing.+Pleasing visuals.+Putting is consistent once you get a feel for the motion range.Cons:-Local multiplayer is workable, but a hassle. Not really recommended as a party game since you're going to be constantly having to adjust the straps. God forbid someone is wearing glasses and you have to adjust the lenses too.-My localisation appears to be broken. I get random chinese characters on some menu elements and buttons. This is not a gamebreaking issue though since the menus are intuitive enough to guess and get by.-Would be nice if they could introduce a control mechanic to ghost/materialize your club. Theres been times where I've accidentally hit the ball while I'm just trying to look around.-Casual players can become frustrated at the difficulty of some holes, bringing down the mood of the group. Nobody likes failing infront of their friends. Know the people you're trying to play with.-Lack of weight in the controller makes getting a feel for putting more difficult than in real life.			"

												I purchased this almost immediately after playing the demo.I'm not a golf fan by any means, but I did sometimes play mini golf with my mom. That being said, VR mini golf just seems like one of the perfect uses of VR, so I downloaded the demo first to check it out. I was not wrong! Chaos ensued quickly, smacking the wall, knocking into stuff just outside the play space. Probably some of the most VR fun I've had yet, and most since I knocked a table over while using my Samsung Gear VR. The sort of nonsense that you can really only laugh about instead of getting frustrated!Pick a ball, pick a putter, and hit the ball! The physics are fun, the courses are fun! In this VR setting you can play on courses that in real life wouldn't work out!The cost of this is easily the cost of a game at an 18 hole mini golf course. And you don't have to put up with the summer heat! This is hands down one of my favorite purchases for my HTC Vive and I'm looking forward to seeing more from it!			"

I've had children from ages seven to ten just get entertained regardless of how well they do. They don't seem to get frustrated, and they love watching adults try to get past the really difficult courses.You can play it one handed, and aside from having to take off and put on the headset multiple times, there aren't really any gripes that I have. Then again, with people having head sizes not too far off from one another, this is an easy recommendation for those that like to show off the Vive and laugh with friends.			"

												This is one of the games I was most excited to play when I first purchased my Vive. Unfortunately, after purchasing 20 other games, this is one of the games I rarely play. The course and putter look great in the hand but the game play is difficult and repetitive. On a real mini putt, I can generally get par. On this course, I am usually 10 over par or more on each hole. Hopefully they will prepare additional courses (or a sequel) that will be a little bit more polished and play more realistically.

												This game has some bugs to work out. The scenery can't be beat, but the multiplayer is EXTREMELY frustruating with one headset. Also the really tough levels with Par 40 can be fun the first time but are not okay for multiplayer. The music is awful, just the same three notes repeated incessantly. Fortunately you can turn this off. I would suggest making the multiplayer do one player at a time for the whole course and the multiplayer course only par 5 and below. A lot of potenital but not there yet.			"

												I have played about 5 VR games so far, and this is probably my favorite.  However, it does have some bad bugs in it though that need to be fixed:- When you swing to try to hit the ball hard, the putter sometimes swings right through the ball.  Even worse, sometimes it records a stroke even though the ball didn't move.- Often you hit the ball out and instead of dropping the ball where you last hit it, it puts it at the location prior to that.- In my last game, the ball became lodged in a barrier.  I lost 5 or 6 strokes on the last hole just to get it unstuck.  What a great score I would have had. :(Also, I wish there were more courses, but please no more like hole 11.  I hate that one with a passion.			"

												Very solid game. Putting feels natural, the courses - at least the default set of 18 that I played - were a lot of fun. Has a level editor and workshop to get more holes.There are a few things that can be nitpicked, which the devs could probably easily fix. - Teleporting to your ball means teleporting directly on top of it, so you have to either move out of the way or manual teleport out of the way. - The lobby music is relatively awful after only a minute, and there's no way to turn it down, only off. - Multiplayer doesn't have you taking turns, both/all of you effectively hit your ball whenever you want. An option to take turns, at least at the beginning, would be ideal.Aside from that - well worth the price tag.			"

												Lovely VR minigolf game with a surprising variety in mechanics. It's a shame it doesn't have more of a variety in holes, once you played all the holes a few times there's not much else to do but improving.Really looking forward to future updates to see what else the developers can bring.Workshop support would be something I would love to see with support for custom holes and game modes.

												This is a fantastic VR game!  The ability to move your head and look around the course is extremely immersive.  After you hit the ball you can take a few steps to the side and watch the ball navigate the course... that is so cool.This game is like playing Mini-golf in The Witness environment, I really like the visual style.  Hitting the ball and swinging the club is extremely polished and feels great.  I love how they implemented the club in your hands.  The levels are great, I want more but I also want to replay the Full 18 dozens of times to perfect my score.  There were plenty of places where it felt like you were just taking random skillless swings but that is just like real minigolf.  And your neck will get sore staring down at the ball which is just like real minigolf!  You will even get frustrated with your shots and continually bat the ball forward just like real minigolf!There are some bugs, primarily I don't know why it shows the floor grid even after I select ""Don't show the grid"" from the options menu.  Also when you center the player on the ball it seems like sometimes it doesn't place you centered on the ball.  I haven't figured out what is happening there.  The music is also extremely repetitive.  Is the music sample only 1.5 seconds long placed on loop (""dut dun dun dunnn DUN"" is repeating in my head over and over and over)?  Maybe add an option where you can't swing unless you are standing above the actual course (versus floating off-course), this would add to the challenge associated with landing a shot near the walls.  You could implement it the way The Gallery does when you walk out of the game area.With these minor issues the game is still fantastic.  This is one of the small handful of VR games that I will come back to every day.  I highly recommend!			"

												Great minigolf game a lot of fun local multiplayer with other people. The physics feel great and the teleport mechanic is fantastic as it always puts the ball in the center of your room so you can walk around it for a perfectly lined up shot! Only issue I would have is playing the courses so much that you memorise them, but with the course creator thats coming out that shouldn't be a problem!

												Crazy Golf?  Crazy fun!  An exceptional VR experience and a lot of fun to play, especially multiplater.  The club feels very intuitive.  Hope for more courses over time, and perhaps less insane courses - the high par courses kind of breaks the competitive nature of the game because it's SO difficult.  So, more crazy courses, but keep the competitive edge.  Would be nice to see wind having an effect as well.  One to buy!			"

The first version of the Vive is not very comfortable when looking downwards, but that was not a problem for me in this game as the environment is beautiful and one can play at his pace and enjoy looking around from time to time and rest inside the game.

												Cloudlands: VR Minigolf is a must-have for Vive owners. The game is simple and intuitive, with fun visuals, and a calming atmosphere. It's a great foil for games like SPT or Brookehaven Experiment. If you want to play the Vive, but it's late, or you don't feel like amping up your blood pressure, this is a much more calming VR experience.Where the game really shines is local multiplayer. It's great having friends over and being able to all experience VR. It's a dynamic that allows everyone to experience the game, and watching others play on-screen is also fun.  Pro tip: When we play, we don't use headphones, and we only exchange a single controller (the club). It makes transitioning from player to player much easier. Finally, the real value is the level editor. It's not only easy to build levels, it's clear (from the workshop holes that are up already) that there is going to be plenty of content to keep you coming back for more.  "

												Infuriating, tricky but sometimes very satisfying... just like real minigolf!To describe it as intuitive would be an understatement - there's nothing to inuit at all. It's pretty much 1:1 with real life, with the exception of your new ability to stand inside walls (which is handy!) and teleport.I'm not a huge golf fan and I very rarely play minigolf in real life. I was really looking for a range of VR experiences to appreciate the capabilties of the Vive as a platform. That said, the random 9 holes I've played so far were really quite fun and I can see myself coming back to this for some less intense, relaxing gameplay.Specs for those interested: Asus P8Z77-V Pro, i7-3770K @3.5GHz, XFX R9 390.

												This is the best minigolf I've ever played. Forget the outside ""real"" world, I'll be here for the next few weeks. The graphic style is great, the courses are unique and most of all it's really fun! I haven't played through all the holes yet but so far most have been really great. There are a few holes that require you to turn around a lot which get's you tangled up in the cable and a bit disoriented, so the best ones for VR are the ones with more linear/straight paths. It's a great game to play after some of the more intense shooter games as a way to calm down and relax. The only downsides are that it's really easy to accidentally hit the ball when you're lining up a shot, and the music gets a bit repetitive.			"

												Note: I haven't tried the other Mini Golf game available on Steam for VR devices so I can only attest to my experience with this one. I played this with three of my friends this past weekend and had a good time with it. The local multi-player works by trading the headset off with the other players after you have completed your hole, so it doesn't require you to trade off the headset after every shot which is good because it would likely lead to a lot of fatigue and annoyance trying to put the headset on and off. Only downside to this is that you can't hit your friends golf balls when they're in your way (since the hole is finished for them) on the course which I'm sure would lead to some funny situations. The online multilayer is not available yet so I will update my review later when that is released. You can set up the course for a full 18 or a random 9. I'd recommend going for the random 9 if you have 4 people playing because it takes a long time to get through 18. We stopped after we got past the 9th hole because it was getting late (it took an hour and a half.)I haven't had the chance to check out the course editor. My biggest gripe with the game is that you can accidentally hit your ball if the club hits it as you're switching the controller over to the next player. Only advance to the next person's turn when they are fully ready. Devs: perhaps add the option to make the club semi transparent and unable to hit the ball unless you're gripping one of the grip buttons on the side of the Vive controller. It would increase the presence because you have to 'grip' the controller in real life as one would do with an actual putter. That being said, even without the online multilayer being available and without trying the course editor, I think this is worth the price especially considering a round of mini golf in your local area would likely cost a lot more just for one round if you and 3 of your friends all wanted to play (not to mention all the possible parking fees, crying babies, allergies, loud noises, falling into stagnant ponds, and alligators that you'll have to deal with.)

												It's not an awful game by any means. It's minigolf in VR, which is an inherently decent concept. However, there are a lot of flaws. The teleport mechanic is awkward, and the hole design leaves a lot to be desired. I ended up not finishing the 18 holes out of frustration with the last hole. It also turns out that staring down is about the least comfortable VR experience you can have.If you really want VR minigolf, go ahead and get it, but otherwise I think it's safe to give this a pass.

												Cloudlands VR Minigolf is a minigolf game in a very beautiful and astonishing ambience. The physics feel on point, never saw any bugs or weird moments. There are now just 18 holes, but the new update will bring 18 more and even better: an ingame-course-editor (hopefully with sharing via Workshop or what-so-ever - idk, sry). Sadly there are basically no ppl playing online but this is basically still because of the accessibility of VR. I got into one lobby once and it was awesome seing others from other parts of the world putting the ball around and swear like a small kid if they miss the whole by centimeters.Cloudlands VR Minigolf is an insane game. It looks so peaceful and friendly, but it can really be a d***. Not because of bugs or what-so-ever... just because the maps have a troll-factor in it, as you can see in my video:

												This game immerses you in a beautiful and peaceful place. There are pink trees, birds chirping and the calming effect of water flowing. In the beginning, it's a fun, relaxing and a simple game... but then it gets really, really, insanely hard. You'll start yelling at the ball, cursing it's near misses to fall into the hole, and flabbergasted at how ridiculous those last holes are. Still, it's a relief when you sink into the 18th hole.This game desperately needs a ""normal"" 18 course game for novices like myself. It would also work out great if there weren't so many steps involved in playing the same hole repeatedly for practice, or maybe an ability to reset the hole after missing par (or a hole in one) and play again.The game shows that a course editor is coming soon. I can't wait to try it out and see what other people come up with.Although I don't like the games last holes, I would still recommend this game as I enjoy coming back to play through repeatedly.

												Great game but not worth, the 19.99. I played the demo and loved it, but the only reason I bought this game is because it clearly states that it includes a level editor, but it doesn't. Steam should remove that tag until the level editor is actually implemented into the game. Its not worth it with just the 18 holes, but if a really good level editor is added, I could see myself buying this game again, because I refunded it.			"

												It's a nice Minigolf experience for the Vive for sure. There is one major part that breaks down and it's simply not acceptable.There is a mechanic that makes sure the club head always stays on the ground and shortens the shaft to make sure it happens. This falls apart completely when you swing hard though. This happens due to shortening happening 1 frame after which results in it not staying ontop of ground and going through it when swinging fast.How this could not be noticed by devs I don't know. But until this is fixed I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Played this game with my son-in-law last night for a couple hours. We had an absolute blast. The par 42 hole was a bit nuts, but we rolled with it. I can see this game getting kinda old fast, though, unless they release the new hole editor or new holes themselves. Right now there's only 18 holes and once you've played them a few times I can see the charm wearing off. I'm not there yet, but I understand the other reviews who say this.All in all a solid game with good graphics, a decent interface, and pretty good physics.

The reason this is getting negative reviews seems to be that the reviewers just aren't putting enough time into the game, it looks like most have less than 30 minutes. It deserves more than that to get a feel for it, and minigolf isn't supposed to be easy, this game is difficult. The last hole is a god damn par 42.			"

												I do not recommend this game for several reasons.  First off, some of the courses are so ridiculously hard that there is no fun in there at all.  Secondly, sometimes when you teleport to your ball, if you are holding your arm in the wrong spot, your club will hit your ball and you'll lose a stroke for no other reason than you teleported.  Thirdly, the programming is off sometimes -- I literally swung through my ball several times.  I could see the putter passing right through the ball, yet it wouldn't hit it.  Fourthly, when I want to hold onto my controller tightly since I want to swing hard, I inevitably hit the grip buttons, and this brings up the score card and invalidates my swing.  There is no way to disable the scorecard opening when clicking the grib buttons that I can see, so this is terribly annoying.  Lastly, there is no way that I can see that you can change the orientation, so I'm sometimes forced to stand facing a direction where my controller sometimes loses tracking.  There should be a simple way to change the orientation so I can stand facing a different direction.  Unfortunately the makers of the game decided not to give the player that opportunity.  For all of these reasons, I cannot recommend this game.  There is a lot of promise to VR mini-golf, but the developers have a lot of work to do it make it an enjoyable experience.			"

												Not smooth at all. If you've played fruit ninja vr, that feels so much smoother to swing in. With this, I can actually see my putter lag which is just awful to look at. Every once in a while the putter will double hit even on a smooth swing. Achievements still broken. Maybe eventually once the bugs are finally gone, I'll be able to recommend this, but not now.			"

												Nope. Close, but no cigar. Here are a few of the things I have problems with:I think the developers need to work on better helping with the timing issues, looking down to line up your shot and trying to look up to see when the windmill or whatever is in the right position does not work well with a Vive on your face.Some of the level design is nice, some of it is terrible. If you have par 42, it's not going to be fun unless you are a real masochist, leave it out. If you have to reverse your orientation 15 times on a hole, then maybe peoplle with a huge cable attached to there heads will have some issues. Needs work.			"

												This game may lure you in with all of its wacky little contraptions, but you will soon find out that it only makes the game more frustrating. I remember reaching a cores which literally had you shooting your ball out of 4 rotating cannons over and over again preying that one will sink it into the hole. The hole's par was 38 strokes which is against regulation and completely ridiculous to begin with, but my friends and I maxed out the stroke counter (which doesn't end your misory by forcing you to forfeit the game) after hitting the ball around like idiots more than 100 times!Long story short, the lack of realism and rationalism breaks emersion, which is crutial to a good VR game. For those of you looking for a wacky, deregulated mini-golf game to enjoy with your friends, you can save $14 and space in your living room by purchasing ""Golf With Friends."" "

												I originally bought this game back in April, before I got my Vive. I refunded it after minutes of playing it. The Vive wasn't designed to spend so long staring at the ground. On top of that, graphics were flickering, and at one point, the world started twisting and swaying, forcing me to pull the headset off, and gave me a headache for 2 hours.In the Summer sale, I thought I'd try it again. After all, months later, the game may have improved.Well... no. Not really. The graphical glitches are still there, with textures visible loading in, but that's not the problem.The game, for me at least, is too faulty by design. For example, after teleporting to the ball, rather than repositioning the player in a logical position, the game simply does so based on a fixed geographical angle. By this I mean if you're facing North when you hit the ball, and the direction between the resulting shot lines the ball and the hole in a south direction... when you teleport, you'll remain facing North, rather than the game predicting where you should be standing. This means that you then have to walk around the room in a tiny circle, making sure that you, physically, are now facing the correct direction.This results in the Vive, with its tethered cables, constantly twisting up. On top of this, the number of times I accidentally touched the ball with my bat while I'm turning around, and adding to my 'score'. This could easily be prevented by having the player pull the trigger or push the touch pad to retract the club, or even require it to be held when taking a shot. Of course, this wouldn't really be an issue if they just fixed the orientation.With this in mind, swapping the headset during a multiplayer game, each turn, doubled, tripled or even quadrupled the tangling issue. After our 2 minute game, my wife and I had to spend a few minutes unravelling the headset.The fixes for these 2 issues are easy and should be obvious. A path finding system would enable the game to predict where the player would want to stand, and effectively rotate the level for them, rather than them needing to rotate so much.Order of play should be based on last on, first on. This means to say whomever has the headset on at the end of the hole gets to play the first hole on the next game. This reduces (potentially halves) the number of times the headset needs to be taken off. At the moment, the game lets whomever is winning stay on. This means that a close game makes it hard to predict who is next to play.I'll not risk my headset cabled getting damaged simply because the developers can't figure out such simple solutions.At one point, we started the game, and immediately accidently touched the ball. Even though it hadn't even left the wooden start space, it counted that as a hit. We then quit the game, and tried to start again. From here, we couldnt figure out how the change the player names. As we'd done it once before, the game didn't ask us a second time. Very frustrating. I'd like to be able to choose who goes first.Another bug bear is that the menu itself is a golf game. ""Want to play? Knock the ball into this gate!"" Why slow down a menu? Just allow us to point and select. I don't want to play a game so that I can play the game!Finally, the hit detection is odd. At one point, I swang the club quite fast, and it went through the ball. It moved less than an inch, but still classed it as a stroke. Add that to the fact that there didn't appear to be any music playing, and the game was more hassle than fun.			"

												2/6 update: So, the devs did fix the two-controller/one-controller issue I complained about in #2. #1 remains an issue, but I think it's down to Vive tracking precision. For example, on the first hole in the game when you play the 18 pre-built map holes, if I try to hit a hole in 1, it will often shoot off at an angle, but it's the same angle every time (either, say, 8 degrees above or below the hole. Always the exact same angle if it isn't dead on.) If I just randomly swing with one arm, not even bothering to aim, I hit a hole in one quite frequently. This could be jitter in my lighthouses, my own body, or God knows what else, but it's there and it *can* be irritating.If you really love minigolf, this will be a fun place to pop in, play a game or two, and pop out. The harder courses (like the par 74 hole, or the par 16 one) can get SUPER frustrating really quickly though, so my complaint that it can be a frustration simulator is still valid. Pick your maps carefully.Most of all, remember to keep your club head in the air when transitioning levels! That problem still remains. :/---End update---People are not kidding when they say this game is hard. I picked 'random 9', and my second course was, I ♥♥♥♥ you not, par 74. I ended up needing 88 strokes to finish it. When other people say the game is brutal they are NOT joking. This isn't inherently bad, so consider this a PSA.The actual bad:1. The clubface isn't straight. Or perhaps it's due to how the Vive controller is designed that you end up not hitting the ball straight. Either way, your shots will consistently go to the right of center unless you force yourself to compensate. There is no way to adjust the clubface angle to fix this.2. You need both controllers, but only control the putter with one. Anyone used to using a real putter will find it very strange to be accurate while holding the putter in just one hand. Or having a controller dangle while trying to put two hands on the single vive to simulate a normal putt. In truth, there's no reason they can't put everything on one controller. It would also be ok to add a two-handed putting mode, but I realize almost all users won't want that, so I also support that *not* being added.3. You have to hold your putting hand in the air when you start a new hole or else you might accidently send the ball flying when your putter spawns in on the new level -- right on top of the ball. The number of times I unintentionally hit the ball was SUPER iiritating, because I never accidentally hit the ball IRL like that. Just have the club wait for us to move into it on a new level spawn.The game does have good points though. The levels are complex and interesting -- things that could only exist in a video game. The levels themselves are visually interesting and of above average graphical quality (for July 2016 in VR). There is working multiplayer. There is a lot of potential for creative and challenging community maps. Overall, I feel kinda bad giving this a negative review, but the things I whine about really do need to get fixed before I consider this game as solid as something like The Lab or Pool Nation VR.

												Disclaimer: I puchased this from the Viveport Store. Unfortunately that edition didn't have level editor support (Devs are working on this) so they provided me with a steam key so I could get the full experience. I recieved my steam key for free but only due to their generosity.I played the demo before buying this and I'm glad I did. What looks and feels like a novelty game on the outstide is actually a really well crafted and fun experience on the inside. The tracking works (mostly), the shot power processes well and each level is for the most part individually great.The addition of a level editor is the icing on the cake. Some of the community levels are fantastic and it's really fun seeing what other people have come up with.I've not yet tried the online mode and may update my review when I have.

												This is a very well made game.  It has multiplayer, a killer create a course mode, it's dead simple to play, and the physics are tight.  If you like minigolf at all and have a VR headset, get this game.  It's easy enough where even my 4 year old can play it and challenging enough where I still enjoy it.			"

												It's minigolf without the pesky limitations of reality or the annoying couples. Just ma and some golf equipment to put around some fantasy courses and forget my crushing lonliness. There's multiplayer too, but I haven't played it because I don't have any friends. (JK, I'm fine, it's a great game, buy if you have a vive and like minigolf)			"

												I got this game as an easy to grasp vr game for first timers. Both my family and the inlaws loved it. There is a hole with a 40+ par which kind of sucks but other than that it is a great game for people to learn how to use vr. Well polished.			"

												Lots of fun. The game is pretty and the controls are fairly solid.That said the difficulty curve goes bonkers near immediately. I feel like the game should really have a few courses, where all the really hard levels go in the later courses.			"

												A great social game for getting friends playing VR. Clever movement to the ball means you don't need much space. Currently only 1 set of 18 holes. Going from very simple to par-18 and par-42 monsters. Explores a number of different challenges across the different holes. Looking forward to future DLC adding more courses.			"

												I wish they had a way to separate between the lower par, real to life holes and the long, frustrating fictitious holes.  The physics seem spot on and the game looks and feels great until I'm forced to play those higher par, impossible holes.  Hopefully they build different circuits or something.			"

												Very fun game. If you're like me and had a problem with everything going blurry when looking down, the Vive shipped with the top strap too tight. Adjusting that fixed everything and now I have no issues playing this, which is great since I love mini golf so much.The graphics are great and the scale/presence are spot-on. The course editor is intuitive and fun to use, although some of the online courses aren't so much fun (Par 83, really?)			"

												Short version: Great Minigolf game. I really love it. Would be nice if more people were playing online, but it's not impossible to find someone to play with. The editor has some bugs but is overall easy to use and works well.I have a full video review with gameplay here:

												Pretty good ball physics, which is most important, but this needs more maps. And the maps need to be CRAZY. This is vr minigolf, not actual minigolf, go crazy with the maps. Also the visuals need improvements, I mean the main wall texture is crap. Why? Why not better image effects? Unity has tons of assets to improve your game. tl;dr; enjoyable, but needs more crazy maps.			"

												A very fun casual game.  Physics feel spot on, each hole offers something different than the last, and you feel motivated to try and beat your best score again and again.  If you're looking for a relaxing game without all the frantic action of shooters and sword weilders, this is the game for you.			"

												Okay so I put off writing a review for this because I wanted to make sure I knew how to use it properly.  Best mini golf game ever.  I've played a bunch and my wife has too.  We love being able to play turn based VR mini golf.  Add to it that there is a course editor and WOW,  just WOW.  For awhile I didn't know there was an advanced controls that allows you to orient your living room in relation to the golf course.  This was very beneficial for me as I use the Rift with two sensors right now.  I don't have complete room scale yet.  This keeps my forward vector in the nice area between my two sensors.  So I don't have to step over a wire and hope the touch controllers stay in view.  Thanks a bunch to the devs,  been looking for a VR title like this.			"

												Wow. this is the first review I have written for a game and that is because this is out of the park the best oculus game out there. the controls are amazing (albiet a little hard to get used to since there is no actual weighted reaction (wouldn't mind haptic feedback)) the graphics are stellar and the editor is the most amazing thing I have ever played with. 10/10 but if you added in controller feedback when you hit a ball that would be the best thing ever!
