MY DBC 17 PC Impressions and ReviewIf your a cricket fan not just cricket gamer this game is a must get, why simply because any cricket scenario under the sun/floodlight  in any era, any place, you will be able to recreate and live it in this game. Want to play in bodyline series you can, want to play pinkball underlights you can, want to play woman cricket which still has the soul and vigour of past era you can. Want to do a Bloackathon on the last day of the test you can, want to Cover drive and break the off side like ganguly or lara you can, or coax that annoying tail end batsman to edge one with the second new ball or edge one from the rough with the old one You can.This is not just a game but a cricket sandbox. TLDR; Cricket fan, Its a definite buy!!!Graphics: 	            The game looks fantastic to simply put, the players look more detailed and real, the lighting in an ODI as the sun goes down and flood lights come on is wonderful. With vintage filters on the game looks a beaut to play withm you can recreat that eras appearance and feel. Animations are more fluid.At max detail in FHD the game looks really pretty.  The grass looks fantastic both on pitch and on outfield. And once you get the community created real teams and stadiums, the game really takes on to next level in cricket simulation.Gameplay:	Batting	: Simply there is not a place on the ground you cant  put the ball through. The batting has greatly improved from previous version with better physics and feel to the shot, plus is more challenging and engaging due to tougher AI bowling. All the drives are a delight to play, just judging and picking that right ball and timeing it to put it away, feels sublime. Improvements From 14 to batting:1.Better physics. feel and stroke variation. straight drives, cover drives are a joy to play.2.Custom batting difficulty, plus you can have indicators appearing slightly before bowler bowls, which helps solve premediation problem folks with slow reflex had with last game3.PRO Cam is stable now and you can play with a still head and feel the ball rushing past you. 4. Precise button for batting really improves in being able to have that checked shot through the gaps, or that little chip shot for four like ponting. 5.Pitch variation is very effective now, and you have to adapt to the conditions more.Pardon the video Quality, my recorder and encoder setings werent good.

			DBC 17 PC batting vid: [Diff medium, IND vs ENG t20] [ pardon for the video quality, think i messed up on the encoder settings, the actual game looks crisp] Had this amazing chase in a IND vs ENG...		

Bowling: 	 This is the area that has improved leaps and bounds from the last game, the new controls are intutive and give a great degree of variations to deliveries. As spin bowler its a delight to be able to control flight, bounce to a delivery along with varyign length and speed and you inner warne roars with delight. But what makes it also rewarding is the way AI approaches batting now so you can actually work out the AI with good deliveries and set them up. Improvments from 14 to bowling:1.Intutitve Controls, no more thumb breaking for spin :p2.varied edges 3.AI batting to edges4. pitch and ball conditon play a lot of factor in bowling.Fielding:	         This works well with the brilliant batting and bowling, the new fielder animations are fluid, the slow mo catching for quick catches actually works well with the flow of game, and i liked it more than i thought would. fielding is improved over 14, still has some little quirks here and there, especially in the way the fielder choose the end to throw the ball, could be more quick with stumpings, and run outs. sometimes they work really well and feel amazing, but there are times when they can feel ordinary.AI field sets can be too atacking at times, when they need to defensive. Its more of little quirks getting in the way.But given the Bigant's commitment to the game and the community, and how fast they improve things, im sure the little quirks will be fixed over time.Career Mode: has gotten a huge improvement from 14 you can now play club level crickter before moving upstairs, also tournaments are a part of career. You also have the option to play as a single player or as a team in career before every match, which is a joy. ACADEMY:	        This is has unbelievable improvement. The amount of customoisation is impossible to comprehend just think about thisyou can create [or grab ones created by  others] any player of any gender with any appearance, with any kit you want and play them in any stadium with any appearance you want in any type of format either official or cooked up by you.even that sentance is a disservice to the accademy. The new logo creator and stadium creator have made modding redundant no more muckign aroudn folders and files for pc players and modding for consoles directly. Right now get best works well ootb, but i would recommend putting some time and curating teams to have a better play in the longer run, i would recommend teams by Casper, Friedlele7,  Karolkarol etc.Check planet cricket community threads for more info. A lot of work has been put into this by the community.UI: the game overlay looks good, has a lot of info than 14. The Hud assists themselves are good and dont interefere with gameplay. The only area were UI is lackign is it takes more presses to get something done than in 14 like fielding changes to bring the field eidtor, batsman transparency etc. Again i have have faith in BA that these will be worked on and fixed. Audio: 	        The atmosphere is amazing in stadium, the crowd ambience, the instadium announcer all make it amazing,  the accoustics are excellent, the commenatary in itself is okish not better or bad than any other past cricket game, they do say unrelated things a bit, i personally recommend setting the SFX and crowd ambience high in audio settings and enjoy the atmosphere it creates.Support and Service: 	                      I feel this is should be a part of review of every game nowadays, almost every game  nowadays have bugs, quirks on launch, its how they are responded by the Developer that matters. In that regard Bigant are a gem, they respond quickly and immediately, they listen to each and every complaint about the game patiently from the community, interact with them directly, not through PR but the CEO and the developers directly interact frankly, collect info and improve. They do beta updates with the community take feedback and update with patches regularly, DBC 14 was a testament to this support and DBC17 now is. As one of  members privilaged to be able to access pc version of the game early and having spent a good amount of time i fully recommend the game even if you have 14 already.This game is a tribute to cricket!

												I, for the life of me, cannot understand why all the reviews are positive so far!I cannot stress enough, this game is a downgrade from Don Bradman Cricket 14!!! It would have been more appropriate for the developers to release this as an early access title considering its current state... Every single aspect of this game, aside from its lofty aspirations, is worse than its predecessor!! When my wife played this game for the first time, she stated ""It's as if they took all the parts of Don Bradman Cricket 14 that needed fixing, failed at fixing them, and then broke every other part of the game while they were at it""... I have never been so disappointed with a $65 (AUD) purchase in my whole life! A few of my favourite issues with this game are:1) The physics – one of the highlights of DBC 14 for me was the realistic way the ball came onto the bat - fast!! DBC 17 has destroyed this feeling, it feels as if the ball is more inflatable beach ball than cricket ball!! This seems partly due to the speed of both the bat and the ball, which are both far too slow to accurately represent the game of cricket... or physics in general!!2) The bowling controls are in fact less dynamic and allow for less control than DBC 14 (While requiring twice as many buttons to be pressed) - instead of controlling the length of the ball with the timing of the thumbstick movements (A great system which actually required skill to bowl the ball where you wanted to), you simply press a button to choose a length, and a modifier to move it foward or backwards a little... meaning there are 12 exact lengths that can be bowled, and no skill is required to achieve the same length delivery ball after ball... 3) While the graphics and lighting may in fact be ""improved/running on a better engine"" from the previous version, they do not look better overall - its hard to explain... everything is just too rounded and shiny looking, to the point that IMO, DBC 14 looks better, as it captures depth and shadows better.4) The system for setting fields is massively overcomplicated, as is the UI experience in general!5) There are things wrong with almost every part of this game, fielding, batting, bowling, the UI, the academy... Some of it major, some of it minor, but its guaranteed to annoy the hell out of anyone who enjoys the sport of cricket!!So I will end with this suggestion:- If you are the sort of gamer that is prepared to pay a AAA price for a low-budget indie game, and say things like ""quality doesn't matter, I want to support this developer, regardless of how unfinished their games are"" and ""This game has the potential to be the greatest cricket game of all time!! Who cares if its going to take another 3 years of development to realise this dream!!"" and ""I am happy to spread lies about the quality of this game"" - This is the game for you!!!- If however, like myself, you prefer notions such as ""value for money"", ""honesty"" and ""Calling a spade a spade"", then avoid this game like the plague, as it is unfinished, sh*te, and a complete and utter downgrade from its predecessor!!!

												I bought this game almost half hour after it was released, having only played the demo till then, thinking it would be a pretty straight forward joystick cricket game. Having not played DBC 14, this one shocked me by its level of detail to A.I gameplay. I can't compare it to DBC in terms of graphics or smoothness, but its pretty obvious that it runs on higher specs and is probably why people find it stuttery. The game is challenging, dont expect to get wickets or runs when you feel like it. U can notice the gameplay difference in career mode as you ascend the ladder, even at the easiest settings one has to play smart, no re-load option mid game, if you're out, you're out, better luck next time. A.I mentality is very noticeable, by their reactions to being tired and under confident and vice versa. There's some annoyance with the manual fielding, but cmon, you always reset that to automatic. Overall I'm happy to see a cricket game that isnt just good for he fans, but a good challenging gaming experience for anyone. It took my guy 3 seasons to finally be selected from club cricket level.			"

												Do not buy this game anytime soon. Why? I'll tell youPros:- Career mode is a big improvment.- Animations are good.- Academy Cons:- Wrong Kits (White kits for ODI and T20s).- Wrong Stats (Displaying First Class, List A, T20 stats for Test, ODI & T20I respectively.- Can't get past the main loading screen.- Randomly crashes.- Have to choose the line up again and again  in career mode.- Stats for international cricket are not available in career mode.- A bug where game gets blurrier.- Umpiring errors.- Graphics are meh.- Commentary will make your ears bleed.- Game is poorly optimized and runs in borderless windowed mode. Game will stutter from time to time on my 1060 and i5 3550 with 8 gigs of RAM. - Max resolution is 1920x1080. Devs don't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ if you are having any problem. I was having an online issue in DBC 14 and I contacted the devs and this is what I was told ""We are the developer of the game, we are trying to help you out of goodwill - we have no responsibility at all to even answer you"". It's pretty much the same support for this game too. Right now I'm stuck on the main screen and can't get past it. I paid $50 for a game that I can't even play atm. TL;DR: Do not buy this game right now. Tons of bugs and some of them will make the game unplayable. It's not even worth $20. "

												I have played this game for 3 hours almost straight. I have the Xbox One version as well. There were few issues in the xbox version but let me tell with a big smile, most of them are sorted out for the PC release. This is fantastic and the game is fantastic. There are more stats that pop up like RRR, RR how many runs needed to win, projected score now while playing. This was something users demanded and let me tell you on BigAntStudios listens as a developers. Few shots were missing but now those shots are playable. I played beautiful cover,square drives. There are batsman who run quicker now, the superhuman wicket keeper and fielders have toned down. I will go out and say this is the best cricket game ever and BigAnt have supassed the Don Bradman 14 expectations and set a new bar.			"

												Great cricket game.  Many, many additions from DBC14 the big one is Gameplay modifers (sliders).. Much more customisation (bats/logos/stadiums) Already most teams/players and stadiums have already been created by very talented people on PlanetCricket forums. It's basicly a cricket sandbox game, you play it how you want to play it from players/kits/stadiums/match types/pitch conditions/gameplay sliders... With the added academy features shame to see no stump customiseation/ boundry rope ads/ball sponsers/overlays like you could with adding files like modding on DBC14 yet. I hope this could be added in futre updates.  Yes the console release of this game was (buggy) to say the least (I have the xbox1 version aswell) but the PC version at the moment is a big improvement with many fixes already applied to this PC version. The graphics are a step up from previous game. Game runs very smooth on my pc at 1440p 144hz (980ti)Bowling is very enjoyable with many differences in edges and delivery types. The bowling hud is much smaller and easier to understand. Batting is very good too. I'm just not as good at batting than bowling :) much more choice in shots i.e advance down the wicket shot now can play along the ground or go in the air. One negitive so far is the CUT shot animation is not very good in my opinion.. I can't remember seeing a cut shot played like that ever. much more precise with shots better controls for shots like precise shots (RB) and such. Commentry is abit odd/repetitive at times but so happy to see James Taylor be apart of the game.Fielding is alittle slow, able to hit and run most times in the circle even when hitting it right to the fielders, ball tracking seems alittle off aswell at times.  Few bugs here or there but BA have a very good track record of fixing things very swiftly on the PC and have committed to delivering one of the best cricket games on PC. The game will only improve with many future fixes/updates. I have every faith in them to deliver like they did for DBC14I fully reccomend this game to anyone who likes cricket, It's a very enjoyable game.			"

Its the best cricket game in the market , but thats not good enough : Like they say, its the small things that matter, and there are so many things in the game are frusterating : 1. The Timing indicator cannot be trusted AT ALL, it will show ideal for terribly timed shots all the time. There have been so many times ive 3 greens and i get caught in the inner circle. 2. Your team needs 12 runs in the last over with 6 wickets remaining, why is the AI defending n taking singles ? WHY !!!!3. Why isnt there a variety in bolwing actions . (This is forgivable , but come on... this is a must )4. If i try to  hit the ball on the off side, the default shot should be a off drive or a glance, not a BASEBALL SWING !!  I am tired of balls that go straignt to the keeper , coz the batsman tried to play a shot on the square leg, rather than mid off. 5. Ball is pitched on the leg stump line, so i try to play a glance. But then the batsman takes a step away to the offstump, and then glances, missing the ball completely . I never asked for that side step, WHY DID YOU DO THAT< WHYYYY6. I am a spinner, why cant i jump directly to spinner field presets , I dont want to go thought pace / fast bowling fields. Spinner field presets are literally at the bottom of the list . WHY cant i just skip to spinner fielding presets. 7. Why cant I save my field setup . I keep a fielder on third man. For some magical reason the game , just goes nope , and moves him away. And now I am a retard bowling on the legside, with noone to save that four. 8. During career , why  cant i practice on a practice ground. Net practice doesnt tell you , if your timing is good enough for a six or a four. You need a ground to tell you that. 9.  Personal tidbits : a.  I would like to see balls edge and go vertically up .  b. the depth persception straight down the ground, (mid on - off region ) does not feel rite .  c. In career mode, if i am not doing well, in a tournament, i should be dropped for a game or two (it will be realistic ,and i will take my game seriously). Everything good to say about the game ,is basically what was good in Don Bradman 14 . Thats why i am disappointed , coz in 3 years not much has been done in terms of gameplay improvements. Yes the graphics are updated , so is the engine. And the career mode is tweaked . But nothing that justifies 3 years of hiatus.Luckly , all the issues i have stated are just tweaks and can easlisly be patched and added. Nothing that is so game breaking , that it will require a sequel to fix. So I am hopeful , and would appretiate if any of these are aknowledged. But for now I cannot recommend this game in this state. Even though i will be spending hours playing this game.			"

												I have to say I was sceptical when I bought this game, but I am really enjoying it as soon as I started playing.For a game made by a small company it is done really well. The only bad thing about the game so far is the feelding that needs some work. Feels a bit sloppy and the animation needs work.I will recommend this game to any Cricket fans.			"

												If you come into this game expecting cricket 2K17 or EA Sports Cricket then you will be disappointed, with more games than just this one.What I have found playing so far:Positives1. Batting is challenging and fun. It requires actual timing and skill.2. Bowler AI is much improved over DBC 14 and is constantly changing it up.3. My Career mode, player creation is much improved and offers greater depth.4. Visually better than DBC 14, yes the lighting is different but is more natural. (Grass blades people, grass!)5. Pitch variation: The pitches are much more dynamic this time around. Without saying much, you should pay attention to the pitch report as different bowler types will be more effective than others.6. Getting singles is much easier and more natural this time around, fielders are effective (most of the time - club cricketers are meant to be fairly average =) )7. Ball physics are much enhanced, although there are times where it bounces more than a tennis ball lol.8. Stadium creator is neat, could be a bit more robust but heu - Stadium creator!9. Customisation is quite remarkable from logos, teams, kits etc to setting up your grade league in my career (I reccomend creating a few rural type grounds for this part of the career as the defaults are proper stadiums. I don't recall my local team playing at the MCG lol.)Cons:1. Commentary is pretty bad, and by bad I mean horrendous. Fortunatly, if you mute it, the sound effects and ambience make for quite the relaxing time.2. A few visual bugs that I have encountered: namely, stuttered animations in fielding and replays. Not a biggie as I'm sure this will be fixed later.In Summary:If you like cricket and cricket likes you then DBC 17 is a fine game. Just for the love of god don't expect a 2K or EA game. Two thumbs up.			"

												This is simply the best cricket game of all time.The niggles from DBC14 - lack of edges vs AI, pitch conditions not translating into gameplay etc. are totally fixed in this iteration: whether it's a hard or soft pitch will affect where you want your keeper/slips to stand, how you bat etc. and the condition of the pitch will make you think about an extra spinner, or going with an all seam attack.The game is full of brilliant, real cricket modes and dismissals: bang in an extra short and fast bouncer and have fine-leg catch it on the run; slip an arm ball through the gate, move one away and catch the edge to slip - it's all in there.Not to mention the depth of game modes and customisation from the academy means there is something for everyone: whatever mode, era or team you want to play with, this game lets you do it with a measure of realism unparallelled in any cricket game ever.Buy it.

												I can't recommend this game at all which is a shame because they did well with their first cricket game, Don Bradman Cricket 14. You can't set your own fields and have them stick the computer will just randomise your field placings when you exit the menuthe AI doesn't utilise bowling all rounders when bowling so teams with multiple all rounders won't be as good as they should beI've had boundaries that rolled along the ground for 4 being called as a 6you can't change your equipment colours in career mode you're stuck with the defaultthe career mode international teams all use white kits regardless of how it is set in the academy or the match type you're playingthe logo database fills up incredibly quickly so you're stuck with multiples of the same logo and can't add more to the console designed logo sharingNo rating out of 10 just a flat not recommended.

												The most obvious and game changing improvement from DBC 14 is the bowling. The ai bats more realistically and is more engaging to bowl at, and I've seen some handsome shots and some satisfying dismissals. The biggest change to batting is that you now have the option to see the delivery hud marker earlier, which is ideal for anyone who felt they were too rushed to pick a shot when batting in DBC 14.Another change is the addition of gameplay sliders, with which you can fine tune various parameters - the pace and bounce of the bowling, lateral movement, batting footwork or timing difficulty, and so on. I haven't explored all the possibilities yet, but I've been able to adjust the gameplay with very promising results so far.The dev team have a track record of excellent support for their games, and they continued to take user feedback and refine gameplay and modding options for DBC 14 for a long while after release. I'm expecting the same thing with DBC 17.As I understand it the PC version has fixes for some issues that drew criticism in the console release, and while I expect future patches and community mod content to improve gameplay further and smooth out some rough edges, as a keen follower of the sport I think it's a pretty good game right now, and the best bits are excellent.

												New to the franchise. I've enjoyed what I've played so far! Bowling is very nice. Batting is difficult but I'm sure more practice will pay off. Fielding is a bit bizarre. Players will sometimes run straight past a ball and leave it for another fielder, costing runs. I find the commentary dull, repetitive and sometimes has nothing to do with what's just happened in the over. Graphically it's very good. Runs smoothly and does the job. Hoping some patches will sort out the fielding out!			"

												It is better than Don Bradman 14. There are a lot of improvements over the old game in areas of batting, bowling, and career. The graphics looks better than Don Bradman 14 too. I dont understand why there is so much negative reviews about the game. May be it is because at first sight when coming from Don Bradman 14 it looks disinteresting because of the new style of batting and bowling. One thing thought its lacking is that the developer is not releasing updates as they used to release for the old title. (Update: The developer of the game has promised a title update in the middle of April.)If have played Don Bradman 14 or new to cricket game, I would recommended this title. Five star out of five.Update after playing about fifty hours: Batting has changed a lot than the old game, you can't hit a shot by pre-meditation. You have to change the style and direction for each ball after it has been bowled. It is good but a bit difficult to master.Bowling: the varietyof technics that both the spinners and other bowlers are given with is really amazing.Areas in need of improvement. Commentary. fielding and bating of Ai, sky graphics.			"

												Great Game and a great improvement from the previous version. I didn't face any technical problems as some other people are facing. I love the detail for domestic cricket, now I can play as Guwahati and then move on to Assam and then to India in career mode. And speaking of career mode I can play female players which I was surprised, a happy one.There is lack community creations as of 23-01-2017 but I am sure this problem will go away with time.Great Game 9/10			"

												Don Bradman Cricket 2017: a review......Don Bradman Cricket is the worthy successor to Don Bradman 14. The attention to detail and the depth of gameplay is quite amazing. The fact that you can now choose to play either as a female or male cricketer is fantastic. I myself have been playing the game the last week and can quite clearly say it is the best cricket game ever made; ever! And I have played them all and always been thoroughly dissapointed.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and of course eerything depends on wha you are hoping or looking for in a game and whilst DBC still needs some tweaking and polishing it has all the ingredients present to make it a classic and I have full confidence that BA wil do jut that.The Don Bradman series is different because it caters to such a wide range of tastes: want a quick fire 5 over bash? No problem. Want a five day test match? Done! And both variations give a realistic and satisfying game.The level of editing now available is mind-boggeling and thanks to the talents of many in the community you can download your favourite players, kits, teams, bats and even stadiums.I myself am setting up my own custom league and making a number of small town stadium to go along with them. I would never have thought that that would be possible in a cricket game.Another great addition are the game play modifiers so that you can now tweak every aspect of gamkeplay so it suits your own needs: need more time to judge the pace and length of the ball? That is now possible along with a whole array of other modifiers such as bounce, friction, front-foot anticipation....the list goes on!Cricket is a complicated game consisiting of many types of cricket and each area of discipline (batting, bowling and fielding) has its own dynamic and skills: these are really well catered for in DBC17 and you really have the sense of being part of a bigger picture where everything matters down to the tiniest detail.Another plus is that the team making the game are themselves very passionate about the game and have listened intently to to the community, striving to bring the game both the hard-core cricket fan and the casual gamer can enjoy. I think they have done a really good job in presenting players with the possibility to find there own particular niche within the game.They are committed to bringing tweaks and patches where needed and listening for feedback as to where the game needs some good old spit and polish.Having already spent many hours on this game i can highly recommend it to every cricket lover: yes it will take a little bit of learning: but thats what you want out of a game: the satisfaction of developing your skills and seeing that pay-off in the field of play. On the other hand there are so many modifiers and custom modes that you can just strap straight up and bash your way to glory as your favourite cricketing hero.Conclusion: should you get this game? If you like cricket: yes! The game oozes cricket in all it's infinite subtleties.			"

												This is definitely a step up from the previous release.A hugely expanded career mode, and a plethora of new features make this the best cricket game released so far.There are a few bug's and glitches currently, however these have already mostly been patched out. "

												Until the devs get around to releasing the actual ""Release Candidate"" version of the game, stay away.I've got over 600 hours in DBC 14, so I was desperately looking forward to this.What I got is plagued with stupid bugs, which basically ruin the entire experience.For example, I set a field for my career bowler. The batsman plays the ball to where I had placed a fielder, easy catch for my man....Nope, my fielder has somehow moved between balls from say, cover, and is now stood down at fine leg or somewhere else.Having fielders stood on the boundary, a ball is hit towards them, they stand on the boundary rope and watch the ball go past for 4.Just stupid stuff like this.Hopefully they'll patch it soon and make it playable. Until they do that, I strongly suggest waiting. "

												If your coming from DBC 14 your first experience will be huh? How did they ruin this game?Pros:- More stats- Improved Menu UI- I like on screen UI as I'm bowling- More stuffCons:- Commentary is buggy  - I got 2 wickets in an over and complains that I need to tighten up because 8 runs were scored  - No mention like in DBC of going into the 30's, 40's, getting my 50  - Tells me great hit won't need to run, gets fielded  - I could go on and on, but it feels worse then DBC 14- The game looks and feels worse. Glitchy, slow UI, fuzziness at times, DBC14 graphics are a better overall experience- random runs being recorded, I would really like to see the devs at least chip away at issues, i.e regular releases to at least show they care, fix one thing, release that, repeat. It's friggen tumble weed on the update. I got nervous when I saw they were doing bat editor, stadium builder, etc why not focus on making the core actually playable, improved instead of wasting dev time on these secondary features. DBC14 was great, but I feel if you actually listened to your users, and focused on fixing the stuff that was broken, not breaking the stuff that was OK, we would have a much better game.Frustrating as this could have been my favourite game of all time, now I'm just too late to refund and hoping for updates "

												Enjoyed Don Bradman Cricket 14? Keep it. Keep playing it. This is the same game but with slightly different UI and graphics. I already get shafted by buying the same game every year with FIFA, I don't need it with cricket as well as soccer.I know I've only played half an hour of this on Steam but I've spent days building my career on DBC 14, on Xbox 360 (I know, this review doesn't really sound believeable but I guess you'll have to take my word here).Everything felt EXACTLY the same. No improvement, nothing worse just... exactly the same. DBC 14 was AMAZING because it was a cricket game that actually felt more like a simulation than an arcadey game. Yet, it has its flaws but by god it was the best cricket game BY A MILE. It was remarkable.I had a huge expectations for this and didn't read much into it leading up to buying it. I genuinely believed that Big Ant would take the incredible base they've made with DBC 14 and build on it, getting rid of the little annoying bugs, adding new features (YOU STILL CAN'T SAVE A FIELD SETTING BY THE WAY, ENTER IT MANUALLY EVERY TIME), and making the AI better and the overall gameplay experience. I got none of that.Sorry but I haven't waited 3 years for a disappointment like this. Refund requested. What a let down. Rant over. Apologies to those who read it.TL;DR - Keep playing DBC 14 instead of investing in this tripe.			"

												I have played 3688 hours on Don Bradman Cricket 14 and still love the game. However, Don Bradman Cricket 17 is a big step backwards and the developers have almost ignored all requests from users for new addition / features to the game.Don Bradman Cricket 17 does not even track your earned stats for your created players like Don Bradman Cricket 14 did. Tail enders bat exactly like top or middle order batsman. There is no distinguishing between animations between proper batsman and those tail enders who have poor defensive abilities. The lack of different bowling animations makes the game look very boring in terms of bowling. Even games like Brian Lara Cricket 2005 and Brian Lara Cricket 2007 had different types of animations for bowlers. The new ball will swing as much as a ball that looks worn 70 overs late. There is no similarities between how the ball acts in real life and how it does in the game. Why is this game called a simulation if it does not represent real life?The pitches are not distinguishable. There are no green seamers where the ball moves around off the seam. There is no dusty pitches where the ball spins significantly and creates issues for batsman every ball. I do not understand why there are different looking pitches when they all play exactly the same. Created stadiums look absolutely awful in the game. They look like the crowd are sitting on cardboard boxes. You cannot even create a created stadium with grass embankments with people sitting on grass like some cricket grounds around the world. BigAnt has ignored all the suggestions from fans who bought Don Bradman Cricket 14 and have created a game of what they believe consumers want. This falls short of what we want. Sadly this game is a shadow of Don Bradman Cricket 14 which is still the best Cricket game ever created.  "

												I'll preface this by saying that if you own DB 14 and want to upgrade to DB 17 thinking it will be better, it won't. However, if you've never played DB 14, then you might enjoy DB 17. I purchased this game after putting in about 400 hours in DB Cricket 14 expecting much of the same, but better. Which was obviously wrong. Bowling has gotten better; previously I could've bowled 10+ overs in a test match before I saw a wicket. Here the edges are more frequentI like the having to do something to make a catch, however pointless it may seemFielding AI is slightly improved from DB 14, but the whole running away from the ball and making a one handed behind the back catch is sillyBatting experience is awful; just straight up awful compared to DB 14At least in career mode, running that first run after hitting a shot is just slowI like the dynamic line up changes in career modeGraphics for a $50 game is not even close. They spent 3 years developing this? Overall, I'm mixed on this game. I would not recommend it for $50. This is a $30 game at best.However, my main gripe is the batting experience in DB 17. If you've played DB 14, you won't enjoy it here as much as you did in DB 14. Still the occasional game crash at odd times. "

												I have been eagerly waiting for this game, and have got to say, im not disappointed!,  the game looks amazing, and with the addition of the community created stadiums/kits and faces, the game has the realism i was after, i played a test match and have got to say for the first time, the AI batted realisticly, playing smart leaves, defensive shots and placing the ball into the gaps, I also like how you're able to find the batsman's edge, which in other games has been very uncommon, the gameplay its self is great, the batting allows you to play 360 degree shots around the ground, and to pick holes in opposition fields, i have found the running between the wickets quite delayed, and when sliding the bat after a quick single, just too late, rather than sliding the bat in, as the batter runs over the line, the bat is grounded after the batsman crosses the line, i hope that is fixed in a upcoming patch, its not game breaking but quite annoying when you are unnable to do a quick single because your batsmen will not ground his bat until hes over the line, but so far from what ive played this game is amazing, its a big step up from DBC14, although there is no major additions, everything has been improved. i definatley reccomend this game to anyone who is interested in cricket games, and for any hardcore fan, this game is a must!!

Product received for free
												The PC version of DBC 17 is a sure winner. Graphics are smooth and crisp, lighting is absurdly good and although Big Ant are a small developer on a tight budget they have made every effort imaginable to make this a cricket game for cricket lovers. Gameplay has definitely come a long way with AI being more tactically aware than in the predecessor DBC 14. They judge chases more efficiently and tend to play better cricket all round. Cricket can now be played 360 degrees around the field and shot making is intuitive and fluid. Edges are clearly way more evident with catches through to the keeper a regular occurance. With 3 different settings and customisable sliders for your own personal preference anybody can pick up a controller and enjoy the game of cricket despite you level of play.With a lot of negative feelings towards the initial console release, the developers have made every effort to listen to the customer and fix what they wanted fixed. Customisation in the game is unrivaled with the academy for users to create and share teams, logos, bats, stadiums and players. With literally hundreds of ways to edit and customise every gameplay, match types and tours etc including Day/Night Tests and every other format imaginable, it certainly has enough depth in its modes. Career mode has been deepened and conitnues to be my favourite. Although a lot easier on the eye than DBC 14 the initial screens and UX are not always user friendly and at times can be long winded when navigating, BA have however made steps towards making it easier and I am sure will continue to do so. Commentary is still sometimes one dimensional and repetitive, but James Taylor is a breath of fresh air and a major coup for the game. - Graphics         8/10- Commentary    7/10- Gameplay        8.5/10- Customisation  9.5/10- Modes             9/10- Customisation 10/10In my book a big step up from DBC 14 in many and a good sequel. Definitely worth it.  "

And will change my review if it deserves it.Updated: Having played for few days, I will say it is a really good cricket game. Best available.

												Don Bradman Cricket 17, despite a few issues immediately following the release, is a top quality game, improving on the original game in bowling, batting, fielding and especially career mode, where you can take yourself from grade cricket all the way to the international stage, via a large variety of domestic cricket leagues around the world. Or, if you want to fasttrack your way to the top, start as an existing player and have fun playing as your cricket hero. I would highly recommend this game, certainly worth it.			"

												9.5/10This is a great sequel from DBC14.The Ui and gameplay take some time to get into but its worth it for this new addition to the franchise, having to workout where you can take a quick single and when you can take on the throw is a nice addition to 17. Whereas in 14 you could 90% of the time take a quick single knowing that the mechanics would give you enough time to get in.The commentary is ok, always a hard thing to get right for games, it sometimes gets the calls just plain wrong. Calling some overs wicket maidens or going for to much etc.Game also has PINK BALL tests :D , one of the few times I am excited by pink.As of 24/1/17 - - Animations for proper stumpings sometimes arent there, just throws the ball at the stumps.- Batter goes the long way round to get back into the crease, which sometimes leads to you being run out by half of your toe. - Also doesnt ground the bat properly or get back into crease quickly after declining a run or dancing down the wicket.- Stats are not updating properly.- From my perspective leg side shots are now harder to play than in DBC14, with off side much easier to play. It was reversed in 14.- Batter steps along way to off stump when trying to play leg side shots sometimes, which leads to you getting bowled when you just wanted to glance the ball.- Sometimes when you get given not out you end up being placed at the non-strikers end.- Fielders are a bit dopey sometimes, overthrows are still rare but sometimes the ball is thrown to you, your player does nothing, the player behind you does nothing, the ball goes to the boundary.- On occasion spin bowlers will be called for ""to high"" no ball.- Ai rarely changes field to anything other than the opening field  Sometimes hits the ball straight to the slips.- Wickets are better than 14, but havent had any reason to have close fielders other than regulation slips.All or some of these maybe player skill based but have been my experience so far.Will update later after a few more hours. :)			"

												DBC 17 , as my review goes played this game online as well as on offline mode and it looked impressive for me. Cricket games are rare nowadays with EA and CODEMASTERS backing out on their Cricket game releases! It was a bold move from Big Ant to release a cricket game and that too with immense effort being put in. I have played DBC14 and now coming to DBC17 this game is wonderful and smooth to play which offers a tremendous amount of fun and rich playing experience. But i still believe this is not a full baked cake as there are multiple issues which i have seen while playing and to point out i feel fielding is bit let down and it needs improvement so as for field placing setting. Graphics part looks decent but then again - eventhough there is a cricket academy and community apart - say for eg: Team India - Except for Virat kohli and MSD none of the players were created right in the community!commentatory is a let down which offers very less for a user experience. But then again coming back to gameplay , inspite of all the complains i have, this game is good and from a country which loves cricket a lot, i believe this should be in the collection of every cricket loving gamer!! Hoping that the patches will be released soon and make this one perfect!			"

												I absolutely love this game! I am not a regular reviewer of games despite gaming a lot and having a lot of games, so please stick with me if I ramble a bit.I finsihed with 994 hours of playtime on DB14 and I am sure I will clock even more playtime on this.I was really nervous buying this game with the mixed reviews that are on here but I decided to buy the game anyway as I remeber how good the dev team were at fixing issues on DB14 and my passion for cricket.  I needn't have been worried about anything.The batting brings a new challenge without changing too many of the things that made the last game so good.  I am still getting used to it but I get  a bit better with every innings, despite getting frustrated with myself for playing stupid shots (a lot like real life!)The bowling is a lot more rewarding than on DB14 where I felt sometimes it was too easy on the lower difficulties and was a bit of a boring slog on the harder difficulties, on this version I feel like I really get into the battle between batsmen and bowler. I read that the controls are a lot more difficult, but I have found them to be absolutely fine.The whole Career mode has had a revamp and it is fantastic, you earn SP points which you can use to level up certain batting/bowling/fielding attributes as you go along. You start off playing for a side local to the county you choose to play for and play in t20 matches for them until you are good enough to be selected for your county, you can also choose the batting and bowling difficulties independantly which is a fantastic idea.CONSI have only found two real negatives at the moment which are;1. The game randomly crashes when loading up a match (averaging once for every 10 hours of game time so far)2. The wording in the game, you can use shorter or longer pitch bowling. This annoys me everytime I see it, obviously longer is the opposite of shorter but in the context of cricket it should be shorter or fuller pitch bowling!PROS1. Graphics - smoother, better and easier for the PC to handle than DB142. Batting -  more challenging and rewarding, you get yourself out playing the wrong shots3. Bowling - more rewarding and more fun4. Career Mode - Everything about it, brilliant ideas, brilliantly executed by the devs5. James Taylor on commentary - nice touch and hasn't got too repeatetive on me yetAll in all I fully recommend this game for anyone. Cricket lovers, DB14 lovers and people new to cricket will all love this game and it is fully worth the pricetag.8/10 as it stands with the potential of being 10/10 and one of my favourite games of all time.

												If you like cricket, then you will love this game. To veterans coming from Don Bradman 14, the changes in this game will be immediately noticeable. The bowling feels so much more compelling than in the previous game, edges are satisfying to watch, and the AI batting is much improved. When batting, the increased range of strokes makes it so much more fluent to play, and more of the shots feel useable, unlike in the previous game.The graphics are a letdown, whilst jarring at first, with character models appearing somewhat more cartoony than the previous game, the improvements to the animations, environments and lighting engine overall give it a nicer and realistic feel, though somewhat lacking compared to other triple A sporting titles on the market.The improved career mode is a godsend, injecting so much more life to playing as your own pro, with the introduction of dynamic teams and club cricket. It feels satisfying to work your way up from the bottom to the top, and the difficulty adjustments you can make on the way allow you to tailor the game to your liking.Some bugs do persist though, with AI fields in first class games to reacting quick enough to your shot placement, allowing you to continually score into vacant gaps and not reacting and plugging them. It’s easily possible to score very quick runs with low skilled batsmen into these gaps. This was a bug in the previous game, so it’s frustrating to see it carry over to this game, three years on.Overall, it’s a great cricket experience. The best cricket game ever made, and well worth a look. "

												Absolutely love this game - especially the career mode. Good fun starting out as a noob in club cricket, and slowly working your way through the system and even to captaincy. Choosing how you want to upgrade your cricketer is pretty neat and adds some RPG-light/tactical elements. Early on every stroke was either a drive or a leave, until I could get some more sweet SP...Sure there are a couple of problems with the game - some animations are a little goofy looking, commentary gets stale real quick, and Shield games should not have a crowd of that size :P But haven't had any crashes, and it seems nice and stable; plus it's only going to get better with patches in the future.Overall a great game and a definite must for any cricket fan - Nice one Big Ant!

												Just not very good. Big Ant must have grown big heads in the offseason, offering this for a higher price than its predecessor, when clearly there are monumental issues with this title. Commentary is just completely off, extras aren't applied to the scoreboard, and fielders are just inept. Not to mention there is no ultra-widescreen support, which would be fine if the letterboxing option actually worked (so the game wasn't constantly stretched).I wish I was eligible for a refund (to be transparent, it took me more than two hours to get a good feel for this game) because this is an utter disappointment. Don Bradman Cricket 14 is, in my eyes, still a superior product, with not much good going for Don Bradman Cricket 17.It just cannot be recommended right now, if at all.			"

												Should have released this game as Early Access title and after feedback and patches should have launched the game. One of the positive is career mode, which has improved a lot than DBC 14.Online mode is a total mess up with full of glitches, there isn't much customisation while creating custom online matches. Do not buy this game for now if you wish to spend more time in online games like me. Will updated the review once the bugs are ironed out.Doesn't worth the price tag right now.			"

												Plain and simple. If you're new here looking for a great cricket game, go back to DBC 14. Where this game improves in graphics, it falls behind in actual gameplay when compared to the original. Sport games are difficult to get right and making sure its gameplay is genuine before making it look good must be a priority. Big Ant Studios failed big time. "

												For a cricket fan, a great cricket game.Yes, the game is quite buggy. Lot of glitches here and there. But the fun level of the game is great. As a cricket fan I was let down by this initial buggy release of the game but I trust Big Ant to go crazy with their patch fixes like in DBC 14. However this game is worth the buy even ignoring its glitches. The game is real fun to play. I play casual games and player career. Game runs perfectly most of the times. I play on ULTRA settings. Its quite fun with the huge player database, the nice little addition of graphical items like the logos and the branded bats. Players look more real. Animations are however a letdown. But then 10/10 for gameplay fun. What more would you want from the game. For a lot of people complaining how batting is quite difficult, get this - A youngster whose skill level is 35 is not going to be clearing the boundary at the start of the innings. Yes. My career player's rating is now 60 and I score international hundreds with a lot of patience and skills. This game is difficult if you want to hit a 6 of every ball. That's why I think this game is more realistic and did I say, great fun! Don't listen to the negative reviews. Play it for yourself and see it. Cons: AI still needs to improve. Animation has to get better. Glitches need to be addressed and bugs needs to be cleared. Game has a few memory leaks so have to delete game cache regularly for smooth gameplay. Online play is nonexistent.Pros: Great fun. Good cricket dynamics like shot making, bowling, 360 degree shot selection, swinging/spinning the ball. Great fun! Huge player database. More realism to the game. Feels like the game could happen in real. That's fun to me.Overall a great game let down by its initial buggy realease but I think that's because the developers would have needed money to keep the project going. Support the developers. Buy the game! We need more games from Big Ant in the future so I'm ready to spend 50$ for easily 500+ hours of gaming for the next 3 years. 9/10 for me! Gearing up for the patch. It's gonna be good :D			"

												Not as good as DB 14 at the moment. Perhaps it never will be.Graphics - I get why they changed the ball now bounces off rather than ""clips through"" just about everything - but this means getting the ball back to the bowled is a vomit inducing camera spinning dizzying whirwind of throws misses and staring at a still ball in the middle of the pitch. Mostly though the player graphics and animations don't look as good. I miss the muscular chest stretch of DB '14's quick bowlers rather than the ""made out of plastacine left overs"" look the new graphics have. All blobby and like several body parts that aren't co-ordinated with each otherOverthrows. If you have an attacking offside field (which in tests as a pace bowler happens a lot) then a nudge to cover will get the cover fielder to run in like a lunatic, throw the ball at the BASE OF THE STUMPS AS HARD AS HE CAN. The batsman is not looking to take a run, no one is at the stumps to take the ball and because only 2 or 3 fielders are on the on side the ball too often whizzes to the mid wicket boundary at which point the commentator tells me what a good shot it was!!!Quality of life 1. As a batting allrounder I get taken off after 2 over spells often - only to be bought back on 6 overs later and have to re-find my fields in an interface that is a step back (again) from DB '14Quality of life 2. How many clicks to start a game? 1,2,3,4,5,6,7?Quality of life 3. The wait between deliveries has gone up considerably. For some reason the bowler faffs about for a while. The game is for my benefit not hte AI's... GET ON WITH IT a 12 year career playing every game is an 1800 undertaking as it is without this constant dithering. Stuff that's just ""wrong"" Why am I increasing my pace stat when in my first club game I can bowl 145 Kph?  The ball seems to go ""game time"" quicker as you increase this stat, but the speed the game tells you you are bowling never changes.Square cut. I lean back then Towards the ball that is under stump hiugh, push up and left - that's a cover drive not a square cut, but no he steps away (the opposite of what I'm doing on the joypad) and wafts a cross bat square cut that either misses or cuts to gulley and out.There's more but that feels like picking on the game.DB '14 was not the game it ended up being when it was released. However I have seen no new patches for this game and it's been out months so maybe the bad reviews here have scuppered ongoing development.The long and short of it - after 3 years it should have been better than this. The rebounding physics stuff seems a step in the right direction but the presentation, gameplay and quality of life all took a step back and don't look like being fixed.Thumbs down for now - if they fix it I will review that.

												TLDR;Pros:-1. Improved gameplay over DBC 142. Great control mechanics3. Highly customisable4. A fun cricket game....Cons:-1. .... which is plagued by lack of production finesse2. Abysmal commentary3. Plenty of in-game glitches, which tend to get frustrating 4. Lots of issues from DBC 14 carried overMy verdict: Buy it if you must have a fun cricket game to play right now, else wait for a decent discount and a couple of patches / updates.7/10DBC 17 comes nearly three years after DBC 14 broke new grounds in creating a fun yet challenging cricket game for all platforms, something which the biggies of the gaming industry *cough*EA*cough* had considered too demeaning for them to take up. DBC 14 was a genuinely fun game, but it had its issues, some of which were never resolved. Of course, the success of DBC 14 meant that the next iteration had to be big enough to live up to the high standards set by the studio.Sadly, I cannot give a convincing thumbs up to this iteration of the game. A lot has improved - batting is much more fluidic and realistic, especially at the tougher difficulty levels (if you are a DBC 14 veteran, don't be afraid to crank up the AI), bowling is tougher than before, but much more rewarding, once you get the hang of it, and fielding has been pushed up a couple of notches for the good. The interface remains simplistic, and focuses on getting you in the game as soon as possible. There are still no licensed players, but the fledgling community should take care of that. The career mode is much more comprehensive now, and slightly less frustrating than before (again, this depends on how it is evolved during the game's) life cycle.However, the improvements end here, at least for now. For a game priced at par with AAA titles, DBC 17 lacks production flair. A little more colour to the presentation would have done wonders, especially in the moments leading up to or after a match. Commentary is abysmal - there is no other word for it - with drab voices, unexcited commentators, and frequently messed up lines. Over time, you will realise how the bad commentary actually kills half the fun to be had out of the match. Animations could have been spruced up much more, and the fluidity could have been worked upon. It's not that the end game is bad, just that three years and a AAA price were enough for anyone to expect all the previous issues ironed out, and substantial improvements put in.While I can easily recommend this game to a DBC newbie / cricket enthusiast (assuming you are okay shelling out this kind of money), I will be hard pressed to do so to anyone who has played DBC 14. The game needs a couple of updates and major patches before it deserves that credit. I will be sure to update my review if and when that happens.			"

												The game is okay. Better in career mode than DBC 14. There are many irritating bugs which will go away in a year or two considering the rate of development of this game.But the biggest downside is its price. For a game full of bugs and graphics comparable to FIFA 07 and without any liscensed team or players price of INR 2999 is very high. I recommend waiting untill its price comes down to  Rs 499 because the game deserves no more than that. Can any one tell me how I can sell this game to someone else :\			"

												I refunded this game after an hour. The graphics and controls are no real improvment from 14 and it is quite buggy. There were numerous times where I would hit the ball with perfect timing, foot work and shot selection and it wouldn't go off the sqaure scored 8 off 50 in a 20/20 which I literally couldnt have scored any faster with the ball never leaving the square no matter how well I hit it. I do understand the budget constraints and whatnot and the sad fact is there will never be a super impressive Cricket game again unless EA decide to make them again			"

												I'll try to keep each point short-Use this game to get out of training-Practice bowling offspin -Become the next memeUnless you love cricket so much that you would die to become a test cricketer in the virtual world of Don Bradman Cricket, or you are willing to spend countless hours on customising and making sure each team is 110% accurate to its real life counterparts. I do not recommend you get this game for the next 4 months. In short, wait for the licensing to come through, so you won't need to fix the entire game yourself, and wait for bug fixes and game crash fixes as well as gameplay issues and your all good to go. Aside from that, gameplay is definitely better and different from DBC14, its more realistic and gives the player a new experience and shows that, hitting 6 sixes is very hard. Bowling wise, yea nah, better.... still can't bowl someone..... lol.Career mode, getting to the level of FIFA but with cricket, favourite part of this game. Also playing from club and rising to national and international level is extremely realistic.Academy, you can build a stadium, nice realism and immersion, edit the clubs....

												The field editor is absolutely useless. You can only view the fielders by name and not number so Dennis Lillee will be fielding at first slip. What's worse is that your meticulously selected field positions will not be saved, and instead you'll have people in ridiculous positions when you exit the menu. I have confirmed this happens when fielding restrictions are not on so it is not auto-correcting a mistake.Apart from that the game is really good and I recommend it. Needs a patch.			"

												Pretty decent simulation of the Cricket game.  Graphics look overall updated than Don Bradman 14 but still a long way to go to really make an impact in modern day gaming environments. Gameplay is addictive but still there are lots of scope for improvement since its just the initial release. Lighting improvements have been great!! 1. The batting shotmaking sometimes lags if i mistime , unlike DBC14 if i play the shot too early the batsman doesnt play the shot or plays it late after the ball has passed the stumps. Its very annoying!! Overall batting looks like it needs some major tweak as it feels very robotic. DBC14 was way better and spotless while batting!!2. Field placements changes have been good and user friendly. The fielders though behave odd and fall for everything especially the WKeeper. It looks abnormal.3. The batting timing meter shows green for everything, foot, shot and timing when I play a lofted shot. But still the ball travels only till the mid off fielder and the batsman gets out!!There are quite a few bugs that needs to be weeded out !! Lets c... waiting for the patches !! "

												Ok guys, here it is.Firstly, I feel people jumped on here entirely too early to give this a good review.While the batting and bowling mechanics are much improved, more balanced if you will between the two, there are ALOT of game breaking bugs as it stands.For instance, having a player that is maxxed out stats, playing a shot with ideal footwork, timing, and shot choice, yet still getting clean bowled (can't possibly play the shot better)Secondly, little glitches like a ball been throwen back from the outfield hitting the stumps, stopping dead, then suddenly taking off to the boundry.Sometimes batter not responding at all to any controls randomlyAnd finally, after getting through 3 years of career player, getting selected to International side only to have my career save ""corrupt"" for no apparent reason and a lot of crashing to desktop.Also not 100% sure if it is an AMD issue with the game, but Myself and others are having our computers running off it's head for a game like this.My PC is being pushed as hard by this as it does BF1 which just indicates terrible optimisation.Can't honestly recommend this game until they patch a few things, but once a few bugs are sorted out, it would be fantastic			"

												So lets start with the positive things, It's a cricket game... Now onto the badThe only thing I have to compare this game with is DBC14 (Which I own on another steam account and have played many hours) They have somehow taken a good game with a lot of problems, fixed none of them and added more problems.They took the best part of DBC14, the bowling, and ruined it, Now the meter you use is for some reason in the bottom right and small enough that you have to watch it directly instead of the bowler.Everything feels small, the players, the stumps, ball, bats, it all feels scaled down, I'm not sure some people may like it but I am not one of them.I am sorry for using this word but I do so for lack of a better option, the fielders are straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, children’s club cricketers show better judgement and athleticism than the fielders in DBC17, Watching the fielders play in DBC17 I imagine would be like watching a group of mildly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children play cricket, badly, and incorrectly.You've got to sprint back to the stumps after every ball or they go for overthrows.most fielding animations, throwing, catching, (""walking"" to the ball as it runs away for 4) look un-naturalFor some reason my 18 year old athlete I’m playing as has the cardio vascular stamina of a middle aged man who hasn't exerted himself past walking from the house to the car since 1985 and is exhausted after bowling an over, and has a finite pool of stamina that once used does not refill.That said this is probably the best cricket game available (best apple in a bad bunch kinda thing) and I will probably play it, a lot. Also, the price is great, I expected it to be closer to $90 AUD. It could be an amazing game if they continue to fix and improve it.			"

												I really don't like writing sledgehammer reviews. Then again I don't like paying out large amounts of money for what should be a premier status and it turns out to be absolutely dreadfulI have never seen such awful graphics in a video for many many years. I have never seen such awful AI for many many years. I could go on but the word that matters here is, awful.This game should be avoided at all costs. If you must buy a cricket game then go for don bradman 14. That game was bad enough.It's obvious that very little money had been spent on this game. The animations come from a different century. Haven't the devs heard of 3D? The stadiums are totally flat, without perspective. The pitch is rendered at low resolution without any textures. It looks like it's been painted on the ground. The commentary isn't even up to PES standards. Yes it's that bad.I wouldn't have believed it was possible to make a game that looked worse than Don bradman 14.Apparently Big Ant have spent three years making this game. Does anyone actually believe that? The game won't even play at 2160p. Assassins creed 2, made 8 years ago runs at 2160p.I have compared this game to Don Bradman on the PS3 and this looks and plays much worse. I have compared this game to games from 10 years ago and the graphics and animations are worse on this game.If this game was given away free I wouldn't play it.Patches and updates will not fix this game. The graphics don't have problems, they are simply badly coded. They can't be fixed without rewriting the whole game. That won't happen.How can The makers of this game justify a premium price for this game? They can do it because they have a captive audience for the game. Just look at the website. Players are desperate for a cricket game. So they flock to buy it.This shows the level of contempt the devs have for the buying public.This game can't be fixed. It's should only be put straight in the bin.I don't enjoy writing this type of demolition of a video game. I wanted to play a good cricket game. I am only writing this demolition because the people who made this game made a game that is absolutely awful beyond belief.  They should hang their heads in shame. A game of this low quality should not be allowed on steam.			"

												It is a good game but very difficult to bat . And there are no real names and real players.  Batting in Practice mode is good but in real matches we simply could not connect to ball at all even though i tried manycustom modifiers, really disappointed with this except the game is superb.			"

												Best Cricket game to date. Been playing them since EA sports Cricket 2002. Is there much of a difference between  Don Bradman 17 and 14 - Not really but it is an improvement in the right direction. Big Ant studios do some great Sport games obviously with a limited budget. You'lll notice this with the graphics it defintely isn't an AAA title done by big companies but Graphics are fine to look at and gameplay is fine too. I sunk 84hrs into Don Bradman 14 and within 1 week i'm already up to 17 hours with Don Bradman 17 and still get excited for the next match be it T20, ODI or Test Series. Definately worth the purchase, defintely the best Game to date if you don't want to spend the money cause you already own DB14 then wait for sales and buy it on Sale			"

												What happend!?!?! DBC14 was fun to play. DBC17 is not fun to play!! Sure the graphics and interface are better, but the game physics are aweful! Batting is impossible, and even in easy mode, you cant smash the ball around. Only play this game if youre willing to study it for 10,000 hours and treat it like a phd in a computer game before you can actually play the game -- and have fun. There is no skills transfer from DBC14 to DBC17 -- so all that experience is worthless, and certainly batting in DBC17 is further away from real cricket than DBC14 was.Batting needs to be patched and fixed, otherwise dont waste any time playing this game!!!

												I usually don't do reviews but this game is something special,as most of the cricket fans around the world patiently waited for a new cricket game.After three years I expected the game to be top notch but I have been downright disappointed.No one should consider buying it unless you are horny for a cricket game and have 50$ lying around,first of all it don't even do any justice to it's price tag max this game should be 20$.I would highly recommend you to save your hard earned money and avoid this title at all cost.I guess this will be last cricket game that's going to release in awhile. So one more time RIP CRICKET GAMES :/			"

												This is one of the most pathetic sports game i have played in a while. I have put in more than 100 hours in DBC '14 which was pretty good for it's time. But this game is more like a downgrade from the previous one. Cons:1) Graphics is mediocre. 2) AI is poor.3) Shot making is very tough compared to DBC '14.4) Commentary in this game has got to be one of the worst for the game of this genre.5) Too many bugs to list them all. Pros:1) More customization compared to DBC '14 like downloadable stadiums, kits etc.2) Controls are improved.3) Bowling mechanisms are totally redesigned and it's much improved now.Well, if you are a die hard cricket fan and you already own DBC '14, don't bother buying this.

												I don't understand all the positive reviews, DBC 14 is way better than this. Animation looks so fake, when fielders throw the ball most of the times the are not even facing the right direction. Once I was standing inside the crease and WK appealed for stump out and umpire send the decision to 4th umpire and in replay I was clearly standing inside the crease but 4th umpire still gave out. And at higher batting difficulties it's impossible to bat against spinners only option is to hit advance shots. Every team has same fielding setup. If you want good gameplay just go for DBC 14. Only good thing is depth of content in career mode but still it can be improved in lots of ways.			"

												This is terrible. Just buy DBC 14 if you want to play a cricket game, you will get it cheaper and it has less problems. The bugs from 14 are still present and they've even thrown a few more in to make you hate the experience that much more. PROSCareer mode is much betterPlayer, Team, Stadium customisation is goodBit nicer to look atCONSPretty much everything else. Fielding is just a disaster,♥♥♥♥♥♥animations, constant overthrows, running balls over boundary, glitching in and out of crease. TheCommentary makes me want to kill myself. The graphics bug out and lock on depth of field randomly. Moving in the crease sometimes makes you unable to play a shot. Moving the field works some of the time, sometimes you have to watch them walk like slugs to their new positions. Multiplayer running between wickets works smoothly about 25% of the time.I don't understand how they can develop a game and instead of focusing on the underlying issues of the previous version they choose to ignore them and add a bunch of stuff that sounds good, but is ultimately poorly developed and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Cannot recommed the game in the current state.DBC14 is alot better currently.Biggest gripes: (I have only played career)Running between the wickets feels slow.There is ALWAYS a single even if you block the ball.You can run fours quite often because boundry fielders only stop the ball, and another fielder runs to throw the ball in.Your career batsmen feels like someone who has never held a bat.  Close to no skill.Good parts:Bowling feels more intuitiveMore customization optionsCommunity players/teams look great so far. "

												I played Online PvP and it was awful XP since fielders running in between deliveries ball suddenly appearing after delivered by the bowler. it was very difficult to time as it was lagging for an unknown reason since I have 24mb/s connection that's more than any game require ATM . personally, to my taste this game is 71-75% done and therefore extensive patching is required . fielders throws ball unnecessarily and bowler is not collecting ball played at him( at any speed ) fielders doesn't charge the ball or dive or make attempt to stop the ball in the circle . in batting there's much difference in every shot played (still investigating) commentary is as awful as anything.i have played more than 35hrs before writing this article and game got crashed 5 times in total. so yeah all n all this is not finished product by any means it tastes like half-baked bread or cookie for that matter . (hope it gets patching soon)the final call - must buy game only after patching and that only if u are a cricket fan			"

												I bought the game yesterday and was rather disappointed. Just to clarify, I played DBC 14 for just over 400 hours. My first gripe was apparent as soon as I started batting. The white of the sight screen, the Umpire's hat and coat, as well as the bowler was absolutely glaring and rather distracting. Even changing the Gamma settings did not help. Secondly, the new commentary is horrendous and kind of lame.... Replays are not smooth and rather jumpy, not worth watching.The only reason I will continue playing this game in perpetuity is the excellent simulation of the game of Cricket. The game is very challenging and this after I only played the previous iteration on Legend mode. Now, I am finding Pro mode tough going.			"

												This game is sorely disappointing. The only improvement i liked was that you could see the length of the delivery slightly before the bowler released which helped me stop premeditating shots. Other than that i felt the graphics didnt live up to the screenshots despite max settings, the commentary was uninspired, the gameplay/controls were clunky and the atmosphere of cricket just wasn't as good as DB14 - personally im going to stick with DB14			"

												At the current level the game is certianly not worth it. the balance of the game ceases to be enjoyable and overall i feel the developers in the conquest to make it better have actually ruined the gameplay in the process. The controls are  very difficult, the animations are not par to the price that they are asking and overall the gameplay sucks at the moment.I have played every cricket game that has ever come out (atleast i think i have) and i can honestly say that this edition is really not upto the mark.What i feel they have done is to just add a few new  teams, the commentary is still rigid and certianly not worth the price the game is being sold for. If you are looking for a great cricket simulation then this is really not worth it. the batting controls are way off, to frustrating since every time i play and miss i am caught behind the wickets, and i am talking after spending atleast 30 hours in the previous edtion. The developers have developed the game without any prior research in cricket, all they have done is to add Don bradmans name and hoping to sell as many copies before the fans get a wind of it. this game should have been sold for less than 10 bucks and it might be bang on the money, the experience is way off and i seriously dont understand their complicated level up system and i am talking after buying and playing atleast 150 games on steam. first off some of the things that could have been done to improve - 1.Batting - 1/10  even at the easiest level it takes a lot of time before you even are off the mark, if you thought 14 was hard, then 17 is not for the faint hearted, 2. Graphics - 3/10 -  nothing actually, its still the same old 1st generation graphics, a few new faces have been added but the rest are the same, cameras -1/10  Pathetic, come on guys do some research, you have one angle for practice and one for gameplay , whoever thought of this brilliant suggestion  should be fired straightaway, although they do have a pro mode where you see in an fps mode but nothing out of the ordinary 3. Animations - 5/10 , a little rigid when it comes to running but overall the animations arent anything spectacular, if these devs priced it close to an indie title i would have said amazing, but when you price it at a AAA price point then you deserve to be criticised if not to the mark. 4. Bowling -1/10  where do i even start, its like learning a new programming language there are atleast 5-6 different controls to bowl a ball, come on , i get it you want a deeper simulation but in the process its like you have to spend atleast 5-6 hours to even enjoy playing the game 5. feilding - its pretty much automated although they have added a few new controls to increase the speed of the throw etc. overall i dont think its worth it, but then if you truly are a cricket fan then you can buy it more for novelty sake rather than enjoyment. The devs need to keep pace in terms of development along with their marketing which they truly are good at. Sometimes i find the mobile simulation games much better than the ones that are available on steam, i think the devs should look closer to something like Cricket Career in Android which is much better when it comes to game play and features, just a thought.

												Game is totally out of sync, Full of Bugs, -------------------Batsman stops responding if you flick between front foot and Backfoot after bowl being delivered.-Fielder stops ball at boundary diving and and after getting up he can't pick the ball, another feilder comes running 30 yards to pick the ball, hence conceding 4 runs anyway,- Batsman after making a shot can move back through stumps without disturbing it :(.-Fielders and Wicket keeper can recieve ball through the stumps ( also without disturbing them)- Umpire gives a batsman out LBW even when he halfway down the pitch to hit a shot.-Animation is just misreably bad, feilders can face opposite to ball still able to catch one handed, and normally they all are superman by default.- I expected Big Ant to implement the Stump uprooting after they are being disturbed (To get batsman out), instead fielders can hit it as many times without uprooting stumps and still get rounouts.-WicketKeeper and bolwer are lazy, they receive the ball but don't want to hit the stumps, even if the batsman has hot reaced the crease, they relaise couple of seconds later meanwhile batsman is home.-Commentry is just pathetic: They say its a maiden over, when are 10 runs in the overIn short no where near as Cricket'14. Only thing new and exicting about the game is customisation of Players and equipment.Please don't buy it, You would really reget your decision			"

												17 hours into this so far and am giving up until bug fixes come along. With a game like cricket, bowling to a strategy only to see your perfect LBW not called because according to the game it hit outside off stump (it didn't) is far more of a deal breaker than you'd think.Pros:The fielding isn't insane in this game. No fielders running at 200mph to take a catch compared to DB14Bowling is actually compelling and fun. You get mostly punished for crap bowling and rewarded for mixing it upVisualisations (reviews, batting movements) improvedGood overall game.Cons:Commentary is utterly attrocious. Very little variation and it's often flat out wrong.LBW ""hit outside off stump"" when it obviously did hit in the line. Plum LBWs regularly missed.Inconsistent gameplay. Last 4 games I edged a shot where I had perfect footwork, shot selection and timing. Basically the same shot 4 times over. Then I'll hit a shot with bad footwork and timing for 4.Fielders never throw to the end that makes logical sense (throw to the keeper unless there's a runout chance, they seem to do the opposite)Spinner fielding off their own bowling. Will stand there like a hapless idiot as the ball rolls past their feetLoad times are really bad for a simple game, especially career mode where you'll play a lot of games back to backRunning between wickets, don't put bat down until after reaching the end, hard to trigger second runs early on so you don't know what will happen. Kind of imaginary timing going on that's a game in itself.Recommend buying it in a few months.Additional thoughts: So a few weeks on, no bug patches and it becomes obvious that the bugs are pretty buried throughout the game. A lot of this makes no sense. So many bad LBW calls (even on review). The D/L method is broken in T20 matches. Batting turns into a frustrating mess when your batsman times it perfectly, with the perfect shot, only to get yet another edge. Some incredible graphic glitches - pitch was so bright I couldn't play at one point (looked like someone cranked the sun to about 3000%) mixed with some bizarre fielding (the tap back from the rope is great, that the player won't turn around and throw themselves is not so great). Some simple gameplay tweaks and adjustments would go a long way to make this game more enjoyable and less frustrating			"

												EDIT: I've changed my mind re: quick field setup - playing at state level, you can actually rely more on the fielders then DBC14, making the auto-set fields more reliable, and if you bowl to them it works well. Now the main issue still for me is dodgy♥♥♥♥♥camera shots sometimes, and scene transitions. Apart from that this is a much deeper game then first expected. -------Don't buy right now - wait until a patch or two. Graphics are a bit off, scene transitions jarring, commentary pretty wooden, but the worst is the terribly overcomplicated field placement UI - bring back DBC14 one please. Career Mode is the main redeeming feature here so far. I think if these issues can be ironed out then I would recommened.			"
