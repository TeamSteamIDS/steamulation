												FM2016 was the first time I'd skipped a year since 2008.  I felt was paying £35 for a database update and a generally buggier game, but over the years I was used that, but last year I was so fed up with it I stuck with FM2015. Along comes this year's update and nothing's changed, in fact very little has changed from 2015. I mean who gives a toss if there's a pre-match line-up and handshake, watch it twice, the novelty wears off, then who doesn't click through it as soon as a skip button appears. I also think the social media stuff is useless bloat, it's click candy and not very good click candy.On to the match engine which is better in some ways and worse in others with the much hyped new video captures i.e. tackles: they motion captured a tailor's dummy while the tackler does a little tapdance and the ball shoots away, and he'll run after it, or just stand there and watch while an opposition player runs from twice as far away to retain possession. (although sliding tackles are fine now)  Shooting at the near post almost every time hasn't been fixed, nor has trying to pass the ball through the clump of opposition players directly in front of you, when you have players free all around you, nor has the disconnect between the action and the text description, if you say the forward blazes over the bar don't show the goalie pushes it over, unless it's followed by players arguing for a corner.  Also ""that would've been some goal"" is only right about 1 time in 20. There are lots of others that haven't been fixed.Negotiations with agents is way worse than 2015. You can get redlocked out for something as innocuous as changing the wage rise from 10 to 15 games. I've started saving my games before negotiations because of stupidities like that. And injuries are way over done. In the Man City game i'm playing I've assembled the best medical team money can buy and I've got De Bruyne, Sterling, Aguerro, Sane, Stones, and Otamendi all out long term. Well I own it now. They definitely did something to the demo that made freak scores more likely in the full version. Oh and sort out the damned licensing issues and stop being cheapskates because we can mod the team names et al ourselves.Also can't understand why you can't have the demo ready in July, and the full version synched to the start of the season, with a full update when the transfer window closes.Well not a positive review, but having clocked up over 8,000 hours playing various versions i'm think i'm entitled to a moan.

												If you are tempted to buy new FM2017, please read some of the reviews first, including mine.I am long-time fan of this series, started with FM 2008 and bought the new one every single year since then. Well, this year might be actually the last one for me. Every FM veteran knows that every year there are high expectations from the fans and big promises from the developers. Somehow last couple years the developers fail to deliver the game we all want, which leads to an increasing number of people turning their backs on Sports Interactive.Lets start with my statement, that I am really trying to be fair and point out only relevant things, as I am not blinded by hate. I just want to play a good football manager simulation game that is actually enjoyable.The concept of the game is awesome, potential is huge and there are countless options and different approaches. Then why so many people dont enjoy the game? Its easy to answer. They expect a REAL simulation with HIGH CONTROL, however SI fails to deliver it.Lets check out some of the issues.1) Team MoraleIn FM 2017 there is often no possibility to make players more happy beside winning a lot. You cant approach or speak to players with low morale. That is really stupid.-You are trying to boost team morale by good training, good approach to players, fulfilling your promises etc. just to find out that players who played 35 out of 38 games want to leave your team because they want to play more. -Players want new contracts 1 year after they have signed a 5year deal increasing their salary 3 times. If you reject it, it very often leads to a riot of other (happy) players, forcing you to sell that particular player and possibly some of his (now unhappy) supporters in the team as well or giving him 3times better salary again.-Your key defender was sent off last match in 12th minute after 2 yellow cards bringing your team down. You fined him. He says he didnt deserve the fine and his morale drops massively. Another red card for him the next match. You fine him again (because thats what you do everytime someone gets it=fair). He wants to leave the club.2) Transfers&ContractsAlthough I think the current system of transfers/contracts offers a lot in a good way, its still far from reality sometimes.- Very often you receive an absolute lowballs for your key players- You need money so you try to sell your good and valuable first team player that was really good past couple seasons and a lot of clubs should be interested. No offers received even if you significantly lower the price- You need to offer ridiculous amount of money for average teenagers- Your average first team 34 years old player wants to sign a new contract and he asks again for increased wage with no negotiations. You reject it. He becomes free agent and then he signs for club 2 divisions lower with 10% of his previous wage- You want your promising youngster to go on loan. He doesnt want to go play first team somewhere else and wants to stay in your lower divison B team, which is significantly worse than club that offered him a first team spot.- Most of players (their agents) want ridiculous bonuses- Some player agents are way too greedy, forcing you to stop negotiating with player that played in your club for 10 years- You are one of the greatest managers of all time and you made your club very rich and famous, yet when your contract is about to be renewed 5% wage increase is impossible3) TacticsMajority of players dont know how to use the tactics and related options properly, making them believe the matches are hard to win and it doesnt matter what formation or system you use. Well, to be honest, the tactics should be the most important and the most result-changing aspect of the game. It certainly has the effect on the match itself, but to be fair, there are way too many player/tactical errors and unlogic behaviour. - You are playing at home in a cup against very weak team from lower division. You studied their tactics, they want to play in very defensive setup, park the bus and instead of counterattacks they prefer just to send long balls to their lonely striker. So you focus on that striker, yet he still scores 3 goals a match. -The next match you play against leader of the divison at home again. Its going to be a tough match. You want to have a good ball posession, focus on strong defense and in counterattacks you rely on your wingers to break their narrow defense line. But clean sheet is a priority, you dont want to lose. And result? 5:7. No words needed. Very real, isnt it?- According to the simulation, defenders ignore their instructions, wingers ignore their instructions- Enemy scores from outside the box every now and then, but your team once a season (despite the tactics)Basically you can create tactics, make numerous plans, give instructions, study the opponent, yet still the match itself is way too random and your decisions should affect the match a lot more.3)3D simulationI swear. Nobody needs this 3D simulation. To me it is absolutely useless as long as you will serve us this mess. Players do absolutely random stuff like shooting from the corner flag or missing the empty goal 10 times in a row etc.Goalkeepers are just figurines, defenders look like they play football for the first time in their life and the graphic itself isnt any good at all either. Please focus on improving the basics of the game and after that start working on 3D.I personally never use this 3D as it makes me wanna quit the game instantly. Im pretty sure most of the people feel the same.4) Beta, bugs, reportsBeta should be here to help SI find the last bugs they havent found themselves before the alpha is released. Yet SI forum is full of topics and bug reports that nobody adressed to this date.I personally reported several bugs I have found, SI adressed just one (where in certain scenario you could play 38 matches instead of 34 in the Portuguese premier league). Rest of my bug reports (with proper evidence and savefiles) were never adressed, but some more recent were. Where is the logic?With that being said I need to mention, that as someone already wrote down here in reviews, check out how many suggestions or customer requests SI actually implemented in game. None.And should I even mention what everybody knows? That this year SI promised to deliver a chinese language to this game and by broking that promise, they basically scammed 40k chinese players who have bought this game?5) AchievementsThere are many people like me who like to go for the achievements. Achievements bring a new challenges to the game so I want to see them fixed.But every year there are some achivements impossible to obtain. Back in the days the biggest problem was to get the National Hero achivements (where you need to get the club from the lowest to the highest division). Then it was the Custom Challenge one, this year its actually a whole load of broken achievements including the most basic ones like scoring a goal in competitive match, winning continental cup or buying/selling players.Please as I stated at the beginning, Im trying to be fair here, so I wanna say again that FM series were, is and probably will be very decent game with incredible depth and awesome football content. You can have fun playing it, you can love it, but the more time you spend playing and trying new things, the more you will see how this game actually needs a massive improvement. I know the series pretty well so I am sure that devs have a lot of work ahead and hopefully one day, they will adress what should have been already adressed. So at the very end of my review, I have to say I DONT RECOMMEND this game, definitely not worth 55€. Maybe on sale but still, beside some cosmetic changes and small updates, the game is pretty much the same for a long time now and not worth its price by far.			"

												Hey! Here's an idea, if you don't have enough new features and content etc to reasonably justify selling as a brand new fully priced game then DON'T!!!Instead of copy pasting the same ♥♥♥♥ every year and pretending it's a whole new game, why not actually make SEQUELS, proper 2 or 3 or 4 year development cycle sequels that noticably raise and develop the concept, and database updates, editor, manager Barbie mode, maybe official licenses and even face and stadium packs, anything that does not affect the players ability to manage a team, could be sold as fairly priced DLC packs to pay the bills. But you'll never get it, you're too far gone.I played this series many years ago, when it was on the Amiga and early PC versions, but the game lost it's magic for me, they forgot that less is more, it's far better to do a few things well rather than trying to do everything to varying degrees of success, from the sublime to the comically, excrutiatingly ridiculous.It's not only me, look at the reviews, sure some justifiably angry 'lied to' Chinese have skewed the figures, but only slightly, look at the top rated reviews, all negative and not a chinese character in sight.You see SI, people are getting sick of your lazy money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.You should ditch the 3D match engine for a start, go back to basics, leave what is good, improve what can be improved and throw the rest into the trash, then slowly add new features once they are functioning correctly.Sega killed this franchise, like they did with Total War, it's dying a horrible and humiliating death, most can see it, sure it still sells and will always sell as long as it's the only show in town, but wait, mark my words, one day some football loving genius will emerge from his bedroom with the game this one should have become after 20 odd years of trying, a market conqueror that will emerge and kick this stale over-hyped garbage into touch once and for all.Football manager is nothing more than a database bolted onto a very mediocre, exremely flawed and bug infested fail game.

												I have been playing Championship manager\Football Manager for most of my lihe, damn, i have spent years of my life in every iteration of this game, since the beggining, so i can only talk for my self. Last year the Match Engine to me was terrible, whatever i tried i never had any consistency, with teams like Barcelona or Bayern, i could beat a big team by 3 or 4 , and then get crushed by the worst teams in the league, but the worst was that the gameplay we saw in the match engine made no sense, the players made really stupid things, wingers were useless, strikers were blind bats, but the opposition most of the times were laser guides in their ONE CHANCE, AND HITTING THE BAR 5 OR 6 TIOMES IN A GAME WAS USUAL, like i said, i played every version they made so i might not be a tactical god (LOL), but i know enought to at least make a team play in a certain way, well, not last year.Now i talked about last year because this year, FM 17 was a new experience, the engine was 10 times better, no more insane perfect counter from bad teams, the defenders even knew what they were doing, and the striker with 20 in finishing didn't miss 8\10 chances when 1 on 1 with the keeper...UNTIL THE 17.1.0 PATCH, after the patch everything wen't  RIGHT BACK TO FM 16 AGAIN, no defending, super fast perfect counters from any team, no more good looking football, hell, i bought Cavani and he scored 13 goals in 10 games, after the patch, 0, ZERO, GOALS IN 10 GAMES, COME ON, and when i told this in the feedback in the forum, in minutes i was ""attacked"" by a fanboy that doesnt know what FEEDBACK means, if you think something is wrong with the game, you are a target, so after so may years playing every game they made, i can only wait and see if they fix what WAS PERFECT IN 17.0.1 AND IS NOW BROKEN IN 17.1.0.Oh, and you guys want to know the ""fixes"" they made in the patch, GOOD LUCK, they say in their forum, PLAY AND SEE WHAT IS DIFFERENT, WOW, we don't even have the right to know what they changed, thats perfect client care, they own the market and they simply can do whatever they want because idiots like me keep on buying even though we get no respect.

												Over the years I've invested more time in this franchise than all the other games I've played combined, so it pains me to kick them while they're down, it really does, but enough is enough.It's basically a patched version of 2016 with a smattering of new features, although I'm not sure they really qualify as features. It seems that each year they're so desperate to justify the price tag that they just shoe horn in ever more inane featurettes while completely neglecting issues that have plagued the series for years.The AI is still appalling.The match engine although improved still falls way short.The social media thing is a complete waste of space.The manager 'designer' is very lame, the models suck quite frankly, the clothing, the hands, it's been very poorly done, not sure why they bothered with it as it adds nothing at all to the gameplay, just more low grade padding.Paying full price for a database update is beginning to really grate with me, played the series since its inception and have bought every iteration, but I really think this will be the last time I get stung.Yes it's the best footie management game out there, but honestly it seems to be stuck in a rut, they pretty much add nothing of substance and don't seem able to fix what is wrong. I'll play it but cannot in good conscience recommend it, at least not for the full asking price. They'll need to really up their game in order to tempt me back to the franchise, and judging by the last few releases that's just not going to happen.4/10 "

												Almost didn't buy the game because of the negative reviews, most complaning about how there has been no changes to the game play. This turns out to be not the case at all. I'll go through a short pros/cons that can be helpful.Pros:- Match engine is much improved compared to 2016. Full backs are much more in line with how they should perform, and attacks/passing show much more variance. In 2016 it was always the same ""through pass to full back, cross, goal"" formula, now you can actually see some variety in attacks. On top of that, defending seems more balanced with players avoiding getting caught off position and actually behaving like regular defenders instead of marauding savages who always charge to the ball.- Scouting in general seems a lot better.- Match reporting is a huge upgrade. I can't understand how people are neglecting this so easily. Pre and post match reports are way more detailed now, with heatmaps too!- Some people reported that their team plays the same regardless the tactic. This is not the case at all. I have a control based 4-3-2-1 and a counter attacking 4-4-1-1. My team is very responsive to the tactic switches, and perform/play significantly different when switched to the other tactic.- Social feed is a nice touch, even though it seems to be not fully developed.Cons:- There are a lot of groundbreaking updates that SI seems to be ignoring every year. They need to go through some of those and actually implement a few.- Same texts for press conferences, player interactions. These are getting old real fast. Need to have new options/interactions here. Would be better to interact with players regarding tactics etc.- Injuries... still devastating. - AI isn't the brightest. During my Champions League 3rd Qual Round match, Monaco didn't even bother to close down my players when we were holding a narrow 1 goal lead at the end of the game, while my players casually wasted time in the middle of the pitch.Overall: With yearly releases this is pretty much what you gonna get. Is it a massive upgrade compared to 2016? No.Is it better than 2016? Yes.Am I enjoying it? Yes.Would I recommend it? Yes. "

												Another life-long fan of the series, but this incarnation seems really awful.  1) Wins the league with Arsenal for the first time in many years.  Reaches Champion's League final.  Ozil immediately demands transfer.2) Easily wins league, reaches Champion's League final for 2nd year in a row.  Bellerin and Icardi (both of whom list Arsenal as their favourite club) demand to leave.  Impossible to keep either of them.  When I try to keep Bellerin entire squad demands that I let him go.3) 4th season Griezman, Renato Sanchez and Mustafi all demand transfers to bigger clubs.  Currently we are first in the league, and on course for a Champion's League final.  Note: It infuriates the players when I suggest that a bigger contract might make them want to stay.  Where is the logic?Also, after a five game losing streak we turn it around and are winning 2-1 away from home.  A number of players on the team are complacent.  wtf?I like the challenge, we all do.  What we like even more is logic.  This is the least realistic version of CM/FM ever.			"

												Social Media Simulation.More interviews. More E-Mails. More Twitter.The main new features (Social Feed, and FaceGEN) are half-cooked. Social feed is attrocious. What the hell were they thinking? You get a positive, a neutral and a negative 'tweet' for everything you do. It doesn't get boring. It's boring from the get go.FaceGEN, while a cool idea, is executed awfully. You'll see your manager pic everywhere. There's no escaping it, unless you disable the feature from the get go. Even then, you still have to choose some horrific images. Not only this, but the regen images are awful. Seriously awful. Most of my youth products are bald or have demonic eyes.The general game idea is the same. The first few years are cool. Then the imbalanced regens appear and the AI appear to be clueless on how to build a team. I respect this is difficult, but they need to spend more time on AI and the actual tactical aspect on the game rather messing around with gimmicky features (In-game twitter).The lack of updates is annoying too. Unable to drag and drop players bug is a killer. Uninstalled. Playing FM2016. No regrets. "

												I have been playing either CM or FM for over 20 years.  This is the first review of a product or game I have ever written.This is the first time the game has beat me.  I literally have no idea what I am doing wrong or how to fix the slumps my team's encounter. I can go from being on a 12 game unbeaten run, to a 12 game losing streak. I appreciate I must be doing something wrong, but the game is horrendous at offering any sort of constructive feedback.  Generic Assistant Manager suggestions such as 'I suggest we adopt a shorter passing game' or words to that effect, are useless and often counter productive. I have spent hours in forums reading up on tactics, listening to podcasts, all to no avail.  Over the last 20 years this game has provided me with a fantastic way of wasting my time.  It has increasingly however become a greater and greater source of frustration.  It is a shame, but with great regret this will be the last edition I buy or play.  I'm done. Never thought I would say that. "

Posted: November 23, 2016
												Will this be my last one?Football manager 2017 review, (this review is based of the base price of the game and improvability, sry for my bad english in advance )I have bought all the FM titles since FM 2007 and i have a fair bit of experience playing this game. I have spent hours after hours trying to work out the best possible strategies etc and it has been very interesting and a fun journey through all these years. FM has always been a very addicting and difficult game to master and still is to this day. There is no better feeling than winning the premiership or any sort of cups you have been trying win for years but have never managed to take the final step up. But why will this be my last title?PositivesThe most important factor in this game, improvability. In this years title there has been quite a few new improvements. Social timeline (social media tab) – a very nice improvement to the game, this adds alot of immersion towards playing the game and it feels better getting that needed win against your main rival or you sign a new player, and seeing the sosial medias reaction to it. But after a few games this might seem a bit repetitive and you will soon start seeing the same posts popping up again. This is definently a nice step forward and needs a bit of improvement. Crispier graphics – They have improved the graphics a bit during matches and the players are more clear and just looks better. (the way they, shoot, pass, drible etc) Big signings – I have noticed that teams like city, utd, Real, etc signs big players for stupid high values, which is just like in real life and again, that makes the game alot more challenging and immersive. Taking a picture for yourselves the manager – thats a very nice addon for players that want to have an option to do so.  These are some of the main features in this game i have noticed so far after playing about a 100 hours. Ofc there are alot more improvements to the game but they are significantly smaller than these once i have listed and it would take ages to write this review if i were to add them. NegativesLets start of with something i have always wanted them to do something about, but they never have.Press conferences – press conferences is huge part of real life football. But why do i still see the exact same questions since fm 12, this is a joke and needs to be improved. Most people just send their assitants including me because of the lack of variaty in the press conferences.Match engine – No improvements towards the match engine so far, and has been the same since fm 14 and 15. Same sort of goals beeing scored most of the time. An example can be crosses, why is it that your team just cannot defend crosses, why is crosses beeing scored this often, in pretty much every single match i play, there is always a cross goal. Completely no marking, even though your team instructions is put on structured and tight marking. This leads to another flaw in the match engine. Which is team instructions, try and put your instructions to play out of defence, and take a look at how many times your goalkeeper is going to kick the ball up completely ignoring your instruction (this is just an example) Or all the times your team, shoots it from outside the box when they are told to work the ball in to the box. This is the biggest flaw with the game in my opinion so far and they never seem to fix this. Player moral – this has been in the game since the early fm days. And it is completely broken, you could be winning the premiership with maybe 10 points and have full control. And then you unluckily loose at home to a premiership mid team which is normal. And you would be thinking we could bounce back even stronger in the next game despite the teams horrible performance in the previous game. But thats not the case, the moral is going to decrease significantly, making the players completey useless despite their huge lead in the league, and this will often result in a bad run. A bad run can last for a couple of games, and that just makes the moral worse until you can fianlly talk to your team saying we need to step up, boosting the moral again. And you can only do this when you are below your expactation in the league, so lets just say, you have a huge lead in the league, but towards the end you start loosing alot of games and teams behind start to catch up, having a team meeting will cause the moral to go down, despite their terrible form because of their league position. Unhappiness –,Another thing is that you can not talk to your own players when they are unhappy, that is the biggest load of bull and there is need for a much better system around that.  Players get unhappy for stupid reasons, mostly first team football, even if you have a player who has played most of your games he will still complain. And then he goes to complain to his teammates which brakes the moral even more… I will continue to update this review as time goes on, these are just some of the few things ive experienced so far with this game. For a experinced player who is looking to buy the new game i can’t recommend it in this state, just keep your old one and be happy about it. For a newer player however, it might be worth a shot, since its basically the same as all the previous fms. (If you put fm 2012 up aginst fm 2017 theres not a big differnce at all, which is shocking btw)This will most likely be my last fm title if they dont sort things out soon. (Mind boggeling that they charge full price for this game) If anyone disagrees on something i would love to hear it :)(extra note, regens is broken, all regens which spawns turns in to physical beasts, which litteraly can win a boxing tournament...)

Posted: November 27, 2016
												This game is a huge disappointment. Apart from the fact that absolutelly nothing important changed since last year, things that used to bother me in FM 2016 became even worse. Let me give you a few examples: (NOTE: Of course, the examples i am going to provide do not apply in absolutelly every game, but i can safely guarantee it happens in most of them)1. Goalkeepers - A few unbelievable mistakes goalkeepers used to make in FM 2016 are nothing compared to those they make now, GKs are unable to defend even the simplest shots, those going straight into them are reflected into their own net more often than not.2. Late goals - No matter what you do, you won't be able to defend in 99% of occasions. Your best bet is to try and score as many goals as you can before 75th minute, because your team will just stop playing afterwards.3. Defense - Positioning in both defence (mostly your center backs) and attack (your full backs) is terrible. No matter how specific your instructions are, it won't matter. More often than not, i notice my full backs instructed to cross from deep and always stay wider lurking on the edge of opposition area as if they were inverted wing backs. Needless to say, my Inside Forwards that are supposed to sit narrower often go wider than Wingers in those occasions, making the time i used to carefully design my tactics be all in vain. 4. Tactics - I already gave an example above, but there's a lot more to it. First thing i want to mention is the defensive line. If you keep it higher, through balls will always find their way behind your defense and there will always be a dangerous opposition attacker with HUGE anticipation, off the ball and acceleration that DOESN't go above 10 that will overrun your entire 15+ acceleration defenders (yes, even that one that is on a cover duty), go one on one against your best-in-the-league goalkeeper and use his composure that is barely there and his finishing that makes you believe he is a defense player to score without a single problem. If he's in a good mood, he will probably entertain the fans and round the keeper because why not. If you keep defensive line lower, no problem - They would just start shooting from impossible distances and those balls would just end up as the most beautiful goals ever scored or they would hit your defender on the way and end up as own goals. If nothing happens, there's always your goalkeeper to finish the job by being hit in the back after a rebound from the crossbar or simply push the ball inside. Second problem is, long story short, whatever you do, whichever mentality you choose, final outcome won't change. Say, you lead 2 - 0, last 20 minutes of the game - If you choose to defend, keep the ball, play careful as much as you can in order to limit the number of attacks they can make or you decide to keep playing attacking football like you did so far because you believe attack is the best defence as they can't attack you if you attack them, it doesn't really matter. In first case, it's as if the game is instructed to teach you a lesson because you retreated too much so early in the game, while in second case it's like: ""Oh well, you kept attacking, left too much space for their counter attacks, and you paid for it."" Also, there's a third option: In case you manage to balance the first two options and you don't allow them to attack almost at all, there's always a chance one of your players would get a red card, make a penalty out of nowhere or you will concede from a set pieces because there's some opposition player just standing there in the middle of your box without being guarded by any of your players. There are probably a few things i forgot to mention, but all this is enough to make me start hating this game. During previous years version, i went easy on all these things that used to bug me because i understand this is a game and those matches are scripted, there has to be ups and downs during your season, it's not easy to make it realistic and balance everything. However, now i simply believe this game is designed to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and make you play it simply because you are annoyed at how powerless you are, not because you enjoy playing it. Hell, i even caught myself laughing after some games cus of how unrealistic they were.The only improvement i see this year is that you can actually buy some players for a reasonable amount, unlike last year where you had to spend a fortune to get a proper backup player.

												Pretty much an FM16 re-skin, no changes to tactics etc.I've played 700 odd hours but I play that every single year on FM without fail, however if I'd have known this was just gonna be FM16 with Brexit added I'd sink 700 more into FM16.Good game if you've never played FM16			"

												Is it better than 2016? Not at all and I didn't recommend 2016. In fact, I can import my old tactics and graphics. This literally means they changed next to nothing in regards to tactics and graphics. Nothing added in this year’s version justifies this as a new version, it is nothing more than a few small changes, a couple new screens and a database update. I have a 7 years’ study of the request threads they post on the SI forums and complied a list of the top 20 most requested things people wish to see. Guess how many of the top 5 requests they have accomplished in the past 7 years? Zero. This literally means they are not listening to the customers at all anymore. Manager avatars/on the touch line was not even in the top 100.Just to put it out there since I know people will ask me, the #1 most requested thing in FM is a new and overhauled transfer system.Am I going to play this game a lot? Yeah, because like I said every year before this one, there is no alternative but it does not mean I will recommend this to anyone nor does it mean I cannot expect more of an update to the game than purely cosmetic rubbish.

												Simply not good enough. Ice skating players on the match engine and terrible goalkeepers kill all immersion, and the gameplay is a weird mix of over the top simulation about every aspect of football imaginable, combined with the players on the pitch utterly ignoring everything you do.This is akin to using a spreadsheet that doesn't work - throroughly unenjoyable. Football Manager lost the magic a long time ago, and this edition doesn't bring it back. It needs a complete rework from the ground up at this point.			"

												Love the Fm series but this is just getting old now. Barely anthing has changed in the engine, dumb social media page with same 3 responses repeated, ton of goals still come from crosses, goalkeepers are either awful or insane, fullbacks rack up insane amount of assists. Same thing as last year sadly.			"

												As a long time fan of the series and SI, having played their CM games and all of the FM titles, I have to be honest and share a summary review that truly represents a feeling of disapointment I have as well as most of the long time fans.FM is obviously the best football simulationg game, it has incredibly features overall. But speaking about FM17... You might as well keep playing FM16. I bought and I honestly feel that if things next year don't improve A LOT this was the last one. A lot of things can be said about the game but I'll just focus some major aspects:1) The match engine hasn't improved at all. AI is still glitchy, I cannot understand how 1 year after we still get the same poor experience in terms of realism. ""Added motion control movements to players""... this ins't FIFA, the goal should be achieving greater match realism/experience. Movement of players is clunky and it's almost as if your tactical decisions mean nothing... Your opponent can have a lone striker and paly defensively, you focus on that player, mark him, close him down, build a powerful scheme... And yet he scores a hat-trick! Say again?You can play and dominate a game agains your opponent with 70% ball possession, 30 shots on goal, etc... and yet you're opponent who only shoots 3 times, scores all those times and you lose the match 1-3?You can have games between two top league tables that end with results such as 7-6.... 5-0... Absolutely ridiculous. And these are just a couple of examples.2) The social feed... This new feature adds zero to the game. What was the purpose of spending time doing this? You always get a couple positive and a couple negative comments. It will not affect your decision making at all... Just useless.3) SI should've improved the realism in contract/transfer negotiations by now... This has been addressed by fans for a long time. Agents demand unrealistic bonuses that can largely surpass the bonus for the player itself and be similar to the value of the transfer. Also they get impatient and unless you give them what you want the deal burns and you can't speak to them again. This isn't ""Football Agent Manager 17""... It's absurd the amount of failed negotiations because of their unrealistic demands.Another ongoing issue... You can try and sell your top players but you'll never get a huge offer, involving loads of millions for them, even if it's fair. On the other hand if you want to buy one such player you always have to burn trough all your fortune... It's realistic that a team demands a huge amount from you for a star player. It just isn't that you can't get those same teams to do the same for YOUR star player...4) Player moral is still uncontrollable and glitchy... If you manage and you do it right your team will have a superb moral, but nowadays it just seems that the moral depends solely on winning matches or giving a lot of playing time to some player. This is a simulator and it should be about providing optimal training conditions, decent contracts, superb team management, among all the other conditions you need to keep a smooth level of moral amongst the squad. How long before the improvement of the Team talks (should be able to do with anytime with pertinent dialogue)? Why is it that if you fine or warn a player because he's been ejected with a red card 3, 4, 5 times in 9 or 10 matches he thinks it's unfair, causes havoc in the dressing room and demands to leave? For the love of god... get it straight guys, that's not how it goes in real life...I could go on forever. The essential is that not only didn't the game improve from last year's... But also it seems the most absurd and irritating issues persist year after year. SI has an incredible team and a great working force. I know they are more than capable of doing better. This is a game that relies heavily on loyalty players and I honestly thinks their major concerns are being ignored...Still the best football managing game. But, for now, stick with the '16 version.

												Same old game with a slightly different skin.Here are some positives and negatives in no particular order.Positives:Some quality of life improvements.Better presentation.Scanning your face in to the game is fun.Slightly better graphics and some new camera angles.The game seems harder this year, but that could be the game cheating you... who knows? It's very hard to tell what you are doing wrong when it's not going your way.Players (match engine) finally learned to pass rather than shoot on tight angles... sometimes.Negatives:Incredibly slow menus compared to last years version.Saving the game nearly takes 30 seconds.The match engine is pretty poor:Insane amount of deflected goals.In fact, the amount of deflections happening inside the box in general is insane.Great goalkeepers not saving shots straight at them. Marking on set pieces is buggy, with defenders swapping position with strikers after the corner/free kick is taken.Marking in general seems buggy, with defenders sometimes just ignoring the striker until he has the ball.Six players on the same team (including the keeper) attacking the same ball on a long throw in.Strikers are mostly ball watching when you don't have the ball, allowing the opposing defenders to easily close down clearences and recycle possesion.Doesn't seem to be much difference between a 2 and a half star sttriker and a 4 star striker, if he is on your team.Same goes for goalkeepers.Midfielders and defensive midfielders rarely get good ratings (unless they score or assist), so it's impossible to tell if they are doing a good job. You have to dive deep and analyse each match to find that out.The referee blows the final whistle when you are in attacking positions.They rarely patch the game, despite there being pretty obvious issues. Instead they wait months before releasing a patch.Watching scouting highlights seems pretty pointless.Social media feed was funny at the start, but becomes as tiresome as press conferences and interviews.Same old questions and answers when being interviewed. Do relationships with other managers matter?There is always one or two players complaining about training, and your assistant manager doesn't care (that is if you have the♥♥♥♥♥ man taking care of individual training).I've been in the Premiere League with York City for 6-7 season with 12.000 capacity stadium with no options to expand or build a new stadium.The regen faces this year are hideous.More often than not, the odds seem stacked against you.Conclusion:I still like the game, but I wouldn't really recommend it. The last three versions of FM have been pretty similar if you ask me. I got my moneys worth out of all of them, but also a lot of frustration.This years version might be the worst of them, or it could be that I just started noticing all the faults in the game this time...Although I don't recommend this version, I will still play it and I will most likely pick up the next version. Let's hope it's better.			"

												At £34.99 it is way over priced. The game is exactly the same as last year except of a few graphical updates, fixes and switching the layout around. It is still the best football manager game but its not changed much in the last 3 years (in my opinion). Even Fifa has new features. I would only get this FM if someone is buying it for you as present, i would'nt bother wasting your money when it is no different to FM 16.			"

												23 years. Started off with the 3.5' disk on CM and saw its demise until i migrated over to FM. It was great coupled with endless hours of addiction and joy. Data has always been the team strength as the guys in FM were mostly from CM in the past. Great user interface with year on year minor tweaks; typical of this company. From a teenager to a family man, Championship Manager and FM has always been a part of my life. But this 2017 edition tops the trash bin. Its a rubbish. Given the resources and the expertise developed over the years, the match engine is no better than an amateur who started off programming. UI is not optimised and worse of all, it is no better than FM 2016. Bottom line is, i thought i loaded a wrong game as it has 90% similarity to FM 2016! I honestly do not know how one can manage to give a good review unless they are paid for to rave things up. Overall, except for the updates to the player and club database, i will give it a miss. Match engine, i suggest you go for commentary as it only serves to make your blood boil. Damage, go buy other games. Verdict: Drop it.			"

												wow, this is shockingly bad, I cant even be arsed to write a full review. I have played every FM since CM days and this is just..well... I have no words.. What the HELL do SI spend 11 months of the year doing? because you cant kid me into thinking this took that long to develop. Its a 2016 patch AT BEST!!! it's almost criminal TBF. The new features are terrible and clutterd. The whole thing in the last two years has gone backwards. The problem is they have no compeition and have a mononoply over sporting rights. What they need is competition as they are cleary getting comfortable and now reducing operating costs by producing RUBBISH.			"

												I have played FM since the very first CM game in the 90's.  Always thought they were great games and have never had a bad word to say until now.I have give the last few versions a miss as they were basically transfer updates in my opinion.  However, I thought I would buy this one as an upgrade and check it out.  I wish I had not bothered.  The tactics don't seem to translate to what happens on the pitch.  Goalkeepers might as well be ghosts.  Your defenders will pass to the other team's forwards, whilst the other teams defenders will be rock solid.  So inconsistent - I played a game as Liverpool against Man UTD and beat them 3-1, then played Spurs and got beat 9-0 in the next game!!! Same tactics, similar team.  They scored 5 in a 3 minute spell.  I am all for not winning every game (would be too easy otherwise), but that was just unrealistic.  Stick to the older versions this one is a waste of money.			"

												TL:DR: This game gets worse every year, do not bother buying if you are an experienced player.I have been playing every version of this game since 2008, with a decreasing level of enjoyment every year. This game contains most of the bugs from 2016 and older versions, while adding new, even worse bugs.I pre-ordered this game and got to try it in its beta-state. As one could expect from a game in beta it had a lot of issues, with most of the ""bugs"" being gone once the full game dropped. One of the most glaring issues I noticed during the beta was that my defenders simply would not mark the players I assigned them to mark. This was a frustrating issue in 2016 already but this time it was on a whole new level. My players would initially stand on the wrong side of the player they were supposed to mark, meaning the (un)marked player could simply run towards my goal, get a pass and score. Not only this, but once the (un)marked player actually got the ball and ran towards my goal, my defender would jog (F*CKING JOG) like 3 meters behind him without even trying to catch him.""No problem"", I thought. ""This will get fixed once the finished version drops"". I went on the Sports Interactive forums and voiced my concerns with this ""bug"", only to be told by Sports Interactive employees that this issue was due to my players having low attributes on ""concentration"" and ""marking"" and what have you. I was pretty shocked, as I have never in my entire life seen a defender defend so poorly in a real game of football. Are the developers actually this clueless or will this be fixed when the game drops?Fast forward to today, a few weeks after release. The ""bug"", which isn't even a bug by their logic, is still present in the game.I could go on and on about other issues with this game, but most of them have likely been covered by others, and the issue that I mentioned is the one that breaks the game for me. As I stated in the beginning, I have played every version of this game since 2008, and I have watched it continually get worse. It is such a shame that a game that is so good outside of the match engine, has such a poor match engine. I told myself before playing the 2017 version that if this version is not better than 2016 it will be the last Football Manager game I purchase, and it increasingly looks like that will indeed be the case.

												My review is not for the new players. I wrote this for the people who played FM for years.I have been playing FM since the FM 2008. I really like the concept and i played 2016 almost for 500 hours. But today is the day that i understood, i had enough of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Seriously, every year they add very little changes to the game and i bought them and played them with joy. But this year, my patience ran out. There are several reasons for why i will quit the fm games from now on. But i don't have much time right now. So i will tell you about only the biggest one : THE STUPIDITY OF THE AI... I might edit my review in the future and tell about the other ones as well but i am not sure if i will.I will not be writing about the ai's stupidity out of the pitch. Because like i said i don't have much time right now, and the stupidity out of the pitch is not really a reason to quit this beatiful concept. But on the other hand, the ai's idiocy in the pitch is annoying. For an example, your team uses a corner, and almost all of your players are inside the penalty area, trying to get the ball in. But you left one or two players in the centre circle to avoid any counter attacks. Your player used the corner, and the opposite team sent away the ball, towards the centre circle. And the ball is coming towards your players which were left to stop a counter attack. And if your players just walk towards the ball, they will have it easily. But they don't! They just wait for an opposite to get the ball. And then they start to press him! What a wonderful move! This is just a beatiful example of the cleverness of the ai... That was just one example. But there are lots of them. And the main problem is, this kind of errors were in the game for years... They didn't fix them with a patch. They didn't improve them in the next year's games... I love football manager... I really love picking my favourite team and creating my own squad. Playin against big fellas like Mourinho and Pep... But i will quit this. Because i really don't think that they will ever improve their game. We play the same game for years now. They don't add anything important, and the vital point is they don't even fix their problems...			"

TL;DR - Its better than FM16, not groundbreaking, but its good. 8/10*This is a BETA review, I will continue to update this review as I get further into the game. -Football Manager 2017. Well where do I start? Honestly I was a little apprehensive when even considering purchasing it, simply because I've been disappointed by the lack of innovation or progression by the past versions, namely 2014 and 2015. Soo did this version manage to finally meet expectations? Yes.Okay, aside from the standard database updates, there are quite a few things to note about the new series.Overlay:I for one can say that this new overlay of FM17, definitely looks significantly crisper and cleaner than its predecessors. The simple white background looks significantly better than the cluttered and messy overlay used in the previous generations. Definitely a plus point. Also glad they kept the layout of the buttons, though it took time to get used to in the past, it is definitely more streamlined and organised than those of the 2011 and 2012 versions.Match Engine:Okay I know the video that SI posted up looked as though there was absolutely no difference whatsoever in the 3D engine, however rest assured, it is definitely far from it. The movement does look smoother, and yes I do agree the AI is definitely smarter as well (though wish they could be even smarter, sometimes stupid things still happen). Couple of new moves and celebrations have been added, but nothing overall groundbreaking. Just a nicer feel to the overall gameplay experience. Manager Creator (Designing):Well this one is a nice touch, but it lacks features, significantly. It's a nice idea, but that's about it. Simple a nice idea. That hasn't been executed that well. Lack of options to customise the character is disappointing. Seems to have no choice in some cases. Personally I think this is a totally pointless feature. But maybe it's still beta soo for all I know maybe there will be more options on full release. Press Conference:Same old story. Nothing much to say here. Just some new questions and more ways to answer. Nothing much. (Still gonna skip most press conference unless its a big match). BREXIT:Well well who would have thought SI would include this in the game? BIG BIG PLUS POINT. Absolutely love it, it makes things more realistic. Though it runs on the presumption of the regulations that may be put in place its a nice idea. I like it. But it be nice to have an option to disable it for those that don't want it. Nice touch, I like! Transfer System:I like the new input of the way in which the agent can speak with you in terms of promises to the player that will be transfered. This gives you greater freedom to see what the player himself wants from joining your club. Also gives you a good idea if you will be able to accomodate him hence further impact on your decision to purchase him. Thumbs up!Staff:Okay, soo many of us heard SI banging on about the introduction of ""Sport Scientist"" etc as staff members, now personally i've left the recruitment side of it to my board members. Hence nothing much to comment about there, though I have signed MANY sport scientists apparently. Anyways, what delights me more is the scouting regime that is in placed. My scouts pick up significantly more players than ever before, finding many and giving much more indepth analysis. Training:Well here's the touchy subject. Many people often complain that their team has too many injuries and claim it is the game's problem. Well infact, it's not. If you explored deeper into the game mechanics, you will realise that the way inwhich you do your training (team) affects their overall fitness. Next up the individual trainining regimes you put players on, also affect it as well! If you overwork your player, there is a significantly higher chance of them getting injured! Training is actually quite fun to set up, soo on my part I recommend actually attempting to control the training and not leave it all to your 'Assistant Manager'.Overall Summary: Tbc			"

												First, let's just say that I was hoping to see some improvement in this game series since the last time I bought one in 2011. I was surprised - not really at the improvement part, but instead at how extremely well the artificial idiotism works. Yes, that's right. I said idiotism, not intelligence.Here are few of the problems I have spotted so far:- Goalkeepers. They have two main actions; either skate crazily and catch the ball firmly, or try a miracle save when an easy low ball comes straight at him. Very clever to try that miracle jump into the top right corner, when the ball is actually going low into the middle of the goal. Absolutely stupid actions there.- Defensive playing. There is no proper pressing or tackling, no matter what the tactical setup is. Defensive players approach the attacking player like they were absolutely terrified of the ball, cowering in fear two meters away and letting the opposing player pass the ball away freely and safely. If a random tackle ever happens, it's usually two-footed and results in a direct red card.- Headers in midfield. If your goalkeeper or defenders open up with a high ball into anywhere within the mid-half of the pitch, your players never even try to win those balls. They apparently have absolutely no jumping strength at all, while the opposition players look like kangaroos out there. To be absolutely honest though, most of the time your midfielders run 5 meters off the ball's actual landing spot and as such never even need to show that lack of jumping strenght. They just like to watch the opponent picking up a free ball, from a safe distance of course.- Strikers and headers. Even a target man who should be regularly winning headers and trying to either hold the ball or flick it to the other striker or attacking midfielder never seems to even try. In the team I played with, I had a very strong target type striker, who should be stronger with head than foot. And what does he do with high passes? Stand still, usually in the right place though, but firmly rooted to ground, while the opposing team's tiniest-midfielder-ever jumps way over him and heads the ball into safety every time.- Receiving passes. Why on earth does the receiving player have to stand absolutely still until the pass comes all the way to him? Let's say that Player A passes the ball to Player B. Player C is the opposition defender. When Player A sends the pass, Player C immediately sees the chance to intercept and starts moving. However, Player B does not react at all; he stands still, waiting for the ball, until Player C has successfully intercepted the pass and is already starting the counter attack with his whole team, while your team doesn't even understand that there's any danger at all. If Player C can see the possibility to intercept, why doesn't Player B see that and try to get to the ball as well instead of just ""giving it away""?- Picking up loose balls, such as rebounds. Midfielder runs to the ball, takes control of it, and... well, simply stands with it long enough for an opposition player to freely take it away. Generally, there's a huge amount of just standing and letting the other team take a freebie, and within highlights, it's always the AI controlled team who gets these freebies....such as a midfielder getting a pass just outside of the penalty box, standing like there he's grown roots, back towards the goal, with two opposing players curiously staring at him and wondering why he has suddenly started to meditate instead of trying to pass the ball anywhere. Finally, opposing players just take the ball and pass it safely away from the area. If this happens for example near the sidelines, your midfielder will stand still for a long time even after the ball has been taken away, and then sprint into chase. Into a hopeless chase, as the opposing player is already 30 meters ahead.- Another version with loose balls: Your player is 10 meters from the ball, running towards it. Opposing player is 15 meter from the ball, also running towards it. Which one wins? Yes, it's always the opposing player who wins and takes a freebie, as your player is afraid of any close proximity of others and slows down well in advance to avoid it.Seriously? This is the level of AI that has been considered good enough for release?In short: Match engine in general is a f'ing disaster. It makes absolutely no sense. Any FM or CM series game before 2010 was much better, so do not waste your money on this piece of crap.Edit: Fixed a few typos.			"

												FM16 glitzed up, getting fed up of them adding stuff that is basically irellevant just to justify a new release when a patch would have done.That and my best player is unhappy before I've even completed a training session because I wouldn't sell him way below his value. Players constantly unhappy is half the battle with this game these days and it's not enjoyable.As a massive fan of the series, had every one since about 93/94 season and games like soccer boss before that, just strip it back a bit and stop ripping people off every year.

												SEGA said they are working on to add Chinese support so I may change this review later based on the progress.As a player originally from China, I just want to give everyone not from China a simple explanation why this year so many Chinese buyers just give FM negative reviews because of lack of Chinese version.The several top reviews somehow are right, SI never includes the Chinese in the game and the store page never said there will be a Chinese version. But this already last for about 10 years. Chinese buyers never do anything like this year.Why? Because Chinese customer not only wants to give the negative review for the lack of Chinese version but also the attitude the SI showing. So in 2011 some people asking if there will be a Chinese version from SI, Mile Jacobson replied that they need 20k copy sold in China ( https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/128969002398646274 ) (P.S.: before this link found, he even deny he said that... Come on ). In 2016, from steamspy, there are 40000 copys sold in China( 5th in the world). So some one aksing SI again, then Mile Jacobson just repled like this ( https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/791659905933533184 ). Read his reply, do you think SI really care about customers???? Of course people from other countries may not need to struggle with this as they already have official language support. But what if you have other opinions for the game? Do you think the developer will listen to you? And for many Chinese customers using 200 RMB to buy a game is not a small cost, but they were encouraged by the 20k promise so there are a lot of people just got the games. But right now SI just made them extremely disappointed.			"

												Easily the clunkiest, buggiest, biggest JOKE of a manager game that this company has ever produced.Quite how it has gradually got worse year on year is beyond me. Boy oh boy do we need a knight in shining armor to come and create a rival manager game because SI are complacant as ♥♥♥♥ year after year, churning out this tripe knowing that it will sell regardless.Well at least this year it's fans have had enough, at least according to the reviews. Here's hoping SI take note and hang their heads in shame.			"

												Football manager is a solid game but i like many others feel conned at forking out full price every year for what essentially feels nothing more than a patch. Tee 3D engine has a slight improvement on last years but still looks like a fifa game from 15 years ago. The twitter feed has a short lived novelty value but adds nothing to the playing experience and you simply stop looking at it after a few games. The match interviews don't feel much different. The only good new feature is the pre-negotiations in contracts but its no where near enough to justify paying the full price for. If you are reading this then i assume you have not bought it yet so i will sum it up for you here. Football manager 2016 + £35 in your pocket is way better than football manager 2017. Its not a bad game, its just the same game and horrendously overpriced for what you are getting.			"

All this money pumped by the community and you can't even ship proper names for the teams. Brazil, Spain are ♥♥♥♥ed. Thank God the community saved our game.

Same questions and answers which get boring quickly.Played FM for years, last year I had spent over 2200 hours on FM 16..Ñever wrote a review until now..

												Haven't bought Football Manager since 2013. I made a decision to never waste money on it again back then, as I simply didn't like the repetitive and frustrating direction the gameplay was being taken. The amount of injuries on FM games, regardless what training routine you use, is preposterous and should have been fixed years ago. Here I am again in 2016, still reporting that very problem. A problem that has plagued this franchise from day one. Playing the Beta version of 2017, it's the same old story. Players acting like children, injuries that kill any attempt you make at being successful. (They are relentless and unforgiving). Inexcusable. I can only assume the makers are taking the p*ss.The tactics I find, are useless. I've tried at least five different formations and all have the same problem. Nothing happens but 'INCONSISTENCY'. Star players can't hit a barn door. (Try being Spurs manager - Kane won't score for me, Everyone gets injured all the time. It's a mess. An awful experience. A waste of electricity). Neither can the players ever sort their attitude out. As Juventus manager, I had to turn it off by October. Another awful, problematic squad, that wouldn't perform and were constantly injured.You are bombarded with problems that detract from actual 'fun gameplay'. My players come across as whiney, spiteful creatures, who will do nothing for the shirt for very long. They can't be praised, because they then underperform. If you don't praise them, they underperform. (Wonderful!!! Lots of fun to be had here I see!).The team talks are an assault on my Chi. It doesn't matter what you say, or what tone you say it, INCONSISTENCY and players underperforming is the result. Results and match events, are a continuous slap in the face, making you ask 'what did I say wrong now!???'. Every team talk and press conference is a lottery. What you think is a common sense statement, is actually a trick to ruin your team cohesion. This game is awful. It's actually been developed to make you feel harassed at something you love doing. It can't even be called a 'simulation', because the injuries and the behaviour of the players, is totally unrealistic and contrived to frustrate you.In-game tactical instructions are limited and do NOTHING. You can spend hours trying to figure out what role to give a player and never get it right. Say something the game doesn't like, (99% of what you are given as a choice, ends up in disaster) and your whole squad will collapse. It's totally hit and miss. Fiddle all you like if that's your thing, but you are either getting sacked, or the players will lose faith, or you will switch it off, because at that point, you will realise that you hate your life, that you wasted time on this game's BS and the fact you've wasted all that money on it again.So my question is: What is this 'game'? A virtual reconstruction of what my hell would be like? When did 'games' become a bloody hindrance?You also have that lame old problem, of players complaining about lack of play time, disrupting the squad, even though they've been playing. One minute they are playing well, (the only one in your team mind), then they complain for no reason and you've lost their form all season from that point too. You still can't tell players they are a disgrace and will never play for the club again. They just keep spiting you somehow and you can't do anything about it apart from fine them after a few warnings. (Warnings which do nothing). Anything sets them off. This game makes you feel like putting everyone on the transfer list and breaking your laptop. Every time I press 'continue', it hits me with another slap in the face. It's so convoluted and utterly infuriating nowadays, what's the point of this 'game' anymore? It has no point. It has ruined what everybody loved about football management games and churned out this totally unsatisfying rubbish year after year. But hey, as long as the facia is a bit different, they'll get away with charging you another forty quid. Never again. Never again. This time the bridge will never be rebuilt.			"

												The problem with steam reviews is that there is no middle ground, either things are a positive or a negative. While I want to  give this game a positive review, I know my feelings for it are more neutral so I have to give it a negative review instead. The reason I have this urge is because I love the football manager series, sinking in 1000+ hours each year to Sports Interactive's football management game. I love the series like no other and each year I've seen improvements to all aspects of the game, but not so much in FM2017. There is a lot of positive things to say about the game. The graphics have improved on last year, there is a lot more varied animations, there's a lot of new ways to interact with players off the pitch, there's the addition of a social media feed which can be entertaining if you give them a read, and the most positive part, is that it's still the same old football manager game I know and love. However, none of that matters. You wll have players requesting transfers for not qualifying for the champions league if you miss out on it in the league but win the europa league. The players who leave will wonder why you've not let them go for half of their value. You will struggle to sell many of your players, and when you try and bid for opposing team players don't even try to negotiate because anything less than 100m is an insult. While many teams in real life think agents rip them off wait until they see the agent fees in football manager! And if you don't pay the agent fees, say goodbye to negotiating with that player until the next window. If the player wanted the move but negotiations collapsed because of the agents the player won't sack their agent, they will instead carry on with the same agent with low morale because of the collapsed move. The engine is still full of problems, and while i don't see losing 3-1 when your opponent has 3 shots and you have 30+ a problem like other people (that's football sometimes) I think that there are a lot of improvements to be made. Keepers make more mistakes than they should, the players don't react realistically and rarely do you ever see players making clever runs. There's never much of a need to adapt, you will find a tactic that works for your team, stick with it, go on a massive winning run and the opposition won't change their tactics or force you to change yours. There are loads more problems and you only need to look at forums to see long lists of issues. To me though, it feels more like a game than a simulation, and games can be exploited in different ways that simulations can't. If I was to recommend this game to anyone, it would be to new football manager players, it's a lot more streamlined than it used to be and much easier to figure out. However if you're a long term football manager player, think wisely before you make the purchase because you will recognise some of the same problems from past versions which still haven't been addressed.

												For a game that only does small tweaks each year, the price is ridiculous. How much is FM17 better than FM12? I have no idea. The ME essentially stayed the same, and 3D has been a joke all the way, even for the price of FM12 (25 USD I think), and I still don't know which tactic system is actually better. All the new features and improvements are not about the football part of the game. Don't tell me about the so-called ME and AI improvement. It basically means AI will stop doing some stupid things while picking up some other stupid things to do. Sadly SI just keeps harvesting money out of our addiction LOL.			"

												I have been playing Football Manager since 2007 (handeld and full game) and this is by far the worst one I have bought, even worse than 2008 which was the worst one for me. I am doing a career with Bournemouth and I obviously understand that I am not going to win every game 5-0. BUT every game is the same no matter what tactics I use or whether its against Man U or Sunderland.  My team has majority possesion, 15 shots on target, 3 clear cut chances the other team will have 3 shots on target and I draw 1-1 or even worse lose. I understand this happens very rarely in real life but on this game it happens 9 out of 10. Sometimes the other team has only 1 shot on target and I will lose which is so annoying. AND  no matter what tactics I use my team shoots from outside the box, my strikers will literally go through on goal 1 on 1 and shoot from outside the box????????????? It is not realistic at all, Liverpool, Chelsea and Man City all finish mid-table? It is terrible, really terrible. AND to make it even worse they charge £30+??? for what??? As far as i can tell there have been no real upgrades to the game that deserve that. Truly pathetic from Sports Interactive and unless I read that there have been major improvements in the next one you have lost a 10 year long customer. BUY FM14 instead.			"

												I highly recommend to not buy this game...  been a pro and long time supporter of these games since cm97/98 and FM17 is the 3rd worst game in the series number one being CM4 and number two being FM16.FM17 is just a prettier version of FM16 with new added features still the same broken game engine and mechanics.  Mac users as well will not benefit with FM17 as the game runs poorly due to a poorly optimized game with in the game menu, to 2D Classic to 3D match engine.  only solution in fixing this issue for macbook pro users is turning off retina support but enjoying a pixellated game ranging from the menus to the game engines.  And the only response from SI about this matter is ""the engine has been improved"".  improved as in broken where FM15 and FM16 ran flawlessly for mac users.And you cant get a refund as by the time you weighed all your options and work arounds which are non existant, ur passed the expiration time.A NO BUY, SPECIALLY FOR MAC USERS.

												In FM16 I enjoyed a decent amount of success, took small clubs up to the bigger leagues etc, in FM17 I'm lucky if I don't concede 4 goals in the first half of a game. Maybe it's just me but, for all the steps SI took in fixing the match engine's broken crosses from last year, it feels like they've taken several steps back in the defensive aspect of the game and also how effective player instructions are.

												So, I am one of the fans that buys the game each year no matter what, but I am not biased. This is only the beta version (the full release will be launched in 4th November) . First Impressions:1.  There is more information than ever, which is easy to access in the panels. Before and after each game you receive a report from your analyst in which you can find every information about the opponent. Yes, in the editions before you could only have a report about the next opponent, but not one after the match. Now, in FM 17 your analyst will compile a summary of the match after it's finished and you can see what went good / wrong. This saves you time of analysing each stat after a game. In my opinion this is one of the most powerful features of FM 17.2. The game runs on 64-bits if you have a 64-bit OS and CPU. This is great because you can feel how fast and responsive the game is. 3. This might be a minor change / addition, but the new skin (the green one) is excellent. Easy on the eye, easy to read and pleasant even at night. 4. I've played about 20-30 games so far and I can really say that this match engine is good. No more overpowered crosses to the back / near post. No more unmarked fullbacks and ultra-concentrated game in the middle. I tried 4-5 different tactics (4-4-2 diamond narrow, 4-4-2 flat, 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 wide and a strikerless one). Each of these tactics worked as you would expect it too. 5. Scouting not has a new option when you want to get information about a new player (Scout until full knowledge). Not a big deal, but it's a welcome addition.6. The pre-season takes longer then before because you recieve more information and therefor, you access more information. Also, signing a player take a tidy bit longer because of the negociations and so is when offering a new contract to one of your players (in most cases). Comparison to FM 15 and 16.When FM 16 came out I was very excited because I loved the interface, the responsiveness of the game, even the way the font popped out on the background itself. In short, I loved it. The problem was in the match engine and I have to say that it was the biggest dissapointment I ever had in FM. The opponent was defending so narrow that it would leave acres of space down the flanks so your fullbacks were always unmarked. It was almost pointless to play an AMC because you would NEVER take advantage if his creativity since he will 90% of the situations just pass it down the flanks where were your unmarked fullbacks. The second issue was the overpowered crosses.  Because of these 2 big problems I felt compelled to revert back to FM15 (which I loved). Now, FM 17 looks even better than FM16 and the match engine is very good (given the fact that it's only a beta). By the way, I haven't seen any major or big bugs in the game so far. FM15 was a very good edition which provided great functionality, a more than decent match engine, but it felt a bit laggy overall.Things that I think need improving in FM17.1. The player models in 3D on the pitch and the ball itself need some tweaking, minor touches. The ball looks a bit too bright and the player's jerseys seem a bit unclear if you use a distant camera (elevated).2. The colors in Football Manager Light Skin need serious improvement. It has very bad contrast in every aspect. However, the dark skin and the new one (green) look very good. Honestly, I am trying hard to think of ""bad things"" in FM17. After the backlash they got for FM16 match engine, the developers corrected their mistakes big time and they added a lot of new things upon that. Regarding the match engine, I think the progression has stalled because of the setback in FM16, but the good news is that now it's playable and really enjoyable. I hope you find this review useful.

												For the past thounds of hours in this series(I mean literally more than 2000hrs), you can see they made a few patches here and there. however, maybe because there is no real competitive /rival game in the market, a lot of crucial things stay unchanged. For example, the tactic switch from attack to defense or vice versa had never been introduced. As I did in the past 2 version, the tactic German used in world cup is quite powerful, normally gave me more than 5 goals per match, while   you could not move 1 of the AM player into midfield to fill the empty when you lose the ball control. Till now, A typical 433 attack 442 defend is still not achievable , while PES could do it years ago. I haven't mentioned the crappy game engine, in 2017, you could still see the classic mistake for the final defender walk like 80s to a ball 2 meters away, while the attacker easily grab the loose ball and scores. The keeper just stone still. He can speak, speak the same English as the defender, and clearly see the fast approaching attacker, and yet for more than 3 second, he did nothing but just let the defender slowly walk to the ball and lose it. Ridiculous.			"

												I played this game during free weekend and I'm not surprised why this game has negative reviews.FM2017 is basically FM2016 with updated database & interface. The match sometimes still doesn't make sense, with 20 shot attempts, 10 shots on target, 1 goal, while opposition also have 1 goal but from only 1 shot on target. Weird, isn't it? Your best striker constantly missing clear chances. Your defenders let opposition player chase the ball instead of chase it themselves and this often results in your team conceding goal. The 3D graphics is still terrible, even PS2 has better graphics & better player movement. Imo this game should just be an expansion pack priced around 10 dollars or less instead of a full priced game.Do you know what will make FM good again? A competition. This genre once had several good games like Championship Manager, FIFA Manager, and LMA manager. Sadly those games don't have newer version, making FM doesn't have competitor and SI release database update yearly with price like a new game. Seriously, this needs to be stopped.			"

												Well, first off, I'm going to say that I do not intend to hate on this game what so ever, I'm just hoping someone from Sports Interactive reads this and figures out what's wrong with the game..PROS :- Good animations- Intelligent reporters- Social media (to an extent, it is good, but gets boring very quickly)- Great tactics feautureAnd that's literraly it..CONS : - AI moves around like it's having a stroke most of the time- Goalkeepers are absolutely terrible- Way too many yellow and red cards, even thought you've set your players to hold back- Clear cut chances are broken, some games it'll never ever go in, some games the goalkeeper decides he's gonna ave' a day off- Too repetitiveYup, it's basically a copy and paste of FM16 with some minor tweaks with the animations.PLAYED ON :Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6GHz16GB RAM + 1TB HDD + 256GB SSD17.3"" Full HD LED displayNVIDIA GeForce GTX980M 4GBWIFI + Windows 10 64bit			"

												Ive always been an FM fan but this installment is terrible !Once again the game engine is broken like it was in FM16 ... Its a lazy installment with nothing new that impacts the way the game plays  ! I feel fooled by that idiot editor that brought out a 30 minute video explaining why this one is ""so good"" ... Its not and we were all fooled i couldnt not reccommend this game any more than i do right now ... and it further pains me that you cant get a refund because it takes longer than 2 hours to get to a game or to get a true opinion on the game therefore steam wont give you a refund for it... but the game is a broken shambles..1. Social Media is awful .. gives you a positive tweet a negative tweet and a neutral tweet every single time so you learn nothing and it doesnt impact on how the game is played or any of your decisions.If they spent a year sorting that addition out then they massively failed it looks and feels lazy and boring ... underwhelming !2. Match Engine hasnt changed at all its still awful and looks exactly like FM16 .. they still Ice Skate and shoot from the corner flag instead of crossing.3.Forget your tactics nothing will work ! We all know anything can happen in football so when a dodgy scoreline happens you just have to let it go but when you take this into a full season where you beat the top 4 no problem and lose to everybody else you realise that thats still the same broken engine as it was in FM16 . why am i beating chelsea 4-0 and then losing to Burnley home and away 6-0 ? It doesnt work ... go counter attack .. say something to your players .. no matter it doesnt work .. not one time did anything happen or any reflection of my tactics on the field at any time but the only consistency was that you beat the top 4 and lose to most of the rest with a few draws in there4. This is linked with number 3 but in the past 2 for me ive had to go on holiday for the first season because the game does everything it possibly can to get you the sack in your first season ... i just had one with Newcastle and lost 12 out of 16 games against what are minnows in comparison in this division but its the same whatever team you pick .. You have to try and survive the first season just so you can have number 3 in place where you only beat the top teams haha its a joke5. Unrealistic Stupid AI for transfers -  Like always i have to spend £180 million pounds for a player  of any worth but if anyone wants my player they want him for £5 million less than hes worth and expect me to pay half his wages haha ... the classics are the ok 15 yr olds that clubs want £90 million for them ... stupid and pathetic 6.AI performance - sometimes its not just you ... ive received screnshot after screenshot from my mates saying are you experiencing the same as me ... After 20 games or so .. Liverpool, Man City and Everton in the bottom 5 and Burnley etc second hahaha ... On my brothers who has had to uninstall because of how nrealistic it is , Mourinho,Klopp,Guardiola and Wenger got the sack after the first season haha I mean how can that broken♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t be defended ?7. Opposition scoring millions of goals .. your strikers couldnt score in a brothel for example i was at Newcastle .. Mitrovic went 15 games without a goal when everything i did was aimed at attacking ... the only goals i scored was random ones from Shelvey etc but no strikers .. i get the sack he then scores an average 2 goals per game until the end of the season ... now i was thinking maybe it was just a glitch and its just mitrovic or maybe i just messed up ... nope every team i try this same thing happens where the strikers just dont score and i have to rely on midfield to do so ... struggle to get into double figures for them everPapered over cracks and fooled everyone ... A couple of new screens but its mostly updated stats/transfers that you paid for and cosmetic reasons with the picture ... but i wouldnt worry because it makes no difference because youll never beat a minnow again on this broken game where absolutely nothing affects your decisions or how you play the game SHAMBOLIC			"

												Football Manager series is not going in the right direction if you ask me.The only good improvement in 2017 is the quicker load / reaction speed.All other improvements are to minor to even mention.2018 hast to be something better than 2017, otherwise people wont buy the game anymore i think.

Apart from that it contains the good old ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from last year like pulling players down from corner kicks to give away pens and constant injuries. I can see why the reviews is mostly negative.

Product received for free
												Well, there ARE new things in the game as far as management goes: -Some new lines from the media (but still poor)-slightly revamped interface (not really new, since this is done every year)-new staff roles (analyst/ sport scientist), which I find cool-Stats are actually explained (woohoo, took us some time to get there, didn't it?)-Overall more info is given about the game through the help system, which new players will appreacite. I remember the first time I picked FM up (and dropped it shortly after before coming back) the game was very confusing and seemed like a vast amount of information that you need to get familliar with and don't understand anything at first. This IS important for new players, as it is important that people understand how to play this game.  Otherwise they won't bother, because it is rather difficult, not least because it used to be very confusing at times. But, of course, for those who have several thousand hours on FM, it is of no use.-social feed, which I know many people love (it is amusing, but, as pretty much everything else, it suffers from the lack of diversity i.e. it gets repetitive and the creative resource gets exhausted quickly).-The way you receive pretty much all your informtion in the game has been slightly altered. You've got a breakdown on every aspect of the club and status of the players in a box, which is presented to you by various staff members, like your assistant for example, for time to time (as per your instructions, apparently). Inside in the very same box, you've got the ability to apply the advice given by the staff member, individually or wholly using the ""apply all"" button. If you don't like to manage the club yourself, now managing the club is easier than ever before. The game sort of holds your hand through the staff members of your club to  a much bigger extent than in the previous versions of the game. The process of managing the players has become more streamlined. Not really helpful for myself, though.-Finally, there are more options for analysis, which is always great.As for the match engine...Well I have noticed four differences between '17 and '16 versions:- the pre-match activity of the players (as in the description, but it is very brief and, once again, REPETITIVE).-the vanishing aka ""magic"" spray is finally at the referee's disposal (this game finds it hard to follow the latest trends in the real life, doesn't it?)-it is now possible to view the match from behind the goal and corner spots.-the interactive billboards are now electronic (oh yeah, we got there!) and show genuine ads (like advertising beats by Dre - I am not kidding!). So they not only advertise their stuff anymore (I mean content made by SI and harmless social advertising related to football, with a little bit of SEGA every here and there), but they endorse products and services for which they are paid, therefore engaging in economic activity. Not a big deal, but I find it gross, especially given how expensive their game became. There should be a way to turn this off in the settings, imho.That's pretty much it. The range of motion of the AI involved in the game has become a tiny bit wider, but no new animations were spotted by me. I always check both high profile matches and very low divisions in hopes of finding somethnig exciting. Not this time!I want to say the match engine remained largely the same as last year, but I can't...because the ME remained EXACTLY the same as last year.All in all I do not recommend this game for its full price. While it is discounted, those who want to pick this franchise for the first time and those coming from FM 2015 and earlier can get a good deal. Why I don't recommend this game?Because THERE IS NO FRIGGIN' REASON WHY THE CHANGES WE GOT IN THIS VERSION COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED EARLIER, IN FM 2016 FOR EXAMPLE! Some of these changes are long overdue and should have been made somewhat earlier. With that, the game still holds its flaws, some of which come from 7 years ago. Only now you are NOT able to see how skilled a player is with his feet without doing some scouting. I always found it weird how you know right off the bat a player's preferred foot and how strong his weaker foot is even if you know nothing at all about the player. There is no reason why things like these can't be fixed and polished in one big batch (or a patch?) in a SINGLE iteration of FM. SI nowadays is like Apple - plan two years in advance, but release only planned ""innovations"" in portions as small as possible.FM definitely needs a competitor in the market. The slackers at SI are not so poor anymore after charging €55 for their football version of COD, so there is no excuse for them now.  Not worth the 55 quid. I, myself, am not buying this game and sticking with FM 2016, which is good in my opinion. FM 2017 is not good or bad compared with FM 2016, but that is the point - why even bother? Yes, the changes are nice, I liked some of them, but I guess i'll be getting them with FM 2018 along with other new stuff (if there will be any).			"

												I should've listened to the game reviews and not purchase the game.This game's tactic engine is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to the point where nothing you do is actually applied to the pitch. Player attributes don't make much sense, since a striker with 16 finishing can miss an empty goal from 5 yards.Worst game on steam this year, and worst Football Manager ever?*I get what people say in the comments. Here's an update.*--------Edit: One last update in a few short sentences.*I managed Porsmouth for 5 seasons and then moved up to Spurs. Here's my takeaway. GOD FORBID you're leading against a stronger oponnent in FM 2017, because the match is going to last as long as it f*cking takes for the engine to make sure you lose. From 80th to 93rd minute, you'll actually spend 8 minutes in gametime and watch your team gets painfully crushed, chance by chance, and of course, lose the game. However, when you're the favorite (talking about matches with Spurs against weaker oppositions), and say the match is draw after 60-70 mins, time flys by! I mean, the second half could f*cking finish in 1 minute! You're lucky if you get 1 chance at winning the match. This does not always happen of course, but you'd be surprised how often.----------Edit: That was what I took from the first 5-6 hours in gametime. I continued to play the game, mainly because I bought it and didn't want my money to go to waste. Here are few more thoughts.One of the things that pisses me off, is when you get into stoppage time, no matter where you are, the referee doesn't allow you to finish up the attack. It happened a few times, my team was crossing or doing a very promising counter attack (or was even in front of the goal) in the opposition's half, and the referee stops the game at exactly 92:00 mins.Hot prospects are really annoying as well. They like to get on loan because they're missing first-squad football, but what FM didn't get into account, is that when I list them on loan, or offer them to clubs, nobody freaking wants them! And what do they do? These 17 and 18-year olds get angry, their morale drops to the floor and they don't want to re-sign a new contract with my club. So, how is the manager's fault that they are not yet good enough, and not even a Vanarama National team wants them for their first-team squad?			"

												I didnt check reviews before purchasing the game. So I am glad if you didnt do the same mistake.Do not buy this game. *Your midfielders are always going to shoot from distance, no matter how many times you tell them not to.*Every cross goes to the goal. *Strikers are useless, always shooting outside. (or the ball hits the bar from the inner side, then hits the ground and somehow goes outside) *Strikers get depressed because of long runs without scoring. (doesnt seem like their fault)*8/10 of all goals are scored from range. (they obviously watched too much payet and pogba while developing the game)It is depressing that the team plays exactly how you want them to. But they are totally unable to score. 25 shots, 3 on target in my last match. It is depressing to watch that in every match. And sometimes it goes totally unbalanced and 3 goals just happen in 3 minutes.I think I'll go back to FM 15 and never going to buy a game before reading reviews again.			"

												The game looks like it's been designed by a group of people who have nothing in common with real football. Just a bunch of programmers who insert some scripts into the game, which lead to random actions from your players. For example, a world class player in your team will make some stupid, beginner, personal errors, at a certain number of games. It does not matter how you train him, or that his stats are fantastic or that he costs 50 millions euros. At a certain number of games he will make some stupid mistakes: pass the ball to an opponent in front of goal, take a stupid red card, miss a series of golden opportunities.Some worldclass players have low stats compared to real life, others are ridiculously better that in the first season of real life. For those of us who like these types of football manager games, we buy it because its the best option, but that does not mean its good.After the successes of past years, Football Manager got its monopoly on the genre market and now they are making sub-par editions, because we are foolish enough to buy them anyway. Please don't make the mistake I did in buying this game.			"

Buggy, awful match engine, unrealistic and it feels like matches are decided by the game before you even kick off regardless of tactics form etc. SI have got lazy and really need to rethink it. Poor, poor game by the standards they had begun to set a few years ago. Not worth the purchase price whatsoever.			"

												Oh my god these negative reviews!Here's a summary of them for you:1) No Chinese!2) It's just FM 2016 with a new skin!3) I suck at the game!4) It crashes!Before I go any further, let me remind you at this point in time everyone is playing the BETA version of the game. There will be crashes, there will be bugs. Most of them will probably be fixed on release day. If these bugs are what is putting you off buying, then hold off until release and check back then.With that out of the way:You have to approach the FM series like you would FIFA: Each year is an evolution, not a revolution.Except, where FIFA upgrades their graphics each year to make it look shiny and new, most of FM's improvements come under the hood. The match engine, even in the beta, is a distinct improvement over last year's, with fullbacks no longer dominating match ratings and awards. If you want the football simulator with the most realistic match engine, this is it.Is the game worth the purchase price? Well that depends on how much you're paying and how much value you want for that price. If you're outside the UK and don't want to hedge your bets on a Steam refund, I strongly suggest shopping around online for the best price in pounds, and buying that way. The exchange rates are favourable for pretty much everyone else. I bought it for 29.99 GBP, which converted to NZ$52 including exchange fees, a saving of 42% over the standard Steam price of NZ$89.99 in New Zealand.I've already clocked up over 50 hours, so that's a dollar an hour, and that will only get better.Bottom line: If you are looking for a good football sim, have about 30 GBP of local currency to spend, and don't speak only chinese (you're reading this so that's not an issue), then buy this game.

												Terrible, unrealistic match engine. Hardcore fans don't buy this FM until this major, game breaking bug is fixed.4-4-2/4-4-1-1 in this version is completely broken as wingers/wide midfielders mindlessly stay far too wide defensively and you can't keep a proper defensive shape no matter what mentality, shape, TIs, PIs, OIs you use. They never move infield to help centrally. They refuse to help centrally even if the opposition overloads the central areas. Currently the wingers/wide midfielders are hard-coded to behave like this which is completely unrealistic. There are several threads on the SI forum with several examples:https://community.sigames.com/topic/381957-wingers-too-wide/#comment-10480754https://community.sigames.com/topic/388134-wingers-doesnt-track-backclose-down-opponent-near-him/https://community.sigames.com/topic/388226-how-to-get-wide-midfielders-defending-centrally-in-a-4-4-24-4-1-1/https://community.sigames.com/topic/386503-football-manager-2017-official-feedback-thread/?do=findComment&comment=10535803https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/5cdbsp/match_engine_bug_wingerswm_too_wide_4424411_broken/ "

Player prices have no meaning since you have to pay even up to 100 times more than what's being advertised. Huge let down.			"

												As a longtime player of Football Manager and Championship Manager before it I have grown increasingly frustrated at the direction the series has been taking. A game called Football Manager should be first and foremost about football, yet every year all the time and effort seems to have been spent on dealing with player contracts and the media. I'm not saying these shouldn't be in the game, but they should be low priority. This year sees the introduction of a social feed, where you get to see tweets from your teams most clueless and repetitive fans, and a player promise system, which ruined game for me, but more on that later.Tactics, something I think should be a high priority, remain incredibly limited, with the ability to issue only vague instructions. There's no way to instruct your players to press hard immediately after losing the ball, but then fall back into formation, no way to tell a player to drift out to both wings like Alan Ball did in the '66 Wold Cup, no way to tell your right winger to cross early and our left winger to look for the overlap. The team width instruction I find baffling. Am I setting up my width for when my team have the ball, or when they don't? I definately don't want the same width instruction for both scenarios, and I can't think of a team which do. Coaching is equally simplistic and vague. Previous versions of the game, going back a fair few years, allowed much more nuanced instructions. Bring back the arrows!Now the promise system. Five of my players became unhappy, because I hadn't kept my promise to strengthe the squad. This suprised me because 1. I had strengthened the squad, and 2. I never promised to strengthen the squad. It's possible that the team's previous manager had made that promise to them, but I did not. Having five players unhappy at me, for something I didn't do, has caused me to give up on this game. What I hoped for is that the games existing mechanics would be improved. What the devs did is leave them unchanged and introduce new mechanics which don't even work well. I imagine if the devs for this game were to make Christmas dinner they'd spend all their time preparing sprouts, chuck a turkey in the oven as an afterthought, and not bother with roast potatoes at all. Not for the first time Football Manager has left me disappointed.			"

												Decided to post a review since the game certainly doesn't deserve the ""mostly negative"" rating.Most of the negative reviews are from butthurt chinese users complaining about the lack of a chinese version even tough the language isn't listed on the supported languages list available on this store page. Others are people complaining about having too much injuries.The game is good, pretty much the same as last year. The interface is neater, post match analysis are clearer than before. The conversations with the journalists, players, board of director are exactly the same as last year, but it's far from the most important aspect of the game so it's alright.If you aren't a chinese who doesn't speak english and happen to like football or just management games you cant go wrong going for it.Edit: Why the hate on my profile dumbass Loda/117? First of all i'm not chinese nor trying to be a hero (lol) so STFU. I don't follow devs or anyone on twitter, so i'm not aware of what has been said there (Here Cyric provided links to what has been said:BDW here is MJ's reply. LOL https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/791659905933533184Here is his 'promise' https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/128969002398646274,)  I look at the store page information to know what's already implemented in a game and some video on youtube. I'm just giving my opinion on the game. Not everyone need chinese language when purchasing the game, so I think the ""mostly negative"" review isn't representative of the game, except if you are chinese and don't understand english.			"

												Daniel Sturridge got injured while I loaded a new game, very realistic 10/10I do recommend this game, but I have reservations as well. Something I've noticed in my 900+ hours is how weak tactics are translated back to us. For example - when I first started playing, I was seeing the most absurd behaviour from my players; daft goalkeeping errors including ""hilarious"" own goals, ridiculous backpasses, stupid defensive howlers, players running head-first into opposition defenders to sloppily concede possession, incredible open-net misses, endlessly hitting the woodwork.. the list goes on. It actually feels very unfair; I would much prefer weak tactics to be blatantly obvious so that the uninitiated might clearly understand what needs fixed (or at least why it is going wrong). Sadly all you get as feedback is a load of old nonsense, the kinda things that real-world footballers just would NOT do, certainly not with such startling regularity.But rcently, since starting to use strong [proven] tactics, I've been seeing a very different game. Beautiful and organic ""pass and move"" football, regular screamers, up-and-coming youngsters terrorising defences with eery precociousness while I scream in delight (and pat myself in the back for having the balls to name that 17yr old against Chelsea like I never doubted his ability). I've won a few Bundesliga titles, Premier League, FIFA World Cup, UEFA European Championship, UEFA Champions League, Serie A TIM... the list goes on. I am absolutely loving it.So when you get your tactics right, be prepared to be enthralled with FM17. Get them wrong however, and you will be banging your head against your desk in brain-melting frustration.DO NOT MAKE PROMISES. If a contract negotiation lists any promises, simply use the ""remove and exclude from negotiations"" option for each one. The player nor the agent will care and will still accept the contract. If you add the promises (especially ""strengthen the coaching team/defence/midfield/attack"") you will fail no matter what. Players never notice even when you massively strengthen the area you promised them, and will come back to you complaining that you broke your promise. This can affect the entire squad and WILL ruin your game.AI Managers are idiots. They never make long-term plans for any club, and will just sign players almost arbitrarily, use up all available budget, put the club into debt if they can, and get the sack when it starts to go wrong. Also - I've never seen Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola last more than a season with Liverpool or City respectively, in more than 20 saves.One little quirk about FM that I've also noticed - players ALWAYS seem to score against their old clubs, whether that is against your club, or one of your players when you play his old club. I take advantage of this by intentionally playing players against their old clubs and it never fails to deliver; (as an example) I've had Danny Ings score 4 in a single match against Burnley and then not another goal all season until we play them again and he gets a hatrick.Players also seem to score their first goal for their club/of the season/ever against you. All goal droughts are ended when a human-controlled team comes to town. It happens too often to be coincidence. FM loves drama.PROS:Stupidly addictive. Sometimes I forget to feed my kids.A massive game with a mind-bending amount of players, staff, and teams to manage.Extremely rewarding when you get tactics right.It's the only football management game worth playing at the minute.CONS:Stupidly addictive. My kids are hungry.Players promises don't work and will ruin your game. You have been warned!Assistant manager in-match advice is akin to a parrot on your shoulder.Game feels very harsh and unfairly balanced if your tactics are weak.Far too much repetitive media.AI managers are stupid.Training needs a proper overhaul.Sensible score: 8/10, a few niggles hold it back from greatness.

												If you own a previous game keep playing that, there is not really anything in this game that makes it worth it. If you don't own any Football Manager games then it's an ok game, but be prepared for hundreds of bugs. Most are kinda small but annoying. SIgames  isn't giving any effort anymore. Their forum wich used to be good is horrible with mods who remove anything that is not praise. Miles Jacobsen, the boss, is the man who is ultimately the reason for the regression of the game. Everytime i hear him speak i'm reminded of the fact that he doesn't know jack about anything. Save yourself the money and buy a real game.			"

												Like many of the recent years' entries, one again another one arrives with some improvements, but core aspects of the game remain poor, if not outright broken at launch.As the same as in previous years, the goalkeeper AI is hideously unpredictable with a healthy dose of fumbling the ball either into his own net or in front of someone who instantly puts it in the net.  In addition, distribution from the goalkeeper is DIRE.  Far too many kicks go directly to opposition players who are standing in acres of free space.Defenders, AI is also poor, either that or tactics are not being recognised correctly.  No matter how much you tell them to close down, tackle hard, man mark... nope, you can guarantee that if the ball is crossed in from the wing or from any distance, it will land at the feet of the opposition striker who has NO ONE within 5-10 years, and he then skins them to score.Passing, also DIRE.  Either an issue with the engine or again poor AI/recognition of tactics.  Short passing and retaining possession for instance is irrelevant... the team will still try long balls and miss their supposed target by a country mile. Same thing as Goalkeepers basically.About the only one that works is strikers... they seem to get a realistic number of goals/assists, a goals to shots ratio.And also, there seems to be a heavy imbalance towards ""smaller"" teams to boost them against larger player teams.  Yes there's some ""cupsets"" that take place in the real world, but dominating performances seem non-existent.  Same effect seems to apply in the league games where a team that's got 3 wins out of 30 will suddenly destroy you 5-0 when you're at home.So yeah... as always, the game has launched with a sense of imbalance/bugs/brokenness that will probably not get fixed for 3 months.In short... after just over a week since early-access, I'm close to uninstalling it and this will definitely be the last version of Football Manager I buy.  The whole series has been a frustrating, broken mess since they brought in the 3D match engine.It's just not worth the effort now.  So, I'll be retiring at the end of the season.  Let someone else deal with this.			"

												Disregarding the weird reviews about no Chinese localization, can't see how anyone would be mad about this. Players make better decisions altogether and it seems like an actual football game for probably the first time since FM2012. Full-backs are no longer tragically overpowered, crosses can still be pretty potent but if you have a solid defense then they tend to not go brain-dead very often. UI is great, too.Only flaw right now that I'd really point out is that the requirements for a key pass are REALLY stringent. This is better than the past few versions where you'd have a right-back pumping out 300 key passes a season, but now you'll only have, like, 30 from your primary playmaker.			"

												The best FM yet. To those complaining about the injuries, (and I was one of them) I've followed some advice on how best to prepare my team for the new season, with training and workload. It appears to have helped a lot. But SI have also said they will look into this matter internally in case there is an issue. I think that's a win win. But injuries aside, apart from the usual beta bugs this is one heck of a great release. It's far better than any other version I've owned (13 onwards). Lots of new features, and much improved 3d match engine graphics in my opinion. Super fun. If I can get anywhere near the time I invested in FM16, which was over 2200 hours, I will be extremely happy.			"

												I've played the Football Manager games since FM2009 and have around 1000 hours dumped into it. Perhaps this is the reason I'm not so enthralled by the latest one. It's gotten to the point now where you can't see the wood for the trees when it comes to actual managment. Saying that, if you're a control freak bent on controlling every aspect of the club, you'll probaly enjoy it. Though it doesn't do anything different from FM2016 in that regard. If you just want some fun to wind down after work, I'd say look elsewhere. The match engine will drive you absolutely insane with the stupid things your players will do, some of the times you interact with players leaves them saying illogical and inconsistent things that can seep into the rest of your team and upset them and don't even get me started on how useless your backroom staff are...Sorry, but this game doesn't do it for me.

Goals often scored or conceded under 10' in a match. Opoosition scores a goal after a single shot on target. Opposition GK makes the best game of his life but still gets under 7 rating. Tactics don't really matter in a match. The game is design to cheat. Too many injuries during a match. I would suggest to people to STAY away fro this game. It's a waste of time and money.

												I've been a long term fan of the franchise, I've put over nearly 1600 hours in the last two titles. So buying this was a no brainer for me. But there are certain problems which make this game a non recommend for me.1. I think that FM17 is too much like FM16, the only major difference for me is the ""twitter"" feed from the supporters. Because of the small (and insignificant) differences between last years version and this one, I don't think I want to leave my save file from 16 behind. Which is not a good thing. FM16 did that, FM16 made me want to start my adventure all over again. 2. What is wrong with the goalkeepers? I've seen Neuer or Courtois just diving over easily catchable balls! SI said they would address this issue but I think they've accidentally made them worse! 3. There are certain problems with the press conferences which makes it impossible for me to create a good relationship with certain managers. I'll say something positive about Mourinho, he'll say something positive about me. But then the media (post-match) will invent something that was supposedly said, but was never actually said! This will cause Mourinho to be mad at me! I miss the days from FM11 where I could just talk about other managers instead of every journalist trying to make every manager in the league hate me!			"

Posted: November 8, 2016
												What could be a very good game is being ruined by a serious problem with the match engine, and that is defending. Whoever I play with the defence leak goals. Not simply with attacking set ups but with any set up. Attacking, balanced, defensive whatever the number of goals conceded are ridiculous. Every corner or cross results in a goal as the defence simply walk away from the attacking players leaving them a free header at goal, this is surely a glitch. This ruins the motivation I have for the game because no matter what tactics, player intrusctions, oposition instructions or training I try, the other team always win because although I dominate possession, shots and shots on target for the say 3 goals I score, the opposition will always have four shots on target and win 4-3. The fact I am clearly trying to fight a computer ruins my interest in the game because If the game has decided I won't be allowed to win, then it's an impossible task. So far I have only played with three teams on the game those being Leeds, Guiseley and Newcastle. I was tired of losing every match 6-5 or 5-4 or 8-0 with Leeds or Guiseley so I did a test save with Newcastle to see if it was my tactics that were awful or if the game really was screwing me over. Newcastle in the championship obviously should be an easy task. It was all going well until January top of the league 6 points clear then the defence started to leak a few goals and a few losses started creeping in. No matter, a simple dip in form. However, the last 10 games of the season saw the problem return, I lost all of the last 10 games of the season, with scorelines such as 7-0, 8-0, 5-4, 4-3, and I went from leading the championship by six points to finishing 4th, at which point I was sacked. So my point is quite clear. With the new features that I am sure you will hear about and probably see for yourself if you buy the game, Football Manager 2017 has the potential to be one of the best in the series. But until this defensive glitch and screw job mentality of the match engine is fixed, this game cannot be enjoyable and so at this time I cannot reccomend it.			"

												It's better than the previous edition. If you only buy for new features, don't buy this. If you buy for a free flowing game, the update, and some extra cosmetics - buy it. Tactics actually matter and if you compare matches between FM16 and FM17, the difference is stark - midfielders are not guaranteed to be the best on the pitch, tactics must be tweaked to work since crossing no longer can bang you in all the goals, keepers are more likely to make those easy saves - all good so far.It's a better FM, and those who still complain should have a look at their tactics rather than continue to whine. Also, as many have said but I'll reiterate - reviews are mixed because the Chinese whine when things are not delivered to them on a plate.			"

												I played this game during free weekend and I'm not surprised why this game has negative reviews.FM2017 is basically FM2016 with updated database & interface. The match sometimes still doesn't make sense, with 20 shot attempts, 10 shots on target, 1 goal, while opposition also have 1 goal but from only 1 shot on target. Weird, isn't it? Your best striker constantly missing clear chances. Your defenders let opposition player chase the ball instead of chase it themselves and this often results in your team conceding goal. The 3D graphics is still terrible, even PS2 has better graphics & better player movement. Imo this game should just be an expansion pack priced around 10 dollars or less instead of a full priced game.Do you know what will make FM good again? A competition. This genre once had several good games like Championship Manager, FIFA Manager, and LMA manager. Sadly those games don't have newer version, making FM doesn't have competitor and SI release database update yearly with price like a new game. Seriously, this needs to be stopped.			"

												Initial ImpressionsOne of the poorly designed match engine. 1. opposition score goals for fun. 2. Top class teams outclassed by minnows. 3. Not once but most of the times. 4. A low class striker can score hatrick within 10 mins. 5. All opposition teams will play like Barcelona with higher posession and shots on target. 6. And finally 30 yards goal from midfield who has long shot rating of 4!!!7. You should have 3 or 4 Tactics ina match to get a good result.Patched version of 2016. Nothing big to cheer about. 1. But on the brighter side, more realistic with transfers, training. 2. Match rating works like real time. Even when your team wins, players who played bad get bad rating. Now you know when to sub him.3. Social feeds looks good but eventualy boring as you progress.4. Might change after the 1st update.			"

												This is my first review but i think it's a necessary one.I'm supporting SI Games since CM4.I spent more time to this series comparing to any other genre.As of 2017 release i'm now %100 sure that they are lying about this so called ""1000000 new feature"" thing.They have the best database and that database is unrivaled,no other ""manager"" game can get that quality or no other big company trying to achive that.Football Manager is maybe the only game that has no single rival in it's genre.FIFA dominating the sales but there is at least a PES strong rival or weak one that's up to you but at least they are rivals.This game or 2016 or 2015 they are all the same we are in 2017 and the 3D stuff they added is worst then some 1 man powered indie studios.They didn't add a proper ""new"" future in years they are making this little fix and calling it a new feature and adding it to 100000000 new feature list.If a miracle happens and a passionate Football lover indie studio gets SI's database they can blow this already outdated game with forward thinking,truly new ideas.I wish other studio that tried to do a CM sequels were still in business and received a proper support/budget.

												I've been playing for several years now and there's just no change to the way the game plays. Essentially, it's incrementalism every single year. The social feed is pointless when it's all generated and the match engine looks pretty much like last years.  The AI is still not very good, especially when you start getting into the regens. It becomes laughable at times to play because the AI do not know how to build a team and set them up in a way to challenge you.  Still the same bugs every year and I can't even play it anymore because there are bug issues with loading. I'll stick to FM2016 until I see something better, which I doubt if their track record is any indication.			"

												I have played football manager since 2008 and this is a continuation of the terrible match engine in 2016 that made me stop at the demo then. I appreciate the social feed but even that is not as detailed as the press conferences and unrealistic. I will start with the bad reviews.1. I bought Icardi at Arsenal for about 40m pounds and the social feed had the exact same reaction to buying Correa for 13, no real football fan would be mad at their club for buying Icardi and also when he scores a hattrick in a match and wins player of the game, the reaction is similar to when he scores 1 goal and wins it, some doubters and some believers. No one irl will doubt the effectiveness of a hattrick hero in game.2. I take 15 shots and get only 3 on target, Even Sanchez misses clear cut chances regularly, Sanchez 17 apps: 4 goals and 4 assists, shooting well below 30% and missing most shots on target. Lots of players miss seemingly easy sitters too. Then AI gets 1 shot and 1 goal, in games when I have more shots on target, the AI's keeper turns into a Neuer but Cech rarely steps up when needed.3. Strikers and Wingers cannot shine simultaneously, Icardi is beasting but at the cost of Sanchez and Ozil being next to useless.4. Small teams pose huger threats than imagined and my world class team feels unequipped to handle league 2 teams or at least as equipped as they are against smaller PL teams. I believe irl, a team like Barcelona can take some teams easily with little to no guidance from their coach, same cannot be said for FM where I cannot trust my players to deal with puny teams as my players never hit the target and end up being susceptible to counter attacks5. Using strictly control without aggressive attacking mentality not enough to shut off counter attack moves and defense always makes sloppy errors opponents never make (Koscielny leaving a striker wide open to join Mustafi and Bellerin who already have an attacker covered).6. Team performance based on attributes not comparable to AI, ref: Sanchez finishing of 16/20 but missing almost every sitter he has. Bellerin pace 20 still running comparably to much slower counterparts (not much to present a huge issue though) (But I wish it reflected real life where Bellerin's pace and ability to track back is his biggest asset)7. Transfers are one-sided, I had to pay well over the odds for Icardi but I could not offload Giroud for his market value, seems like every time I try to sell, I always get lowballed with no negotiating power.8. (Good review) Acquiring young popular talent is a bit more realistic and I cannot just build a future juggernaut team for 30m like in the past games.9. Not enough tactical fluidity and players end up being rigid, always plays down the wing and when I go up against defenders strong in the air, I lose. Even when I try to exploit the center and Ozil, the ball always gets to the wing and the overlapping full back- wing back combo is overplayed and most games are decided by the wingers and never the CAM.10. ""Our engine has fewer injuries than real life"", yeah yeah, but when my players always get injured on clockwork, it becomes iffy, once Sanchez comes back, Cazorla and Mustafi go, and one time, I simmed through the same international break like 5 times before I was able to get a scenario without an injury...gosh. And the training injuries are a lot. Maybe they tried to be realistic but I didn't appreciate Cech getting injured for 3 months since irl the last time that happened was in 2014 and before that was in 2007 but it happened in less than a month of my being in charge. Maybe it is realistic but I dunno, the injuries for me aren't a dealbreaker, the match engine especially with the SOT and clear cut chances missed are my biggest issue.All in all, I feel like returning this game but I probably won't, just gonna hope SI fixes the game and get my dreams broken and buy fm18 because FM has no competition and no reason to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together.

												This isnt much different from any of the previous Football Manager games, and to be completely honest this review focuses more on the general issues of the game. The best summary of this game is that it merely gives you the illusion that your decisions and tactics are having an impact on the outcome of not only the game, but anything at all. A loophole within the game that involves saving the game before any match, and before the final whistle simply using Task Manager to close FM and then opening again at the point where you saved. This has allowed me to experiment with the mechanics of the game, altering my pre-match comments which only accurately represent the drama and controversy of Jose Mourinho's press conferences and no other manager. Also altering my tactics and even completely changing my team and also the morale (which can easily be boosted and lowered through simple interactions which rarely occur in real life). An example of a ridiculous interaction is that praising a player for playing well in a match can result in the player completely disagreeing with you and going from good morale to poor morale. No player is that sensitive - these are adults and FM treats them like they have the maturity of 7 year olds, anyway. So after altering a variety of things, i rentered the same match, and 9 out of 10 times i would receive the same result, often with similar patterns, e.g. comebacks, penatlies, red cards etc. This exposed to me how scripted this game is and how whatever i do i cannot beat the algorthms that dictate the game. One example is the 'get stuck in' instruction, this basically results in your oppostion receiving a penalty ever other game and your team receiving a red card eveyr 3 or 4 games. Yes this accuately represents real life football and that aggressive tackling can lead to these occurances, but the issue is the uniformity of the occurances and how 'fixed' the mechanics are. Another major issue is transfers, the value of players is so random, on occasions you have players like Juan Mata being sold for £105m and at other times players with values at around £15m are being sold for £3-4m due to transfer requests. The only thing FM does right with transfers is young high potential players which are valued almost perfectly, which brings me to ask, why can't they make a similiar system for the rest of players? Minor issues such as when players promises are broken such as not strengethening a certain position can have such massive effects on the whole club which just kills the realism of the whole game. There are so many other issues within this game that i could rant about but i dont have all week, this review has felt almost like therapy.FM17 however is still a decent game, compared to alternatives such as FIFA's Career Mode the detail is incomparable. But this doesen't excuse the game from its flaws and predictable game engine. Also we're paying £50 for this game but there isnt player faces or badges, seriously?! If your really thick and don't really notice that season after season your just following the same patterns then this game is perfect, but for you seasoned gamers this game is easily figured out after about 100 hours. But you would have probably got your money's worth by that point.  "

Have requested a refund as i can't be bothered to find a solution to such poorly made game. Plus nothing much has changed on here and for them to charge £35 is a joke. Money Grabbers!!

												Been playing this series for a little while and this is by far the worst FM I've ever played. I guess tactics, and having a dominant team means nothing. 65% Possesion most games with over 10 shots on goal, yet I lose countless times in the 90th minute to a much worse team with there very first shot on goal! WTF happened this series used to be so addicting, now it's just garbage. Fix your game SI please.			"

												This game is officially stale.Nothing changes. The big issues remain year after year, and parts of the game are so insanely tedious. My biggest complaint is that the media is still so boring and yet so time consuming. My second biggest issue is that the level of interaction with the squad is still very very shallow. Players complain if you meet with them too frequently, but in real life this happens every day or 2. You can't gauge from the players what is going on, or what they think, and sometimes a response you give is completely the opposite tone of what you intended. It completely ruins immersion and makes the game much less fun to play.I don't care about the 3D engine, I don't care about graphics. I want the game to be fun, and the only thing you talk about improving every version is the 3D match engine. I don't care about it. It adds literally nothing, and feels like a ploy to get FIFA players into the game, but adds absoutely nothing to the game itself. 0 added value. Nothing. Nada.Who can blame the devs though, we still give them our money every year, even after saying we won't. Of course they will get lazy, they don't have to innovate to earn customers, so we are as to blame as anyone else is.I've been playing since Championship Manager Italia, the game where Juergen Kohler would get 9.8/10 every game. Back then I would find an excuse to press Continue just one more time. Unfortunately, the series has been getting worse and worse for the last few iterations, and has lost the fun it used to have. I now boot it up once in a while, play for an hour and then after getting fed up of 5 useless press interviews and other pointless screens, I then exit. It's a pity.Sorry SI, this will be the last time I buy it an FM game until there are big changes.			"

TL:DR If you're a new player, wait for a sale. If you're a returning player from FM14/15/16, this isn't worth full price, maybe at a steep discount or if you're really dedicated to the new features (upgraded transfers, In-Game Editor, better keepers, AI Fantasy Draft), otherwise I'd avoid.Keep in mind, this is the full game with In-Game Editor enabled, not the ""Touch"" version, which is included in the price. Also, excuse any grammar or spelling issues.Football Manager 2017 is a hard one. It combines my love for the sport, as well as taking a step into the feet of a manager, who's always under pressure from their board, media and his players. FM is the leader of this genre, and I love it. However, I've been playing this franchise since FM14, and with every edition, I've put between 100-250 hours into every title. Looking at the differences between FM16 (or even 14/15) and FM17, I see no reason to pick this up for 55€, unless, like me, you're really dedicated to the new features/changes that comes with this new edition.+ Excellent menu design compared to FM16, which was quite complex compared to 17, which has been majorly improved to see more in the same menu;+ Updated players database;+ Steam Workshop integration is, as always, a more than welcome addition, and in some cases, even necessary (lack of licenses, shown below);+ In-Game Editor has been revamped to add an availability to get or send players out with a loan, to bind a transfer fee to players instead of sending them out with a free transfer;+ Keepers have been given an upgrade, with more saves and more movements, instead of being a sand bag standing in their goal. Now they can actually do something;+ Better loading times (between matches, creating or loading a new game);+ Upgraded main menu (your manager is now universal, you can use it in every game mode and it's really easy to use, you can even get a 3D model of your face!);+ Fantasy Draft is no longer only against human players, but you can also include AI!;= Licensing issues in several competitions (changed or shortened off club names (A. Madrid instead of Atletico Madrid, no logo's), thanks EA;= The Editor (not In-Game) still lacks explanation for new users;= Press conferences are still really bland, and lack depth, I always hand them over to my assistant manager, just because it's always the same. Thankfully, that option is there, as well as an option to turn them off in the Editor;- The price-to-features ratio is idiotic. 55€ for a revamped FM16 with a couple of new or changed features, for the majority of the people playing on older versions, this is NOT worth the money;- Still lots of bugs in the match engine (in the Instant Result menu, there's a bug in the IR feature which causes the assistant manager to place players all over the place (for example, strikers as defenders, while I've clearly set them up as strikers, wth?);- Input from users/gamers to SI have known to be worthless, they implement some new features, but by far not all of them.This game falls under two categories:If you are a new player or haven't picked this title up for some years: then this could be worth it. I would hold off for  sale if I were you, unless you're desperate to play some FM, and believe me, it's good, it's just not worth the full price they're asking. 30-35€ would be much more reasonable.If you are a returning player and you own/have played FM12 or up: then this is not worth the upgrade/55€ they're asking. It has some new features, but it's like CoD, it's almost the same thing every year, except for some small upgrades/changes that usally end up pretty good. However, if you own FM14/15/16, I would wait another year, unless you're dedicated to the new features or updated playerbase.For now, I'd give this a ""mixed"", but since that's not available, for this price, I am giving this one a thumbs down.Final conclusionA: Must have;B: Great game, worth it, either with or without a discount;C: It's an OK title, I would only recommend this if it's discounted;D: Not worth it, unless it's majorly discounted;E: Terrible title/not finished/broken, do not pick this title up under any circumstances;F: Early Access, usual caveats/warnings apply;			"

												A must buy for the Manager fan's under us. That said, u will find the usual issues that the game has for over years now that are still not solved. If u can look past this, this still is the best manager out there.For the newcomer, buy FM16 first for cheap and try that... liking that one? wait for a sale and then buy FM17 becuase in my opinion it's not worth the 55,- euro *(be smart don't buy on steam at all ! saved me 20,-)Will need to recommend this game or not, no middleway unfortunely so that's why i choose NO. I will change this review when the game is official out, IF it's gived me reason to do so.			"

												By this point, reviewing Football Manager becomes more of a review of the series than a review of each individual game. FM has really begin to stagnate over the last several years; personally, I don't feel as if any game changing introductions have been made since FM13.Yet, when you remove the rose-tinted glasses of previous installments, it's hard to say that FM17 is anything other than a genre leading game. It's worth noting that several of the negative reviews on here do have some strong foundations. The match engine is very 'spontaneous' in its creation of highlights, as a result leaving AI players making the most unbelievable of decisons, and it's hard to deny that press conferences and interviews are anything other than a tedious grind that becomes the bane of your life after several hours of gameplay. However, the fundamental elements of gameplay are strong and allow for players to sink copious amounts of hours into generating wonderkids that are found in deepest darkest Peru, developing their own pub team into world beating superstars and winning the Premier League with Liverpool.Download the demo if doubtful, but FM17 is, although a small step forward, a step forward none the less.

												I really love the presentation of this game but it is quite simply too hard.The AI is very quick to work out your tactics and even the worst teams and managers can win easily.You can easily outplay computer controlled teams and have 20+ shots compared to the computers 2 or 3 shots and lose, this happens far too often to be realistic, I mean for example teams know how the likes of Barcelona are going to play can they stop them?I buy football manager every year but I'm very disapointed with the difficulty of this game, it takes away all the enjoyment.

												Long time fan of the series, since the days of Championship Manager.I tried a few saves some with really big teams, and a few with really small teams and I left this game with the smae feeling everytime, this is by far the worst game made by SI. The changes from 16 to 17 are so minor and underwhelming that it makes me wonder what the developers are doing, because FM is their only game and they release it 2 and a half months after the season starts in most of the leagues in europe. So they spend around 9 months doing nothing, and then change the database and ship it out.			"

												Very suprised at all the negative reviews especially as the people giving them are complaining about no improvements and new features, or the classic its the match engines fault. Also a lot of people saying SI and Miles have conned us with the lack of updates!!! Thing is they release a demo every year that lets you play 6 in game months as many times as you want. Which would give anyone who is unsure about the game a chance to experience what you are getting. Yet people still rush in complain about features yet put in an average of 40+ hours gametime and rant on here. I personally feel the game is a massive improvement from FM16 and all previous versions. The match engine is as stable as I have known one on and around release date. If your a football fan it is a must have addition to your collection. And before you buy it and end up unhappy once again there is a DEMO try it first!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

Well, it does not; each each it goes from bad to worse.And what makes it ever more catastrophic is the updates; I had rather good impression about FM 2017, but after the last update the game logic went completely wild. These is no game without 4 goals and tactis are completely nonsence. I win 4-0 away, and then I lose 4-0, to win again 4-0. In a season that I did not score more than 2 goals before the update.I will make sure I never buy this game again.			"

												i am and always will be a FM fan but this installment is so broken i don't think it can be fixed. - The goal keepers missing saves they should be making - the game decides for you whether you are getting the sack (you can't save your job at all) - transfers are far too expensive for clubs - Every time someone scores a goal outside the box is pathetic - Every time a player complains about not having enough game time when there your best player and played all season - Every time someone in the social feed says your player who was the clear motm wasn't bloody stupid inclusion- Every time you concede or lose to a team you clearly shouldn't be drawing or conceding to usaually it's last minute and a wonder goal from outside the box.They need to work on a patch for this to fix it and F##cking quickly how can you release such a poor version when 2016 was so good? but do you the person reading this buy it? not right now no it♥♥♥♥♥♥poor beyond a joke they released it in this state.

												Don't let the ""Mostly Negative"" fool you it seems to just be more than a few disgruntled Chinese players who are annoyed there's still no Chinese language feature. Now for my review.My first 3 hours have been great and have reminded me why this is the only game series I bother pre-ordering. The new UI looks a lot sharper and cleaner but will still be familiar to players of the series. The new social media feature is also pretty cool as well in my opinion. So far in the beta I've encountered no game breaking bugs or any bugs for that matter, and the fact that in my Arsenal save (COYG) I lost a first team player for 2 months to injury during a damn intrasquad friendly tells me the game is working well. I will keep updating this review throughout the beta but for now this game is looking like money well spent.EDIT: I do often wonder at times in FM games how much of an effect your tactics truly have. You can set up a high class team against some distinctly lower level opposition to play control but rarely will you ever feel like you've truly dominated a match and had a one sided outing as does happen in real life. Of course large teams don't always have their way but they do more often than not. Also, and this was the case in 16 as well, it seems that as soon as you score the opposition will always fire back almost immediately, regardless of your defensive setup or how the match was going beforehand. I'd like to know if the rest of you are having the same gripes as I am though I am happy to report that I have yet to encounter any really game breaking bugs only one instance where my manager avatar got deleted for some reason.EDIT: It's gotten to a point where I genuinely believe that the match engine will just ♥♥♥♥ with you whether or not it makes sense. I've had matches where I concede within two minutes despite having my world class defenders against much lesser opposition. After maybe 40 minutes we'll bounce back, not two minutes later the opposition has the lead again and this happens no matter who you're playing against. I also feel my tactical instructions will be ignored, I set my team up to clear the ball to flanks but all balls go straight down the middle, shorter passing never works and the team constantly loses the ball with hopeless overhead through ball attempts. At this point I'm not sure whether or not selecting ""Retain Possession"" even does anything. For better or worse though this is the closest thing to football management and as such I will still reccomend it but oh my it seems the same old flaws keep repeating, making the game force feed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to players does not constitute balanced difficulty in the slightest. Veterans of the series will encounter the same issues in a prettier engine and new players will have to steel themselves and prepare for inevitable rage quits. Is FM the Dark Souls of football sims? Seems like it's trying to be.			"

To motivate my players im still having to use the underdog mentallity for team talks, no pressure, pick up where you left off... No matter what you do, how you play, the A.I 99% of the time will score past you, I have 25+ shots everygame, the A.I will have 1 shot on target and it's a goal, as i've mentioned my defensive players, you can imagine how poor this can be fount to people. I've played 13. won 10, draw 3.. including going 1-0 and 2-1 down v a league 1 team.. If I was playing attacking or overload i'd accept the goals conceded, I play control with every player high on morale, 1 shot on target v Neuer and it goes in almost everytime..Also, in real life when surprises happen, on FM, you know their happening and you CAN'T do anything about it.. I've had reasonable success, took ipswich up first season, was top with Blackburn first season until i got injuries.And the worst, the official forum is full of people that love and defend the game, any contstructive criticism gets you ban warnings and threads closed. Very unprofessional bunch of moderators on their mixed with fm lovers who wont here a bad word about the game.. Most of them also act like moderators.. Gutted really as I love football management games, but FM is just abysmal.To top it off, i've read you need to create a persona and never change it else it effects your players mentally bad in the long term which will put them off form and so on... This is a joke, so your basically a life actor playing a computer game... Too much detail, too much info, the A.I are way to smart.. you have to change your tactics to surprise them, like when in real life do managers change tactics when their teams bang on form? on fm youl go 15 unbeaten, then 15 not winning with the same tactic, its that bad.. if you like this its up to you.. I get excited to play it, then when I load it up, all the poorness comes back in to my head... In real life, Wingers can play either as wingers or inside forwards depending on the situation in the match, on fm you force the players decision.. Really dissapointed.			"

												Absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥ You could have the best team in the wolrd have 50 shots each game and still manage to lose 2-1 to a non-league team. Defenders shocking stand so far apart may as well be off the pitch, strikers couldn't hit a barn door with a banjo and overall just terrible. Anyone who has played since release date will know that the game was much easier and actually competitve before the update which has completely screwed the game up. Would reccommend just giving £35 to charity instead of buying this horrible, horrible game.			"

												Review for those who haven't played a Football Manager game before: FM is the most detailed and the best football manager game in existence. It can be very overwhelming to get into, but once you get a hang of it, it is the closest you get to actually land a job at a professional football club. If you like simulation games and like football you will like FM2017Review for those who have played FM before, and consider 2017: I think it is worth it. I have played 10 hours since beta release yesterday 6 pm. The match engine is better, the game runs a lot faster, the data analysis is very improved, scouting is improved a lot, the interface is very intuative. All in all it is a better game than FM 2016 and 2015 and it is well worth the price			"

												Unfortunatelly first time in my history of playing fm(i started on champioship manager 3) i cannot recommend this game. It's only dlc for football manager 2016 worth at most 10£. Good:1.working on 64 bit (its faster a lot)Bad1. Lack of useful new features2. social feed which give nothing into game it is not making any diffrence if we have it or not cause we cant interact with it so whats the point of doing it?3. lack of private life of manager 4. lack of possibility to become chairman in create you club. whats the point to create your own club if you cannot be its owner?(back in fifa manager it was really good option)5. LESS ADDICTIVE! because its totally re-play from previous game!!6. LESS ADDICTIVE!7. LESS ADDICTIVE!8.LESS ADDICTIVE!9.....LESS ADDICTIVE!...ive found while playing:10. Polish translation is not finished many lines are not translated. Just poor poor job from devs.			"

												Worst football manager I've ever played, every goal you concede is a low drilled cross from the byline, I always concede a goal in the 70-80th bracket without fail, I don't even know how you could even get around that issue..... all it shows is that the game engine is broken and predictable.Dont select aim for penalty spot for corners, your player will without fail cross it outside the box. One match my player tackled my OWN goalkeeper and laid off the ball to the striker, 1-0 down. Then my keeper rolled the ball out to himself and walked straight into their striker who tackled him and put it away for 2-0. I don't think I've ever seen one of those incidents in a game let alone both in the same game! I can understand mistakes, but those aren't mistakes, thats just match fixing behaviour.Player wanted to leave, told him he couldn't leave the whole squad complains that I've blocked his move. Sell player, squad complains I sold player....... what????Social feed is terrible, player got a hattrick and your supporters feed will say ""I don't think he had a great game"" yeah ok.I could go on with some of the other crap I've encountered but don't really wanna waste anymore time.Don't waste your time either, play older versions.

												+ It has updated squads+ some UI improvements+ 3D match engine has (according to the developer) 1000+ new animationsBasically that's it.- it's too bloated, they're adding lifeless social networking and other stuff for no particularly good reason- the 3D match engine is awful. Goalkeepers are terrible, letting ridiculous goals on regular basis- its' more or less the same game from 201xIt just doesn't justify the price. Not nearly enough improvements. They're selling you squad updates for 50+ euro. If you haven't played FM in a long while - buy it.If you have - don't.			"

												One of the best parts of Football Manager is being able to sign players at the end of their contracts.  But si decided to add a gamey Brexit feature, something that hasn't even happened in real life and may not .  After putting many hours into the game, i get told i can no longer sign British players at the end of their contracts, oh did i tell you i am a British team, oh but i need to apply for work permits to sign European players also. Its already impossible to sign players outwith EU, now i need permits for players in Europe as well, who the hell am i suppose to sign now.  This is so stupid imo and ruins a great part of the game.  You should be able to turn this feature off at least or be told at the beginning of the game what brexit you are going to get.  This is football manager, a football management sim not politics simulator.  Totally ruined the game for me after spending so much time on itAlso si being si, while trying to fix bugs (which there is many) fix one part of the game and ruin another.  The match engine was fine but after the recent update, players are back to doing all the stupid things from fm16Miles should stop being so arrogant. Thinking he is never wrong and some god among men and listen to the people who have played the game for years.  Stick to 16 if you have it at least you can have fun signing players at the end of their contracts without worrying about a stupid feature coming in that will stop you doing that			"

												Honestly I wanted to recommend this game, I really love this franchise (I played 800hrs on the last one alone) but there are too many problems for me to recommend it right now. I know a lot of you will say 'but it’s in beta' which is true but I have played FM every year in beta since they started doing it and frankly not that much changes from the beginning of beta to release.The first major issue I have are the injuries; excessive injuries have been a ridiculous mainstay of the FM franchise for the last few years making it infuriating to play without the in-game editor to heal some of the more ridiculous ones. I’m really tired of this being such a problem it surely shouldn’t be that hard to fix, 8/10 games have at least one serious injury for one of the teams which is just absurd and god forbid if you actually manage a top club where you have players going off to play internationals because 50% will come back injured. The result of this is if you manage a big club you will have a comical revolving door of players returning/getting injured.My other major issue with this game are the defender/ goalkeeper AI. They appear to have tried to fix defenders from last year as they had a miraculous ability to push opposing players 10feet if they were to contest a ball but while they appear to have fixed this; defenders are now incredibly dumb. SI claim that players make twice the decisions they did previously, I see no evidence of this players seem no smarter. Defenders particularly, they have no ability to read danger they literally cannot track opposing players and if you play any remotely aggressive tactics then opposing players will pass around your defenders like they are training cones (or Daley blind). This defensive weakness is made all the worse by the goalkeepers, I literally have no idea what SI were thinking I can only assume they spent all their time on the new goalkeeper animations (which just look funny as a keeper will go from stationary to fully airborne in a millisecond often diving over the ball when just a simple save was required). Goalkeepers now spring about in flamboyant jumps but they literally only make wonder saves, if a ball is flying towards the top corner of the net there's a good chance they'll stop it but if your grandma has taken a shot down the middle of the goal they literally have no chance, springing over it like a scared cat.I have also been greatly disappointed by Miles Jacobson practices of late not only with his disgraceful handling of the deal he made with Chinese fans to do with translating the game, but also his exploitative business model towards loyal fans of the series. First of all, the controversy regarding the Chinese localisation came about as a result of a deal that Miles Jacobson made with Chinese fans that if FM sold a certain amount more copies of newer FM games than previous ones in china then future FM games would have Chinese localisation. Chinese fans were outraged that this deal had not been honoured in this version because they felt that they had easily reached their target citing steam spy for figures as evidence. Miles Jacobson claims that they had not reached the target saying instead that steam spy figures are often incorrect and in this case by up to 60%. Frankly this seems unlikely given such a widespread backlash, I mean look at the sheer volume of negative reviews on steam this surely shows that there is a large following for the game in china that cares about the product. Even if it is true that they had not reached the target would it have been so hard to translate have the game translated as a goodwill gesture toward a loyal fan base especially as this is such a successful franchise. Honestly this just seems like another example of the complacency and laziness that has become a mainstay of the FM franchise of late probably due to this game having no real competition (honestly look at the match engine it looks 10years old)The second reason I am dismayed by Miles Jacobson's behaviour is his pre-order policy to take advantage of loyal fans. FM17 came with what seemed like a fairly generous offer for loyal fans who received a discount based on how many previous FM games they owned up to 20%. However, while this may seem generous at first glance this truly seems like a very cold calculated move to exploit loyal fans who have bought the game every year. This is because the deal was not simply a pre-order bonus but it required blind faith as it was only available for a short time before any details about the game had even been released! (apart from the name) Miles Jacobson claims in an interview (http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-11-01-attacking-someones-family-over-a-video-game-is-not-acceptable-miles-jacobson) that it is an 'early bird' reward for loyal fans. How does that even remotely make sense and I’m sorry if you believe that line you are deluded, if it truly were a 'reward' for loyal fans (and not simply an attempt to take advantage of the most loyal players) then why should this deal have an expiry date? Especially an expiry date before any details about the game were even released.I will wrap this review up I promise but I felt these issues were very important; and I should clarify there are some nice new additions like the new statistical analysis after every game and the improvements to the engine making it run faster as well as some other nice touches including improved/smoother UI and the new social feed but ultimately these are not really major changes especially when there are such major problems with key features such as the match engine. I really can’t bring myself to recommend this game, originally this was simply down to my disappointment with the absurd player ai, particularly defensively which in no way represents real life. Now though I feel that I cannot recommend buying this game on account of Miles Jacobson's deceitful and exploitative behaviour.			"

												Been playing FM's for over 10 years now and I'm not impressed with this years version at all, AI stikers aren't scoring as much as they should as I've proven to a developer on steam, and posted it on official forum only to be ignored...look for a thread on Steam called ''trouble with shots on targets'', I've shown end of the season results with screenshots taken from 3 different leagues, and posted the real life scoring list from each league too...one example is, the Dutch leagues top scorer at end of season was 13 goals.Injuries aren't as bad as people make out, but the conditioning of players is terrible, players wear out too quickly, you can't play players through weekend games then a midweek game then back to a weekend game like you can in real life. People will say rotate, I understand you have to do that in the game, but isn't this game supposed to be a football simulation game? some people really do miss the point.Then there is this problem with ball winning midfielders, they cannot play a game without getting a card, I understand players that play this role will generally pick up more cards...but every game? it's ridiculously bad.The game just isn't fun like it used to be, it's just frustrating knowing these few things make the game unplayable for me, it's a shame because the game has potential to be so great.And the media is just getting worse, its ok for the first 20-30 matches, by that time you'll notice the same old questions being thrown at you all the time, it takes time answering them, it's boring and repetitive. (although I turn this off through the editor).I won't be buying another FM for atleast a few years, and it's the first time I've ever done this, I'm genuinly sick of it now.			"

												Probably the worst FM yet in my eyes. WAAAAAY too many games you are winning that end in defeats and the opposition seems to score with every shot/highlight. People will (I'm sure) say ""You're just bad"" but it is a nonsense that your players just throw the ball to the opposition on throw ins and you concede.Also, the fact the kick offs are only 1 man in the centre circle and that hasn't been patched is embarrassing, not to mention the goalkeepers who drop the ball behind them and then panic clear it to the opposition strikers. Does anybody test games before release these days?!			"

If you are a series pro or a new player i just want to warn you that this edition is very bad. Completly random match engine, tactics and player form have no effect, tons of bugs. Don't celebrate if you are winning 7-0 at half time at home against a non league club who have had 8 players sent off, you will lose the game. i have never witnessed such bizzare randomness in a statistic based game before. i understand that football is unpredictable but it still has to adhere to the laws of physics, it does not in this game.

This completely spoils the game and needs addressing asap.Otherwise its a good game but transfer baragains a far and few between and transfer negotations are tough with players walking on one offer frequently.I've played the game since 2004 and so far this is a poor one.** Edit Some work has been made to address which is good but some of the the AI issues but still exist such as every cut back = a goal number of 35yd screamers.

It's just FM16 with new bugs.I thought they'll improve the game engine, i thought they'll add ""gegenpressing"" (PES17 did), i thought my strikers will help the midfielders when mentality is ""defensive"" (FIFA17 strikers do), i thought they'll add new instructions, they didn't.Performance on Macbook Pro still sucks, even if you use 2d with ""low graphics"", sure i could go to their community and submit a bug, but don't think i should, because that issue is from FM16, why would they fix it now?I found a match engine bug, went to their community and submitted a bug with PKMs, SI didn't respond yet, so i decided to go ahead and request a refund.The only ones who responded are the power hungry ""mods"" who complained that ""that's not enough PKMs"", ♥♥♥♥ off.Tacitcally, you have more instructions in PES17, positionally this game sucks, players don't know where to stand and they need to add new instructions, but they'll probably won't, because why should they? do they have a competitor?I'm shocked and feel conned, SI needs a competitor, yesterday.

												I like how the match engine is still exactly the same as FM 2016's.Only conceding from crosses, shots from 30 meters by players with 5 longshots and fullbacks with 5 finishing who'll just curl it into the top corner from just inside the box. Yeah, right. I wouldn't mind if I conceded these goals if the opponent were much better. But when I have +-20 shots on goal and the opponent has 5 to 10, and they score every single time and I don't, it just starts to get onto my nerves.Fix. The. Match. Engine.			"

												Even though the game can be annoying with its shocking engine, I don't mind the game (it's just FM16 + transfer updates and some new staff). I'm only doing LLM at the moment so the aids that have happened in games don't annoy me as much......goalies however. Well. I could have no limbs and do a better job.Also, the tactics are the same, players love taking longshots even though there's about 5 players in the box. Needs a good update to fix this.			"

												Looking for a good football management sim, Fm2017 is out, woohoo just what we've been waiting for, NOT. Try anything else, go back to 2011, go back to when CM/FM meant an enjoyable duel between AI and the manager. Don't waste your money on this garbage.Seriously upset about his game. Tactics are a joke, they don't change a thing. May as well stick with 4-4-2. Same goes with player roles, support, attack, defend, all are worthless. Played since the original and unless this garbage is seriously overhauled i' going back to a cm game where your tactics actually made a difference. It's a game where cosmetics has been pushed over actual playability and until this has been addressed it is not worth a free play let alone the huge price tag i've paid.			"

												(Firstly there may be one or two errors, I have copied and pasted my FM16 review, with a quick skim through of edits. (Yes, I have taken a Sports Interactive approach to reviewing)This review is based on being a FM/CM player for over 20 years and someone who only ever plays the full mode, not classic or touch.Firstly the big thumbs down is based on two reasons. One: A huge part of managment is the time between games, the training part of real managment is huge. Who is doing well, who isnt putting the effort in, who is fighting for a first team place. What bonds are being formed between the players ect. FM 17: Nothing.Two: Boardrooms. I only manage big clubs and big clubs in FM17 doesnt even slightly resemble the big clubs I read about in the papers or see on television.. There is no living world above the manager in FM17, just a bland, highly basic, simplistic UI that makes you feel like you are a manger of a non league club with pretty much total control.This year we have a simulated Brexit. Really?! Its like someone thought this up while they were sat on sofa infront of the news last year. All the things FM lacks and they put in a brexit. Honestly the direction this game has gone in the last few years is just baffaling.On the Sports Interactive FM forums there is a huge wishlist thread with over 6000 replies. Pick any random page and there are countless wishes for in-depth training, media pressure, player interaction, ME improvments, Board improvements. With the exception of the ME there has been no noticeable improvement in any of these over the last three years.The game is all to easy to create all conquering teams that win trophies year after year. In real life how many managers stay at the same club and keep constantly winning trophies? Obviously Sir Alex Ferguson and a few others, but it should be hard, really hard to do. Its just to easy in FM. How many young players who are deemed wonderkids in real life go on to actually become superstars? Not that many, a handful from each generation. Not so in FM, buy a wonderkid, play wonderkid, watch wonderkid fulfill potential. On the other hand, want to pluck a kid from the french second division who no one really rates and watch him suprise everyone (ala Marhez of Leicester), no chance. The constrictive CA/PA system wont allow that until a FM researcher updates it for you. The problem with this system is that Marhez is now a world beater because of one good season, in FM18 he will probably be mearly good, but in a save game which runs muliple years we have a situation where Marhez was awful in FM15/16, amazing in 17, yet neither is a true refelection of the dynamic evolution of a player which has peaks and troughs. Its a system that is showing its age and each player is a snapshot of a FM researchers opinion at a moment in time, but a snapshot that will be set in stone throughout a save game. They may have served the series well, but many of the systems FM17 incorporates are basic and easy to control because they havent moved forward in the last few years.Football Manager really hasnt moved forward with the times. 15 to 20 years ago a lot of managers did run the club from top to bottom but these days top, top clubs arent run like that. FM does a really poor job of reflecting this, sure there is the token Director of football, the token head of development, but again very simplistic, basic systems that just doesnt reflect top level football in 2017. Managing a top club in FM17 feels more like a quaint throwback to the 90s than an actual reflection of what fooball has become in the last 15 years. Adding a pretty basic social media UI isnt going to modernise anything in a meaningful way.3 years ago I thought FM was about where it should be. Now its coming across stale and out of ideas. Going by the wishlist thread in their own forums theres 100s of great ideas, but for whatever reason SI has entered the change UI, tag on some light weight features and sell for full price approach. Its sad to see. I will still play it, but every year its getting harder to justify paying £35 for a game that isnt moving forward and is no longer reflecting the sport I watch and read about. I will still rack up the hours, but more because there is no other game to buy than what SI have developed.The FM series needs a huge shake up. Whoever is choosing the directon of the game, what new features are going in ect needs to be moved on. Every year real life football grows, the juggernaught keeps getting bigger and expanding. Every year that goes by where we have new features like create a club and fantasy draft is another year where FM loses ground on the sport its trying to represent. Its sad that the people in control of the games direction have completely lost sight of what gave the game its cult following. It got the basics of the football world right and let the players imagination fill in the gaps and build from there. The basics of the FM world dont feel right anymore. Without that basic foundation the imagination has no support, FM needs imagination to work or it is just a game and FM was never just a game.			"

												This is the first time i have reviewed a game. (its that bad)  I have always bought this year in year out and its going downhill. To be fair i love the database and not that fussed about the small changes compared to 2016. I would buy the game just for the data update, Which i do.On previous games i have spent hours enjoying a saved game. I even spent hours on 2016 and thematch engine wasnt the best on that.But wow this years 3d match engine is the worst iv seen, It makes the game umplayable. I redownloaded FM13 to test the game and how bad the games become. I dont know about anyone else but i loved FM13 Match engine, Players would actually dribble, Pass and shoot properly. Unlike this year. The players are all over. The engine is broke. Its easy to blame tactics ect... but no iv always been decent at the game and i still am this year. I am winning my matches but its boring! Players shoot in the side netting all the time, The keepers are iver amazing or dreadful thiers no inbetween. Iv had my keeper run out of net and they score a open goal.  Players always look sluggish, the dribbling is terrible, they just run, stop turn and pass or shoot miles away from goal. Which takes me to long shots, Fair enough the odd time, but wow even when my tactics are set to work ball into box and the players are set to not shoot from distance it dont matter. They just shoot from anywere. The defending is shocking, Freekicks are the same were they iver get blasted against the wall or wide, with the very rare goal. Like i said this is my 1st review so sorry if its not like others or not into better detail. I read the reviews before i bought the game but one of the stupid ones that buy it anyways every year. If you havnt bought it, Please dont. Everyone is complaining how little changes have been made, I think its worse. Might only be the match engine but thats the whole point of playing the game! I wont be getting next years unless most people have recomended it.			"

												A really bad game. I feel I've been let down again this year by Sports Interactive. The game is almost no different from FM16 and it has exactly the same issues. After I've played with both PSG and Man Utd, and tried several tactics and philisophies and the players still underperform, I've chosen to stop playing the game. With players like: Hazard, Griezmann, Cavani, Dembélé, Verratti, Marquinhos, Laporte and so on, and still losing 3-1 to teams like Nimes and Troyes and not being able to qualify in the Champions Cup, I've discovered that the players don't listen to your tactics and instructions. It doesn't matter what tactics or instructions you give the players or teamtalk, you will still get bad results against bad teams. For 55€ i will not be recommending this game			"

												I'm pretty tired of people moaning about this game. This game, is, by far, the most in depth and detailed football game you're ever going to get.The match engine isn't as bad as people make out. Yes, there are some glitches, yes it requires some patch updates, But most games do these days. This is the route ALL NEW GAMES go down now. Look at Xbox games, constantly adding updates to them now. PC Games have always had patches added to them and, this game has been the most ambitious of them all because of the political changes surrounding Brexit that would have needed to be made. I'll come back to that later. Speaking as someone who has worked in computer programming, you can guarantee that any other game that now is part of a console that connects to the internet will be sliding small glitch and bug fixes into their patch updates. I also hear people complain about either being too many changes or not enough changes. Its ridiculous. the game is adaptive, works better, is more personable to the players and all round, is more difficult to play than ever, which at the end of the day, i'd rather not be sat here winning league after leage while finding the game ridiculously easy. If you want to play a game where you win game in, game out, go play FIFA 2017's career mode and just play the games yourself.I find the game good fun, enough to write this review, because people will buy the game, play it, lose a few matches or find it difficult, or get a slight glitch, and boom, straight on the review pages slating it.....Please click my review to see more of my rant...The game is very realistic. Whenever i discuss it with people who don't play the game, they are pretty surprised by the lengths that the game has gone to take what goes on in real life and put it into the game. Again, its obvious you will not see Wayne Rooneys taste for the elder ladies come into fruition, Cristiano Ronaldo is not gonna write off his ferarri on his way to training. Big Sam will not be caught with his pants down over circumventing the third party ownership laws and of course there won't be a massive scandal over the head of Fifa taking bungs left right and centre because THATS NOT WHAT THE GAMES ABOUT! you just won't see that in any game!The crowning glory for me in terms of the new additions is the Brexit. The fact that you can start any new game you want and it will be completely different from the next because of this. It is like Russian roulette of Footballing geography. The fact they managed to turn this around so quickly into probably one of the best additions of the game is unbelievable. YOU WILL NOT GET THIS IN ANY OTHER GAME!Yes, there are alot of the same old same olds, but, its a football management game. I'm pretty sure there's only a finite number of things you can do when you break it down. I don't get what people want out of the game when they say this.The only things i've noticed that have swayed from the realism is team names and the German national team situation.  It seems like that is the only thing that has gotten worse from previous years. There are no Brazillian team names any more, or spanish. You can work it out, but they are named differently for some reason. That is a negative.As far as managing the team, playing through the matches, moving up the leagues, winning games, losing games, buying/selling/dealing with/training players, even the realism of transfer fees and the finances going on in the game and the influence of the Chinese leagues are concerned.. this is second to no other football management simulation game. Fact.So stop moaning about not being able to win games, that one glitch that cost you a goal, that you hammer teams statistically but can't score for toffee, or even that the came crashed one time and you were on a good run (USE THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SAVE BUTTON AND AUTO SAVE OPTIONS!), about the bug fixes that come out (which FYI, auto download through steam and other than the january transfer updates move seamlessly into your save games),  about the gameplay (because that has actually improved alot over the years) and realise that this game is still the number 1 in football management simulators. All of them things can boil down to the work arounds i've already provided above or one simple thing.... BE A BETTER MANAGER!if i could give this game a star rating i'd say 4 out of 5. Aside from the club names and German national team situation, the only other thing that irks me slightly is the Sports scientist and data analyst roles and that there is currently no stats for them that make them any better or worse than anyone else. of course this is just my opinion, but i think you'll find its more detailed than the hundreds of othersthat say ' Games bad,' 'same old same old,' ' waste of money because it doesn't work properly' Anyone who says that this game is the same as the last one, is blind to the fact that thats the way it is now. i think if you look at the majority of games that release new versions every year, you'll find, there aren't any that really overhaul the game and come up with something brand spanking new. This game is trying to get as close to something in real life as it can. There is only so far it can go! if you find it too similar, step outside, take in a big deep breath and look around at yourself. life rarely changes!The game works fine for the most part, its the people operating the machines, or the machines themselves that don't work. Like i said, i'm aware that there are some crashes, some bug fixes... but ultimately, everything that you need to provide back up for all that is in the auto save. Maximum you will lose is a month if you actually bother to go to the preferences and set it up. Don't hate the game, hate the players (and after reading these negative reviews for the last 4/5 years... i actually have started to)			"

It appears that the developers have forgotten fans of this game want to be Football Managers! Inconsistency in results, 10m transfer rejected only for the player to transfer for 5m elsewhere, Goalkeepers are all sh#t and i can't get a striker to score, i mean Barcelona with Messi, Neymar and Suarez scoring 10 goals between them.

												It's honestly the most annoying FM ever! I play with my favorite team Feyenoord when this happens. In the beginning of the season, my team is able to win almost every match (lost 2 matches of the first 17 in the competition). After the winterbreak my team is struggling. It's harder to win. You can say, your opponent is changing his tactics on your style of play. But then I start testing the same match 3(!) times with 3 different tactics. I did this in the match FC Twente - Feyenoord. I'm 1-2 up in the 89th minute. Somehow, Twente get a corner. The ball comes to my defender and he wants to clear the ball. However, he shot at the striker of my opponent and the ball bounces back to my keeper. He can easily pick the ball up, but he managed to dive OVER the ball. 2-2. 1 minute later: Free kick from 30 yards out fly in to the top corner. I Lost 3-2.I tried this game 2 times again and the same stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥goals happen. My team is stronger 9 of 10 times, and have much more possesion, much more chanches and much, very much more shots, but the keepers of my opponents are like an octopus. This game tests your frustration every single game. It's like you cannot be a champ.

												Poor game when it comes to putting your tactics in place.  Your players simply don'tlisten and you end up watching mostof the game seeing your players pitifully chase the opposition.Incredibly annoying and confusing as you can't really put your philososphies in place.  For example, my philosophy was to play direct football whilst closing opposition down immediately.  Also I attempt to have my midfielders involved however they are continuously overrun.  If your tactics don't work you know about it.  I've losta fair number of games so far with 8-0 a common score.Dont bother buying unless you like losing.  Far too difficult it's practically impossoble.			"

												+ Looks more realistic/greater graphics+ Incorporates real world events (Brexit)- Almost the same game as last year, very little difference- Injuries are way too frequent, overkill- Still no badges for certain teams and names for certain leagues which is ridiculous - Social feed is completely useless, why on earth did they spend time on this?- Negotiations with players and staff are just stupid. Sometimes they won't tell you what they want so you have to guess    which often leads to them walking away. I always have to save before starting negotiations which just ruins the experienceAs you can see - I don't really recommend the game.			"

												Been playing this game continuously from FM 2008. I have also played Championship Manager 99/00. I don't recommend buying this game, there just simply aren't enough new features to warrant purchasing it. This series has been getting like Fifa has now for the last few years. It's just rehashed and put out there. PLUS there is a huge bug that I didn't realise has not been fixed for years, but I have just experienced for myself. All my player and manager history has disappeared from when I started the game. I looked online and players have been experiencing this for years. So no stats at all shown...This is simply put really bad and a load of crap!! Last Football Manager that I will ever play. Luckily I didn't pay for my copy as it was a Xmas gift, but I'm still disappointed with this game and SI.			"

												I downloaded this game with a sense of hope. 10 hours into the game, the reviews proved to be true. Based on my first run in, I find the game to be poorly designed or shall i say, a distinct lack of improvement over the past few years. The match engine continues to be broken. The number of shots per game is unrealistically high. There often are at least 20 shots per game from one side. Talented youth players will go for 40 to 100 times of their market value hence making it quite impossible to buy them on a limited budgeted. This is based on 10 hours of game play where 2-3 hours was spent on setting up my squad. I have asked for a refund and i hope i will be reimbursed for my time wasted else just what i paid for the game.			"

												As most people already wrote, I'm also getting tired of fancy updates with few ""improvements"" no one really wants or needs. FM needs an urgent re-vamp. I buy it every year, and while this year I was slightly hesitating, I bought it and - regretted. Here are my reasons. a) I've been following ""the wishlists"" for a quite few years now and the meaningful stuff people suggest (and there are wonderful and very doable ideas) hardly makes into the products. b) opposite to previous, insignificant stuff like ""social feed"" always happens, and personally, I find it as painful as pre- and post- media conferences. Here is why. Simply, you won a game: there's a few ""feeds"" about enthusiastic fans and always  one claiming ""messi wasn't anything special"". In other words, although it was added to help realism of the game, it really doesn't matter how did your team play, you always get pretty same (or very similar) ""feeds"". c) Academies! Academies! Academies! At this point, I find ""youth intake"" which you cannot influence at all - no matter what they claim - quite irritating. It hardly changed since 97/98. In reality, you don't have any control over it. I find it impossible if your club has the state-of-art facilites, extensive recruitment, throphy after throphy and it's absolutely focused on youth development that your 'youth intake' is absolutely worthless. Don't get me wrong, I do not expect a Messi or Ronaldo every year, but if your club reaches worldwide reputiation (and it's focued on youth development), I do expect at least several or perhaps few average players each year. Moreover, I personally find getting a good player to develop keeps my interest on the game. d) Facilities! Ok, I'm not talking about graphics. I believe a lot of people play in 2D anyway. I'm talking something more specific than ""improve facilities"" and waiting until October or December in the game for facilites to actually be improved. I'm pretty sure there are little improvements each club can do on its facilities (replace seats, install under-soli heating, invest in office-space...) which can come handy and also get more related with getting better sponsorship, sales of goods during the game...e) Dynamic rivalries! There has been a lot of talk about it, so I'll explain what I precisely mean. If one club in the league starts doing outstanding in continental competition, I find it ridiculous that its league rivals after 2, 5, 10 years of losing cannot 'follow the example' for improvement, find external funding, change owner...Especially, when today this is very dynamic everywhere and it would also add interest to the game. Now, we have something as so-and-so bought a club, they want to take it to the new heights and then ______________Or in other words, nothing happens. Long story short, I'm not buying game next year if I get bunch of 'rearranged stat tools' and another fancy update.			"

												I've bit the bait and bought this version of marvelous franchise that I have been playing since like 20 years (with previous versions considered) with %50 discount, but I sincerely can't remember how I felt so annoyed and dismayed while playing past versions. Sure, I've had ups-and-downs throughout my gameplays, to be honest, I would consider myself as a decent player, learned to let failures and frustrations sink in, notwithstanding of this fact, I really hated this one. I totally agree with reviews, mostly laying emphasis on the negligence and laxness of devs that never cared to make even simple improvements from last years' versions. It's outrageous to disregard, and disparage at some point, even simple demands of such potent fanbase and I would like to say they were not demanding that much. I've felt my tactics would not even affect the outcome in any case, whereas they expect me to spare my limited free time to work my♥♥♥♥♥off and spend hours to cope with preposterous AI. I know it takes devotion, character and intensity (Brendan Rodgers much? :) to create a persistently performing team, but how can you expect me to thrive in such conditions, that your team concede in almost exact same fashion in every single game (Closing down through whole pitch, pinpointing shooters who would cause trouble and closing them down specifically, higher defence line or retracting deep into own 6 yard box...nah, none of them works!) , or players would not even care to apply the instructions that given to them and act on the contrary of them? I don't even bother to continue playing this game anymore so I hope this review might shed a light on other fellow players who would consider buying it....			"

I am for sure gonna think twice before buying FM in the future, unless it has some real graphics changes.			"

												I have played football manager series since fm 2005. Honestly i have been very patient when things go bad, cause eventually maybe after a few weeks, maybe months things would start to turn in your favor as you try different approaches in tactics, tweaks in your instructions etc.This year i have ran out of patience.AI decides whether it likes your tactics, playstyle during game and comes with a conclusion of the game at the end. But, and there is a big but here, the way its carried out through match is purely STUPID. For instance, you had a bad start conceding very early and trailing by 1. Now, if you haven't conceded again within next 10 minutes from your opponent left/right back's crossing you think you are lucky. But you don't get away with it. The ball approaches towards your right back with excellent stats, however he literally avoids the ball by running backwards instead of simply standing there, getting the ball and clearing it from the danger. Result? Opponents left winger gets the ball, your right back pretends to defend by escorting him all the way to six-yard and opponent scores.I have watched it over and over and came to conclusion that this game has no point. Things just arbitrarily happen and doesn't make any sense and i should stop wasting any time on it. Fix your freaking game SI and actually make some changes to game that are useful and improve user's experience. The only reason i bothered to write this review is i'm mad and i don't wany anyone else to get mad in case they consider to buy this crap.			"

												A small briefing here. I've begun to play FM since CM 2000-2001. I am a huge fan of the series. Every newer version since CM 2000-2001 was a bit better than the previous one. Until reaching now FM 2017... I'm in the difficult position to announce that Football Manager 2017 is easily the worst manager ever. So here are some pros & cons that i've encountered already in this year's version:Pros:+ graphics are great.+ it's been very helpfull that green board who keep suggesting you things. [it's been since 2016 but whatever]+ some details are also helpful and comfy.Cons:- this is a huge ball breaker. if a player receives an interest from any club regardless if their contracts are ending in a long time then demands new contract, if a contract not served, then uprises making the whole team into pieces. Imagine that in a  very larger scale than one player. And If any of you ask me how much i have  in discipline it's 20. - players uprises randomly demanding improved contracts to reflect their importance to the team regardless if their contracts are ending in a very long time or if they are only in the team for a year. - playing against minor teams i might lose 4-0 or 5-1 and against bigger teams i might win them 4-0. This usually happens. [it's been in the last Fm editions but whatever]- i cannot make an instant request from the board the first year of my contract. Why this had to change?- too much talking even for minor issues.- AI is heavily stupid. I was doing the registration for the Europa League, as the most of us know the Under-21 players don't need to register but once i'm finishing the registration there was a player that his age is 19 years old so i didn't register him  and he was upset why i haven't register him. And there's more than that. just finished with my registration and two players the one that i've been talking earlier about a second one that he is 17 years old both i did left them unregistered fm shows me that i cannot use them. I mean WTF?Putting all the minors together you don't have time for the actuall game but instead you focus on past these craps;So i certainly won't recommend this game. I'd put a 3-4/10			"

												I am not a loyal FM fan, bought the game simply because I like strategy games. So far my experience is not what I would expect from a PC FM game. 1. the splash screen are 4:3 scale, we are in 2016/7 and I was astonished when I saw the 2 dark areas at the sides of my screen, fearing I bought some game made in the 90's. 2. no music/SFX in the menu. I only have a low-priced headset and all I can hear during the game is the buzzing. Again we are in 2016/7, we no longer need to try to put everything in a 32kb disk. Even if you just put in one 8-bit BGM, it would make me feel much better.3. terrible optimization. The game's UI makes it feel like a web game, but the loading tme feels like a 90 GB triple A game running on a 00's PC.4. terrible art choice. Why the ♥♥♥♥ does my manager have such long arms and such terrible looking suits? Come on SEGA you were from Japan, even just grabbing some 2D portraits would make the manager look much better. The unpolished 3D model which lack detailed customization only make things worse and  make the game even more feel like a terrible web game.5. as every Chinese player ponted out in there review, the producer promised Chinese, the game supported 16 languages, the game itself has Chinese football league, yet there is no official Chinese translation. I have no difficulty reading English, but trying to read those not-mother-language small characters on a 15 inch screen is really pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ This is not simply a matter of not supporting the majority of the purchaser of the game, but exposing the problem of discrimination and dishonesty.I have to admit that the core game mechanics are fascinating, but these surface level problems are hindering me from enjoying those juicy core contents. When small problems gather, a nonnegligible situation appears, an thus a not recommanded is given. 49/100 slightly not recommanded.			"

												Football Manager has been made great again. Because Football Manager is fun again.The goodSome of the ""modern"" aspects of the game have been scraped away (mainly the psychological management) in favor of 2012-like more balanced system.Instructions you give to players finally make a difference. Since dropping the sliders in favor of roles & instructions, it was very frustrating to have your team play the same every single game, no matter what you say. NO MORE! It's not 100% perfect, but it's much much better.AI transfer policies seem better and random highly unlikely things (1 year injuries) aren't common any more.The badPress conferences are still bland af. Everything present was in 2011.There isn't much pressure to make your tactics detailed. You can live with default settings and adjusting roles.Player search results aren't cached, so when you want to go through a list by looking at player profiles, every time you press back, it has to re-process.The uglyMost criticism in Steam reviews is about lack of Chinese language and unrealistic match simulations. I can't/don't want to comment on the first point, but it's kinda unbelievable people still expect *realistic* matches. Sure, every year SI says it's going to be realistic, but come on! There was never a realistic CM/FM game and it won't be in forseeable future. It's, at least, fun again.OverallFM17 is a well-rounded game, unlike last editions. People who criticise the game about its gameplay are probably oversaturnated. This franchise is evolutionary by a for-profit company, not revolutionary. It's basically *only* an improved older version. If improved isn't good enough for you because you've played enough of 14/15/16, you're gonna be frustrated. If it is, ignore the mixed reviews and buy it.			"

												Game crashed 3 times in about two weeks. 2 times were in the Beta so I gave the full release a chance, but after 2 friendly matches in my first save - it crashed for the 3rd time. Never happened to me in any other FM game before. P.S - The social feed feature is worthless and useless. Should have stuck with the regular news.			"

												I could say that I'm a true Football-Manager fan. I'm playing the game for 10 years now and it's a game who's always on my 'to-buy' list. The only problem in this game is: The game is already so detailled, it's almost impossible to add things that are really an addition to this game. I love the way they improve the graphics, interface and extra-options in the game like creating your own manager for example. Everytime they add some more tactic-options aswell which makes your team completely the way you want it to play. When you switch some tactics it's really rewarding to see your team really changing the way of approaching a match, and it's even more rewarding when it's really working out!On the other side, they could really improve the Social Media and the Press conference options. You're always facing the same questions and comments. That's the reason I let my assistent-manager do those things, because it got me bored already. Resume:Gameplay:      9/10: It's really addictive, especially when u'r playing with your favourite teams or climbing up from the bottom.Replay value: 10/10: Because you can almost play like every club on the world, it is really awesome to try other tactics with the same squad, or become manager on the other side of the world. Graphics:        7/10: Because i'm playing for around 10 years, I really see the improvements they are working through. But ofcourse, it can only get better.Price/Worth    7/10: €54,99 is a lot of money for a game. But I play this game so much every year, it's really worth it for me. Total: 8/10. "

												I will recommend this game, when the developers develop the game, to make it a lot more realistic. It is just way too weird to see your team game after game several times a season have 20+ shots at goal, and the opponent having 1 or 2 shots, and lose by 1 goal. This does not happen that often. Hardly ever. And to tell your players not to shoot from long range, and still bagging 10-15 shots from outside the box every single game, even though you've done everything (slowed down, worked ball into box, retain posession, etc.) to tell the team and individuals NOT TO SHOOT THE F'ING BALL FROM LONG RANGE, they still do it time and time again. Even with players that have high teamwork amongst other preferable skills (decision, etc.) Not much management to be done there, is it? No, make it much much more realistic, and I'll recommend the game again.			"

The tacked on social network aspect is appallingly bad and only serves slows the game down, the create a face feature seems like the owners saw a good sales pitch and decided to tack it on and the AI/Match engine is all over the place at best. FM16 has it's flaws but is infintely more playable than FM17. As of today I will be going back to FM16 full time, I played a few hours last night and the game flies by at breakneck speed and seems fresh an clean without the token social network attached.			"

I blooded a few of the youngsters from the under 23s and 18s.....i was playing awesome and the players were performing unbelieveable...i did lose and draw and few games i must admit aswell wasnt one of those 30 games without victory!! SO comes to closed season and i had like 100mill to spend brought 4/5 players in 2 of which were world class and 3 promising players...i sold...lingard,darmian,rooney and blind for decent money...so i started the second season with a better squad 2 class players per position...tactics rolling class again in pre season...i start the season with 5 losses out of 6...3 of the teams were promoted from the championship with no investment of there squads!!...and i had 5 red cards in them 6 games ...2 of which were in one game before half time!! i would go 1-0 or 2-0 up and just fall apart..i would have like 30 shots on goal and 4 on target 65% of the ball and they would score on the first shot on target at 75mins!! i didnt have 1 red card last season...and now i have 5.I then have about 10 injuries to the first team 5 in the middle of midfield all happened in the last 2 weeks of pre season..last year i had one or 2 injuries how can that change so much?!!! ibra scored 46 goals last season hes played 9 and scored 1! the game is a joke! over priced bag of rubbish! none of this is realistic at all.....i for one am not the best Fm player by a mile and dont mind losing but not like that with Man Utd and Squad of World class players who won 3 Tophies last season!

												2 games into the season, 2 games lost: 2 indirect red cards despite the fact that none of my players has an aggressive instruction, 1 own goal in injury time all the while I have 5 clear cut chances  (vs 1 for the opposing teams),  6 shots against post/crossbar and ridiculous saves from both opposing gk. This engine is just a complete mess.Edit: as I never really played with one of the top teams I decided to start with Barcelona for a change. I'm in November and what I suspected is simply becoming the truth, you can have the best players in the world and it makes no difference. Messi, despite taking all free kicks, managed 1 goal from a freekick and puts about 1 in ten on target. Most of them either go in the wall or over. There's an insane amount of blocked shots and an insane amount of shots going wide (this is nothing new btw it's been in the game for years). If three of the world's best strikers fail to get a shot on target from within the box there's clearly something wrong there.  Three of my conceded goals happened because my last defender decided to just stand there with the ball till the opposing attacker took it off him and scored. To illustrate this, and mind you this is not the only game this happened just the most extreme example, I give you the stats of my game against leganes which ended in a narrow one-nil victory: 47 shots on goal, 22 corners and five clear cut chances. Their, injured, goalie made 12 saves and got a 6.8 (!) rating. The tactic doesn't call for long shots or taking shots whenever they can yet Messi only put 2 out of his 9 shots on target (and missed a penalty), Alcacer 1 in 6, Iniesta 4 in 11 and Rakitic 4 in 14. Now in what world is this still a sim?			"

												This is a very frustrating game, there are very few issues with the game play, in fact in terms of game play I would say that this is one of the best FM games in recent years. My issue is that around 60%-70% of the games crash (I have had to play a game three times). The big issue is that I played a game was winning on three occasions and the game kept crashing, on the fourth attempt I lost the match.

												Exact same thing as FM2016. No tangible overall improvements. Improvements in match engine were offset with new bugs with said engine/ incompetent AI with the spatial awareness of John Stones. Negotiating Contracts offer more options, but somehow feels more like a chore than ever. Lets not even get into man/team management regarding ""player concerns"". I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone. Not even fans from championship manager days			"

												This game feels like the developers have just watched the excellent Trading Places and said, ""Wouldn't it be great if we Louis (Dan Aykroyd) the managers, you know, just for a laugh? But keep turning the screw until it breaks.""It seems to defeat the enjoyment to be had in playing strategy/management type games, of meeting challenges, learning to cope and turn events around to hopefully win, when the AI decides to take over and throw all your carefully crafted work out the window for the rest of a season. You're no longer in charge, and the game is no longer a game but a series of disheartening events.Welcome to Football Manager 2017			"

												First of all I don't agree with the vast majority that say that this game is worse than last year!Is this the best game they made until now? For me it isn't, the best one for me was FM2012, with 2015 close by. However they made some slight improvements to the match engine in this one and they update how some B teams work in the leagues that have this system and that is way better than the way it was on FM2016 were you will never use your B teams, because they were usuless. Is it still worth it buying it? Yes I would say so since I found 2016 the most boring game they made because the match engine was completly broken, and in that way didn't allow you to enjoy the game. Is this game worth full price? No I don't think so and I bought it outside of steam for a cheaper price, otherwise I would not be playing it. But I do recommend it when the game hits a sale of at least 50%. And because of this I will give it a positive review, and because I think it improved in relation to FM2016.			"

												I like the few changes that are made in the menu's and how FM presents information. There are much statistics and pre- and post game information that makes you feel that you can actually impact what happens on the pitch; However, that feeling is brutally killed by the match engine. I don't mind the graphics being so poor that it looks like a game from 2009 or the goalkeepers being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but I do mind that feeling of the game's outcome being pre- decided (most often not in your favor). And no matter what you do, or whitch tactics you choose, I never get the feeling that I'm actually changing anything or giving my team better chances. I've experimented and tried various tactics and approaches, but I still feel like an observer to my own funeral, with nothing to say, or do, to impact the outcome. I don't mind losing, but at least show me why I'm losing. Instead of my team hitting the post four times and missing a penalty, and then conceding in the 80th minute on the first half chance the opposition gets, five matches in a row!			"

												FM 2017 is essentially FM 2016 with a minor change of number in the title (the number ""6"" at the end of the game's title has been replaced by a ""7"") except for the fact that it has also become worse than its predecessor. Far too much priority was spent on including pointless features rather than improving the clear, obvious issues that FM gamers have been ranting about for the past few years. For instance, world class footballers continue to blast the ball over the bar from six yards out 15 times a match, and opposition players manage to score goals from tight angles by crossing the ball and it taking a deflection off of thin air and bouncing past a goalkeeper that looks like he has consumed a barrel of beer and been blindfolded, just for the commentary to cry, ""What a goal! He certainly didn't mean that!"" Well no, he certainly did not mean for his cross to strike a slab of dark matter floating inside of the six yard box which bounced the ball past the goalkeeper. Not even the laws of astrophysics meant for that to happen. But nevermind that, there is a new social media feature in the game! And the boring, repetitive post-match interviews which have been unchanged from FM 1826 are still there to be replied to! Anyway, FM itself is still amazing and the love of my life (sort of), but these issues demand ranting after so much money has been spent on the game. And despite all this ranting, I am going to continue smashing the game away!			"

												I bought this game in Beta, and tried it out.. As excepted a lot of errors and bugs made the game very hard, like injury spree where players constantly got injuried.Now we're 20 days into the full release and a bug with defenders acting like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ still isnt fixed. On their official forum they won't even reqinize this as a bug. They state they need ""more info"" even though you find 10-20 different examples with plenty of attached pkm files for the dev team to look into.They have a very arrogant way of telling you that you're wrong. If you report (taking another's case) that you as Tottenham managed to beat Arsenal 10-0 in a normal league match 3 years in, the moderator will reject the case stateting that ""3 years in, everything can happen"". As soon as the author posts back that Arsenal finished over Tottenham the past 2 season he just don't respond back.Another case, a manager managing Frankfurt wins massive games and just roll over Bayern Munich massively. Still not accepting this to be a issue..The goalkeepers are acting weird and so are the defenders. Lets take one last example from my own game.I have a DL about to clear a ball (all alone), he somehow manage to pass it back to goalkeeper eventhough it would be more realistic for him to run and play the ball up the field of clear out to throwin. He pass the ball back and the goalkeeper wont take the ball with the hands and just walks to it, and let it pass under him resulting in a own goal. I mean, WTF right?.. Well the goalkeeper gets a massive score drop (from 8 -> 5) and the DL gains score after that, and the DL is credited as own goal.After that indident I have a poor keeper in score with low selfeseem infront after 60 mins of play with 5-1 and end up losing 5-7 to a team in the bottom with only a few points.The game is broken, their support is non-existance and considering they haven't even started working on the patch we can expect this game to be broken for a while.I can't believe how poor i feel about this game. FM2016 was so perfect, and yet FM2017 is so far away from perfection as possible.DO NOT BUY AND SUPPORT SEGA - BUY FM16 INSTEAD!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!			"

												Worst Football Manager ever. Fm 2016 wasnt great but this one is even worse.Problems are always the same. players do stupid things way to often. even if your tactic is decent and worked in every Fm ( when i say work, i mean win more than lose ofc..) it doesnt work here. u can have control and u have 30% ball possession...makes no sense.70% of goals i concede is a shot from a defender to their striker isolated. i dont think thats realistic to happen all the time.Doesnt matter what u change. if game decided u ll lose. u ll lose no matter what u do...Only good thing is interface is slighty better . but for a 50 euro game is too pricy for playing with same database all the time.....Crap crap game , dont buy this. and hope another company release a good manager game...

												I think I should preface my review by stating I am a long time FM (and CM) player with well over 10,000 hours logged since my first game back in 1998. To get the nice words out of the way, FM17 looks very nice. Social feed clogs everything up but on the whole, a nice visual change (albeit small) from 16. Matchday looks good so no complaints there. And now onto the bad. I remember reading a review from earlier which stated that FM17 had embraced this identity of a get the slightest thing wrong (team-talk, group meeting, flexibility etc etc) and you will get absolutely pasted and to a certain extent, that summation is correct. Since about '14 we have seen this to be more and more accurate. But for such a framework to exist, there HAS to be some kind of continuity with which things like team-talks & formations work. Team-talks are easiest to focus in this example. Game A, your team talk makes your players focused and they dominate the game and win. Game B, similar opposition, players are focused and you get pasted 5-0. There is absolutely 0 feedback to tell you what you are doing is correct because there is no continuity to assure you.Then we move onto discipline, penalties and injuries. You will rarely see the AI give away a penalty, get injured or get red-carded. You can be sure that your team will get 1, 2 or even all 3 happen to you in one game.It feels like SI have gone out of their way to make the game difficult which is all well and good. But they have gone beyond difficult and created a system which NO-ONE understands. The best analogy I can come up with to represent this is this. If I put my hand in fire, it hurts. I know not to put my hand in fire. I learn. Whereas the SI approach dictates that sometimes you can put your hand in fire and win a new car. Other times you 'might' get hurt. There is ZERO system in place to help you learn. All you can do is guess. Very, very disappointing and very, very boring. Poor show SI. Poor show.			"

												Not as good as it used to be, the depth and knowledge of players and clubs, is always impressive with Football Manager games. But they need to bring more into the game make it more fun to play as with this latest edition it just feels like it offers nothing new & exciting, i agree with people saying its more or less 2016's game with a new skin. It defeinitely feels like they have got lazy and complacent, because lets be honest they have no legitmate compeition, which will always lead to them cutting corners. The press conferences are the same old, boring. I just click anything most of the time to get it over with as quickly as possible. Players still do very strange things on the 3D match engine, I have seen players just standing still watching the ball stuck in one positon while they just stand their, neither team making an effort to take over possession of the ball. I hope they will put a lot more into the next additon of FM otherwise for the first time in over 10 years I wont be buying it.I wish LMA manager would make a comeback :(			"

												i've been playing FM since 11 and been a big fan of the game, and never had any issues with it until 16, i liked 14 and 15 and i still play 15 when i get bored with the stupidity of this one! (played 15 over 2000 something hours, that's how much i enjoyed it and i still do) 16 was the worst FM game ever made!! 17, still bad, really bad, not as bad as 16, but bad, i mean yeah, new staff roles are kind of cool, even though some of them are absolutely pointless! but game logic? i see some others mentioned it, but come on man, 30 shots on goal but only 1 or 2 goals? and opposition gets 2 chances and scores them both? even though they are not a high level team nor have a good striker for that matter? that's just absurd, i mean sure, there should be some diffculties to the game, otherwise you keep dominating, but make them sensiblei set up the best backroom staff that i can, best physios, club doctor, best fitness coaches and still my players gets injured very often and not even minor injuries, lots of major ones, if hiring the best of best is not going to make any difference, then what's the point of spending all your time to find the best coaches and physios? what's the point of the attributes of coaches and physios if they are not going to make any difference?seriously, SI, you are losing us!for 18 you guys should make some real changes, i'm not talking about what you did for 17, just some minor changes from 16 and here's a new game! you ripped us off!most fans of the game had problems with 16 and yet you didn't care, you didn't listen to them, all you did just a little tweak here and there, but not good enough tweaks! and here is 17!, seriously try to go couple years back, try to make the game as good as it was back in 14 or 15, using some celebrities for some weird ads on net, not going to make the game any better, make some real changes, give us something better, most fans been loyal to the game for years and this is how you are paying us back for our loyalty? with an over-priced s****y game?yes, making the game a little harder could be good, because i used to just dominate the league and CL, but make it in a way that makes sense, not in a way that makes you want to destroy your computer because even though your team gets more than enough chances to score 3-4 goals and that you have a good striker, but yet can only score one against a fairly weak opponent or where tactics doesn't matter,so no matter how much you work on finding the best tactic for your team, it's not going to make that big of a difference, because of the game mechanism, you still end up having the same problemsyes, add new staff roles, but ones that are actually useful and makes a difference, don't add something useless just for the sake of giving us something new, yes, we would love to see new staff roles or some new features of the game, but we want them to make the game better, to add something to itfor 18, do something good, because right now, i'd rather play 15 or go way back and play CM 07 or 08, instead of playing 16 or 17, we've been loyal fans for years, you should be loyal to your fans as well, don't try to rip us off, because we may be loyal now, for the sake of the past, but sure as hell won't stay loyal to a company that doesn't give a damn about what we think and giving us some s****y versions of a game we love and making us like it less and less every year, so don't take your fans for granted, some other game companies did the same, with different football manager games, and they lost their fans and now those games are just history, that's what happens when you don't give your fans what they want and when you try to rip them of, so take it serious, give us something good, something really good, because if you fail us for another year, FM is going to be history as well!

												I buy FM every couple of years in the hope that some key aspects of the game that calls itself a simulation will be fixed. In 2017 version the problems are the same as always. Dumb AI which removes fun and challenge from the game, lack of AI team building skills, lack of AI rotation and training skills. To be fair, this hasn't changed since 97 my first CM game, another thing that hasnt changed is the exact same path to success. I take a League 2 club in England, get promoted first season, finish in the top 2 in the next 2 seasons and bam premiership. Than it will usually be mid-table first season, maybe Europe qulaification, top 4 next season and after that winning everything every year. This exact path happens with any club I take, using exactly the same tactics, every year of FM in the last 20 years. I dont rotate tactics, I dont tweak them I play the same tactic all the time, every match. Each mid season I get most of my players on free transfer as I never have any money, I focus on the best coaches and scouts I can get and make sure I have 2 players for each position. In lower leagues the loan system makes it easy to get 4 top players for your team especially if you get someone like Chelsea as your parent club. I did in my latest run with Blackpool. So I ask myself if I do the exact same thing for the last 15-20 years and get exactly the same results what has all the development led to. We get more fluff, media, social, (ok the stadia is nice) players morale, agents, etc etc but those are all just addons, the core game has not improved. So should you buy it? Not if you have any of the previosus versions. If the game is new to you than yeah. Personally I am dissapointed that in the 20 something editions the core game has not been improved at all.IN my steam library I have over 700 hours in fm2013, over 800 in fm2015 and now 90 or so in fm2017. Really disappointing. !!!!Here is some advice to devs - teach AI how to build squads and to rotate players, make sure that their team doesnt have half of the first 11 with 80% fitness when I play them towards the end of the season. I can manage my squad on the lowest average attendance and lowest salary, rotate it and finish first without problems. My team of talented free transfers should not be able to storm the league. I do want to fight to avoid relegation, I do want to stay in a certain league for a couple of seasons, I do want to have time to develop players, at the moment I change the squad drastically every year untill I get to winning champions league. My rise should not be guaranteed!!!			"

												This is argueably the best FM till now. On the other side, the difference between 2017 and 2016 is too little to justify the retail price of 55 euros. Football Manager 2017 seems to me more like a small patch of 2016 with some updated stats of the players, something that also happened in 2016 in comparison to 2015. In my opinion the developers are out of their minds thinking these minor changes justify this retail price for a game that is basically a re-released, patched version of last year. This shall be the last FM i shall buy. "

Posted: November 13, 2016
												I am honestly going to have to bite the bullet here, but it is something I should do, and something I realized after playing with my friend, I have to do for conscious sake.Awhile ago, I made a scathing review on the game. Calling out many of its supposed faults, and criticizing its apparent randomness at times.Moreover, although there are bugs, as there are in every game. (Videos online will show goalies just throwing the ball to the opposing player, which are funny, but frustrating.)I do not feel I am able, in good heart and intention to give the game a bad review.Initially, I posted a bad review with 75% favorable rating and 85 of 116 people finding it useful, and although it is my highest ever review, I honestly believe people just hate on the game because many of them do not understand Football. I realize, I sure didn't. I made these seemingly unstoppable tactics, that would work for a bit, and fall apart, or I would have downloaded tactics that worked for 90% of the people except me, random goals going in at random times of the game, back and forth stuff.Honestly? I am an idiot. The game plays great once you start sitting down, and putting time into your players, your coaches, your strengths, and weaknesses, the game fully comes to life.I had a friend, who has played 1000's of hours throughout the FM games, who stopped to help me with some of my tactics, we spent several hours going through players, my tactics, my squad's abilities, shortfalls, and the like. After he had offered some critical analysis and fine tuning of my tactical approaches, I began winning. I started doing things to fit the complexity of the game.See, the thing is I think most of the people on here ranting about the game being horrible, are like myself. Over-zealous football fans who attempt to reflect the ideal tactic in their head. Many of these self-proclaimed managers will try these, and get mad when they do not work. Despite not looking farther under the surface. The games complexities are both shockingly beautiful, and somewhat scary, with hundreds of different combinations running at a single time calculating what the player will do realistically. Those random short goals I had been on the opposing end of, were because of a lack of mental ability in my players. They simply were not able to focus and stay working for a full 90 minutes. After I had destroyed most of my defense core in favor of mentally sound players first, with the others coming secondary, I began to notice a stark difference in my previous attempts, as opposed to my revamped force. They were taking the field in style, pushing down when I said to push, retreating at the right times, their heads were in the game. This is why I cannot in good heart give the game a bad review. The game has seemingly infinite complexity through player choice, decisions, and behind the scenes rolls. A player with great stats might do good for 20 minutes of the game, and fall apart to a worse player, who puts his heart on the pitch for the full 90 minutes and starts to pick the more skilled man apart. I do realize that some people who play the game have a lot of previous experience with football games, and although I do not put their opinions on the hotpan, I do think that some of them are mis-informed, or simply not trying to change, perhaps to a excess of hubrus. Despite the reason, at the end of the day, Football Manager 2017 is much improved in terms of mental A.I on the pitch, many bug fixes, and the dreaded cross storm from last year.If you like the Fm series this game is definitly a must buy.If you are interested in what I had said in my previous review, I will keep it posted below for those curious.A weight off my shoulders, for good reason.-JeepThis game is garbage. Zero innovation, nothing has changed. Literally, watch a FM17 video on youtube and compare it to 16, they literally updated rosters and reuploaded it. U.I the same, Match engine the same, (Player decisions were apparently improved despite them STILL doing random glitchy stupid things.) You wouldn't even notice it was a different game.Crosses, although drastically reduce, count for a ridiculous portion of goals scored still.Random unexplainable breakdowns in this game are ridiculous. I swear half of them are thrown in just for drama, leading 5-0 at the second half, they score 1, 2, 3, all in 5 minutes. I sub, make changes, talk to my players, 4, I change more. 5, 6, and I lose at the end of the game 7-5, despite being full defensive and parking the bus, against a team half my size and skill, they make a 7 goal comeback? Okay?.... There are many other situations like this, this just being the most recent before I RQ.The game hasn't had anything changed, the game is still random in scoring, look at other reviews other than my own. Unexplainable action players take despite player instruction riddle this game with randomness and half of your players don't listen to your tactics.Another recent example from my game, I have a Short foot to foot passing on, dribbling there way up the pitch once control is established. That's the idea, but does he follow it? Of course not! Once we acquire the ball, he hurdles up the side of the pitch (against no dribbling instruction) cuts into the middle (despite me telling plays to maintain their shape and position on the field) and B-lines the god damn ball across the entire field into the chest of an opposing fullback, the ball comes back down the pitch and I get scored on. This game is ridiculous with random breakdowns, defensive breakdowns, random inability to score halfway through the season despite being 1st place and most in scoring prior. SUDDENLY they cannot finish to save their lives. I want to say it is just the players on that team, but I cant, because looking at other reviews, everyone is having this problem. Not to mention it happens on 3 different teams I have tried playing as. You can have an entire team filled with hard working determined players who are not supposed to quit playing until the end of the game and give their heart. But they suddenly get complacent anyway and lead to goals against and you lose the game.I am serious when I say, this game will make the most calm person into a raging lunatic watching every single lead they establish in a game fall away because players quit listening to instructions halfway through the game and lead to blowouts from teams 2 leagues below you.And before anyone pulls the card that I just not know what I am doing, I have played FM games since 2013, take a look at my steam library. This game is just bad, no innovation, nothing improved, same seemingly random match engine, if you want to pay full price for an updated roster of 2016, then its just as good or better. But if you paid full price expecting a new completed game with fun features and the horrible match engine finally patched, it's literally a copy and paste.4/10EDIT: Love losing my final game because despite me teling my keeper less risky passes, pass it short, AND distribute to defenders, he take the ball and punts it up field and brings it back to score on me. Just happened. I swear to god I woudn't rage at this game so much if the A.I listened to basic commands like PASS IT SHORT.			"

												This game is too expensive for the changes that have been made. Slightly better AI behaviour in game engine but players still doing sh*t moves. Big addition THE SOCIAL MEDIA is interesting maybe for a half of season then it became boring. You do better if you'll update data for your last Football Manager and pray for rocking FM18! On the other hand I can't figure out what to bring to the table with new manager. Right now it's complex and lovely game.			"

												Same♥♥♥♥♥♥different year.Been playing this for the past 6 iterations and its been steadily going down the drain. It is beyond me how SI fleeces $60 for what is basically a database update and and adding a different color to the interface. Its like paying for a game just to get a DLC.Coming to the actual game,the game engine is horrible.You rarely go through a match that has some semblence of reality. Unrealistic stats like having 20 shots a game and 1 goal. Defenders just stand ball watching and half the time the GK gets hand to ball only for it to deflect into the net. Incredbly high number of goals allowed at near post from impossible angles.Players rarely follow instructions no matter how you do it. I had some success having my fullbacks do overlaps but that's the extent of it.Also,the transfers are ridiculous. I agree that clubs dont want to sell highly rated youngsters but demanding $140M for an 18 yr old??? ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥!!Please DO NOT buy!!			"

												Been a huge fan of FM for many years. However this game just baffles me... Having read some negative comments recently, unfortunately I have to side with them. I understand you have to be patient for your tactics to gel, and in every team I have. But surely when you keep having 30-40 shots a game compared to the oppositions 5-10 I should be winning or at least drawing games... But nope, you come up against mid level/lower teams who have hardly scored (Average less than a goal a game) then you lose 0-3, 0-2, 1-3, or the last minute 0-1 because of a mistake by your defender usually...I've alternated with different tactics, all with the familiarity high same thing keeps happening. Then you play the so called bigger teams and I always seem to well against them. Unfortunately FM this is the last time I will be purchasing this franchise game. It's just not consistent.			"

												It is what it is. The game is well established and I've loved it since old Championship Manager days before they changed franchise. It does keep getting better, and this version is probably the least needing 'patches' I can remember from any version.BUT.....the business model of releasing a new version every 12 month and then charging full price imvho is not worth the £/$'s for what extra you get on the previous year's version. Especially as you can get community led transfer updates etc (or do them yourself in the editor).SI the publisher have made it clear that they can't/won't get away from that annual release business plan but £20-30+ for an annual update is down to you whether it's worth it. For me it's not. Maybe buy it every 2-3 years to see real bang for your buck in improvements?Tactics wise it's more complex than ever and if I were a new player to the game I am not sure I'd cope. It's a massive (and brutal) steep learning curve as it's so in-depth. And sometimes things can go wrong for your team without knowing why unless you're deeply in to the game. There's a balance of realism or fun, and again that's for you to decide. One person's poison is another's pleasure etc.			"

												I've bought and played CM/FM since Championship Manager 2 and this is the first year where I can honestly say I haven't enjoyed the game.I find the tactic system this year to be far too forced. If I want to play leaving the majority of my tactics up to my *cough* world class *cough* assistant manager, I'll be lucky to see out the season before I get sacked. If I dive into the tactics and give it my all, even using the tactics posted on the workshop which claim to be amazing, I still lose games I really shouldn't.Also, I know the amount of money in football is becoming ludicrous these days but to even talk to a player in FM I have to triple or even quadruple their value, and good luck getting hold of cheap youngsters; if you are a big club they expect big money, sometimes £10-20m for players that aren't even good enough to be in the first team at lesser clubs, ridiculous.I'm at a loose-end. If you look at my played times for the last few years FM games, you'll see 1000+, 2000+ hours, but I just can't stomach it this year. I can only hope that SI have seen just how negative the reviews have been this year and get on and fix the game for next year.I want to be able to play my deeply immersive football management sim again without having to be a professional tactician.

												Whatever the game is or not, the match engine is bad. If you're gonna lose a game, you most definitely will. I honestly couldnt bear with the stupidity of the AI. For example, I want my striker to defend corners, so what he does is clears the ball at the near post, and his very next instinct is to run back to his position upfield regardless of where the rebound goes,  i mean the ball could be 10 yards away from but he WILL not retrieve it, he'd rather let the full back deal with it who is guarding the post, HE heads the ball and bam starts running upfield. I could go on and on( seriously there are a lot of match engine bugs) but i think i've mde my point and barring a massive overhaul in the match engine this is the last FM im buying and this is coming from a 6 year loyalist. 10/10 would rip the match engine open			"

As an football coach in real life you can't think you will succed every single time. WIth United in 6 years won 2 times Champions, 4 times Premier, 2 or 3 FA Cups, lost world cup final...

												I believe that the match engine/experience itself hasn't progressed as needed considering all the bells and whistles that have been added in the last 3 or 4 years.The lack of feedback on what's going on in the match is becoming a serious issue hampering aspiring managers in the game. I shouldn't need to watch a full match of repetitive scripted animations that has no resemblance to real football whatsoever to try to spot a gap in midfield, A player tackling too hard or a full back moving two steps forward than needed. Especially when you give us an ME that's a crossing fest like last year.Here is a list of concerns:- Ratings:I remember on the good old days if I had all my team on 8's and two players on 6 then they are not performing and probably this is the cause of my worries. Now it seems that if all your players are on 7's and you are 3-0 down its fine because and I quote one of the deluded mods on SI forums :""Player ratings are an indicator of how your players are performing up to that point.. not any kind of indicator on the match or the opposition as a whole, Just because your players have ok ratings, doesn't mean they are doing what they need to be doing to win."" - Player performance/Body language:Again it has no clear meaning and is detached from the match engine completely. Even SI can't provide an actual explanation on how it works just like team talks. Does anyone actually use it?For example how can everyone be playing okay when we are 2 or 3 nil down? ....Or a scenario where all the goals come through our right back and it says the left back is having a bad game and ignores the actual cause.... Unless the ME is not consistent with the other features and is very limited in what it shows us.- As for the ME itself, I'll ignore the 3D animations because I don't think it's that important how it looks as long as it plays right.I remember playing 2D on FM 2008 and being able to differentiate between a pacey skillful player or a player with vision. Now it's just a player running in a straight line then crossing or a silly scramble where everyone stands like a scarecrow.The commentary at that time gave us hints about how the game is going. In 2016 the commentary is the same if not worse considering the limitations they had in the past.By 2017 I'd expect to see one twos, triangles, proper sweeper adaptation and maybe some more physicality. I expect the commentary to talk about a lot lot more.It's frustrating when you spend 2 hours tuning your tactics and going through all these fancy positions and roles and shapes to end up with 3 identical crossed goals, A bad backpass or a player with a longshot stat of 2 scoring 3 screamers for the first time in their career.The new features are an absolute joke, Instead of enhancing team talks, press conferences and giving us a stadium creator with a kit designer and sponsor choices, We end up with a face generator and a twitter gimmick that adds nothing to the game and is better implemented in iPad games.Of course on their official forums, You get some nazi level of modding that prevents anyone from expressing any concern, And a number of users that act like hunting dogs for their masters going around insulting the intelligence of everyone. FM 15 had games ending 7-4 5-3 and it was never addressed. FM 16 had crossed goals domingating the game with fullbacks winning player of the year awards constantly and this year it’s just a patch that fixese these two issues!! "

												I played this game for free over the weekend to see if it's really shity as the say it is. and my conclusion is if you manage to get through the social media ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to the playing part, the game might be good, it has nice mechanism, tactics are tuned, finally the team actually plays the way you set them up(after so many years).Although the players development system is a surprisingly shity after so many years, game itself would be great if not for so much spam, but man do they spam. I wish I had adblock installed in this game. this is a sports social media simulation with option for player database and tactics if you want. the only thing you must do is recieve social media spam; for everything else you can delegate someone else to do it :D it they remove social media from next release, together with new database, they will already improve a lot from this year. I would not reccomend this game at full price because social media and others already paid half of that price prior to release.  "

												the last football manager i purchased was 2012 which was pretty decent, clocked up countless hours and managed to get past 2060 a couple of times.  this game however i cant even get to december 2016 without getting sacked.  ive tried about 5 times managing blackpool all with complete failure.  i managed to get promoted one season with a bit of saving to get past the playoffs but after a couple of months i was dragged into the dropzone.  i got called into the boardroom where i was told i had to win the next game to keep my job; it was a cup game which i won on penalties and yet still got sacked.  very annoying.and now to top it off, im for some reason having to reinstall fm17 again.  i like a challenge but come on.

												Have been playing football manager since it was known as championship managerOverall game medicore  AI needs vastly improvement and priority attention to be competitive and enjoyable game but nothing is done. Every edition is just tinker and looping Match engine back and forth and add in new database a new year version is releasedThis year the wideplayer is not effective you would go wilth 2 or 3 strikers and centralise formation then next version the wide becomes more effective and vice versa. endless loopingWhat a joke to thrash and humiliate Big teams domestic and europe as a smaller club. While in real life nobody enjoy playing against them and fear them. Attribute a trash in this game as the ME decides the attribute of players. My 7 passing fullback doing switch ball to other flanks. what a joke. and my arsenal francis coqeuelin scoring goals for fun.look at loki doki experimental youtube video you will be horrify to see how bad the game AI is finding and transfer players but that only a part of it. Social media and brexit is pretty much trash and repetitve to be ignoreIronically they feel Steam negative review was because of the chinese unhappy player.Positive thing is the injury is more realistic as older FM there is no reason to have a bigger squad and injuries is so rare same starting 11 every game week in week out.Contract negotiation has been positive as we players exploit AI and gives medicore contract to our favour but now agent staff and players now has chance to force you into  submitting into their offer or lose him.Stop tinkering your ME and improve your game AI.

												First review i ever wrote. This is more of a complaint or disconcerning fact. I decided to enroll as a manager for Chelsea, had a great season up until the 6th round of the FA-cup. As usual i saved my game before i started up the match vs. a Luton in quite a form. I went through the motions, did what adjustments I had done and had success with throughout the season, end result 0-7 to Luton. I thought to meself ""okelidoki.. let's try this again with the same line-up."" 2-8 to Luton. I ran that match 13 times with different line-ups and tactics, losing 11 and drawing 2 of those 13 matches. biggest loss was at a whopping 3-12. So i contacted the developers about this, and they reassured me that everything was in order that one of the world leading major teams could lose to a Skybet league 2 team 13 times in a row and bla. bla .bla. since i do not condone idiocy, i uninstalled this game of random outcome and i shall never again return to this outlet of my frustration, and neither should you. Spare yourself, be at peace knowing that in a righteouss and realistic world, Luton would never hammer an in form Chelsea, and those who dare to venture such an opinion... there's really nothing to be said about that.P.S read an article covering the developers of the FM franchise, 3% watches football regularly... could explain the absolutely unprecedentet incompetence of the creators this game mirrors. Wouldn't trust them to have the know-how of how to apply a condom, not to mention develop a game.			"

												I love Football Manager and I played all the games in the series since 2003. But the last two years I am deeply dissapointed. I paid a lot of money to buy this game and I feel the creators stopped caring about the game and are looking only to grab our money. This year the game have also none improvement. It's like I'm playing a slightly revised version of FM16. Match Engine once again is bad, and I know that it is a football manager game and not FIFA but it is 2017, we want an dramatic improvement. Conclusion: This could be a good purchase if it costed half the money. It does not worth this amount of money they asking. Its just FM16 with new name and a very few tweaks. I'm starting to feel I'm beeing robbed.			"

												This is the first time i buy Football manager game since 2013. I can see the major difference between these 2 version, but still beside the updated players database which for me to play the new one, i would rather ask for refund for this.The most severe issue is your match tactic doesn't making any sense. You are 0-2 down at the first half against a weaker team, much weaker team, and the shoot chance is about 10-2. You make changes in the changing room, whole team speed up, put more player to attacking, remove defensive midfielder and replace with a strike. Final score still 0-2, shoot chance is 11-2, one long shoot added in the second half. Wow! Brilliant.I played against Man City in FA cup quarter final, Man city put out several teenager in first starting line up which i never remember their names. I am leading the Premier league with massive advantage, and i field almost full first team in this match. I lose the game with 1-3, which Iheanacho scored an hat-trick, which currently lacking match fitness, only played 4 games with 20 games available. Nevermind, i want to do experiement that how many times i am gonna repeat the game until i win the game, i save and reload. The second time i win 4-0, which limit them with 1 shoot only. I changed nothing about the tactic, player and teamtalk. So conclusion, it's freaking random. RANDOM. And you are powerless to change that!			"

												Uptaded version of FM 10,11,12,13,14,15.16. Nothing changes but the price. Any player that plays FM can see thousands of problems in this game but the developer company still keeps the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ Budget of this game is over million dollars therefore I think that you should be able to have at least real logos of teams and photos of every player on the game. As a manager you should have also a social life on the game or at least you should be able to buy some♥♥♥♥♥♥with your money. In low leagues like Norway, Serbia, Greece or Crotia wonderkids must be low-priced. Just check the real life, there are many players who get sold less than 5M Euro. Anyway this is FM so we ll keep buying Jackson, so you ll change nothing as old.			"

												I will always recommend FM as it is a very addictive game... but not this one. The main issues I am currently experiencing is the inconsistencies between your teams crossing and the AI teams. When you cross (if your team decides to do so), it gets defended, saved, cleared etc. When they cross, your team seems to just stop, it manages to drop perfectly in between both centre backs who have actually sandwiched the striker. He scores.. and again. It seems like every cross or shot my team faces, they score. Might as well have sticks and gloves in goal rather than Lloris. My team are slow to make any decision and gets tackled. The AI can do anything they want. Consistent 6.5 and below match ratings. Hardly even draw. I have won just as many as I have lost. S.I NEED to patch the crossing and non existent goalkeepers. Beyond a joke. I may get used to it or I might go back to FM16. We shall see.			"

												The game does not change very much from edition to edition. In fact, the updates they do provide could probably be done by a much smaller team than SI have.I do not agree with how they handle marketing, or how they treat fans. They rewarded them this year with a discount based on how many games they already own, which is  brilliant but they barely announced any new features before this reward was out of date. Not exactly fantastic from them.SI do not foster much love from the commnity, reguarly coming into confrontations with fans. The community itself does not foster much love from each other though, so both sides are responsible.The game is still good though, even if it isn't perfect. If you enjoyed FM16, or FM15 or before you might enjoy this game. Each successive game technically gets better, though everyone will have their favourite version.If you do not compare it to it's predecessors, and count out the fact it is practically a reskin and a paid update then you'll realise it is actually a very good game, and easy to sink plenty of hours into - as is proven by the statistics.

												Ive never played a more frustrating game. Every single game, i have 15 to 20 shots on target, the other team has 4 or 5 and  I end up losing. Now I know what people are thinking, get a new striker. But it makes no difference what strikers I use. It makes no difference what tactical changes I make. Ive just played a game where ive had 13 shots on goal and not scored any, my opposition had three shots on goal, all on target and theyve all gone in. Its not just an isolated incident, it happens every single game I play. I am convicned the AI teams are  weighted against a human player.It would also help if the devs actually understood the offside rule. So many times ive seen players (on both sides) that were inline with the last defender or even massively onside, be ruled offside.			"

Took a break with FM 2016 and now I got 2017.I played over 170 hrs and I am quite sure that if nothing major comes through I will not continue to play the series.All in all here are some of my thoughts. Some bugs are there even 17.2.0. SI comunication with the comunity is poor. They los a lot of licenses and that affects the feeling you while playing. I know you can get club badges and names from comunity but still is annoying. Sometime it gets frustrating with all the injuriesSome teams and players are overrated and I talk about small leagues especially.  "

												I've been playing since the 90s and really enjoyed the experience. Until now. I just can't get figure out how to win anymore. I've used my own experience, plus all the expertise available on various websites to try and succeed in the game, but it has defeated me, It seems the AI is just too smart. It's the same pattern with just about any game I play: I work hard to build a tactic and team do well then for no reason I get beaten every game with my team not even getting close. And there seems no way around it. If you change things around the players play like they've never met each other, but if you leave things alone the AI has you sussed and snuffs you out. It's just not enjoyable anymore, and it's such a shame.			"

A Backup player will kick off at the age of 34 for not playing games, you'll agree to sell him and the rest of the squad will become unhappy, and that'll leave you being unable to score goals and conceeding for days even though you have 2 top class strikers with service every game and the best defence in the leaue prior the conversation.Not worth £19.99 this year never mind £34.99.

												There has been quite a bit of negative reviews assocaited with this game. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. That is great.For my opinion, I'd say this is the best game in recent years. However, I will say there are nuances that are annoying.The match engine itself has had a massive upgrade and it's noticeable. However, with that massive upgrade, it created issues in the 3D match engine. They significantly tried to reduce the OP part of crossing from fullbacks/wingbacks generating 20-30 assists a season in FM16. To do this, they've changed the way wingbacks/fullbacks operate. Wingbacks/fullbacks hold the ball way to long before crossing so nearly all crosses are blocked or honestly just poor crosses. The play looks choppy/unintelligent when the wingback/fullback is yards past the defender, but then holds the ball for 2-3 seconds and allows the defender to catch up so he can block the cross.Goalkeepers are....interesting at the best of times, and just laughable at the worst of times. There's also still the weird issue (I'd say bug) where the opposition will score their 1st shot on goal on approximately 60% of the attempts. It won't be a clear cut or half chance, it'll just be a weird shot that goes in. It is what it is. Also, it's much more difficult to use a plug and play tactic. That plug and play tactic will generally be successful for you I'm sure. But if you're truly looking for an unbeaten season without reloading, minor changes will occur during the season as the opposition will learn/adapt to your style, as well as in game, quirky things happen. This is similar to real life. At any time, some team can beat another team. It happens.People also complain about injuries. Yes they are an issue; but I suggest you look at your the teams in the league you watch and see how many teams have 2-5 players injured at any given time, for small 5-15 day injuries plus the long term injuries too. Injuries are in part, down to your tactic, your training intensity, lack of rotation etc. Another thing that loses it's useful/entertaining aspect of it, is the social media addition. It's great for 3-4 games. Then it's very repetitive and worthless.All in all, the game is overly positive, I just wanted to lay out a few negative issues so that people are aware of them, and they know what to expect going in. I'd recommend the game.			"

												Pfffff the game is about the same♥♥♥♥♥♥as last year except the match engine is ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥poor pigshit..Basically♥♥♥♥♥♥like:players getting constant red cards , ♥♥♥♥ing plaques of injuries (for example luis gustavo just came back from his red card suspention got sent off after 20 mins or something.♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine that was reworked to nerf inside forward now you cant get inside forwards like yarmolenko , draxler etc to perform consistently..Theres often ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ happens in the matter of : your goalkeeper kicks kicks the ball at a opposition and they score..Happens quite often.Repetitive boring teamtalks .. Unconsistency and RANDOMNESS in the match engine..But a consistent theme of SAME EXACT goals going in against you mainly wingbacks peeling off and crossing on ANY TACTIC including top forum tactics (before you start saying♥♥♥♥♥♥like of your tactic is poor) no SAME♥♥♥♥♥♥with top forum tactics btw if you carefully read then there arent actually too many working formations atm and any kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥you try is unconsistent ..the only thing that has any kind of consistency at all is if you play CANCER NARROW 4-3-1-2 or some kind of 5-3-2 wingback formation without wingers and even that tends to be sketchy and concedes rediculous but repetitive goals..read reviews and see...I played fm since 2006 the game is more cancer than ever ..Absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥dont buy!I TRIED VARIUS FORUM TACTICS AND SYSTEM AND CURRENTLY I UNINSTALLED THE GAME DUE TO SHITNESS OF MATCH ENGINE			"

												As a new member of the FM community, I personally don't see what all of the negative reviews are about. It may not be terribly different from FM 2016, but the level of vitrol over that seems... excessive. Personally, I find consistency to be rather positive in a long-running series such as this. And while sometimes wonky things can happen with the match results (22 shots on target, 75% possession, lose 3-1), screaming angrily at the players usually fixes that particular problem, I've found.Also, I put 100 hours into this game within three or four weeks. I never do that. Ever.			"

												A lot of people complaining because they lose games... that's football and I don't mind if I lose a few games that I dominate. I support Southampton so I'm kind of used to losing randomly at Hull, etc. The thing i'm annoyed about is random in game crashes are now MORE likely to happen despite a fix saying otherwise (note to self, autosave once a week!) plus Goalkeeper AI is pretty bad, near post goals happen all the time. If they patch that then it will be a pretty strong game. it's still playable just about as whilst GK's are bad, so is the AI's so you can kinda level things out. Regardless, this is a negative review for now as they should have polished these issues out in the first patch.			"

												No idea why Sigames thought they could predict what would happen after Brexit but the very idea that a Tory governement will create a system where Rupert Murdoch's Premier League business model would be ruined by work permtis is a ridiculous and naive assumption of post Brexit Britain.Sigames, you are politicvally naive buffoons and should have never bothered with this feature, it smacks of nothing more than a silly vendetta against the UK public because they voted Brexit.I would also say that the injury system is stupid, no amount of wrapping players in cotton wool helps in this game.Anothr issue is penalties, never expect even the greatest pen taker to score if it gives you a 3 goal or more lead against a team with a higher rep than you. not going to happen.

												Football manager... How i have been a fan for you for years, and years. But sadly. With Fm17 out, and played it for a while both alone and with friends. I must admit to say.. what  the heck did you even think?!. I have expected bugs. Alot of them actually, but i´d never imagined that you.. The devs would be so ignorant and go the length of actually ignore the massive span of rapports of bugs comming through each day with words like ""Oh, it SHOULD be like that, your defenders should act like they´ll never been on a football pich before"". Oh, right.. its a review submit, not a rage quit submit. Football manager. you take care of your favorite team until you eather get deported for someone else, or go the distance to take the podium among the legendary other managers there are, and have been throughout history. There review done. Now for the important question, would i recommend this game?.. Sure i would. ♥♥♥♥ the bugs how gamebreaking they are. And yes, some are excpetionally gamebreaking. But what do i care?. Well take a gander at the fields of where i grow the ♥♥♥♥s to give, and look how barren it is. There, done. If you a long time fan, buy the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Are you a new beginner?. Go one step back and get FM16. And for all of us that still glings to the hope that the devs gets a stern talk to by the management, we'll wait and see when you guys actually want to do your job and take it a bit serious and fix the game.

The game has depth, UI is easy and pleasant to navigate, player interaction and behaviour is unpredictable but logical, matches themselves seem realistic and entertaining to watch and manage.One of those cases where you have to ignore the reviews and judge a product by yourself.

(although the press releases and media interaction can get pretty wonky from time to time, aka male players being referred to as 'she', and so on)I clocked in a reasonable amount of time in last years game, just over 1740 hours, and it looks like this time won't be any different.

												Rarely have I been so conflicted over a game.The game isn't as bad as people are making out. A lot of people seem to take issue with losing when they have more shots; something which happens in real life on the regular. If you're dominating the game and getting loads of shots, I don't get why people can't conceive of teams soaking up pressure and hitting you on the counter. Another issue oft mentioned is the goalkeepers. I haven't personally encountered them messing up more than is normal, although the 3D engine does have a habit of making some things look more ridiculous than they would in real life (passbacks, own goals etc.). A number of people posting bad reviews (by no means all of them) sound like they just can't take losing. The game needs to be challenging and frustrating. It would be very boring if your tactics always worked, you always won the games you deserved, and your players never got injured (another complaint I have seen) or made mistakes.My main issue with the game isn't what is wrong with it, but the lack of progress. A few tweaks here and there, a couple of new, minor, features, but basically the same game as last year. No new tactical instructions, minimal updates to tactical analysis of opposition (or your own team). It's a better game than 16, but not by enough. To be honest it feels like a very expensive patch. Set pieces are still very basic. The monotonous press conferences continue, and few new questions have been added. There are some in-engine issues - long shot goals are far too rare proportionate to real life, and even on 'very fluid' teams stay unrealistically structured (if you look at average positions you can see this), and crosses go to the goalie to often. It's frustrating that the issues are largely the same as last year, as it shows SI aren't listening to a community which is very loyal and helps them out a lot by creating content to fill the gaps they leave (badge packs etc.). If you're going to get something wrong, which is probably inevitable for a simulator, at least get different things wrong! It'd keep the game fresh. I am still really enjoying this game nonetheless, and would always recommend it purely because it is still by far the world's leader in its genre. However, as the worst received and least improved edition of the series, SI really need to come up with some new ideas and do some serious overhauls.  "

												I haven't really played the 2016 edition, so I can not make that comparison. But in general I am enjoying FM a lot. Some things are unrealistic (30 shots on-goal and still lose, for example), but that's also part of the rollercoaster ride that is FM. This game is not flawless, but it sure is fun!			"

												I've been playing this series since Championship Manager 01/02, and while it has gone leaps and bounds since then, the past few years have been pretty stagnant in terms of progress.Overall it's a good game, still plagued a bit by bugs that have been there for years, but never to the detriment of my personal enjoyment. (although the press releases and media interaction can get pretty wonky from time to time, aka male players being referred to as 'she', and so on)I clocked in a reasonable amount of time in last years game, just over 1740 hours, and it looks like this time won't be any different.

												At a glance FM 17 doesn't appear to change much on the surface from FM 16 - but in truth the game changed in more ways than people think.First of all, back post crosses are no longer extremely OP, and you can actually use other tactics than exploit the back stick. But I feel like this has been replaced with screamers, and boy have I seen some screamers. Secondly all the improvements to the analytical part of the game, adding a passing diagram and a data analysist staff role helps you figure out what makes your tactic tick. No ZM or spielverlagerung level of detail yet, but I feel like that would make the game too easy. Also, the improved screen for your youth team games allows you to keep tabs on your squads of regen wunderkids from obscure countries. Overall, I feel like FM 17 is a step forward in the series, but still seems a little safe.Also, ignore the negative reviews that complain about no translation, SI added in a Community Translation feature so you can translate it into your language if it is not supported by the game natively.

												Seems that most negative reviews are about there not being a Chinese localisation. They might still add one in the future, relax guys.---Anyway, is it worth buying FM 17? Well the answer is simple: if you're a fan of the series then yes, if you're new to the series then yes.If you're expecting football as a sport to suddenly add laser shooting or something crazy then no.Seriously I don't get why people keep saying they didn't innovate this year. The sport itself doesn't change much, it's the same thing you're watching every year, just with different players and coaches.So does FM17 do an amazing job at keeping up? Yes!- improved match engine- social media added to simulate real life- Brexit simulator - quality of life improvement- completely up to date player/staff - improved fantasy draftThat and many smaller features, too many to mention here.It's another year of football and it's another great year for Football Manager.Now buy it, play it and get addicted!

												First of all, 2017 doesnt have so much difference from 2016 so before you buy I suggest that you have to think about this. Social media thing is so good and there are some real humorous comments made me laugh :D . Despite that, it is likely quite same to FM 2016 but I still wanted to buy because I have been playing this series since 2010 and this series are absolutely good. I spend so much time with 2011 and 2015. Still, match engine has to be fixed because there are some nonsenses which makes me frustrated. And clubs financial status has to be fixed as well especially for Turkish teams I barely made transfers already. Despite those, I have no trouble to play.Unlikely to majority, I will recommend this game. For me, cost maybe not worth but on sale you should buy it.			"

												I like the game a lot better than FM 2016. Here is what I love about it:The match engine looks a bit more realistic when it comes to play and goals . I was tired of seeing the same goals with my tactics - the fullback crosses to the far post and my winger or striker scores. Now I have more goals from long range, keeper mistakes when there is a deflection or the keeper made a step more.I get many offers for my players and some of them can be negotiated to triple the price if the buying team have a big budget, which was impossible for smaller clubs until now. I hope this is not a bug and the official release will carry high interest.The new feature using my photo to generate my manager worked fantastic for me when I switched from the recommended low to medium graphics. My wife was amazed how realistic it looked and we spend an hour ""trying out"" outfit colors, hairstyle and so on because of her.The social feed - while you guys try to read the tweets, the thing I like the most is that I no longer have to subscribe to players, teams and competitions. Besides twitter reactions there are headlines when you follow something which works very good and I don't have to get them in my inbox anymoreOdds for youth player awards and top goal scorers before the season outlining the leaders in the category.The Pre-season reports for a team watch, the next opposition report and the post match reports are well presented now highlighting the important stuff.

												Sports Interactive has finally given some attention to the core of the game this year: the match engine. The match engine has undergone some massive improvements. Players move in a more clever way both with and without the ball. They will also make more sensible decisions on the pitch. For example, players reaching the byline will now actually look for a teammate to pass to instead of shooting from an impossible angle.The other noticeable difference is the way information is presented to you. I will just give a few examples here. FM17 continues the trend of previous versions in presenting information in a more graphical way. Graphs and pie charts have never been more abundant. This is the right way to go in a game driven by data. Backroom advice is now integrated in different parts of the game. Your inbox is now as useful as ever, as you will now be able to make an aggregate of decisions with just one mouseclick.All these little tweaks and better integration of existing features make Football Manager 2017 feel like a finished product. Combine this with a highly improved match engine and you know you're doomed to have another year without a social life. Just one more game, I promise.Written by a FM addict for a FM addict			"

Product received for free
												Some people won’t be convinced by the game this year and will stick with their saves from last year’s edition. But looking at the game this year, and comparing to my long running 2015 save, I can see the changes to the match engine, contracts and finances and quality of life improvements adding up. It doesn’t hurt that this is the most polished and accurate the match engine has felt for many years.Will picking up 2017 change your life if you’ve been enjoying one of the recent games? No, but you will certainly end up with a more rounded management experience, with the extras like Fantasy Draft now offering you something worth checking out. So for the main game, I am recommending you take the plunge and put your faith in SI that this is worth your time and money.Full review on The Reticule[thereticule.com] "

												If you have any fond memories of the Football Manager francise then avoid this game! The match engine that was meant to have been revamped is terrible. Opposition players some how manage to outplay your team in most games even though your players are much better. The decision making of the players was meant to have been upgraded but its awfu, your players can't make simple 5m passes yet the other team can hit crossfield balls no problem, simple obvious passes are ignored in favour of shots from 40 yards instead. This means your constantly giving up possesion for no reason and then the other team goes up the field and gets a shot on target at your goal so you concede a large amount of goals. Rather than waste £28 it would be a better idea just to buy the editor for last year and move players about that would effect your league. This game has been slowly declining in playability over the last few years but this years edition has taken a mighty leap down the spectrum. As a long term fan and player (over 10 years) I really hope the full game is vastly improved on the beta version, otherwise I can see FM losing fans over the next few years.			"

												Nothing new. The tactic system feels old and out-dated. It's not about being a brilliant tactic creator or outsmarting your opponents. It's about using the same 2-3 formations, that has been flavor for the past 5 or so versions of this game. And then just press next, next, next, buy a player, next, next, next, buy player and so on.			"

												CONSGame doesnt know Free kicks rule (when to give a card and when not to), game doesnt know offside rules.Injuries are too many.Work permit for a premier league team for a player who would be in the starting 11, rubbish not to give this. probably due to all the racism going on in Britain atm so the game probably adopted the racism too.Still too many stupid questions young player signings is not a job for the manager to answer those questions rubbish and waste of game time, and sometimes they ask 3 questions that basically are the same, can also focus on a person who wasnt man of match, again bad journalism and stupid.Skins are awfull looking I¨ve had to download skins from awsome modders,. but that FM lacks that much of commitment to make beautifull skins is a grand minus.No pictures of the players, you have to download it from example FM scout.They said they had made a lot of changes game is more or less the same changes in overall is minor.Pros:Game is still the most realistic Football manager game to date.Still fun game and has a lot of details.Boardroom advice is now in the inbox and I do like this change.Game has gotten an upgrade in graphics.Game has gotten some new staff jobs, though not very detailed and they should probably have set a certain trait for those jobs, but nevertheless they are still there.My personal rating 2/10After having played it some more too many bugs are in the game, free kicks unrealistic players with a rating of 17 only hit inside goal frame 1 out of 40.Yellow cards are given to players who do absolutely noghing than standing behind a player who falls. crappy display of a freekick.Players forget ball like a toddler would do when dribbling. meaning ball lies still and they continue to run resulting in the opponent picking ball up...wtf who on earth is that stupid other than a toddler not know what he or she is playing.They promissed a lot of changes yet skin is still crappy and the same.Game is basically nothng more than an update and too many crappy bugs are in the game.

Strategy has gone out of the window, with the games being decided more on luck and whether your keeper has an even number of chromosomes. Tactics seem less influential than ever. Stick to FM16 and get a new database.Apparently the game still hasn't got a Chinese language either. Probably a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥if you're chinese, that. 5/10.			"

												This is by far, my favorite game. My favorite genre is strategy games, my favorite sport is football (soccer) and my favorite line of work is user experience design.For strategy and management simulation, this is 10/10.For interface and user experience design (graphics) this 11/10; in fact it's a reference in good dashboard design.For football (soccer) games, this a vertible encyclopedia of global football - both past and present.Of course, it's not without its flaws. It has occasional performance bugs despite running on high performance hardware. The match engine has a variety of glitches, both in graphical animation and in simulated outcomes... and occasionally the ai can do silly things. Some people have conspiracies that player choices or strategies don't work or are artificial. I don't agree, but from time to time it does feel like affecting outcomes is baffeling and obtuse - still, it can be done. I think the biggest problem, is that althoug the help system is well executed and innovative it is far from exhaustive or clear. For example, there are no explanations as to how different player instructions integrate with others. The different training options don't clearly outline exactly what the effect on the team will be, etc.Overall though, is is by far one of the best management sims in the world of gaming. It's by far one the best sports (especially in football/soccer) games in the world. And it's one of best examples of dashboard data-driven software design in the world.While I'm not fond if AAA game prices, this one is definitely worth it.			"

												Brilliant and immersive football game with outstanding attention to detail.I've never written a review for anything before and never commented on youtube etc but I feel I need to address the balance of the negative reviews I've seen for this game on Steam.This game is so much fun. You have the ability to manage and control more aspects of football management than ever before and if, like me , you are fascinated by the beautiful circus that is modern day football management you will love this game. I completely understand the frustration of users loosing games and not understanding why their strikers aren't scoring but that's part of the beauty. Sometimes you loose and sometimes you get battered this IS football simulation. There are tricks, combinations of attributes, tactics, ways of tweaking and manipulating the game to find a way of playing and affecting the game. The only answer I can find to people's negative experiences wouldn't be down to a instant gratification people's expect from almost anything these days. Your team needs care ,attention, and lord knows a lot of time and sacrifice to get right but it's ultimately so rewarding. The database it self is outstandingly accurate. Subjective perhaps, but with an editor that anyone can use if you don't like or agree with player attributes you have to ability to change It. What other game can boast that.I'll speak for myself and this years version is the most fun I've had playing the series and apart from a brief hiatus at university I've played all the games so far. A thanks to all the team who work on the game and keep up the good work. Keep creating and i will keep playing and enjoying.			"

Currently in year 2027 and I don't feel the need to answer the press conference every time (why do they bother to put the tones in the conference in the first place)In my opinion, if you own the previous FM maybe you won't need this game since you might not see any improvement from FM2016. Only the update in transfer window which you might get in workshop or other websites. Wait for another 3-4 years then consider to buy this series again(If they still want to publish it every year)			"

												It's a good game, it always is. Nevertheless it feels like so much more could be done to enhance it. SI have no real competition, so these annual launches really feel like patches on last year's edition. I still play it to pieces every year and have done since the very first Championship Manager was launched in 1992 (imagine that, kids!). I'm hoping SI will look at developing the match day experience a bit more. I played and loved Cities:Skylines with its endless plethora of user-generated mods. Why not make the stadia moddable for FM 18? I am sure this would result in beatiful, immersive, player-generated replicas of existing grounds which would make it so much more enjoyable for me watching Lazio draw 1-1 at home against Frosinone and throw away the last Europa League place in the league, which happened just last weekend. Seriously though SI, get it done. It would cost you nothing and enhance the game so much.			"

												I've read other reviews about this game and having viewed a lot of the flack the game as got I felt obliged to weigh in.  I've bought every FM since I can remember and put A LOT of time into each version.  Yes the graphics in the match engine could be better, the press conferences are a drag and the new social media tab is repetitive, but overall the game is great.  It hasn't brought in hundreds of new additions from last year, but as the old adage goes 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.  It is still a wondrously in depth game that requires thought and attention rather than button mashing and luck.  I get the frustration with results when having 20+ shots yet losing 1-0, but this happens in real life not just FM.  I don't understand complaints about the game being just a database update when FIFA has barely changed a thing in 10 years yet charges £50 every year without fail for the same game with an updated database.  At least FM is only £35, with a far larger database, far more realistic and often available on offers during either sales or reduced as part of a loyalty deal.   In conclusion, if you want a more realistic experience then it's FM every time.  If you're happy watching David Alaba join Juventus for £30 million on deadline day (without fail) then play FIFA.  Both games have their place.  Personally I feel SI are doing a great job.			"

												I've played CM/FM since CM99. I love these games, and Football Manager 2017 is a consistent and solid game that improves on its predecessors. I have seen a lot of the criticism up here on this comment board, and it almost dissuaded me from buying the game, but I'm glad I bought it anyways. I honestly dont understand the criticism having played the game now, it's a worthy successor in the FM series, and it makes several fun improvements over the last edition of the game. The match engine is a bit better, the tactics have more possible permutations, the transfer system has been improved; its an all around good game, and I recommend it.			"

												I'm writing this review just to let people who are already familiar with FM mechanics know that they haven't fixed your shoots on target efficency with ai's. Even if you play like a possession ♥♥♥♥♥ and get 10 out of 20 shoots on goal leading 2-0 ai's gonna get 2 goals with 2 outta 4 shoots on goal and tie the match. At first you gonna say that might happen it's okay. But then that's gonna happen a lot. And you're gonna get mad. :c If you don't mind that it's a ok 'game'. For me Fm series lost it touch to real football. Very sad really :'c			"

												Football Manager is one of the better sports management sims available on the market today (the other one is OOTP in case you were wondering). I'm not as experienced with the many iterations of the game but I have played 2016 and the 2017 versions to know how to play the game. I used to think that the game was less based on RNG and more based on how you use the players you purchase/have contracted but that's not the case. For example if you have two decent Centerbacks (when I say decent, I mean they're average for the league you're playing in such as the British Premier League) you should expect them to have a through pass get through at least once a game. There's also times where the ball is crossed into the box from an outside position and it somehow gets into the goal past 2-3 defenders and the goalie. The ball's not touched after the initial cross by anyone and it floats into the goal. It's really random if you players play like a real player would or if they just run around with their head cut off sometimes. The game's other aspects (outside of playing games) are done pretty well. You can sign players from anywhere you'd like (as long as you can get them a permit if your league requires one for foreign players), you can play any kind of formation you want and play as long as you'd like. You can do anything you'd like to do with a team (aside from relocating them to another town but that's a non-issue for me personally) and do it as long as you're winning games. TL;DR the game's alright but some stuff feels too much like it's based on luck and not on how players would react in real life. It's a video game so maybe I shouldn't expect that but one could hope for that. I JUST WANT MY DEFENDERS TO INTERCEPT A THROUGH BALL AND BLOCK A CROSS THAT'S ACTUALLY HEADED FOR THE GOAL. IS THAT TOO MUCH TOO ASK? IT'S NOT EVEN A HIGH CROSS, IT WAS A LOW CROSS THAT GOT PAST 2 DEFENDERS AND THE ♥♥♥♥ING GOALIE.			"

												I've only played 4 league matches so far with Arsenal. Across 4 matches and in excess of 40 shots, I have 2 goals.Against Swansea I had 24 shots, 6 on target. No goals. Swansea had 1 shot, 1 on target 1 goal.I'm picking up loads of injuries as per usual.It's literally the same issues every year. I must be stupid to persevere, but I'm always stupid enough to think that this is the year they will fix it.This game is so broken. It used to be SO good, but SI have really lost their magic touch.

												Best FM2016 re-skin by far. Altough I am pretty dissapointed about the in-match gameplay. The settings used for my matches is only Key Commentary, and it's preatty predictable what happens next. Usually when durring the a key higlight if a own player produces a mistake (lost possesion durring attack, wrong pass in the middle, fall down by mistake etc) that's when I realise that the opponent is going to score against me. Basically Key Commentary is now predicting that somebody is going to score - at least 85% from key commentary are goals.			"

												Well, I feel 10 hours and half a season in is a good time to review this years FM in its beta stage.  I don't recommend it unless they fix the huge issues of injuries.  I had 5 injured players in 2 days, the third day was match, 3 injuries in the one game brought me to having 8 injuries in my first team. Unplayable as it is right now, will change this if these problems are sorted after release.**Edit:  I now have 30 hours playing, this is because I started a new game with a team who have enough money to build a bigger squad to deal with the injuries. So yes, its playable with enough club funds, not playable with a team who starts with 40k transfer funds and a small first team**			"

Some are just subtle graphical fixes/improvements, others have to do with the AI of the match engine being smarter. Either way love the game, it is getting better and better every year.P.S.

												Don't know why this version got negative reviews. I am enjoying it alot more than previous versions. The match engine seems to have been improved. On FM 2016 fullbacks would get a ton of assists with crosses. Now it seems like it's different kind of goals scored rather than from crosses all the time. You can still concede stupid goals like in FM 2016, but it seems like it's improved sligthly on that part aswell. When it comes to transfers I find it really hard to sell players even if they have performed really well for a season. It was hard enough as it is on FM 2016 to sell players, but it seems even harder on this version. Dunno if it's because I'm playing as Walsall, but I'm expecting to atleast to sell a player for half his value. Anyways, I could write alot more of pros and cons, but just can't be bothered. That's enough from me!			"

More importantly, you guys don't keep your word to release chinese which is of great dishonesty. This is a kind of fraud. Last but not the least, you guys want to make money from chinese market without providing best service to meet chinese customers' need. It's an irresponsible behaviour.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I wrote this negative feedback in english insted of dirty words in chinese to show my respect to you. At the same time, I'm wondering how you guys should regard negative feedbacks from chinese as a ""deadly threat"" as your manager said in public? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Add chinses please!

												It's an improvement on Football Manager 2016, that's for sure. Don't see why loads of Chinese people are complaining about the game and giving it a bad rating, although it's become a typical feature on FM reviews over the past few years.Some of the new features seem a bit pointless but are there just to add a bit of realism / flavour so they don't bother me. I do wish they'd add some brand new major features rather than just shuffle things around which makes it look like a lot has changed... I honestly believe a feature such as Academy management - working your way up from the U18s or U23s to be offered jobs elsewhere or at your own club would be an amazing new feature for next year, although Miles doesn't think highly of the suggestion. Something new and fresh like that could really give the game's dedicated fanbase something to be excited about rather than having to get excited over the fact that they've added 'data analysts' which are there for a bit of realism.

												after losing 2 years worth of fm15 data, decided to try out fm17, i have a long history on many of the previous fm and cm games over the years however this is by far the most enraging.throughout fm 13 and 15 i have used 2 or 3 tactics to win nearly every cup and tournament under the sun and for some reason i cannot get anywhere with that tactic on fm17, i can put messi in my team and i will still lose.after completely dominating pre season with 4 different teams beating much higher class teams, first few games of the season and everything disintegrates.i have played around 30 competitive matches on 2 saves and 4 teams and so far i have had 19 red cards (this is without the hard tackle instructions) i had 4 players sent off in one half! and in one game i had 68 offsides. it is beyond a joke!i love these games and i am a certified fm addict but im sorry i just cannot continue with this one... back to fm 15 i go.

												I definitely prefer Soccer Manager 2016 as it's free and a bit more realistic in terms of the actual game. However, it's an okay game, but not really worth the price.Pros:+so much depth+in terms of everything (EXCLUDING THE ACTUAL FOOTBALL) it's really realistic+fun and customizableCons:-it trully incredbly lacks realism in terms of football. Can someone explain to me, how does my FC Barcelona side lose 1-0 at half to my FC Barcelona B side in a friendly match to test out the players?Overall, if it's on an incredible sale (like capping around 15 euros), then sure, buy it and give it a try. Other than that, try to avoid wasting your money on it.			"

 Is this just the same ole same ole? That was the question I honestly asked myself before purchasing football manager 2017.I have been a huge fan of the previous titles owning my first in 2005 and having every reincarnation since. It was inevitable that I would submit to the urge and purchase football manager at some point but was I going to buy it as soon as it came out or would I wait it out for a while. I trawled through reviews and social media trying to come to a conclusion and well I bought the game way back in beta stage.  Do I regret it?  Heck no! I am so glad I got on the FM train early. Its given me more time to practice and really enjoy this years version. There are enough new features, like training updates, social media, new staffing roles etc to keep me entertained yet it is the same Football Manager I know and love. I'm sinking lots of hours into the game and currently have a series on my youtube channel and ongoing stream on twitch and its going down really well too.This really is the only game I personally know that I can keep coming back to whether that is to take a low league club to the dizzy heights, take my nation to world cup glory or simply raise a group of wonderkids to take over Europe.I have been in a relationship with football manager since 2005 and I can see it continuing for a lot longer yet!

												This game is freak'n awesome IF you like this type of thing!  It definitely will improve your overall soccer knowledge, situational awareness and understanding.  This game can be hard and VERY complex if you choose it to be... very indepth.  Basically you manage or delegate ALL aspects of any soccer team you choose or create.  I mean EVERYTHING!  You manage the team, training, match days, farm team, team academy, players, press conferences, media, transfers, scouting, board and ruling body, business aspects, I even designed my Italian suit I wear on the sidelines on match days.  It is fun, if you like turn based, day by day managing... hell, this game should be required participation for ALL corperate America managers and wanna-be's.  YOU must make the hard decisions:  blow sunshine up player and staff asses, transfers, cuts, injuries, staff hiring and philosophy, etc.  A VERY nice change of pace when you want to fantasize.How many times have YOU said that coach/manager is an idiot and this is how I would do it... well, get in the chair and lets see how YOU would do it!!

												Because of the negative reviews, I didn't plan on buying FM17 and only did when I got bit by the bug to try it this March.  It feels like everyone's review sounds like they're describing FM14 through FM16--and those negative reviews are accurate for those games--but my experience of FM17 so far has been pleasant enough.  While many things are still the same, the radical interface design has freshened up the place a bit.  So far, I haven't been hampered by the overly sensitive morale issues or 80th minute lead collapses people claim are all over the place and have been in previous iterations.  If you're thinking about buying this game, I'd say the user reviews are a backlash of how hard the series has become in previous years but I would say that I'm enjoying this version just fine and would recommend it if you're on the fence about it.

												I've been playing the FM series for about 15 years now, back when it was still named Championship Manager. I hesitated to buy FM17 since I was still enjoying FM15. But now I don't regret it a second. Especially the Match Engine has matured so much. This time I really feel as if I'm watching a real match, whereas in the past you would often see the same type of goals or strikers always shooting from impossible angles rather than opting for the pass or matches that seemed like they were predetermined. None of that in FM17. Everything feels so natural. I also love the improvements to the user interface.			"

												Where to start, this has been the first FM i've owned since 2014. It hasn't changed much but I don't ever recall other versions being so irritating. You can be 3-0 up and then lose within the last 20minutes. You can be dominating a game and still lose with a striker goinjg straight through your defence and defensive midfielder. If you do have a def mid expect them to be red carded, just annoying and makes no sense. The match engine is obviously broken and it takes a hell of a lot of fun out of the game, having to constanly tweak your tactic as you leak goals is not fun, it doesn't make any sense. Save yourself the money and waiting until they fix the engine.  "

												Maybe it's because I skipped FM2016, but I'm totally addicted again. Instead of other players I'm not conceding that many goals. Beside the negative points it's just another good FM. If SI will improve those negatives it would be great. But for now I'm still hooked to the game.The negative points:- Do not watch the matches in 3D. In 3D modus players do weird things which you (obviously) can't see in 2D. SI should focus on the gameplay itself and not on the 'looks'.- Unrealistic transfers/negotiations. Lowballing on your best players while you have to pay top prices. Totally inconsistent.- Players get unsatisfied too quickly. Without any good reason players will be unsatisfied. After that they often want to leave asap. - Players require unrealistic contracts. Barcelona/United bidding on your player; decline it? Expect the player instantly wanting a new, mutch better contract. Your 33-year old keeper is out of contract? Expect him only signing a new contract with a higher salary. Yeah, ok.- Sports scientists / data analists have been implemented but for what? It's fun to contract them, but I don't have any clue what they're for.			"

												Dota 2 is unlike any other game I’ve ever played, both in its nature and history. It started off as a StarCraft mod popular enough to be ported to Warcraft 3, which then exploded into a kaleidoscope of player-made variants and eventually coalesced again into a single entity titled Defense of the Ancients Allstars. There is no single author of Dota, though all the anonymous contributors who’ve made it what it is have come from the community that first started playing the mods. As such, Dota is the very definition of grassroots game development. The idea of a game made by the people for the people, as a certain American president might put it, fills me with a particularly warm and fuzzy sensation.			"

I think many negative comments from from people of one country.this version is more detailed and you ca use MODS perfectly. Game system is much unique So, getting win is much harder than before. in such cases you have to reconsider way of handling team talks during games. and you have to be careful man management in your team.  if you ignore players requests you will get suffer of doramatical decreasing team moral and your game will be terrible.I think this version is very realistic edditon than before.but ones you learn the way of handling problems you can fully enjoy this game.

It's basically FM 2016 with just a database update. But for me that's good enough.Pros:- More realistic matchday- Better-presented coaching feedback- More stats- Facegen for your managerCons:- The price of the game- The social feed is repetitive- It look's like FM2016Overall I recommend this to the new players, I do not recommend it to older players because they have already FM16 so they can just download a new database for that game.I rate this game so far 7/10 "

												I'm a fan of Football manager since CM 00-01 in Shanghai, China. It's my favorite PC game and one of the most important way to leisure.Sure I know English well and it's easy for me to play in English envrioment. And I never care about Chinese version until Mr. Jacobson promise he will develop. What I anger is not about the Chinese version but his faithlessness.At the last, I'm proud of being a Chinese FMer.			"

												Its purpose is to annoy you. No matter how good your team is, you will concede through balls, and there is no tactic choice that can prevent that. Crosses always end up being a goal, because keepers and defenders can't understand that corsses are sent low rather than high. If you're leading 3-0 or something like that at half time, prepare to draw the game or barely scrap the win in the end, because no matter what u told your players at half time the will play like♥♥♥♥♥♥in the second one, so ultimately it is better to be down or leading by 1 goal at half time. Reputation gain is a joke. Players wanting to join a ""better"" club, despite you winning the champions league is a joke. Premier league is overpowered. Penalties are ridiculous, it doesn't get better than winning a penalty shoutout 1-0 in a league cup final. Keepers need better animations. Most goals look as if keepers have no hands.But it is still the only decent football manager game out there, so unless something new emerges go on and buy it.			"

												Well, There are so many negative comments here. I feel it is unfare for its quality.this verson is well made. If you like other versions, just BUY it. I think many negative comments from from people of one country.this version is more detailed and you ca use MODS perfectly. Game system is much unique So, getting win is much harder than before. in such cases you have to reconsider way of handling team talks during games. and you have to be careful man management in your team.  if you ignore players requests you will get suffer of doramatical decreasing team moral and your game will be terrible.I think this version is very realistic edditon than before.but ones you learn the way of handling problems you can fully enjoy this game.

												This is the first football manager I've played since FM14 and quite a bit has changed. Whilst some things like the social feed are a little unpolished, the game is very accessible overall. On previous versions I'd always download a tactic off the internet and just use that but I've taken the time to play with the system and gotten a few things that work. Whilst I'm not the best tactician in the world the advice from your coaching staff is very helpful.The game is well worth buying and is a real time sink.			"

												The real question here is if FM17 is better than FM16. And the answer is barely. They've improved on some of the features that needed improving, and added a few more half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥features that need more work in the future. In other words, it's a new FM release.But you'll buy it anyway, because you're an addict and this is your digital cocaine.			"

												I've been playing FM since the start of the series and I'm still in love with it. People love complaining about things, don't let that put you off from buying FM 2017. It's still as good as all the previous games with the benefits of newer features and sub-systems. Transfers are more interesting now, as well as the social media aspect. If you're someone that expects a complete brand new game that's 100% different from the previous years' version, this game is not for you. If you're someone who has played FM for a long time and knows the steady improvements each year, then this is the game for you. "

												FM 17 is a great game in the series.  They have ironed out the problems of 2016 and really given a complete game this time.  I think they need to just extend 2017 with a yearly update and not bring out the same game with a slightly better game engine for the next one however.			"

												I get why it has negative reviews on steam, as at face value it hasn't changed a lot from the previous years. But the new changes are good, although quite small, they do improve the game a lot in my opinion.This has been my favourite version since 2012, so I'm happy. I do think the way you interact with media needs a huge overhaul, it's tedious atm. I think overachieving with a team should mean more. I feel that the media could create stories and reward good play, and criticise bad. I just feel there's loads they could do with it.Don't expect a huge changel, but do expect a good solid version of FM.			"

												Much improved over 2016 in the ways I wanted it to be. Match engine is better, inside forwards and wingers behave in a rational way. Gameplans execute more faithfully. The Social media stuff is hit or miss, overall a good improvement.			"

												게임을 플레이하면서 몇가지 문제점이 빈번하게 보이고, 실제로도 많은 사람들 사이에서 꾸준히 제기되어온 것 들을 나열해봄1. 게임 제작사가 패널티킥이 왜 패널티킥인지 잘 모르는거같음. 심한 경우에는 실축하기 위해서 패널티를 차는 느낌임. 오죽했으면 프리킥 성공률이 패널티보다 높을거같다는 얘기도 많이 나올정도(물론 당연히 실제로 그렇진않음ㅎㅎ)2. 실제 축구에서도 오프사이드를 이딴식으로 심하게 잡지는 않음. 골과 직접적으로 연관이 되어있는 상황이 아닌데도 오프사이드를 불고, 공격수가 오프사이드를 감지하고 달리기를 멈췄음에도 불구하고 오프사이드를 불어서 경기의 흐름을 깨쳐먹는건 비일비재.3. 도대체 골키퍼는 왜 골포스트쪽으로 오는 공을 잡고 엔드라인 밖으로 나가는거?4. 소셜피드 재밌고 참 좋은데 평점 9.9점을 받은 선수에게도 반드시 한명은 디스를 한다는게 좀 그럴듯하지 못한거같네. 그리고 소셜피드에서 나오는 반응의 종류를 사람이 추가할 수 있게 만들어줬으면 하는 바람도 종종 보임5. 주급을 2,3억씩 받는 선수가 드리블로 수비수 한명을 벗겨내는것 조차 힘겨워 하는 건 실제에선 절대 흔한 일이 아님.위의 문제점들만 제대로 개선을 한다면 16을 1300시간 정도 즐겼던 나로서는 그 이상의 시간을 투자할 가치가 느껴지는 게임인거같음.

												I dont normally bother with reviews but felt compelled to, so here it goes....Welcome to football manager 2017 otherwise known as football manager 2016 remastered. yes thats right, its exactly the same game.  Im currently using fm16 tactics which work fine so the tactics havent changed. the match engine is only slightly improved but only in minor areas. Its clear that football manager has no real competition, which is made abundantly clear by the fact they can rip off there loyal fans and supporters by selling them last years game at the price of a new game!

												Most people have guilty pleasures, for some it will be reality TV, the others may be having a smoke on a night out, me, I am absolutely in love with the Football Manager series. I originally started playing the series way back in 2001 when the main developer team worked on Championship Manager. After a few years, Eidos and Sports Interactive split in 2005 and a new franchise was born, Football Manager. The developer team was headed up by a lot of the core people who worked on the Championship Manager series, and shortly after the birth of Football Manager, Championship Manager slowly disappeared from the scene. For those who are not familiar with the franchise, the game is essentially a glorified spreadsheet, as are most simulator games. You take charge of a football club (read soccer club) and manage all aspects of it, from working on your team’s tactics, to contracts and wages of your players to political elements such as this year's Brexit campaign. The game is not to be confused with Fifa, where you actually control the players on the pitch yourself; you do not do that in Football Manager, you are the manager, you manage the players. We have had a new release of Football Manager on a yearly basis and each year comes jampacked full of improvements and changes from the previous iteration. 2017 is no different. The first major improvement is a graphical one. The game has never been well known for the realistic graphics engine that we see in the likes of FIFA or NBA, heck, the game only got a 3D engine in 2009. Before then you used to play the matches out with 2D circles running around the pitch. How I managed to get so engrossed in these matches and jumping out my seat is beyond me...The improvements this year add new lighting and shadow effects, to the very small details of the grass getting a more polished look. The players on the pitch also have 1500 new motion captured animations which make them move more fluidly. With that being said, some of the animations still look a little strange but there are definite improvements from previous installments. The addition of a new camera angle means you get to get up close and personal with all of the action on the field too. A small change that people who don’t really follow football will notice, is the inclusion of the Magic Spray. Whenever there is a free kick, the referee will mark out where the ball needs to be placed, and where the defending wall can stand. It’s only a small change, but it adds to the realism to the game’s match engine. Pre-match presentations are something that we see all the time at actual football games, whether it be players emerging from the tunnel, and line ups for national anthems or the pre-match handshake. We also get the inclusion of a the rule changes to football too, such as one player may kick the game off, rather than 2, an injured player can be treated on the pitch if the offending player was punished with a card, and last man red cards will now not automatically result in a red card. These are the main in match changes that you’ll probably notice more than anything, but a whole host of other changes have taken place out side of the match screen, and on the “Inbox” screen. Match analysis is a key to any sucess story in Football Manager, and with the cooperation of STATS and Sports Interactive, you have more information at your finger tips than you’ll ever need. The UI has also had a revamp to make layouts and menu options much more concise and compact, I think a lot of this has to do with the move to tablet devices but it is still clear and easy to navigate on PC. The game includes a handy system that will highlight all of the key changes to the UI for you compared to the last game in the series which is a welcome addition to any hardcore fans out there who don’t want a full tutorial experience. The main thing about Football Manager that I love the most, is that the world you play in becomes your own little universe. You can take a minnow from the lowest league in your country and turn them into champions of the world. You can find a young teenager in a youth team, and nurture them into the next Lionel Messi, or Cristiano Ronaldo. Your game will keep evolving and changing, whether you play just for one season, or you are playing in your hundredth season, no game will ever be the same. You can play Football Manager as either a completely hardcore nuthead and delve straight in at the deep end with thoughtful tactical processes, training regimes and scouting networks, or you can play a much more watered down version of the game, that aids newer players in learning the ropes a bit. This is ideal for people who can’t commit as much time to the game, but still want to get the experience out of it. This “watered down” version will allow players to complete a season in an evenings worth of time, whilst the full blown version will probably take upwards of ten hours to complete a season. I’ve actually been known to reach the end of a pre-season and managed to wrack up eight hours of playing time just because of the amount of detail you can go into. Meticulously planning your player transfers, budgeting each and everyone of your player’s contract renewals, it all takes up time, but the more time you put in, the bigger reward you’ll get at the end. From reading the reviews on the Steam page, you will probably see that the game is “Mostly negative”; which completely and utterly astounds me. After playing for almost 24 hours now, I have only good things to say about this game. Yes you could very easily play the last version of the game and still have just as much fun, but this version of Football Manager is ten times better than the last, and is a fully immersive football management simulator game. I mean, the game is the third most popular game on Steam, beating the likes of Civ VI, Team Fortress 2 and GTA V. This is a behemoth of a game franchise and should be experienced by anyone who follows football in any manner. I started playing the game with only a fleeting interest in football, and now it is one of the most important aspects of my life. Football Manager is not only a game, it is a factor in so many people’s lives whether it be good or bad reasons. The bad mainly being the game has been cited in 35 divorce cases… I can wholeheartedly recommend Football Manager 2017 at full price for any football fan out there.			"

												DO NOT buy this installment. Enough is enough. SI needs to realize they have a playerbase that they need to start respecting.As they develop more and more features for casual play, trying to expand their sales, because they know we'll buy it every year regardless of what they do, it's gone to far. I'll spare a quick line for the positives - the match engine seems to have improved and they've done a good job with the visuals. And now onto why I think they've gone too far - this game crashes. A lot. 16 used to crash a lot, but I've been playing this for half a day and I've lost count of the amount of times its crashed as I tab out while its simming a match. Or just crashed as I'm loading. Yes, yes, beta. But we all know unless they're hit with a serious sales dip, they'll just spend their time developing more casual modes instead of fixing bugs. As they've done for years, while we've eaten up anything they do. The UI is getting more and more cluttered and there are questionable decisions on changing things that never were a problem and creating new problems. Until SI decides to work for their loyal customers, who still represent the vast majority of people buying it, I highly recommend avoiding my mistake and buying yet another one. At least not until they stop crashing so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much.			"

												Have to say there's still a significant amount of bugs remaining very close to release making this one of the least reliable football manager games of recent years - however still in pre-release so it's possible they've got a day 1 patch to fix these.Most of the new features this year revolve around userability upgrades and having the extra information and suggestions come into the inbox is a nice touch but applying changes here doesn't seem to reliablity apply to the team - nothing this year feels that revolutionary in the game design.The bugs that seem to be present in every football manager game are still here - I'm on 12th training injury of the season despite being on a low workload and only 8 games in.The 3D match engine looks a little nicer and is a little more fluid than before but it's not worth the £35 on it's own - get yourself 2016 or 2015 for half the price and find an updated league. SI need to do some serious work on this game to make it worth your money.That said - this is still football manager, there's still a unique charm to this games that it's difficult to get anywhere else, it's just a shame that this years iteration feels like a step backwards.

I miss Richard Hancox.Nowadays i buy the games mostly for player research, but i do spend a few hundred+ hours every version just to test new features.This is the best version since 2014 (by a mile), and the first game i ever enjoyed playing with 3D graphics (i always liked to keep with the original CM with just using text commentary). There are still issues; too many injuries, too much player revolts for no (valid) reason, but it's getting there. Fantastic game, and highly recommended!			"

												The amount of negativity this game has accumulated is crazy. I'm not going to stand here and tell you guys it is super innovative or ground-breaking stuff but it appears some people have forgotten a simple fact. Football Manager 2017 is still the best football management simulator out there by a country mile. If what you want is a well built management game, I don't see too many issues with this. I suppose I'll quickly get the problems I do agree with out of the way first. The price is too high considering how little innovation there is. £34.99 is asking a lot when the game is not all that different from FM16. Add the extra £3.99 for the in game editor too and it has to be said, S.I might be pushing their luck a little. On top of this I will also concede that the game needs refining in places. There's silly little things which should just not be a problem which are. For example, if you sign a player who can't get a work permit and then try to loan him out, it's not uncommon for the player to then complain that they feel they are too good to be loaned out. Clearly in this case you should be able to talk to the player and explain to him that he needs to get a work permit elsewhere. However, this is a little bug which can be irritating at worst. It does not destroy the experience although I will admit I also feel it's something that S.I should patch ASAP (which I suspect they won't).With that out of the way, let's address the two things I'm sick of reading. FIrst of all, being bad at the game does not make the game bad. The amount of times I've read 'I CONCEDED IN THE 90TH MINUTE AFTER DOMINATING THE GAME THIS SUX WTF' is ridiculous. That happens in football, you know? Look at Burnley vs Liverpool this season. Liverpool were the better team in every description and yet Burnley took a 2-0 win. It's frustrating but not unrealistic necessarily. Also, if this is happening every game it's probably a tactical fault. Drop off, update your player instructions. If you're just sitting there then what do expect? No game is won by not doing anything. The second big thing is that people claim the game engine is identical to last year. I can't say I agree. I've seen a huge range of new goal types such as players actually bothering to pass across the box which just weren't present previously (at least not often anyway). Sure, players do stupid stuff from time to time but that's simply replicating real life. Only a few games ago I had my keeper miss hit a long kick straight to their striker for an open goal. Is that BS that hasn't been improved from last year? No, it's a individual error that can happen to anyone. Green's OG in the World Cup? Gerrard's slip? Terry's penalty? Errors happen and the game represents this well. Just because it gets you angry doesn't mean FM's doing anything wrong.All in all then I'd say this. Should you buy this for £34.99? Only if you're a huge fan of RECENT TITLES. I say recent titles because it's very similar to them but not at all like games from years back. For the average guy I'd say wait for a sale which drops it down to at least £24.99 or lower. It's still a fun game which does a competent job of simulating football management as a whole. It can be a little complicated and it certainly isn't for everyone, but I still believe FM17 is a fair game at the very least.			"

IntroductionProbably what you expect from a game with yearly entries. No huge differences, but enough to make it worth.In detailToo many negative reviews for the wrong reasons. I totally disagree.Pros+ Substantial visual updates+ Players witll act more like actual human beings during the game+ Appealing Interface, which makes the game playable without skins+ More realistic negotiations and interraction with players, board, other teamsCons- Better graphics mean laggy game for low end PCs. Even on high end PCs, forget multitasking- Price is high considering the new additions of this entryConcluding, it's a great game, and if you have the funds, go for it. Last FM i played was FM15, and i see a substantial difference. Money won't be missed7/101. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].] 2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10]. 3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10]			"

Art imitating life i guess. lose the social feed. no one reads that same old♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is all. will be playing this game for the forseeable future.			"

												I have bought FM for the last few years straight because I enjoy it but also because I can afford to do so. There is no doubt that if you love the idea of managing a team with all the myriad problems and challenges it brings then FM is without peer. A serious alternative might well be the driver for revolutionary change - but, as we have seen in other areas, this may not necessarily be a good thing. For now, this is the only game in town but if the annual outlay was a struggle I would just use community mods and updates to keep an older version of the game running.I don't mind the new social media aspects of the game but, like the Press interviews and player interaction, they quickly become formulaic - although I have picked up some fresh talent to scout from it. The game's jewel in the crown for me - and what makes this game such an  enticing challenge - is still the unfathomable dark heart of FM's match engine.  Some reviewers have slated its unrealistic scorelines or tactical glitches but any week's real world results will always throw up its fair share of ""bugger me, there's no way I thought Leeds would go out of the FA Cup to a non-league side"" incidents. I have played a lot of chess in years gone by to quite a decent level and I don't feel its an overstatement to see FM's innate complexity and the interaction of so many variables as similar in some ways. With a few community downloads (logos, DF11 facepacks and skins), it can also look how you want it.While I do  think the series is due for a bit of a makeover (and I am shallow enough to want the match graphics to be a part of that!), I wouldn't want anything which is so clearly not broken 'overfixed'. If you won't miss the money and you are patient enough for the game's learning curve it's definitely worth buying. If the cash is an issue hold out with a previous version and update it. "

												Ii believe this is a good game. I have played the previous three FM titles and have been thouroughly impressed with all three as bad and as plain and similar it is to last years doesnt bother me. Its hard to make a football management game different every year. And it is still better than most if not all of the competiton. I do however admit that the game negine and the ai are basically useless. Especially keepers. And Defenders. To be fair strikers make fairly intelligent runs and wingers and central midfielders are fairly accurate with their balls to find them.Overall I enjoy the game and would reccomend you buy it if you enjoy the series, it still has a challenge and has the unpredictability i love from actuall football.

												S.I. Have FINALLY fixed the match engine, improving the game 1000%No longer when a player crosses from deep will a goal be scored at the far post.No more will your player make a last ditch tackle only for the ball to miraculously fall to the feet of the opposition who score.Now when shots are made, the can be blocked, will ping around the penalty area and deflect behind for corners.Keepers actually come out and CLAIM THE BALL on crosses.If a player has low composure, they will shoot early and blast the ball wide.Sadly, the commentary is super annoying when it comes to assists, yes EVERY assist will be a world class, one of a kind, the best ever, assist according to the commentary (until the next one, which is even better)			"

												First time buying and playing football manager.I think most people are salty because the only major change is player database update for the price of £35But then again, if they change something then people will complain about ""it was working so well before, why did they have to change it"".I got it on sale but if you got 2016, then you can live with the same database if you don't want to buy 2017.Game wise i enjoy it, simulates well. I think it's realistic and not silly. Football can be unpredictable just like in real life, you shoot but if it don't go in, it don't go in. you dont see players complaining about the goalkeeper being too good and/or that your shots are weak. Teams with high possession doesn't mean they will win automatically.  "

												I'm still holding on to the hope that they can bring the match engine back closer to the quality of fm 2015. There are just way to many kinks in this one. Penalties are very hard to convert while crosses are impossible to defend against (just get a good target man and two good wingers and you can upset any opposing team). My chances of converting a cross is actually much higher compared to penalties. Defensive midfielders are almost always guaranteed to get carded everygame and teams that get stuck in injure their opponents often while conceding far too few fouls.Regardless, I still like this game because of then w features, but the match engine is what's supposed to make or break this game. I hope they can find a way to finally fix it on the official release.			"

												Football manager is back in all it's glory. But not in the usual ""overhaul everything way"". Yes the new 3-D match engine is very noticeable and there are slight tweeks to the whole transfer process. But it is a game that really rewards someone who pays attention to detail, (i.e player body language) along with other mutilple excellent marginal changes. If you want to blast through the game, buy the tocuh version, which offers a more pick up and play aspect. But if you want to take the time to craft a beautiful team, make your chosen club a collosial football empire,  (or have no friends like myself lol) get the full version and immerse yourself into the world of professional football :)			"

												I'm writing this review because this game is really worth to write it, to buy it and you play it all day long. And so you know it i've been playing FM for quite a while so i'm not in a hype train.Pros:- New engine looks gorgeus but it has some issues which i will talk about in the Cons but overall they did a nice work, in my opinion the game is more fluent and more enjoyable. Full Backs/Wing Backs won't get many assists from crosses anymore and i don't why do people complain about goals from crosses. I'm getting goals from long range, dribbles in 1 on 2 or 1 on 1 against defenders, crosses into headers, corners, freekicks ... i mean if you use tactics that exploit flanks and you don't use work ball into box all they're allowed to do is crossing.- In my point of view, goalkeepers acts more natural allowing not to concede many goals which was difficult last year they simply wouldn't react to easy balls and sometimes they would make world class saves non-stop even being low rating. Annoying right?  (i'm about 20 games in January and i've got 4 conceded goals in a major league)- They didn't change the UI neither the Tactics Interface which i like personally, you can go back and rearrange old tactics easily and adapt to the updated squads.- Making your life easier to the previous ""pro"", now you got a sort of ""updated"" list/resume from your scouts & staff that allows you to quickly sign future world class players/renew contracts/players you should sign depending where you're lacking depth in your squad/replacing ""old"" players that probably are near retirement/ and much more ... all of this by just pressing an ""arrow"" that will apply and do what they adviced you. Of course you can quickly get into the players interface/stats easily so you can have a look, all by clicking their names like usual.- A lot from FM wasn't changed, the good things, the complicated things, stuff that we had to learn last year which were needed to improve but since this year it wasn't needed an improvement they didn't change it. And it's true, don't change what is good, there's no need, we would have to relearn all of it again which saved me time.Cons:- The issues about the engine: Players still float/moonwalk to reach some headers, the goalkeepers were fixed but there's still room for improvement with patches so it's not that bad of a ""Con"".- Even doe some players from another clubs are not doing that great, sometimes they tend to over perform in UCL matches, i mean yeah sure some players in real life play better under pressure of big matches but this wasn't the case. I got curious about some performances vs my club and i went to check their performances in their league/cup/UCL club matches. They didn't perform any good vs anyone except my club. And no it's not the tactic that was bad, they just tended to score their first goal or second of the season ... out of nowhere which was weird. 3 players did that.- Some players were buffed from last year which was normal if they did perfom well, but what was weird it was that, even doe in real life they want/wanted to stay at their current club, they tend to ask to leave the club, wanting to move on right in the 1st-2nd week. Last year that would happen only if you would under perform in pre-season which is alright or if you were already 1-2 seasons in which is also normal but not straight away, as soon as you start playing some may ask to leave.Conclusion:-The Pros are way stronger this year but there's room for improvement, yes there's some issues with the new engine but patches can fix them which i won't complain about. I like the game now and i probably will like it more over time. I recommend it to previous years players and newcomers. Don't complain about the price because there's a lot of people working on the game like scouts/data analysts and so on, no need to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I've got no life now ... thanks ... 21hrs in 3 days ...8/10			"

Some setting of prices of players are ridiculous. Also, DOES THE GAME HAVE ANY CHANGE??? I cannot see any difference between FM 2014 and FM 2017, besides the different database fo players. Can you may any any any change, SI Game? This bring me so suck! I am Chinese, and I spend 180 RMB (30 USD) in the new FM 2017 only seeing a version with setting which is the same and that in three years ago and a relatively new database with even less authorization. Can you be just spend a little more money on the faces of players? Would you be more happy seeing the black heads of players? FM 2014 bring me good memory, also because it is released three years ago. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AFTER THREE YEARS!!! It is a good game three years ago, but there are too many chages in this society in three years. I am very ""HONORED"" to see a game with no real change besides the database after three years. And it sells for 180 RMB just for a change of name FROM 14 TO 17! I do not want to talk about the language, and I am NOT WE NEED CHINESE party. I study in an American university and I can understand English well. I do not need Chinese version. However, the terrible settings and minor change is enough for me to give a disapproval.			"

												I didn't play Football Manager 2016, so many of the complaints I've seen others make about it lacking change since then are not things I have noticed. Last game that I played was Football Manager 2015.It's Football Manager, so it is always going to follow the same basic format, the usual tried and tested features and layout are back. The interface and some of it's functionality has improved since FM15, there were annoying bugs, particularly with things like setting custom view profiles causing columns to disappear and refuse to display and almost all players being completely unrealisitc with their demans of game time(a first team player being in 70% of matches and yet screaming that he doesn't get enough match starts for example). There were numerous other little buggy annoyances that plagued the game but are too small to merit going into.I am only 28 hours in with FM17 but I can gladly report that the majoirty of interface bugs seem to be removed, though when mousing over the information icon of a player the tooltip that pops up will still sometimes bug and stay there until you click the same icon again and move away from it; a bug that has been in every recent version I have played(FM 13, 14, 15).The players also do seem to be less whiny so far, when they do whine they are much more reasonable. The key and first team players that I've had complain so far were happy as long as they started in ~50% of the matches during the promise interval and most seem content not to complain so long as I give them at least that many starts. I've not had any rotation/backup players complain yet.All in all the game so far seems to be a good version of the series and less buggy than the previous versions I've tried. Still what people have commented on is true, it's not going to be radically different and blow you away; it's a Football Management sim afterall they can only innovate so much. The AI of opposition managers could still do with improving as it does still seem easy to get on long winning streaks as long as you have a strong tactic and aren't vastly out-skilled with opposition players; the majority of AI managers don't seem to use anything resembling complex tactics.

												It's fine. There are ever only marginal improvements in yearly release sports games, and FM 17 does that. You could easily skip this year, but buying it won't be a letdown either. If you're looking for HUGE changes, you'll need to wait 3-5 years between releases. That said, it's FM game, and it does FM stuff, with some recent tweaks and updates. Outside of the fact that it's still doesn't represent how central Ronaldo/Messi are to their clubs (or their goalscoring prowess) I have few complaints.			"

												I'm writing this review because this game is really worth to write it, to buy it and you play it all day long. And so you know it i've been playing FM for quite a while so i'm not in a hype train.Pros:- New engine looks gorgeus but it has some issues which i will talk about in the Cons but overall they did a nice work, in my opinion the game is more fluent and more enjoyable. Full Backs/Wing Backs won't get many assists from crosses anymore and i don't why do people complain about goals from crosses. I'm getting goals from long range, dribbles in 1 on 2 or 1 on 1 against defenders, crosses into headers, corners, freekicks ... i mean if you use tactics that exploit flanks and you don't use work ball into box all they're allowed to do is crossing.- In my point of view, goalkeepers acts more natural allowing not to concede many goals which was difficult last year they simply wouldn't react to easy balls and sometimes they would make world class saves non-stop even being low rating. Annoying right?  (i'm about 20 games in January and i've got 4 conceded goals in a major league)- They didn't change the UI neither the Tactics Interface which i like personally, you can go back and rearrange old tactics easily and adapt to the updated squads.- Making your life easier to the previous ""pro"", now you got a sort of ""updated"" list/resume from your scouts & staff that allows you to quickly sign future world class players/renew contracts/players you should sign depending where you're lacking depth in your squad/replacing ""old"" players that probably are near retirement/ and much more ... all of this by just pressing an ""arrow"" that will apply and do what they adviced you. Of course you can quickly get into the players interface/stats easily so you can have a look, all by clicking their names like usual.- A lot from FM wasn't changed, the good things, the complicated things, stuff that we had to learn last year which were needed to improve but since this year it wasn't needed an improvement they didn't change it. And it's true, don't change what is good, there's no need, we would have to relearn all of it again which saved me time.Cons:- The issues about the engine: Players still float/moonwalk to reach some headers, the goalkeepers were fixed but there's still room for improvement with patches so it's not that bad of a ""Con"".- Even doe some players from another clubs are not doing that great, sometimes they tend to over perform in UCL matches, i mean yeah sure some players in real life play better under pressure of big matches but this wasn't the case. I got curious about some performances vs my club and i went to check their performances in their league/cup/UCL club matches. They didn't perform any good vs anyone except my club. And no it's not the tactic that was bad, they just tended to score their first goal or second of the season ... out of nowhere which was weird. 3 players did that.- Some players were buffed from last year which was normal if they did perfom well, but what was weird it was that, even doe in real life they want/wanted to stay at their current club, they tend to ask to leave the club, wanting to move on right in the 1st-2nd week. Last year that would happen only if you would under perform in pre-season which is alright or if you were already 1-2 seasons in which is also normal but not straight away, as soon as you start playing some may ask to leave.Conclusion:-The Pros are way stronger this year but there's room for improvement, yes there's some issues with the new engine but patches can fix them which i won't complain about. I like the game now and i probably will like it more over time. I recommend it to previous years players and newcomers. Don't complain about the price because there's a lot of people working on the game like scouts/data analysts and so on, no need to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I've got no life now ... thanks ... 21hrs in 3 days ...8/10			"

												Don't know why everyone is moaning so much. The game is still awesome. Only thing I would change is match engine, this needs to be altered as some of the football played is very poor. They could learn from the old LMA Manager. I'd possibly alter the agents input on transfers. They do take the♥♥♥♥♥♥a bit. On the whole the game is good and will get a positive from me.			"

Brilliantly deep, requires you to think about what you're doing tactically, and consider the strengths and weaknesses of individual players when developing your plan for a match.  If you keep doing the same thing tactically, teams will figure out how to play against you, making games interesting even if you're clearly superior from a talent standpoint.Love it.			"

												Good game, a few tweaks and updates from last year to make the game more immersive. Love the new stats addition that has replaced the prozone this year. Still in pre-season of my Plymouth Argyle save so it's early doors. I'm sure there will be lots more to discover as I get more and more into the game. Love the new gigahertz boost or whatever it is. But the game has been made to run much quicker. No more waiting ten minutes for the game to save or 'continue'.			"

												Been a long time player of the game from FM2005 and have played FM16 extensively as well The 30 minute video that Miles put up before the BETA was launched was interesting and I decided to buy the game . There may be people who term this game as a skin of FM16 but I would say its much more than that . The game feels crisper and there have been improvements in the 3d engine . Please do not expect FIFA level graphics on the 3d engine . I am just happy that its an improvement . The engine , hmm . Last years overpowered fullbacks are gone , gone are the times when the fullbacks would give you 15 assists per season . Tactics of FM16 don't work in FM17 . The analysis part has hugely improved . I love the match analysis report that your coach gives you before the start of the game and also tells you about how the opposition played in the last game . It adds a new dimension to the game as you know which players to target and where majorly their goals will come from Also the heatmap is a good indicator to show where your team is playing majorly and where it needs improvement . The social media interaction is also pretty good I must say . It certainly isn't fantastic but its a good start . You love it when it first appears , after that its the same lines over and over again apart from a few funny ones in the middle . I would love if they keep adding new lines of texts with smaller updates to keep this social media interaction fresh . Training - Didn't see much of a change in the training but I would have loved to see a bit more control on them . In today's age , training methods of different managers are how they play the game . I would love to be able to do that and assess players in training and then decide on my squad on how a particular person trains that week . The interface is pretty smooth . Smooth transitions and easy accessibility to menus which I really like . All in all its been good so far , apart from a few bugs which will be sorted by the time the full game comes out . I am going with 3.5/5 to the game . It isnt necessarily 16 but it just does enough to differentiate between 16 . Also nothing pathbreaking ,but you will indeed have a lot of fun playing this game .

												A couple of initial comments on the beta. You can no longer see the coach/assistant manager's potential and current ability star ratings by hovering over a player's ""i"" information button. This was really useful to get a quick idea from the squad screen of who might be declining or improving. I've also noticed that you no longer see the coaches stats when deciding which coaches to give advice on topics like training in the backroom advice section of responsibilities in the staff menu. This was useful because you didn't have to memorise your staff's attributes or jump back and forth to the staff's information page to know who to allocate to what activity. Two things removed that have made the experience worse.....			"

												If you want to run every aspect of a club and be held to the unfair standards of a real life football manager, this is great. If you want to just play and win games and not focus on scouting/finances/interpersonal relationships, get FIFA. Scouting is improved, work permits are improved (though hard once Brexit kicks in if you manage in the UK), staff roles are improved. It's not 10000x better than last years but there is tangible progress from SI. If you're already a fan of FM it's worth it, and if you want to immerse yourself into the football world to learn about the sport and the industry it's worth it.			"

												Im playing this since 2004. I have started with EA Sports Manger and then I changed the next year 2005 for FM. This is a life changing game. I had countless nights on my pc with this game while my parents where shouting at me to go to sleep :) I love those times. Today I finish my studies, found a job, got married and have kids but there is still time for FM. I'm pre-buying it the same day when it's announces, before steam i was in line in from of the FNAC or other retaillers from 6 in the morning... FM and Civ 4 have taken months from my life but its a every moment well spent. Thank you FM :)  "

												Thoroughly enjoying this years version.  It has all of the management fun that you'd expect if you have played the past versions.  The main upgrade for me is how good the 3d visuals look now.  I'd always used the classic 2d graphics but the player animations and stadiums/crowd add another level of realism and tension to the big games.			"

												With all my respect for the game, after playing 373 hours, I'm tired of receiving golas from crosses and from players that have attributes like long shot: 8, finishing: 11I'm tired at looking at the statistics and see my team: 18 shots, 9 on target, 0 goals and CPU team: 4 shots, 2 on target, 1 or 2 goals. I know that not every shot on target from statistics is actually on target in match and this is a bug.I'm tired to see how I score a goal and after 1 minute I receive one.I'm tired to see how I miss penalties, 65% miss rate.I'm tired to see how 4 defenders can't stop 1 attacking player from the opposite team and I'm not talking about top class players.I'm tired to see how composure, concentration and decisions attributes doesn't count for oppsosite team.In conclusion, I'm tired. The game is good but you must have energy and nerves of steel in order to understand something from this ""perfect/imperfect"" game. "

												I have been out of the Football Manager loop for a few years and now coming back to the latest installment has been a real surprise. I wasnt sure that there was much they could improve on but they seem to have kept the same very good game experience with updated features and enhanced emulations. The depth of the game play is excelent allowing you to be as much or as llittle involved as you like. Overall I would rate this an excelent version of the Footbal Manager series. The only minor point I have so far is I would like there to be more options to shout intructions from the side during the game. At the moment they are quite basic and you need to go into the tactics area to set a simple instruction like 'hold on to the ball more'. If you have enjiyed the Football Manager games in the past you will love this one.			"

												As usual, FM2017 is a great game that you can either pick up and play for a few minutes a day or spend your entire life in it and enjoy it either way.  The only problem i have with this game [that no FM has solved yet] is that if another team tries to buy your player, they wont go above their value, however if you want a non transfer listed player, its not uncommon to be asked for £100m+.  For example i got told £197m for Dybala . . . . . . . .			"

												Playing has never been easier with help being thrown at you with assistent recommendations, tooltips on every stat, tactical advice and boundaries so you don't do weird stuff, like having your CB go on a dribble rampage every 5mins (I kinda miss that option though :/). This makes the game easy to understand, but it's still hard to master. People complain about getting 20 shots and not scoring once, but 20 shots mean nothing if they're all from too far or taken by the wrong players. This game is a time sink tweaking your tactics over and over again to get those 20 random shots down to some clear cut chances. FM17 is a great game if you're willing to invest in it. Otherwise you're probably better off with a simulation mode in a different football game.			"

												My whole impression is positive so far there but are some things that still annoying me! About the match engine don't expect massive changes, also anyone remembered these matches where your opponent make 3 chances scores 3 goals and you make 5 chances with 0 goals, its still up. Also the 100 crossbars in every game you wont miss it this year either. The ball its next to your player and he waits when the opponent make a massive run from 10 km away and gets it first.I do recommend this game but i'm making this negative review with the hope that we get rid of them after the beta.

												**WARNING LONG POST AND A BIT OF A RANT ON THE COMMUNITY, MY THOUGHTS AT THE END**This game should be used as an example to why steam needs to put in a min 10 hours of game time before you can review a game. Now I'm still new to the FM scene, played FM14, heard bad things about 15 so skipped that, got 16 but didn't play it until the march update (got it in a sale) and bought this game on release, so I haven't got the same knowledge of the engine as most other people. The point being the engine isn't that bad, people complaining about conceding loads of goals because of bad goalkeeping CHANGE YOUR GOALIE THEN! Or better yet sell the♥♥♥♥♥♥one, ride the storm and sell them in the next window as you know keepers just lose form. Right now onto the Chinese players, you don't know what's going on in the background, they might have had licence issues with China as they have very different laws to other countries to do with copy rights (if you're from there you should know that and know better than to let that cloud your judgement). If you had of waited just two weeks you could've picked up a language pack from the store which people have been working very hard on to make for you cry babies.Lastly and sort of related to my one of my first points, the game is in it's early days, you haven't mastered a formation yet, I managed to get a 4-4-2 diamond to work for me most of the season but that was what suited my team and my style of playing. You trying the formation you were using last FM and expecting to win 6-0 every game (which is what the formation I used in FM16 was like) then you're doing it wrong and the devs did something right!My overall thoughts on the game: Pretty fun, got Leicester to 4th in the league in my first season, got to the Qtr finals of the Champions league and won the FA cup, Vardy netted a record 36 goals in the league playing as a Poacher. So all in all not a bad first season with my own Tactic (been a sucker to copy tactics from the store as I'm bad at making tactics)			"

												TL:DR All the bad reviews are from people who suck at the game or are lying about what has been changed.Felt I should write a review to counter balance the complete crap being written by obviously stupid and illiterate people. This review is for those of you who enjoyed the game over the last few years and don't believe that you losing games is a bug like the most of the people crying in here.Basically people seem to be crying about doing badly in the game. Guess what. They are not very good at the game. Plain and simple. Why do footballers go in and out of form? Why did Hazard not show up for Mourihno last year, yet looks like one of the worlds best this year? Why did Vardy get top goal scorer last year and this year has only scored one from a penalty and was dropped for his last game? How did Leicester win the league last year and Chelsea finish mid table. Why are newly promoted RB Liepzig top of Bundesliga right now?Football is a funny old game and more often than not the unexpected happens. Fm 2017 is realistic in the sense that anything is possible and it works both ways. However FM2017 is still a game and is not reality, therefore there are ways to play the game well and do your best. Firstly I would like to prove a large part of the noob tears wrong very very simply. People are crying about losing and bad runs of form. Many of these people claim it is been the same for a long time and others say it is a bug..... lol. Explain this then:https://sortitoutsi.net/records/table/130/fm2016-most-league-games-without-losingThere are many stats I could pull to prove my point but this is enough. How can it be possible that the game is bugged so you start losing after x amount of games or whatever, people saying they have 30 shots every game with 6 clear cut chances but never score. But if someone else can win EVERY single premier league game then out of the window goes your theory.Thats all I have to say on that aspect of the bad reviews. This game is not just about tactics, just like in real football management this game is largely about managing the players. One guy in his review talks about drinking game rules one of his rules are:'Every time someone complains about a player wanting first team football drink'Yes like this is an issue... Obviously players want to play first team football unless they are youth or reserve players who have been signed on a backup contract. I mean are you for real?Players need managing. That is why this is a football management simulation and it encompasses all aspects of football management and imo it is sometimes scarily realisitic. People just buy players with good stats without having fully scouted the player, considering impact on the squad and without knowing his personality. You might get lucky sometime but more often and not you are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in the wind and it could end up anywhere.Now onto the lies. Match engine and graphics are a reasonable improvement from last year for certain. Anyone saying otherwise is lying. If you played enough from last year you know the game engine bugs:- Heavy focus on flanks (FB's and WGs assists and goals a bit unbalanced).- Defender passes back to keeper and missed for a corner almost every time from wide with no pressure.These were the main noticeable ones for me and I am sure there are more. The first one is gone 100% and so far the distibuton seems more even across the pitch but I havent played enough yet to know for sure. however I can 100% say there is improvement and graphics are definitely a little better.The UI is a big improvement almost every critic agrees on that. It is a lot cleaner and clearer imo.Honestly I havent played enough of the game so far. But as someone who had a lot of success in FM2016 and enjoyed it so far, all I can see is more tools and features in this game to help me get the best out of my team and my players.The truth is not hard to see here. I could have pulled one of any review here but please consider Ajays review right now it is second one down. He lists bullet points on why the game is bad. Over half of them are just about him losing and being bad. How can you write a review with 7 negative bullet point where 4 of them are the same thing. Ok we get it you suck really hard and are salty. It is not a bug you just havent worked out how to be good yet. Half of the negative reviews are all like this.'I sucked in fm2016 and now I suck in fm2017, f*** you SI, bad game'. Thats basically it.This is why I enjoy the recent FM's. I used to be the same, winning 10 games in a row then losing every game for the rest of the season before being sacked. But I worked out eventually I was just bad and not playing the game well. Trial and error improved my game a lot and in my last game before FM2017 I took coventry to Premier League from L1 and in Championship I got to semi final of FA Cup beating West Ham, Man U and Liverpool on the way. Chelsea knocked me out.In case some of you are actually interested in getting better here are some tips which helped me improve a lot:- Get the best out of your players, select good positions and roles. Train them properly. Encourage them in games, don't be quick to get aggressive or criticise them. Build them up!- Look at there traits NOT JUST THERE STATS. Buy players who fit in. Look for high determination always. - Use your scouts properly. Srsly I didnt even used to scout, scout targets to full knowledge. Get a good scouting team up as quickly as possible. - Dont always blame tactics. I generally played the same tactics throughout my successfull spells. It is usually player motivation or player management that leads to under performance. As I said, encourage them develop good relationship, really important to get the best out f players.- Consistency and big game performers are important. Look at who is consistent and who is not, who is up for the big games and who is not. Your lineup should reflect this.- Training. Make sure your team are fit and ready to go at on opening day of league. Train your tactics intensively before season starts. - Don't buy too many players at once!!! Trust your squad, players take time to gel and a lot of the time the board has little tolerance of failure. Dont buy 15 players and expect to immediately perform, might take a season or two.- Watch your games. Order touchline commands, change tactics to reflect scoreline and performance. I always have either full match or comprehensive highlights. You can see when things arent working and change them. Always check player body language panel. I always have it open. If a player looks uninterested tell him to concentrate! Take him off he carries on with his attitude.- Stand your ground with players. My best player wanted to move to a bigger club when we were in Championship with Coventry in FM2016. He kept copmplaining and asked if he could go. He had 12.5 mil release clause and I told him he would only be sold for the right price which was his release clause fee. He got angry and said he was going to cause problems with squad. Squad came to me and asked why I was doing this and I basically told them I am not being held to ransom by any player and to get on with there jobs. They all reacted extremely positively and were on my side. about a wekk or two later the player dropped his conerns and now wants to stay.There are so many more but the last one really shows how important man management is in this game. Judging your squad and players based on their traits and make decisions accordingly. If anyone would like anything else explained please ask and I will do my best. I have owned every single football manager from 1993 on floppy disk so i have a lot of experience.The only thing I will agree with is injuries do seem like they need the frequency tweaking a little and guess what there are already mods to change this to your preference.

												I played a bit of this years FM, and i gotta say, even though there a few negatives they should work on there is definitly more positives, making this game better than 2016 edition IMO. Starting from the improved match engine, the de-complexification of the UI, the addition of the social feed (useless but entertaining to read nonetheless)  more staff roles and functions and overall improved realism of the managerial experience, and ending on the balancing of player roles ending with the overpowered BS of last years right and left back crosses that made the game ultra easy.The only gripes i have with the game is the lack of innovative features like i would love to be able to do something significant with the wages of my manager, make him buy stuff and have a lil bit of life simulation to it (a bit in the vein of fifa manager back in the day). Plus the licensing is absurd, just too few licenses it wouldnt be too much of an affort by the developer to just go out and buy some licenses cause hey they charge 55 euros for the game. Apart from that im loving the game.would say 7/10			"

Nothing wrong with the match engine either if your keeper is none existant then you are doing something wrong tactically cause I have been playing through and like most FM's I win around 75-80% of my games currently in 4th season after achieving an invincble season with man utd my first since I started FM.

												So hey everyone. I bought this game long ago, just about when pre-order became availiable. I have always been a fan of the series, and played, more or less, all versions of football management simulators, including Football Manager itself, Championship Manager, FIFA manager and some online management games.I didn't play much before release. Then, just before the official release itself, saw the reviews, and wondered, whoa, it can't be that bad. Years in gaming taught me that if you like the series, 99% of the time you will like the new game regardless of what others say in their feedback. And FM 17 definitely isn't the game that can fall into the remaining 1%.I actually liked FM 16, even though the match system was a little bit broken.In FM 17, everything became much better.To name a few things: 1. The ""Match/Opponent Analysis"" message gets you updated and quickly informed on what to expect from your next opposition or how did your team fare last game. This is very useful.2. Less complaints about playing time. 3. Much better match engine and players behaviour.4. Social feed, I love it!5. More ingame editor options, a nice additionI guess what many old timers don't understand is that the game is becoming more realistic, while most expected some kind of ""advancement"" in strengths of FM 13-15 while these strenghts were never close to real life. I read a lot of negative about the ""perfect counterattacks"" and ""losing to teams you cant lose to"", but look at the actual football going around. Barca loses to Celta three years in a row, english top teams actually fall to these perfect counterattacks, even ever-victorious Bayern loses points stupidly. There is a huge importance in what I call ""complacency factor"", and the game demonstrates it extremely well!To enjoy FM 17 - if you are an old timer - you have to change your attitude towards the game and think of it as a comupter representation, though a little simplified in terms of social communications, of real-life management. Transfer & loan systems, tactics and behavior help to do it. Sure, there are negatives about FM 17, but its the best game in the series to date.If you are new player and want to try yourself as a football team manager, this is definitely a must. Easy to learn, hard to play properly.Don't listen to haters and enjoy the game.P.S. As far as price as concerned, I 1) dont think it shall apply to a game review at all 2) mind how much workforce you need to complete all these databases!			"

There is a huge importance in what I call ""complacency factor"", and the game demonstrates it extremely well!To enjoy FM 17 - if you are an old timer - you have to change your attitude towards the game and think of it as a comupter representation, though a little simplified in terms of social communications, of real-life management. Transfer & loan systems, tactics and behavior help to do it. Sure, there are negatives about FM 17, but its the best game in the series to date.If you are new player and want to try yourself as a football team manager, this is definitely a must. Easy to learn, hard to play properly.Don't listen to haters and enjoy the game.P.S. As far as price as concerned, I 1) dont think it shall apply to a game review at all 2) mind how much workforce you need to complete all these databases!			"

												Overall I really like the improved areas I've seen so far, Improved match engine, more interaction with agents/players, manager setup etc.. There are however problems with player wages and club transfer budgets, every player, no matter how bad wants 100k+,  I play with Everton (COYB) and this season, Koeman was given 100+ mill transfer budget and any players sold add to that, when I started with them I was only given 45mil with the inclusion of players already bought sold in the real world yet not reflected in the transfer budget etc and any players I sell I only get a fraction of the price to re-use.. I know this is specific to a single team, but even still you would expect those things to be down to a tee. Also injuries happen so so much, pre season I lost 2 of my new signings and 3 key players and lastly some of the results are unrealistic, my first game was against Leicester and they was up by 4 goals in 20 mins, my team had a good proven tactical setup and was completely destroyed...These things mentioned do need looking at, and my review does seem really negative but it's still a good improvement on all other things and I cannot wait for the full release!

												Well, i was not waiting for an overall change on the game, because if u really think about it, we like the game as it is. And above all, the game have few average to grow besides players and some tweaks.The features are great and the game its more ""in your face"", meaning that you get information all the time. If you are that kind of manager that gets envolved in all the club (staff, responsabilities, young development, etc), the game offers that to you in a more interactive way.Engine runs perfect, AI respects more the tactics, wingers dont shoot withouth angle instead of crossing (at least less times).If the game is worth 59€, dont think so. Go for a key or sale.			"

												Just thought I would share my experiences with the beta since I bought it on Friday.Initially I thought I threw £35 toilet. The game crashed constantly, the match engine stuttered and went through large periods where the match wasn ‘t even visible. After tweaking the settings and some “turn It off and on again” tactics I have had a great experience with the game so far.I have seen some people bemoan the constant injuries, I have to say even when I had 8-10 injuries spread between the First, Reserve and Youth Teams I never felt like the game was conspiring against me and I used the opportunity to experiment with the formations and starting 11. It’s a squad game so it is important to make sure you have depth for when the injuries start coming in.Having migrated from FM14 I am having a blast and this version should last me another 3 years easily.

												I wasn't willing to write a review but seeing all the hate this game has been receiving i changed my mind.I've been playing FM since the 2007 version and it's one of the best since then. They made the 3D engine a lot more realistic ( Keepers are better, wingers are better, crosses are not overpowered anymore ...), they reworked stats, tactics, transfers ( even though the social media feed is a little useless you're not forced to watch it)It's a lot better than FM2016 and that's what we ask for, of course they are not going to change the game but improve it, and regarding how much time and people play this game, you must not hesitate to buy this game (50€ for at least 500h is cheap, when i see people paying 60€ for a 5h long game)You'll find 2 kinds of people complaining about the game:- Chinese kids complaining the game isn't in their language (Although they still bought the game, probably only to write a negative review)- People complaining there are not enough new features in the game If you're a FM fan like me, rush and don't hesitate, your money will be well spent			"

												Why has most negetive reviews all got users playing 200+ hours on this game, yet they are advising people not to buy? That doesn't make any sense.Yes there are minor changes to the game, thats because over the years they have strived to perfect the game. The changes within the game are fixes to common bugs and unnatural situations. They have also increased animations providing a better 3D visual experiance. Also added alot of great analysing features.Yes there is a database update. Who doesnt like up to date content?If you are a previous Football Manager player then you'll know what to expect. However, FM17 provide a better experiance than the previous year but please note it's still football and it's still management.Please don't buy this game expecting to manage something other than football, find it hard or the harsh facts of football and then give SI stick.Football in real life is a cruel game, there is horrible injurys at the worst possible times. Players are absolute divas especially higher the quality. A goal can happen from anything and so can a mistake from any player. Did you blame SI for Gerrards mistake that basically ruined their chances of winning the league? or did you simply not care because A. you are not a liverpool fan or B. because you dont manage liverpool in real life. This is one example of millions of possiblities in Football.Lee Wallace for Rangers got injured just before the New Year Old Firm, Rangers didnt have another LB availible to replace him. Can you relate to this happening in Football Manager? At the start of the game Rangers key player Joe Garner gets injured, in the build up to a goal. The team go on to lose the match. Can you relate?ANOTHER TWO EXAMPLES OF THE GAME AT ITS CRUELEST!Stop being a moan because of A. You cant cope with the technical advances to simulate real life football.B. You aren't as good as managment for what ever reasons as you think you are.C. Are used to the old Football Managers were you learned the formulas and were able to win anything with ease.This game is amazing, especially if you are like me and consider yourself a little controlling when managing anything. They have done a superb job over the years to create a simulation that reflects a cruel but so rewarding sport. To people struggling and blaming SI, my advice to you is to slow down, open your mind, understand football and use the critical features used in football management in real life. Analyse! a key reason to buy this years addition they made it really easy for you to analyse games and teams.Please note, If you are a new player this could help: This game can be exceptionally hard, don't make it harder by doing stuff that you are not sure of or by making your manager low rep and no stats. Patience is key and again allow your mind to open and give it time to think. Theres no rush. Allow Football Management to sink in			"

												I have read many critics and they are mostly negative. I'm trying to find the same problems these people have in my game but i can't. All crosses go in? Not in my world. Only if a cross is well placed and my striker is positioned well. Unhappy players because of little playing time? YES. Because if you were a footballer you would like to play instead of sitting on the bench, so what's the problem with that? People have to understand that this is a simulation game and not Pro Evolution or Fifa. You have to adjust your tactics before every game based on your rival's weaknesses. You can't just start your season with a 4-4-2 with controlling mentallity and go on like this 'till the end. You have to adjust just like in real life. Just like that girl you liked in high school but instead you got her ugly friend..			"

												So far it's much better than 14, 15, or 16. The interface is faster and more responsive. The game runs MUCH faster than 16, with all leagues/players enabled.Crosses being OP is fixed. Central defenders wandering off during critical moments seems to be fixed. A new bug where goalies meander after woodwork hits has appeared. Other match engine silliness sometimes but that's FM.Negotiation is a bit harder than before, which I appreciate. You can now also negotiate terms with your affiliate clubs, instead of being forced to cancel if you want to change the agreement.All in all, it's a solid upgrade of FM16. I'm pretty unimpressed with the default skin looks, though! Can hardly tell messages apart anymore. They used to 'pop' more and there was more contrast between areas of the UI, now it's all mashed together.			"

												I would reccomend this game, once you get used to it, it is challenging and engaging. However, if you're not willing to put the effort in to understand it then don't bother as you may be there awhile, I lost my first game 3-2. Then won my next games by adapting to the team I was playing. However, if bugs and seemingly silly sim mistakes irk you, perhaps this isn't the game for you. However it is not worth full price if you're just going to be a casual player and aren't a huge fan of football. Perhaps check other websites or wait until the price drops to £15 if you won't get that fan feeling.			"

Been playing since 14 and each year i feel like I know less.  It's not a simulation at all, so the choices you make really dont matter.If you like frustration and watching your team lose over and over again as well as missing open net goals you will like this game...a lot!

												It's Football Manager, so of course it's great.  However, whether you want to get this year's iteration or not probably depends on whether you have FM2016 or not.  I'm not the person who buys every FM game every year, but tries to hold off until there's a feature of the latest version that I'm looking for.  So the new Prozone stuff wasn't enough to get me to cough up last year, but that plus having a 64-bit version and the bundled version of FM Touch (from pre-ordering) was enough to push me over the edge.  I can probably run about twice as many leagues for the same in-game speed now, so a definite improvement.			"

												I have been playing now for over 50 hours, not alot by some standards, but enough to get a good impression of the game. Overall, I am very pleased. I think there have been some great improvements in the match engine, yes, there are still some goofy goals and players playing out of position, but I see that every week irl. I also like the ai is not as predictable as before. The same tactics do not work every match and the ai even seems to make reasonable adjustments in the match. It also seems like parking the bus does not automatically lead to the opposition scoring, like it seemed to last year. I really like how teamtalks and morale are playing a bigger part this year as well.I would recommend this game to people who are looking for a realistic experience, is it perfect? No, but it is getting better every year.			"

												'been playing FM since the CM era of 2000, where i went 'rogue' and transalte the game text to my native language to make other dudes get in the game and play along - i buy the game every 3-4 years, simply to allow some buffer of improvement and I see a lot of people moaning on this 2017 version of being rugged and bugged -I can partially agree with this, but i try also to understand there maybe a mindset change of the game, and there can be a diff algorithm approach on the players that influence their performance (eg a striker with fin 11 / comp 14 / flair 14 is better than a striker with fin 16  comp 11/flair 11 - may sound dumb but its a situation too often encouter in the game), which was not that visible in other versions, tactics and player distribution is also influence by player atttributes i think this time more than in other versions.I didnt see problems with transfer negatitions, with the right tweak and  clauses i got to sign good player for less than they expected in 90% of the cases, so im still evaluation the bad part of the transfers.Injuries, indeed are dreadful, and i think may be avoided if we would have a more compiling reports on players (like injury prone, or reports on training sessions regarding their physical state).The overall feeling of the game is good, and i wouldnt go that far to say its crap, but requires fine tunning.A bit overpriced i agree.DLC for transfer updates, that is a d*** move.I would recommend you play the game if are coming from 14/15 versions -but not yet required if you are coming from a 16 version.Play the game with your friends and dont take every aspect so personal :) "

												This is the first FM game I've played since '14, so it's quite the overhaul visually from the older version. The game looks great and plays well so far, but the biggest bug I've found so far is that when I appoint a player as my captain, whenever I click on his profile the game crashes. This has happened 10+ times on multiple saves with multiple players. I'm not going to say it makes the game unplayable, but it is very frustrating and difficult to remember to never click on a certain player's profile or else lose all progress.			"

												First I want to say that I really(!!) do understand those who complain about this beeing just a ""small update"" from football manager 2015-2016. I think the social media thing is wayyyyy to bad, its the same 15 messages over and over, never anything new. so they should have worked alot more on it. The first times i saw them they were cool, but when you are in 2050 you dont even read them anymore. But its w/e honestly. (I reallyy hope they should do the same thing FIFA manager does, give you the opportunity to have a life outside of football. buy car, house, get a wife etc..) <- I think the game would get more fans and take another step if they add something like this. something actually new. Goalkeepers does ALOT less mistakes than what they did in FM 2016, also ALOT less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ defenders making stupid mistakes for no reason. (this is my oppinion, 350+hours, saves in 2050, NOT saying this is how it is for everyone, maybe im just lucky).I love the graphics in this game, but its not thaaat much better than what it was in FM16, but I dont play this game for eyecandy. Hell, I could have played in 2D if i had to. NOW, my opinion; Is this game worth to buy every year even tho the new things they add are so small they could have just updated the previous version for a 10€ dlc? YES! I really think it is worth to pay 50€ every year for a new game. Simply because i love theese games so much that i look at it like World of Warcraft subscription(You have to pay every month to keep playing). And i think the makers of this game deserve it for bringing me more football manager content. And if you dont like it, why does people pay WoW every month to play that game? Why is nobody complaining that they have to pay every month for a 10year old game for no reason AAAAAAAAAAND pay 40-50€ FOR EVERY F@^*3# EXPANSION TOO. Like wtf, why is that ok, but not paying 50€ once every year for this game???? And insted of buying it, playing 10 hours, then cry here because you dont like it, go watch vids on YT and DON'T buyt it if you dont like it. how hard can that be?... Again, i uderstand that some people are butthurt because there is to little massive changes from the prev games, but cmon..... You dont buy a car with closed eyes, then cry like a baby because its ugly 10 hours after you bought it. watch gameplay or something before you buy it. Call me Einstein if you want, common sense... all it is:)			"

A lot of the changes are small but there are plenty of them and there are still going to be loads that I have not experienced yet.Currently on my save I have won a treble (League, FA Cup and Europa League) with Man Utd and in my second season I have just won the League, Euro Super Cup and I am in the Champions League Final.This game isn't just about your tactics you have to say the right things in the press conferences and team talks as well			"

I do not know why there are so many bad comments about this game, i like it and i'm sure a lot of you will too.

												Yes the game is very similar to FM2016 and not much has changed since FM2014 in my view.However that is not why i think most buy this game, more purchase to have the latest database, teams and leagues etc etc (much like why Fifa sells so much each year)It is a slight update but still in my view a step in the right directionTactics setup seems much more important now, and i feel like this is a great change over last year when it seemed to me most tactics i tried didnt work or work for long.I also like the addition of data analysts for the matches and the match engine seems much more robust and improvedThis is just based on the pre launch verison so i hope/think with further improvement it will be a game i sink hours intoAlso i could be called a fan, i have purchased every version of this game since orginally released by the collyer brothers back in 1992 (then called Championship manager prior to the split from Eidos and becoming what we all now know as FM)just on the versions i have on Steam (going back to 2009) i have put in a total of 3722 hours (155 days)into these gameOverall a great game, and a must for any football fan			"

												i cannot give a accurate thought about this game until it has been released fully and therefore it would be unfair as the game is still in beta but we can try right?........ what i can say for sure it *looks very similar to (football manager 2016) in terms of layout* i guess a few little changes have been applied like *sports science* like *data analyst* and also *team reports* (has its own left menu now with your team's Strengths and weaknesses) also *Squad depth* also noticed that social media is been implemented giving you a more diverse experience media interviewers may be improved but say if you start at a lower league club as i did your unlikely to get many of them so i cant deny or agree that its better yet therefore im sure that i may of missed some improvements that havent come to my attention as of yet?, as for the match engine is *less clunky*than 2016 version i cannot say anything about how improved players decision making is and how intelligent players movements are because of only being 5 hours into the game using match engine but im sure theres is plenty of room for improvement so i can say for sure To Be Continued			"

												The beta so far is fantastic! Now that the game is also running a 64 bit version, my macbook pro is running this beta smoother than the full FM16 game! This game feels like a huge improvement in every aspect over last years.			"

So far i will give it 7/10Peace "

												i cannot give a accurate thought about this game until it has been released fully and therefore it would be unfair as the game is still in beta but we can try right?........ what i can say for sure it *looks very similar to (football manager 2016) in terms of layout* i guess a few little changes have been applied like *sports science* like *data analyst* and also *team reports* (has its own left menu now with your team's Strengths and weaknesses) also *Squad depth* also noticed that social media is been implemented giving you a more diverse experience media interviewers may be improved but say if you start at a lower league club as i did your unlikely to get many of them so i cant deny or agree that its better yet therefore im sure that i may of missed some improvements that havent come to my attention as of yet?, as for the match engine is *less clunky*than 2016 version i cannot say anything about how improved players decision making is and how intelligent players movements are because of only being 5 hours into the game using match engine but im sure theres is plenty of room for improvement so i can say for sure To Be Continued			"

												Hmm I am not very critical as I am fanboy, but however - This year I hesitated whether to buy this or not, as SI is still strugling to do some changes, which I would like. I did buy it after playing the demoPROs - More polished and streamlined gameplay.Match engine this year looks most realistic ever.Social feed - at first I did not like it, but now I LOVE it. There is a possibility, that I will get fed up with social feed, but nowadays I really enjoy it.ConsPress conferences are still the same - lame and dull.Strange goalies behaviour. "

												I have no idea if this years FM is better than the last one. I do not like BETA's , so i am waiting for the full release before getting into it. I do know this though: SI's BETA release looks more like a ""complete"" game than almost any other post-beta game i bought the last year. Maybe it will require 1 patch or 2 for bug fixes and minor improvements but this is normal and acceptable. I am 37 now, playing FM since day 1, i think its 25 years (jesus) or so. I cant compare FM17 with 16 or 15. Football is rocket fast, a game such as this needs to be updated. Whether we need to pay 50 euros for database updates and some light improvements is for anyone to decide.In any case you are getting a FULL game here, not one that will require a million updates, patches, DLCs (Firaxis, Bethesda etc) and full priced expansions to make it work 6 months later.

												Played fm since 2005, this is the most difficult one. At first I disappointed because it is very hard to win, but then I try to tweak the tactic, trying to understand most details settings, and finally getting used to it. This game is the closest thing for being a football manager, sometimes good players is not enough for being champion. There's no enjoy if you always win, the enjoyment come when you struggle very hard to win the game, even if sometimes makes you frustated.			"

I've read that the game crashes frequently, to me after 4,5 hours of playing it didnt crash at all but I want to see what it will do in the future.My opinion on the game is that it really good football managing game but it doesnt worth the 55 euros. I bought it from a shop near my area for 25 euros and for that money I think it's worth it.			"

												Having played almost every edition since 07, I'd like to believe I know a thing or two about the Football Manager series. Prior to my purchase I had a few doubts looking at some of the reviews and the 'Mostly Negative' overall score. But I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.I know a lot of people say, don't buy it, nothing has really changed from last year... but the same can be said about FIFA, and yet, millions of people continue to buy it year after year. So, what to make of this year's addition....I know in previous versions of FM, there have been some very noticable issues with the match engine, but this year's version seems to perform very well. While the game hasn't had a revolutionary overhaul, I have already noticed a lot of subtle improvements (both in terms of the match engine and the UI) that make the game feel much more polished than previous editions. If you're a FM tragic like me, I'm sure you will appreciate them. Is it worth the $60 price tag?? Yes and no.If you're new to FM and keen to know what all the fuss is about, I would say ""go ahead"", once you've chalked up 500+ hours you won't be phased by the $60 price tag. For those of you thinking about upgrading from FM15 or 16, if you're indecisive like I was, perhaps get it on sale (I got it for $30). There are definitely enough improvements to warrant the $30.Overall, as a standalone FM game I would rate it 4.5 stars and certainly don't think its worthy of its 'mostly negative' rating.			"

												So another year passes and the new Football Manager arrives, as always an instant buy.I have played every version of this game from the original Championship Manager days and have invested thousands of hours into the game.Some may ask why? Well realising the dream of taking your local team to the top, the only way some people will ever see them rubbing shoulders with the world greats.So what does this year bring?Polish and lots of it!The match day engine looks better than ever and the increased AI is noticable.Staff are a lot more useful and offer more advice in a more useful way, with the intoduction of new staff to help the Medical and Scouting Teams.Signing new players has been upped a notch with Agents being even more involved and the need to scout and trial players even more important.The players have moe to say as do the fans. Social Media has been introduced tp help gauge what the public think #nicefeatureI am now 'really' in the game as I have have my face planted onto my avatar's shoulder a little feature but nice all the same.There are lots of little things I keep discovering, and this is what makes the game so special.Any disappointments?Well despite the meetings with press, players and everyone else having a few extra tweaks they still have a repetitive edge. A lot of repitition, despite the odd new thing.Otherwise the new licks of paint are all good.What would I like to see?Despite it being last years April Fool, I would like to see the club Mascots feature just to add the odd bit of extra fun!Oh and a thumbs up for the loyalty bonus too, much appreciated.Separating the Touch version fully made sense, so it can be run on lower spec systems .... And you can take  it on your hols now!Overall another great addition to the series. "

												I am purchasing the game at north america region, but I am actually from China. I've purchased this great game on Steam all the way since 2013. And before that, I bought the retail version FMs in China too. I am really happy that SI and SEGA finally start working on Chinese localization. I also want to tell them, FM does have a really large and great fan base in China, when you guys didn't give us Chinese localization before, there is a group of people (playgm.cn) who is doing there own version of Chinese translation for us FOR FREE and they are doing it EVERY YEAR since around 2001. Think about it, for over TEN YEARS, your fans in China is doing the work for you because they really love this game. I'd say their outstanding work is one of the key factors why FM is so popular in China. When you announce that you are starting Chinese localization, Playgm ask us to send them screen shots of the Chinese version Totti's player profile page each year all the way from CM2001 to FM2016 (why Totti? Because we are as loyal as him!!). They asked it because they just want to let you guys know how much they love the game and how much they want to contribute back to the game for Chinese translation. And the fans got all the screen shots within just one day!!I am so proud of being a humbled member of the Chinese FM fan conmunity. And I am happy that SI and SEGA are now starting to pay more attention to their fans. I really hope that FM2017 is the start of a good communicative relationship between the company and its fans (I'm not saying 'no chinese no recommendation' is good, but it's a start anyway).			"

												Attention: the reviews are being bombed by people angry about the lack of Chinese language support.I won't comment on that.. But you should be aware of it.As someone with over 2,000 hours on FM2015, I am very happy with this years version. I skipped 2016 so I can't comment on moving from 2016, but if you want to get this, go for it. Best version for years.If you are new to FM and want to get into it, go for it. FM is the best football management sim out there and this years version is excellent. "

												Amusing nerd rage on here from people screaming that nothing much changes game to game... you've really just worked this fact out? Really? : /If you don't like buying it yearly buy it on a few yearly cycle which a lot of people do, criticising the game for something which has been a fact of the series (and is the same with pretty much every single game series which does a yearly release) is pretty moronic.The game itself? Extremely similar to '16, which means good play and at the top of its game for the franchise, if you haven't bought it in a few years is it worth getting? Yes! If you have last years and are expecting huge game changing updates then simply don't purchase it, don't be like the almost 4k dumb reviewers who seem upset at their own niavety.			"

												At this current time, I've played this game for approx 38 hours.If you're looking for a pure football management game, then this is what you need! There's plenty of things that have been tweaked from last years edition, even the little improvments of the match engine.The only thing that I have noticed is the increased amount of injuries but this will probably be patched in the full release.I would say this game is the best game in the series so far and I would recommend to try out the BETA stages to see for yourself.I'm going to be putting a lot of hours into this game. I just know it! About the negative reviews... I don't understand why people just like to leave negative reviews due to minor bugs. If you put effort into playing it for a few hours, you can tell there's a lot of things that have been improved and not just the database alone. Bear in mind, some of these critics have already played this game for hundreds of hours. "

												I asked lots of buddies in China to figure out why this game have such a bad review in China, It’s not because this game lack of our language it is because SI's manager Miles Jacobson is a fraud and a racist person.  When people ask him when FM will have a Chinese version in 2012, he said ""...we'd need 20k of the people currently pirating to buy the game, and that's not going to happen."",     Then steam gives Chinese a nice way to buy games (FYI I use to live in Shanghai, one of the biggest city in China, It was almost impossible to buy any games online or in store because of government ban, not everyone wants to go with the illegal things, they just simply can't).  Last year in Chinese store, they put on the game with a low price and it sells well, then they decided to lock the region because they realized the price was too low, then on Jan 2016 they re-release the FM 2016 with a higher price.   This year FM17 released with a even higher price in China but it still sells really well. According to steamspy 4%(1108114 in total) FM 16's sell are from Chinese Steam Store and also while it's region locked lots of Chinese players bought the game Keys from Russia or they just bought the hard copy, also there are lot of players like me, live in other country and bought the game in other countries, so the number is way over 20k, I don't know this person is being sarcasm or he is serious about this, but a deal is a deal, you said 20k and we doubled it, now it’s time to do your part.    When people ask Mr. Jacobson about his word he denied about the number and assume SteamSpy's data ""to be wrong by 60%"" as a developer he should have the number, he just doesn't want to do it.  If you assume the number was wrong, then what's the number? And how he get 60% about steamspy?     After that he threat Chinese player by saying: “have the community translation option now which I hope people use. Our other option is to stop selling the game."" this is just ridiculous, I know lots of people saying bad words to him which I think it NOT right.  But after this it really make me want to say something bad to him.  Again, it's the government banned the selling of games not Chinese people don't want to buy it, since we can use RMB to buy the game here, there are huge numbers of people buying games from Steam, according to our population base I'm really confident that 20k is a easy number to reach.     While reading his words, I can feel Miles Jacobson is a man who doesn't like Chinese.  And I feel he doesn't like Chinese by refuse to putting our beautiful language in his game also he refuses to admit China is a rising market, more and more Chinese have the opportunity to buy the copyright games through steam, and also by his banteringly words.  I don't feel comfortable while reading his words.     Again, just to people who might concern, it's not recommend not because there's no Chinese in the game, it's because Miles Jacobson's lie, his threaten and his racist. Adding Chinese is not enough, we need an apology, you have right to be angry about the people who illegally download your game, but you should not force your anger to the people who spent money and brought his games.  According to his words I feel he assume all the people in China download games illegally.  I'm not defending my country, I'm defending people like me who enjoy game buy spending money buying them in China, which is not a small number.     For people in English speaking countries and other English speaker, sorry this is not about the gameplay according to steam's new system they might want you not see the negative review from the other side of the world, You might think it's not a big deal, and you might don't feel his word offend. It's OK, and I'm sorry to waste your time, hope you have a nice day and enjoy this game.  English is not my first language, I'm sorry for my spelling and/or grammar mistakes.     For people who care, please help us, let SEGA and IS know a lying and racist person like Miles Jacobson should NOT be a leader and voice of their company.  We will not change our not recommend back until Mr. Jacobson give us a good answer/apology.     If I know the story earlier I won't buy this game.    And a word to Mr. Jacobson, not recommend your game are our rights, no matter what reason, criticize this is just stupid and immature, btw, if you really have balls, why bother RELEASE the Chinese version now? If you want to stick on your opinion, just stop selling the game in China and I will happily remove my comment and ask for a refund.			"

Posted: October 24, 2016
												After 3 years of refusing to buy Football Manager I decided to check it out again to see if they've finally fixed the core issues that have plagued this series for so long now. Short version: They haven't been fixed.Long version: So the problem here is that the way that the top teams are scripted pretty much messes up the game in the sense that it becomes too static, which is in place to make sure that the top teams as we know them in real life always end up on top at the end of a season. Taking the Bundesliga as my example; according to this game, a buffed up Wolfsburg can never win against Bayern/Dortmund. NEVER. These 2 teams have been scripted to win every match apart from the odd few (to make it seem realistic, ha ha). So unless the team that you're playing with is selected as one of those odd few teams, you're going to lose. EVERY. TIME.Now you might say ""oh, Wolfsburg losing against Bayern, that's not so weird!"". Indeed, but what if the same match could be replayed 100 times in real life? Are you saying that a buffed up Wolfsburg would lose against Bayern 100 out of 100 times? Because that is exactly what this game is saying. Even if you save ahead of the match seed and reload that file every time. Even if you apply the most logical tactics or change them a bit every time (which used to change the ""scripted"" result when you did this). And this is exactly why I don't bother properly playing this game anymore since I don't want to play with a team like Barca/Real/Bayern etc which are scripted as described above, but when you play with a slightly less good team or worse then your tactics won't matter vs these teams. Either be a lucky pick of the ""lose/tie vs a few random teams every season"" algorithm or lose. Lost the same match for 5 hours straight against Bayern/Dortmund testing this statement by reloading & applying different tactics every few attempts by the way. The forced loss goals were hilarious to see, like the my player falling over after which the ball rolls to top team X player and scores calibre.Aside from that, the only way to win against teams like Bayern is when you overtake them with an alt head coach, put a non goalkeeper (someone short if you really feel like serving justice) on goal, select all the goalkeepers/defenders and move them all up as far as you possibly can, preferably the goalkeepers on striker positions, and then enter the match while controlling both teams. And even then, top team X will still score a few goals! LOL! The best part is how those goals happen, which proves just how scripted these results are. You'll have the goalkeeper of top team X making moves so smooth that your considerably rated strikers and attacking midfielders only rarely pull off and they end up serving a killer pass which results in a goal or better yet, score a goal on their own. Oh yes and let's not forget about the standard scripted ""fires a weak shot straight at your goalkeeper, somehow the ball gets scrambled into your net"" situations. Yep, that still happens. But hey, atleast your team wins with a ~20 goal deficit because you forced all of top team X to play upfront and put a normal field player in their goal. It's interesting how putting a non goalkeeper on goal actually has a big impact on the match result though, which proves that atleast the goalkeeping stats are functioning as they should. Well, when they're not forced to go into derp mode because the script demands top team X to win that is.~~So if you're still not convinced yet that you've just bought or are about to buy Feign Realism Which Dummies Won't Notice Simulator 2017, let me go in even further detail and tell you a story about my team Wolfsburg~~Wolfsburg has 2 good left backs. The main one is the well known Ricardo Rodriguez, and the other one is a young rising star named Jannes Horn. One day, Jannes decides to complain about his lack of first team football. I somehow missed this message and so he got even more upset and complained to other Wolfsburg players about it. They demand a team meeting (epic new addition to the game OMGOMG FM2017 BUYITNOW /sarcasm) in which they tell me that they think Jannes should get his chance in the first team. As my answer, I tell my players that in order to do that, I'd have to put Ricardo Rodriguez on the bench instead who is performing well (more like carrying their sorry butts but ok). They're like alright cool fam that makes sense, we'll go back to being generic. Jannes got dropped by his teammates, he's just gonna have to fend for himself now. In response to this action, Rodriguez gained a new happiness status which states that he's happy about the way that Jannes has been treated. You'd think that he'd be grateful, right? You'd think that he'd want to eventually win the league with my ever-improving Wolfsburg side, right? WRONGA jump in time to the end of the season: For the first time since I took over as head coach of Wolfsburg (1 year+), a team shows interest in signing Rodriguez. It's Arsenal. They bid 25m (typical Arsene, lowballing as expected OMGOMG SO REALISTIC FM2017 BUYITNOW) which I of course decline since I made it pretty clear that he's my main left back in my glorious team. As soon as I decline, Rodriguez is knocking at my door saying ""M8 y u no let me go to Arsenal I've always wanted to go to a bigger team wtf man"". I tell him that I declined the offer because it did not meet his valuation, after which Rodriguez sits down and goes ""Alright, so lets decide my buy price because I don't want to miss out on this chance"". I suggest 60m, he's like ""haha no"". I lower it down to 50m, he literally says ""this is getting daft now"". I lower it to 42m thinking wow this is so realistic (not) and he leaves more upset than he already was, saying that I should've just said no in the first place since I clearly had no intention of selling him before he ran out of my office door in tears.AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW. He ran to his teammates, crying and all which proc'd the indignation of some. Who then of course demanded...a team meeting (OMG EPIC NEW....ah F it) in which they say ""Yo coach you wanna go at it? How dare you treat our beloved teammate Ricardo this way! He should be allowed to leave wtf is wrong with you!!"". Keep in mind that Rodriguez has been carrying them all season long, and yet they're angry that he's not allowed to leave. Realistic Football Simulator 2017. OH BUT, GUESS WHO WAS AMONG THIS GROUP OF ANGRY PLAYERS. YES YOU GUESSED IT: JANNES HORN. He had the supportive of teammate status which reads ""Unhappy with the way that you've treated Ricardo Rodriguez"" and his other negative status was ""Wants a chance in the first team"". Not gonna lie that was actually hilarious, but this is supposed to be Football Manager 2017 not Soap Opera Manager 2017. Anyways, the point is that all players are scripted to be mercenaries who want to transfer as soon as an even slightly better team is showing interest in them. I know that's the trend nowadays but I really don't think that the FM creators should be encouraging it. I love loyal players (aka club legends) such as Gerrard, and it would only be natural for the top players of your team to remain loyal to you if you're clearly building a team around them and match their ambitions - which all my actions indicate. And people like that do still exist today (why hasn't Reus left Dortmund yet for example), so again this is really unrealistic and actually discourages me from playing the game because I'm playing this to build and IMPROVE my teams to the highest possible level while some resemblance compared to the team irl still remains.All in all, these are but a few issues and it doesn't look like they will be changed any time soon. Football Manager: The best, but only because there's no non indie devs that are able/willing to compete.P.S. Check out the first 3 comments on this review aswell which touch on social feed, 20 stat cap etc.			"

												Arguably the best version to date although I often find myself saying that! The stats that are generated through playing the game are better shown now and more easily found which is brilliant and there are a couple of fun new features to find. I am not a big fan of the brexit in the game but it is still an interesting inclusion which most players won't get to unless they are committed to a couple of years in the game.Other than that it is Football Manager, there is no competitor the community is great and you can lose hours playing the game.

												I've purchased this game just about every two years since maybe, 06. The buying cycle has never failed me...I can't say whether or not this is better than 16, because I don't own that version. However, there are enough new features here to confirm it is miles better than any version from 15 on down.As you can see, I have at least a hundred hours logged already. The AI is much improved and the small new features do a good job of displaying useful information while enhancing the immersion. Yes, it's the same great game at its core. Yes, most of the game breaking bugs have been fixed since they switched match engines. And yes, I stand by my statement at the top of the review...it's the best iteration yet. If you had last years version, you probably won't notice huge broad sweeping changes, but whatever AI hiccups existed do not seem to be present. At the end of the day, it's a fun game and is the most complete football game available.			"

Addition of social media is also a cool idea. KUDOS TO SI team for bringing this game to us. If you're in search for some high performace graphic game with a gameplay then this game is not for you. Play FIFA in that case.  Cheers!			"

												Although my review might sound bit harsh / negative, I still do like FM. It's as good as it has ever been. Maybe therein lies the problem. As a manager veteran (FM 2016 was the first in the series I have skipped in 15 years or more)Cons:- The same things I have felt need improving are still there. In fact, the game feels exactly like FM 2015- Sounds could do total remake. ""Drums of mordor"" at Bayern munchen arena, chanthing teams names, witty songs etc. are all missing. Same bland cheering as always. It would do wonders to tight rival encounters, putting headset on and actually feeling like there was a live audience. - Press conferences: I found couple of new questions compared to FM 2015, but basically it's the same questions as always. If you are gonna have that feature (and the idea is nice), there must be atleast 10 times more questions to keep it itneresting after 10 games. - Tactically game feels exactly like FM 2015, about same features. It's not all bad, mind you, tactical side is actually good, but some new features in 2 years should be available. - Logos still missing and German national team still missing aswell. Not SI fault but still...- Generated players still look awful (and exactly like they looked in FM 2015). Again, game is played with feeling and when all the new stars look basically like clones, it takes away the authenticity (atleast for me)- Managerial contract negotiations are still somehow strange. Even winning practically multiple Champions Leagues in a row (in FM2015), teams offered basically same wage and didnt seem to budge at all. After first negotiations in FM2017 it seems it's exactly the same. Was funny, club offered 63k wage (exactly the same I had at the start of the season) and they were delighted with me as I was leading the league. When I asked for money, they just offered the exact same sum every time with smaller CL winning bonus. - Wanayama still takes yellow card in every game he plays :)Pros:- Player attributes are toned down again (it's a trend that has been going on in FM series for years). It's a good thing. In older FMs you had plenty of players with max key attributes (lot of 20s) and it just felt silly. - Graphical interface is smoother than before. - Some minor new details to pre contract negotiations with players which are relevant- It's FM, so it is a very good game overallSummary: Same old FM. Expected bit more with 50€. But it's a damn good game so grudginly recommend it :)			"

Do you really want to buy a football management game where you automatically win everything with a vanarama league team? you get out what you put in.Opposition team scoring on 3 shots to your 25?

Its an incredible game and provides endless hours of fun. If you have the 2016 version, it does not worth to pay this amount of money since the differences are very little but if you do not have one of the latest games such as 2015 2016, i suggest you to get this game if you like football manager games.

												As a player originally from China, I just want to give everyone not from China a simple explanation why this year so many Chinese buyers just give FM negative reviews because of lack of Chinese version.The several top reviews somehow are right, SI never includes the Chinese in the game and the store page never said there will be a Chinese version. But this already last for about 10 years. Chinese buyer never does anything like this year.Why? Because Chinese customer not only wants to give the negative review for the lack of Chinese version but also the attitude the SI showing. So in 2011 some people asking if there will be a Chinese version from SI, Mile Jacobson replied that they need 20k copy sold in China (https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/128969002398646274). In 2016, from steamspy, there 40000 sold in China( 5th in the world). So some one aksing SI again, then Mile Jacobson just repled like this (https://twitter.com/milesSI/status/791659905933533184). Read his reply, do you thin SI really care about customers???? Of course people from other countries may not need to struggle with this as they already have official language support. But what if you have other opinions for the game? Do you think the developer will listen to you? And for many Chinese customers using 200 RMB to buy a game is not a small cost, but they were encouraged by the 20k promise so there are a lot of people just got the games. But right now SI just made them extremely disappointed.			"

												Massive change (for the best) from FM16, improved contracts, improved staff capabilities/roles, political madness, etc. Worth every penny, however if you have a life and don't want to lose your job / partner, don't play FM17.			"

												Been playing a lot of FM games over the years...this is by far the worst. Can't buy anyone, can't sell anyone, no tactic works from any previous games, you can have the smallest squad in the league and players will moan about not playing?!The tactics page has roles just made up out of nowhere...the RAUMDEUTER role....wtf is that? it's called being a Winger guys....

												Hmm, I must say, I was very reluctant before buying this game.However, I was pleasantly surprise to notice that many bad reviews are totally irrelevant, as the game is decent, much better than FM16 and with a lot of positive aspects.PROs:- Improved interface, more friendly format and some nice borders and pictures- Social Feed, which adds a bit of realism, even though, at some point it becomes repetitive- Improvements in the game engine; players seem to listen more to the instructions; In comparison to the older versions, a player getting in a wide advanced position, closed angle, prefers to cross now and not shoot like a brainless idiot as used to happen beforeCONs:- Team morale is very sensible; players get unhappy or low morale very quickly- Transfer difficulty; As in the previous versions, the transfer fees are ridiculously high and it is very hard to buy a player you wantOverall, I would give it a 8/10, it's better than FM16 and with some tweaks could even become a great game!

												Is it fun? YesIs it a challenge? YesIs it an improvement? Kind of.While it has cool new features like AI drafts and Social Feed, it at the core is a update for FM16. However I believe this years to be much more of a hard game, where it isn't easy to win every game. I also like how they have compressed achievements and added others to replace.But overall, a good game.			"

												Every year me my, father and my brother all buy football manager in a quest to see who is the best football manger, we have done this every year since 2004. We all love the franchise but feel it has not lived up to recent promises that have been presented and the lack of improvement from last year is disapointing as even straight away as you join the club the speach is the exact same from last year. There are new menus that make the game more detailed but still looks and feels quite similar. However, this game is still amazing and the detail that has gone into it is emence and still serves its purpose as being a fantastic football simulater and the possibilities are unimaginable. If you were a new player i wouldnt see you getting bored with it in a long time.			"

												So the game is good and a welcome upgrade on 2015. A rather unfortunate number of negative reviews here are due to a chinese review bomb. I can't compare to 2016 because I only buy every other FM. No real problems with AI maybe the game is too hard for people hopping straight in the deep end with clubs like Barcelona, honestly guys try a league 2 English team or something it's fun!So having now played roughly 10 or so seasons taking Blyth Spartans to the premier league I can say the game is fun. It definitely doesn't deserve a 3/10 . This game is not worse than Aliens Colonial Marines. So please ask yourselves why the reviews are mostly negative and what substantive reasons people give to their negative recommendations.			"

												HI SEGA AND SI: I am a Chinese player, I play your CM series from 1998, to the present has been in the past 18 years.Of course, I am not every generation has to play, so far I have a genuine FM series of games only 4 models: FM2015&16&17, CM3.At 1998，there is company agent CM3, the Chinese mainland area called CM98, including simplified chinese.At that time, I love the football, playing to your game, I am very excited. I played CM3 until my University of grade 2 (2004).After several generation, because there is no purchase channels, and I love this series of games, so may not have but I play the FM that is not genuine.Until 2014，I can play the genuine FM2015 from steam, I immediately let people purchasing the FM from abroad; and later FM2016&17 is purchased directly STEAM.I would like to say, thank you for bringing me such a wonderful game, but now I am sorry very much, I have to give you a bad review.Since you changed to the FM series, there is no Chinese, even now FM2017 has supported the other 14 languages and english.This attitude makes me feel that you, your team and your stuffs, are against the Chinese mainland players.If it doesn't change, I don't think I will buy any FM series or SI products.Of course, I'm just an ordinary player, only one people that will not affect your product sales.Thank you again and I wish your performance is getting better and better.

												LOVE THE GAME, But one major thing is that, your defense sucks no matter what you do. Many times the breaks the line you have issue, just to press a player to get the ball, or him to make a mistake. That would have been fine, if it was not for that BIG GAB he leaves in the defense, your backs are totally useless in defense. Not closing the gab, get overrun easily, and your wing do not think defense. Most of the time they just lead there mann run, and then your back have two players to  protect against.

												Well all of us know that this year's FM has not got so many updates and new features. But the most important reason of me making a review like this one is : SEGA promised us to support Chinese this year. And I do not understand why they did not keep their words.I'm fine with the English version, as I've always been from FM 2012, when I knew FM at the first place.But if you make a promise, you better make it happen, otherwise you will get reviews like this one. I'll not change my review until Simplified Chinese is supported officially.			"

												So ive had the chance to read a few reviews, the top 20-30 negative reviews are based around poor optiumisation, there isnt a chinese version, its the same as the last 10 copies not to mention a good few of these reviews were made before release date in Beta stages.1. Poor optimisation? Buy a new PC. If your PC or Laptop cannot handle a Database game then you have some serious ♥♥♥♥ing issues my friend. Your opinion does not count with this comment. I have had the game from day 1 of Beta and ive had no issues what so ever. Optimisation issues on a Mac? ♥♥♥♥ off. Uninstall steam if youre even using a Mac. You're a disgrace. 2. No Chinese version? WHO REALLY GIVES A ♥♥♥♥? Stick to table tennis or badminton. Why would you want hieroplyphics across their screen whilst trying to get immersed in a Football Management Sim?3. ""Games♥♥♥♥♥♥ its the same as the last 10 years"" - Congratulations you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Its a football management simulator. Ofcourse its going to be the same. Besides player transfers and league positions what else do you honestly expect from a it? You all know what the game is going to be by the last 10 versions so why are you so thick?4. ""Im letting in goals left right and centre. My players are missing sitters and im bottom"" Then you sir are♥♥♥♥♥♥at the game. Its been out 10 years, if you havent mastered the basics by now. Youre proper ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥and you should just give up. Uninstall steam and ♥♥♥♥ off because if youre bad at this then id hate to think what other game you're shocking with. (The Sims?)Its all in the staff, coaches and training. Regardless if youre Man City or Arsenal. Your staffs stats still make a huge difference to the game. Research your staff and get rid of the deadwood. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Also a majority of you whining have well over 100 hours invested into the game... If i hated a game that much judging by some of your reviews, it wouldnt even get a 2 hour spin on it lol.Ofcourse this version has its bad bits. Only MAJOR issue i see within the game is the cost of players, especially young stars. I.E 17 year old Eric from Spain - Value 34k - I'll offer 100k for a near certain purchase. - £48 Million please.The game now has loads more features, most of it is really useful if youre playing the game properly. If its a quick escape its pointless to you.This release yet from SI has been the best yet and can only get better from this point forward i believe.			"

												If this game only has English language,chinese would not be so mean to you,but it has other language whose range are smaller than Chinese .I think this is a discrimination,it is not fair.And you also didn`t keep your promise.So I decide to give you a negative comment in order to protect our rights.PS:I am a chinese.The reason why I wrote this comment in English is that chinese are not idiots,thouthands of chinese buy GENUINE FM game,giving you negative comment is within our power.We love this game,so we want to make FM series better.I think most of chinese people don`t play genuine game is because of you don`t make chinese edition.So if you can make a chinese edition, it can benifits we both.Hope you can think about this instead of complain it on twitter and lie to us.Thank you very much.

												Personally I rack up around 1500 to 2000 hours every year on this franchise and I feel this new version (although at this stage it's still got some issues) is indeed an improvement on last year.Positives:Tweaks to the 3D engine are good the game seems a bit more realistic with the exception of a few minor issues with goalkeepers and general balance.UI seems a little more crisp.A Few more sensible options / reports with regards to staff feedback etc.  The new team report is great, very useful to assist you to identify possible issues in the team.I also really like that Brexit scenarios are included and the new promises portion of signing players.Negatives:At this stage club balance seems well  out of whack, promoted teams still considered to be of the league below. Although I suspect thiswill be fixed by release.This game still seems to have an issue it always has had, where young players never actually seem to grow taller which is a bit silly - at least I have never managed to get them to grow.Press conferences are generally just annoying. For example, it would be great if the game learned a little.. I always get asked about my tactics and I reply I will not discuss tactics before the game... would be great if they stopped asking that. Also I agree with one of the negative reviewers that the press always try to get you to fall out with other managers and misquote you - very frustrating although probably pretty realistic if I'm honest.Overall I feel this is another good addition to the franchise and lets face it if you are a football nut like me you will love it!Personally I can't wait until this is released tomorrow, I just hope they release the editor on the same day so I can sort the height issue out with my teams young players. Up the Reds!			"

												I will probably update this once I have more playing time.There are some nice little touches, like noting the number of away fans in the match info during the game.The 3D match is a bit smootherthan FM 2016....but they really need to do something about the players arms, it looks like they are all doing metal mickey impressions.Some of the screens are more detailed and the screens that interface with your backroom staff are better - the job advert system works better, the default skin can be harsh on the eyes on certain screens, but mainly looks ok.The overall gameplay at this point seems slightly better than FM 2016, however until I have played longer I can't say whether or not it will be addictive or not yet.Forgot to add, they have improved the stupid Ref in 3D, now at least he doesn't seem to always be where the ball is going, he actually stays out of the way more often than not, which was one of the most annoying things with the highlights of FM 2016 for me.Speed wise it is definitely faster than the last version, 14 leagues (with all the lower divions) and the large database, and it seems far faster to progress day to day than FM 2016 was with the same setupUpdate: Still loving the speed, simulated one season with 39 leagues in 15 countries in 2 hours, that would take 4 times longer on FM 2016.However, got myself appointed as Chelsea manager, got to be in charge for one game, 2nd leg of a UEFA Cup game against Leverkusen (sp?) the previous manager having lost the 1st leg 3-0. I won the game 2-1, got knocked out, immediately summoned to an emergency board meeting and fired.....WTF.Now I'm am annoyed, and probably won't play this game again for a while until I calm down and there are some patches applied to stop crap like that			"

												Football Manager 2017 is a good game, and after 1 week of having the game I have already sunk about 25 hours into it. There has only been one problem with the game which I have encountered and it is a game breaking one. It is where you go to load one of your saved games and a message pops up informing you that the save game cannot be loaded. This has been quite annoying to encounter and I hope it gets fixed soon but it probably won't. Apart from that though, the game is great.			"

												I've playing Football Manager since 2008 edition. It was the first time I play sports simulation game, and makes me love this game because its comprehensive information and data about football. From this game I've learned about history and records from a club, nation as well as player.For the next edition (2009) I didnt play FM, until 2014 edition (but I didnt have enough time to play). 2015 edition, I think it was the best edition. I've spent my gaming time not only just playing career with a team and trying to win a trophy but also learning how difficult the people behind the game is to present all the data that used when playing FM. I know I wasnt a good man in editing database, but from my experience when creating a new country as well as the structured competition (for additional my games) I've learn how difficult it is.I didnt play the 2016 edition. So far, the 2017 edition in my assessment was 8/10. + its the exciting new features like the manager facegen, promises in the pre-contract, and social feed (social feed was my fav).- its ME not improved significantly and many of UI still have a bug. but I think because the game is still in development (cause the newest patch can still released) I think its fair enough assessment for this edition. If you're truly football fans you must play Football Manager and feel the sensations to take control of your fav team.			"

												So I have like 600+ hours on FM15, and skipped 16 and decided to try out FM17. I'll be succinct as possible but let me explain why this is a great addition to the FM franchise. Good:- Much more difficult! My problem with previous games was that there were too many cookie-cutter tactics. There was no emphasis on looking at past matches and seeing why something worked well or why it didn't. Now I find myself using variations of the same formation or changing roles up. Which leads to my second point...- Better Data Analysis! I love looking at the stats for matches and seeing how we can exploit teams weaknesses. The new data forms are great for looking at past matches and if you have a Data Analyst, you get a nice printout of weaknesses a team had in the previous match. This is great for changing your formation up. Sometimes your data shows they have slow and weak D (C) and instead of having a ST drop back to help build up, maybe you just play your target man to stretch the defense and get a cheeky goal.  In this iteration moreso than FM15 (I have played 16, but it wasn't quite as good IMO), you feel as though you need to tinker and tune every single match. - Defenders actually follow the rules! Anyone who has played this game will tell you, that some of the older games a la FM15 and most likely 16, both had horrible problems with defenders. Although there are remenants of there uselessness (such as being incredibly out of position for counter attacks and through balls 90% of the time), they defend set-pieces admirably and make great decisions that I haven't seen yet in an FM game. - Scout footage! You can actually watch gameplay of a player you are scouting! Great addition to the game, really. Can see how he sits in the team, where he scores from most often. What position he scores at most, etc. Really a great idea to bring this in. - MLS easier to get Designated players! You're scouts and player's agents will now give you reports on Designated players. For instance, in FM15, you would be lucky to get a player like Michael Carrick or Huntelaar on your team. But in this update, it's much easier to see which players are willing to make the move to MLS as a Designated player. Small addition, but adds a great quality of life when managing the horrors of the MLS league. Bad:- Data Analysts and Sports Scientists have no explanation!

As for new players, this is the most fun yet that I've had in FM in a while. It's fun to create teams to put in random leagues and build a franchise from the ground up. Just lovely. 8/10, still some things to improve, but definitely a step in the right direction.			"

												Best football game on the market. Match engine feels more balanced and polished in comparison with FM16. Brexit feature adds more variety which is something I'm OK with. I have mixed feelings about the in-game ""social media tab"" - it is extremely repetative with always one positive opinion, one neutral and one negative.Player ratings system - especially central midfielders - is something that IMHO needs to be improved in future editions of the game.

IntroductionFootball Manager 2017 in my opinion is an excellent game. This game has received some criticism about how there is no real difference between this and last years edition, my answer to this is that is there really anything to change about a game which seems to be perfect in every way. Take a look at the FIFA franchise, that is basically the same as the years before (with the exception of this year with the addition of The Journey) with some minor engine upgrades, same as with Football Manager.Pros:- Excellent realism.- Fun gameplay that will keep you playing for hours.- You can play as pretty much every team you could possibly want.- No necessary DLC!Cons:- Some leagues don't have the official logos, kits or badges, this can be fixed with mods but it is a hassle.- Some player prices are unrealistic.- Match engine needs some work.- $50 maybe a bit too much.Conclusion:Overall Football Manager is a great game that allowed me to win the championship with Fulham and return them to the Premier League (Where they rightfully belong) and do whatever crazy thing I want! (example, selling all the Arsenal players for $100k and replacing them with the talented Sydney FC players for at least $50 million each) I hope these Football Manager games continue to impress and I will definitely be buying Football Manager 2018!Overall Score: 78/100 "

												So I have like 600+ hours on FM15, and skipped 16 and decided to try out FM17. I'll be succinct as possible but let me explain why this is a great addition to the FM franchise. Good:- Much more difficult! My problem with previous games was that there were too many cookie-cutter tactics. There was no emphasis on looking at past matches and seeing why something worked well or why it didn't. Now I find myself using variations of the same formation or changing roles up. Which leads to my second point...- Better Data Analysis! I love looking at the stats for matches and seeing how we can exploit teams weaknesses. The new data forms are great for looking at past matches and if you have a Data Analyst, you get a nice printout of weaknesses a team had in the previous match. This is great for changing your formation up. Sometimes your data shows they have slow and weak D (C) and instead of having a ST drop back to help build up, maybe you just play your target man to stretch the defense and get a cheeky goal.  In this iteration moreso than FM15 (I have played 16, but it wasn't quite as good IMO), you feel as though you need to tinker and tune every single match. - Defenders actually follow the rules! Anyone who has played this game will tell you, that some of the older games a la FM15 and most likely 16, both had horrible problems with defenders. Although there are remenants of there uselessness (such as being incredibly out of position for counter attacks and through balls 90% of the time), they defend set-pieces admirably and make great decisions that I haven't seen yet in an FM game. - Scout footage! You can actually watch gameplay of a player you are scouting! Great addition to the game, really. Can see how he sits in the team, where he scores from most often. What position he scores at most, etc. Really a great idea to bring this in. - MLS easier to get Designated players! You're scouts and player's agents will now give you reports on Designated players. For instance, in FM15, you would be lucky to get a player like Michael Carrick or Huntelaar on your team. But in this update, it's much easier to see which players are willing to make the move to MLS as a Designated player. Small addition, but adds a great quality of life when managing the horrors of the MLS league. Bad:- Data Analysts and Sports Scientists have no explanation! I feel like this is just a foresight on the part of the dev group, but these newer staff members have little to no explanation on how to use them. We know they reduce injury, give you a pre match analysis, but what differentiates a bad one from a good one? Considering a lot of bigger clubs start with one of each, or at least one, you could simply sell the one you have and hire a cheap one. In some cases these guys are making - Social media should have been more fleshed out! Like, This one bothers me the most. It's just sort of there, completely bulky and useless. The reaction from the fan base never changes. If I buy a crappy player and my fan reaction is low, I expect to get nasty tweets about the deal. Instead, you get 1 good tweet and 2 bad tweets. Likewise, if I sign a great player, you get 2 good tweets and 1 bad tweet. Very boring tweets with little to no substance. Also, it would have been nice to see it replace the news section completely.

												Best version since 2013, the new features can be easily ignored if they are annoying, otherwise everything is a welcome update.  Refreshed interface, added functionality, new staff and backroom options, its a good game.The launch was shaky, I will admit, and there can be a lot of gameplay clutter if you don't know how to manage it, but this game is superior to its predecessors in this generation of the current GUI.Hoping for an overhaul soon, improve the non-match engine, change the UI, but until then this is defintely worthy of being in your FM collection.

There are certain issues as with any game but i already know that i will be clocking up several hundred hours playing this, so pound for pound it is excellent value for money.			"

												I already spoke to SI about this issue for the past games but never done anything about it. I did not check yet if this issue is still persisting in this issue as well. Have been playing with Real Madrid for 7 seasons.  I have Morata playing as well with the club. He had to miss the last game of the Liga and the Final of the Champions League due to an injury. When I checked the payer's biography, there was written down that he did not win the cup. I think the issue needs to be resolved that all those players who were written down in the list, all of them should have the possibility that they will have their name as champions as in real life. Please bear in mind that Morata ended the season as top scorer in the cup.			"

												I would strongly suggest to purchase this game. Despite still being in the beta stage it still is a great game and can only improve after full release. Results are more realistic, but at the same time youre not going to lose 3-0 to a team 3 divisions below you. The English premier league is the toughest league so its not going to be a simple walk to the title. But if you play to your team strengths then the game is brilliant.			"

												FM 17 is simply perfect. It's a million times better than FM 16, particularly in regards to the match engine. While this year there are no ground-breaking new features, the game plays better than ever. Seriously, just try a match in the demo and you'll see how improved this iteration is.Side note, the game received a lot of negative reviews from Chinese players because their language isn't supported yet. Ignore them. Long-time players are all in love with the new version because of how much it has improved.			"

												Every time i look to these reviews i wonder if everyone has just gone insane.Has the game seriously turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥so badly that everyone hates it now?It needs work sure. Keepers rarely get a defense, defenders just give up plays for no reason, terrible players turn into Messi and score insane goals, there is an awkward amount of goals from the side line, animations are bad.That being said, in my personal experience i found it to be by far the most addictive FM i played so far. It's harder to win, finding the perfect tactic is much harder. Scouting has evolved, it's now easier to find the players you need. I do agree it lacks new feature but thinking about it i can't come up with anything else they could add to this game.This game is amazing even with its flaws and does not deserve the bad reviews people are giving it.

												Having been a fan since 2011 I must say I already enjoy this game a lot more than some of the previous versions. The game is a lot more forgiving to non-hardcore football fans who don't know all the ins and outs of the game, and it does streamline the backroom advice meetings. The update to the social media is also a lot of fun. Seeing NPC's tweet about my progress in-game makes my successes and failures seem more realistic. As a few people have already mentioned, if you're looking for a game with tons of new features from the previous game then this isn't the game for you, and it's not worth upgrading. However if you're looking for a more streamlined, and overall more enjoyable playing experience, then this game is defenitely worth getting. Also keep in mind, some peoples complaints may be invalidated when the game is fully released, as it is still in beta.			"

												Really enjoying beta so far.Been playing since mid 90's however as i've gotten busier my interest in the game has started to decline.2014 was first year I didn't purchase on release date. 2016 first year I didn't buy it at all.Possily enjoying it so much after a year out so the changes stand out more rather than the continous minor tweaks.Match engine seems better and player interaction much improved.

												I love all the football manager games and cant tell why this game is getting more hate than the other versions because this one has more things in it than the others, New staff and a new tactics familiarity bar for players. If your being influenced by the mass amount of people sying this games terrible all you have to do is look at how many hours theyve put into this game. The majority have over 50 hours but still gave it thumbs down, seems hypocritical. The games great as usual!			"

												Even though i haven't played all that much, i've played enough to know that the constant negative reviews are unfair on the series. I've been a fm fan for a while and althought fm 17 hasn't brought the MOST updates ive ever seen in a series it is still a good solid game. I clocked over 1000 hours in both FM 13 and FM 14 and i don't find FM17 any worse than them, it is still an amazing football manager experience with different things happening in everybodies save which makes it unique and special. Not every annual release of every game has 5000 million updates. The franchise is still improving as a whole and im not sick of it. 9/10 would reccommend to any football fan.			"

												The game is not a game of revolution, but one of refinement. Transfers are smarter and more involved than previous FM games, and the faster player development and streamlining of information are welcome. The perennial strengths of Football Manager are stronger than ever, yet it’s the furtive improvements to the match engine that really set FM2017 apart from its immediate predecessor. Sure, I still have gripes with the tactical interface, and there isn’t anything new there worth writing about. While the tactial interface is rigid and in need of an overhaul, the match engine is enjoyable again. New features are lacking, and those that exists are trivial, but match days are more involved and pertinent information is easily accessible and well presented. But if your rear end has ever been entrenched in the virtual dugout or you're just a fresh-faced hopeful looking to begin your journey, Football Manager 2017 is easy to recommend to the budding manager.

												FM17 has got better and better in my opinion since the latest patch release. I have played on FM since the start and it is great to see all of the enhancements throughout the game. FM17 is a cut above FM16, which I also enjoyed very much.The Match Engine is solid and you can see your tactics working and I love the transfers to China, makes it so realistic to the modern game. Great Job SI :)			"

												First let me say that FM17 is my first FM game. I'm a Yank who fell in love with football during the 1994 WC in the U.S. and have been a big fan of international football first, but more and more I'm an EPL fan, especially since NBC now let's us see ALL EPL games. Anyway, I'd never really given FM any thought in the past because quite honestly, I was a bit intimidated by the depth of the game. However, I decided to give the FM16 demo a spin a month or so ago and then bought FM17 during beta release and I....CAN'T....QUIT.....PLAYING! While I'm still getting my head handed to me for the most part (although believe it or not, I did win the Champions League with Tottenham in one of my first seasons), especially trying to win with Swansea (yeah, I'm a Bradley fan), I have learned SO much about the game (both real football and this game) from lurking in the forums and reading user-created guides that have been stickied.Anyway, from what I can tell, the bad reviews are basically in one of three camps: 1. I'm Chinese and don't like the fact it isn't ported to Chinese 2. It is too much like previous versions 3. I can't win because of bugs or I'm just bad and won't admit it. While I can't speak about item 1, what is wrong with a game that is similar to the game you love with just a few more features on an annual basis? I've played over 100 hours and put down $50 and am just getting started. If I quit tomorrow and enjoyed myself, $2/hour is pretty cheap entertainment. Jeez guys, developers have to eat too so throw them a bone once a year if you like the game even if it doesn't contain earthshaking changes. As for item 3, I love the fact that I'm getting my butt kicked most of the time. In this day and age, everyone wants to win, but no one wants to put the time in that it takes to be good at something. After doing hours of reading in the forum tips/guides section, I'm actually starting to improve quite a bit and hope to someday coach Swansea into the top 4 and while I don't know if that will ever happen, I'm sure enjoying trying! If I was going to give a game bad reviews on steam, it would be due to stability issues, lack of replayability or just poor gameplay so it just boggles my mind that the major of reviews (about 66%) are negative? I'd like to give the developers a big thanks and tell them to keep up the good work because you've won a fan for life! If you are the analytical type who really wants to get a feel for what it must be like to be a real, football manager and are willing to put some time in to study up, this game is for you.			"

As a typical FM player, I'll play the game loads and buy FM 18 anyway and that will probably contribute to SI's complacency.			"

												Much better than last year (last years game was virtually unplayable for me due to constant bugs) with the only bug i have found being that sometimes alt+tabbing out and back into the game will result in a black screen but just repeaing the process fixes it. The customisation of the manager is nice if a bit to in depth for something that is superficial, the scouting system seems better despite beingthe same as last season (less black stars helps a lot). My only real complaints is that bookings seem to be given out for fun in this game, both for me and the computers, and some players seem to be massively under rated (will grigg should be much higher rated than he is given the amount of goals he scored) and positions seem to be mixed up for wingers with a fair few players (rangers wingers are the wrong way round that i noticed as well as oliver burke) but other than that a good game all round			"

												Install.Start New Save.Sign Heskey.1st thing I do every time. But onto the actual review.So far about 70 hours in and just into my 2nd season with Leeds United. I haven't experienced any game breaking bugs. Only issue so far was with wages( Had 30k wages, but was only able to offer 2.5k in contracts) & another with player promises, was absolutely positive I had met all promises for my top goalscorer(Kevin Lasagna, hilarious name btw and a beast in championship) Had to sell him because of this apparent broken promise but I more than doubled what I paid for him so that lessened the blow somewhat.Graphics - Improved, more realistic movement on players, not perfect though as on highest setting on occasion the players move with the ball with their legs not moving at all, sorta ghost walking.Game Engine - Similar to last year, punishing if you don't make changes during the game. But highly rewarding if you do. Coming back from 3-1 down at half time to win 4-5, thanks to a few well times subs & tactic tweaks.Overall impression on beta. Addictive & very enjoyable with only a few small issues. "

												I have bought every football manager game since 2005. Before that i had lots of fun with championship manager series. And to be honest, i waited to buy fm17 partly because of all the negativ reviews and because i was having a blast with one of my FM16 playthroughs.If you play football manager for the immersion part of it, like me, then fm 17 has a lot to offer. They have made many tweaks and added new functions that take som time to find. I find that enjoyable and shows that the devs are actually doing something good and productive. And the fact that they are making pathches and updates, shows they listen to the community. Sometimes it might seem slow but hey, programming takes time.I have not expericened the long winning streak followed by long loosing streak error, which was the main reason i waited to buy.To sum up: FM17 is another great installment to the series, and i cant wait to see what new features will see in the future. Buy it if you want a game that is great to play on the side, while watching some champions league football in the background.Remember: Install the game on a SSD to improve saving/loading time.			"

												I'm baffled by the ""mostly negative"" reviews on here.What everyone has to remember is the fact that this game is still in BETA. As of right now, I've not played much - around 22hours in the game and so far i've found it very similar to FM2016 until I fully understand the logic behind the Sports Scientists, analysts and other new key features - which I'd imagine I'll have to explore the game and test out a bit more to know. Unfortunately, no highlights of stats appear against them which is a negative right now, but i'd imagine this will be fixed.Playing in the scottish leagues again, I feel as if for several years now that I'm still struggling to sell players, but every other club around me can offload their ""prized possessions"" so quickly and easily and turn a quick buck, whereas I'm struggling to sell a single player before I simply release them a year or two down the line as they just don't meet my requirements any more.On the other hand of all of this, I feel the signing of players is much MUCH better. I'm not too sure what SI changed in regards to this, but there is a sense of realism to it now where I can actually sign players for roughly the value i'd expect to sign them for - instead of most clubs asking for 10s or millions of pounds for a player that is no where near his potential, nor will I be able to sell him at his prime, or for him to even reach his prime for me.All in all, It's similar to FM16, except when some of the new features has a bit more depth and a few fixes in to prevent any bugs, it'll be a great game.

Ofcourse as the game adds more every year it's going to become harder to add new conetent which is as revoloutionary as before. I'm not going to act as individual who only defends Sports Interactive here and I do understand there are bugs/problems with the game but guys seriously don't just give it a bad review because you got off to a terrible start with a formation which has worked on a previous years version.

												I am unsure why there are so many angry reviews on FM17. I think its a vast improvement of FM16. The introduction of a 64 bit version means performance has dramatically improved.  The new panels to analyse your games to see where your team is flawed is brilliant. People were expecting a whole new game compared to FM16. I'm not sure where this expectation came from. As far as bugs in the game, I have not seen any as of yet. It appears many reviews are because it is not as easy to play as FIFA! Such as 'Teenage players cost too much' the solution is that you clearly are not a big enough club to focus on that heavily. If you look at the top teenagers who have transfered in recent years, you'll notice that they often go for large fees... Its a simulation! What do you expect! If you want to sign young players then choose Man Utd or Man City who have lots of disposable income for that. I find most of the negative complaints on here utter rubbish with the main complaint it is too hard. The only reason I don't find it hard is because I have played the last two football managers heavily. If you want it to become less difficult, play it more and be willing to learn it. Also, there is a Demo version so perhaps you should've tried that before you bought it.			"

												To whom it may concern,Football Manager is arguably the best representative sample of what it takes to manage any kind of football club in the world, and do so in a variety of different styles.  This year's edition allows for a more comprehensive user immersion by allowing the player to generate his/her face into the game.  The match engine has also been redefined as well as a retouching of certain UI features, game features, and the customizable part of the player's game.I love football, and I highly recommend this game to all lovers of the beautiful game and non-lovers alike.  However, I do not recommend this game for the casual football manager or the uninformed supporter of a mjaor club who can barely name ""their club's starting XI"".  Football Manager 2017 allows us as fans of the franchise to become evven more involved at the clubs we know, don't know, or the one our friends dared us to create.  Football Manager 2017 is an improvement of an already unique franchise and this year's edition does not disappoint.What I Like:I. I like that I can now put my face into the body of my manager and he is truly a personal creation much like my legacy to come in Football Manager.  I am an Arsenal man myself, with a few kits and a scarf to compliment it.  I also made my avatar manager to look like me (since I always dress up everyday in and out of game).  My manager has become a personality within the game, but he exists outside the game when I flap my arms bemoaning the fact that my top-notch striker who I dished out $50 million for is writhing on the ground from a cynical challenge.II. Football Manager has given me even more control of my tactical approach.  I remember my lists of instructions from Football Manager 2015 being 15 items long (no wonder you all are laughing and my players could never blend into the side).  The condensed tactical options have put more emphasis on matchday decisions and tweaking of a basic set of instructions for my team.  As a manager, matchday preparation is as important as the substitutes used and instructions given on matchday.III. The coaching system gives me the ideal staff I want as a manager.  As a top-notch Premier League club, I want to bring in world-class coaches to enhance my chances of a title run.  Meanwhile, a lower tier club around the world must make the most of limited resources at its disposal.  This creates a game within the game as quality coaching at any level can help your squad achieve the success you, the manager, have been cooking up.IV. The addition of social media.  Although very limited in scope, the addition of social media helps to bring the life of a modern manager to the game.  I can now see what my supporter's spokesperson is emphasizing and how my supporters react to my latest run of matches or the big transfer target I just busted the bank for.  In my opinion, it was about time the mailroom got a new addition because I remember the days when my inbox would have 25 messges a day because of all of my subscriptions to stay informed.V. The new way injuries are denoted.  As an avid spectator of football, I am accustomed to hearing injury diagnosis on air by the match commentators.  Football Manager added that this year and I believed it helped enhance my experience even more.  I remember when I would cautiously sub off a knicked player because I did not know the extent of his injury, only that my assistant recommended that the player come off.  With today's additions of new technologies avaiable for diagnosis, it was about time I had more than physios diagnosing injuries.  What I Don't LikeI. I am still not a fan of the 3D match engine.  I know that the FIFA franchise by EA is where that can be found, but I believe that Sports Interactive needs a greater involvement in devloping the match engine.  It has come leaps and bounds since FM 15 when players looked lost on the pitch, but more is needed in this area.  The revamped engine found in FM 17 is quality, but I would like to see more from Sports Interactive in the future.II. Not all leagues and clubs have an official liscense with SI.  In the future, I would like to see SI use its connections to get official FIFA sponsorship for all leagues, clubs, and players.  Out of the Park Developments did this with their MLB and NHL games and it has paid dividends.  While FaceGen is still lacking, FM could surpass this with their own official sponsoring from FIFA and numerous high-profile players.III. The transfer market is still unbalanced.  I know that top-class players warrant high fees, but it is ridiculous to me that a club in a precarious financial situation will demand more than acceptable fees for players.  I understand this oocurs in the real tranfer market, but it is not the only method of business.  I find it hard to have players live up to fees and I wish that the game balanced transfers slightly more.This review is unofficial and posted on behalf of my own account.  I hope you all decide to buy this title as it does live up to its hype.  Overall I agree with the metacritic score of 80, the game is great, but certain features hamper the experience.In the future I would love to see touchline antics and celebrations for managers because they do exist around the world (nothing gets my blood flowing like agitating the fourth official), a better match engine because I feel like FM 17 underperformed in this regard, and a way to compete with your favorite clubs in a create a league mode where you create a club through a fantasy draft and square off against the champions of the world (club or national team).Disclaimer: I do not recommend FM 17 if you are not willing to invest time to know the happenings of world football.  The game is not as rewarding that way and $50 USD is a lot to pay for a game you may never understand.			"

												Don't listen to all the haters. The amount of work required to keep working on the same game and concept year after year is quite a lot. FM17 is the first FM in years that has A LOT of improvements. Yes, the match engine and the interface are almost quite similar in comparison to the last two FMs.. but its the tiny things and the tiny changes that make it waay better than any fm over the past few years. Stats, player info, pre and post match analyses, player conversations and all. Its all the new tiny details added this year that make it so great. And to be quite honest, these tiny details are why we love this game. Adding all the small and trivial details that a real life manager has to go through. I really dont understand what 'New features' most of these people were expecting. Yes, the game is in the end a program and has it's flaws, but it's quite close to being a totally realistic simulation than any other football game out there. In my opinion, this is the best FM in 3-4 years in terms of improvements. Improvements which stay pretty close and ture to the original purpose of the game, which is to make you feel like a real football manager.9/10			"

												If you want a balanced review of this game then you have come to the wrong place. Google it instead. This is not the buggy piece of crap most (Chinese) Steam users would have you believe it is. Fair enough it's not a million miles from the previous few versions, but was it ever going to be? It's an upgrade, with a few tweaks here and there. Waah, waah. If you liked the previous versions, you will like this. Not much more to say other than give it a try and if you don't like it, request a refund. Don't be like the other boring, spotty, fat ****s about it and give it 1/10 because it has a slight issue, or they didn't implement one tiny UI update that you were hoping they did. Every iteration of FM has had issues - did that stop you ploughing through season after season and racking up 500hrs + of game time?In the words of Captain Hook - ""I like it.""/fanboy (and not the slightest bit bothered :))			"

												This is definitely not a game that you can judge by its covers. It's covers are plain, old and dusty. But once you ""open"" it and start playing you discover level of detail and sophistication (player database, statistics, tactical preparation, man management etc.) that you won't find in any other football game. It's realistic, demanding and ruthless. And you will get punished if you don't pay attention to details. In short, if you want a hardcore manager simulation then this is the game for you, if you're a casual gamer just look away.			"

												Lets start off with the good, all the new touches to the Inbox, how staff work and transfers are fantastic. Now to the bad (and where it counts) the 2 most important aspects, the tactics and how they translate onto the pitch, the tactics are exactly the same, literally nothing new and the match engine is no different to FM16. Apart from these two MASSIVE issues the rest of the game is fine. If you dont like change then this is the game for you.			"

												I've never written a review for any game before, but I find that there are far to few fair reviews of the game.   First if you're a first time buyer, do not be scared of buying the game despite it's negative reviews. The game certainly has a steep learning curve for beginners, and it might never have been steeper, because of the new more realistic interactions with the agents, where they can demand release clauses for your wonderkids which makes it harder to just look up 20 wonderkids and buy them and then become a powerhouse 3 seasons in, as well as the improvement in manager AI where opponents will adapt and exploit your weaknesses.  This really isn't a game for those that want it all to be easy.  But if you're here you have a passion for football or soccer, you want to unearth the next Neymar perhaps? Find the new Ronaldo, get the new Buffon, or lift the Champions League trofee.  You may never do it, you may do it, it takes work, scouting and most of all time, there is nothing that guarantees instant results.   Quite frankly the game is more a scouting tool than a game almost, which should tell you that this is the most realistic and the best football manager game out there. If you're an avid football manager gamer, temper your expectations. This game is mostly based on FM16 which was a good step forward from FM15, despite it's problems.   With every iteration of Football Manager there are some people that want fifa level match engines, face it, it's not something we will ever get, because that's not the kind of game this is.  We have the mandatory updated database, injuries are still a woe, just as in real life, and is simulated pretty realisticly, and if you look around at the avarage injuries a team has at all times, you will find they have quite a few at all times, so don't complain about it, you're not entitled to have an injury free first team, and there are quite a few ways to reduce the amount of injuries one get.   The game is more streamlined, you have far easier access to all your necessary information, and backroom information goes straight to your inbox.   The game now runs on 64 bit, which makes it run far smoother,  if you have a 64 bit computer, which I have to assume you do.  Social feed is an gimick that has arrived in this iteration of the game, and looks to be something that Sports Interactive might build on in the future, which is a nice detail that adds in the immersion until they run out of original twitter posts and you get tired of seeing the same old where you have three reactions to the match.  As for the match engine, it still has problems, but rome wasn't built in a day, right, or 3 years, which is about the time we've had the same engine,  being upgraded and slowly fixed last three years.  And as I told first time buyers above, injuries are a part of the game, and if they are an issue, it's your own fault and not the game's.  Now, I urge you to buy the game if you have a passion for football, and would like the most realistic simulation of managing a football team.  If you just want a game.. and you stumbled on this, then you should not, cause it's not just a game, it's a way of life, and as life demands alot this game does too.  "

												Game is "" the same"" as last year, still enjoyable, i mainly wanted to do this ""Review"" For our Chinese Colleagues.Stop whining, Write it your self, nearly every langauge available in this game has been fan made.Player stats were(may still be not sure) fan made, people scouted/Translated for this game to make it more enjoyable for everyone.Your being disrespectfull towards the people that are doing stuff for this community by complaining about the lack off chinese in this game, again, Start translating your self if your so annoyed with it, contact SI  and see if they are willing to put your translation in the game for succesors.. Who knows you might be asked to help out for new features in the future.PS. Stop pirating this game might help aswell ;)Anyway, to get to the game it self.. Im again enjoying it just like many past versions, The new features that i have been using up until now are great.Sure its the same every year, yet diffrent.Also, Keep in mind, until next week this game is still in Beta, so bugs as in injuries, money dissapearing or w/e are bound to happen, Dont play it if you dont want obvious bugs and just wait till next week!Get this game if you're in to football, and the tactical side off things, running a profitable club.

												It's a shame the game is being Metabombed by people unhappy about localisation as it continues to improve and add features year on year. I'm a long time fan of the series who has had their ups and downs with it over the years but I'm really enjoying this version, so take that as you will.Some things I've noticed that I like:- Improved match engine. Refinements everywhere, players make decisions and act more fluidly over previous versions though can still seem a bit ice-skatey and ponderous from time to time. Your team does what you tell them for the most part, it seems easier to tell when things aren't working through assistant feedback and player's body language, in-match tactical changes and team talks have a visible effect.- Many screens are overhauled and streamlined, often giving you the options to perform the action you need to take as and when applicable, really cuts down the time spent digging through screen after screen for the information or options you want.- Interacting with people (players, board, agents, press) is improved. You can talk to a prospective signing before hand to give them a clearer idea what you expect from them and make promises to convince them to join. Agents are still all Satan himself.- On top of all the stats and analysis that were added in recent years, you can get reports about your matches and opponents that give actual insight into how best to prepare your side and tactics. What's working and what's not. Where their weaknesses might be.I give it 9 To Dare Is To Do's out of 10 Danny Roses.			"

This game is £35 and if you liked FM in the past, you will get your money worth! Its not FM2012 but its a good game which HAS improved from 2016 and is worth a play if you enjoy the FM series.People have unreal expectations, its a game not real life and IMO FM is the best game series out there and FM17 does not hurt that one bit. They aren't many games that for 30/40 quid you can get thousands of hours out of it.Biggest improvement in the series in a number of years and worth if this is your thing!			"

												Been playing Football Manager and the original Championship Manager ever since they were first released on the Commodore Amiga. I am a huge fan and have enjoyed every version since the original. Me personally I have enjoyed FM17 more than FM15 and FM16. The beta for me has been very stable, I like the tweaks to the match engine and even the improvements to creating your manager are good. It's not Fifa 17 quality but shows good improvements. I see there is a lot of negative reviews due to the issues with Chinese Language. Please don't let the negative reviews put you off this game, it really is great. Another life sucking game that I'm finding hard to put down. I know there are still improvements to come with the full version and I look forward to the tweaks and fixes. Overall I can highly recommend FM17, just be warned that once you start playing it's very hard to stop.			"

												This is great game. It has been updated for many years.compare to previous FM2016Match engine had updated much better. (It became more realistic when i use Fullbacks on both side.)Graphics slightly better than it used to.In my opinion, even though the game is still beta,There are 2 reasons that i recommend for playing 2017 than 2016Firstly, Devs added 2 more occupations for staff (Data Analyzer, Sports scientist), which has not been updated perfectlyThe one seems help to understand opponents strategy by giving us detailed data sheet as if it is can be found on [whoscored.com]and the other seems help or assist Dr. to prevent from the injury that possibly occur on your team player.Secondly, you can make fun of making Manager's face.just check the screenshot of FM2017 community hubs. it doesnt require the game.As a beta version this definetely need to update a lot, though.I would recommend for playing FM2017.P.S. when i read a review like : No Chinese, No commendation? LOLDo Chinese really think that is the constructive review?They're must be the f**ked up communists who do not do their best to get and acheive what they want.Chinese should know that languages translation was offered by community from each countries under Czech from the list.

												As Football Manager 2016, was, at least for me, a failure, I started FM2017 with a dose of scepticism. I preordered it though,  because I buy it every year, and in terms of hours spents, it always justifies it's value.After about 40 hours of BETA, and now some hours with full version, I have to say that I don't find any big issues with it. Interface is polished, UI is responding quickly due to 64bit version, everything goes smooth. And most important part, the match engine, this year seems very good. As bad as Crossing Manager 2016 match engine was, this is complete opposite. It is more balanced, more fluid, and you have feeling that your instructions are playing the part. I do definately recommend it. 8/10 for me.			"

												Edit- march 2017Have to make known some issuesGame feels choked. Straight Red Cards can only happen with a reckless tackle.Absolutely nothing else. No last man professional foul, no violent conduct etc.Goalkeepers never ever give away penalties. When GKs makes tons of saves in a match, their rating does not tally. 7.1, 7.2 max.Score a goal clearly via deflection counted as an own goal by deflectorPlayers via agents still ask for improved contracts every other week after getting rejected more than once.When player misses a penalty, said player refuses to go for the follow up. Never ever.Bought it @ 20% off for owning copies since 2011. 5% for each copy till max 20%Its basically the same old FM with an updated database, Despite numerous improvements, there really isnt anything strikingly different from previous versions. The bugs during beta seems to have been fixed but players demanding new contracts every few weeks even after i have spoken to them is really annoying.(Cant go on holiday during off season since they will crank up if they cant speak to you) Match engine still suck. The positioning of your players on set pieces still get thrown into chaos when you change a tactic. All these overwhelmingly negative reviews seems to be a little harsh but i still enjoyed the game so im giving it a thumbs up. PS: Do somewhat shake things up on ya own. Go download skins, facepacks, logos etc etc. It'll make the game alot more enjoyable			"

												Czech supported, Danish supported, Norwegian supported, whatever languages you've never heard about are all supported except for Chinese. Good job licking asses of players speaking those languaes SI. No offense for ppl in those countries though, but just think about the numbers. SI is just too arrogant to care about Chinese players because they have been so loyal to this franchise. So, if SI licks asses, we can simply kick♥♥♥♥♥The fact is, incorporating Chinese support in the game is not much harder than us giving negative reviews, because the community translation has been there for quite a while, at least a few years, and very much polished already. We've seen SI's attitude, and now we are showing ours. Unless SI reveals the reason for denying an official Chinse language support, negative reviews will not stop growing. Workshop is NOT enough.

												Don't often write too many reviews, but THIS IS EXCELLENT! everything you do matters more than ever before. 64 hours in 5 days is stupid. I don't play that amount of time on games often. I can't keep off of it. Equally enthralling as it is frustrating. When you get things right though, god it feels good. EVERYTHING MATTERS! no more one style fits all. Can't rush through seasons. Honestly I don't understand the negative reviews here. Last one I enjoyed was FM 2013. I've had no crashing or any issues of any kind.............. Buy it!			"

												addictive, i have bought every version of this game and every year i wait for the new version to be released, but there must be new features in side the game it is some thing that so boring to answer media questions every time with the same answers i dont even read the question and it is so boring i always assign assistant manager to answer them but usually this part must take the next step .  another feature that must be included is the youth teams and the youth candidates if u r so lucky u will have tow players that are very good and the are♥♥♥♥♥♥why u dont include more youth players why there is no youth camps in other countries why it is just one youth team it must be under 15 under 17 under 19 every tow years the player go to the next level . another thing why players dont get attribute points more throug the season the best i get in 6 editions of football manager is 3 attribute changes in every season . transfer are unrealestic again and again for example aplayer that is aged 19 playing with the youth team in portugal when u want to sign him they are asking for 80mill dollars!!!! i tried to convince him and declare interest and the player is unhappy an the team still want 80 mill this is some thing that must be improved. agent !! what are their rule in the game they are just names u cant speak with them u cant build a relationship that can endorse a transfer they play no rule in obliging a transfer   . if i want to continue and speak about what i want in the game i will speak for two days . thanks alot for this game i love this game i dont play any other game im addicted to this game but i want it to be better to supply all my needs . and plzzzz dont just improve picture in the game i play this game and watching the game through commentry i dont need this.

												I recommend Football Manager 2017 because it is worth playing.I admit FM2017 is indeed a good game. But it is a pity that there is no Chinese language support. Chinese is my mother tongue, I will feel more comfortable if  playing in Chinese.			"

												This is a really solid update from last year's entry. The match engine is much improved and it feels as though your tactics have more of an influence on the game. Negotiating with agents/players feels more realistic than ever and the UI is generally more streamlined. The whole game runs a lot better and the load times seem greatly reduced.The only negative so far is the social feed. It feels a bit redundant and tends to recycle the same messages, but it hardly has a negative impact on the overall experience. I just feel as though they could have spent that time and energy on other aspects of the game.It's still the best football management sim out there. I've bought all of these games going back over a decade, and this is a definite improvement on 2016. Ignore all of the troll reviews - if you want to take your local team from obscurity to Premier League glory, it's still the best game out there.			"

												Best Football manager yet, more realistic! I used to choose one tactics and buy players to fit it and i'd win win win as long as my players were stronger, now tactics seem more effective, if my defence is high up that reflects on the pitch when watford lob a ball over the top of my back line to a man running free. it is more difficult because it is more realistic and that is brilliant! a couple of licenses lost are the only negative i have found so far.Edit: Forgot to mention the game is so much faster now it is x64, allowing it to utilize people with multiple processors thus speeding up day time, i no longer have time to watch a youtube video alongside football manager as the days resolve the fixtures so quickly			"

												Football Manager has always been my favorite game！I bought more than 2 months of the game, the game time of 405 hours, the official commitment of the Chinese version of why not yet cashed?Football Manager一直是我最喜欢的游戏，我购买Football Manager 2017超过2个月，游戏时间405小时，官方承诺的中文版问什么还没有兑现？既然在中国开放购买，那么应该有中文版本，没有中文版本和游戏的画面不好，游戏的打击感不好这些因素一样，是影响个人游戏体验的因素之一，我很不满意，不推荐！我已经购买了fm2016和fm2017，如果一直没有中文版本，那么在fm2018出中文版本之前，我绝对不会再购买！no chinese  no recommendation!!!

												Edited: Now that SI working on Chinese translation, I guess there is no reason to bash this game againIt's actually a decent game... Not the best FM game, but still good. I can't compare this with the last year FM, but from 2015 game, it's a quite good upgrade... Great actually.Need a lot of fix, and I hope they fixed this on full release...Overpowered AI when your team tactical familiarity is full just taking too much.Ok, the enemy knows my team's weakness, it doesn't mean that they can easily counter it...Need much much much work to do with ""realistic"" match engine...God goalkeeper, stupid defence, massive injuries, etc. It's an old♥♥♥♥♥♥taken from previous version that keep coming on every year...And, I hope they who gave this game negative review JUST because a language package, can fix their review if SI give Chinese language on release.

												Have played lots of previous FM`s this is the best so far, 3D engine much better, player contracts and promises nice touch, whole game runs better.Must keep players happier,Team meetings and instructions have far more influance.Players improve/decrease over course of season, analyst information useful and pre-match reports/information more helpful.Lost of little inprovements on top of this, few tiny bugs ( few zombie moments but the rest of the match action is great, can`t predict if attack will lead to goal now, ball passed around more to make match more intresting and no crazy angles in terms of shots) Forget Chinese negitive .

												Ah FM2017 where have you been the last few years. It is so good to see you return. Unlike the 50 individual instructions per player managers, and the change your tactics every time you see a pass fail, I believe that a good tactic, a smart squad build, smart succession planning and development game time maketh the team. Only ego, panic and faux micromanagement can sink you. For the most part CM / FM always rewarded a steady hand on the tiller and punished panic.  But then the 'tactical managers' got their turn and the saddest post I ever saw, was this; 'even if you have a winning tactic, you must change your tactics at least 6 times per game or the AI will 'learn' and punish you in FMxx . Really ? If Sir Alex or Barca's tika taka didnt abandon the tactic before half time and throw in 6 different ideas for the one match, then the Everton or Real Sociedad manager would learn and beat you on the day? Seems historically unlikely and nice ego boost for managers (simulated and real) who think its their 5 minute segment brilliance that determined the sim or game.  This years version (still in Beta = PLEASE dont change when the tactical crew whinge!) seems to be one for  the folks who value consistency and for that (and the 15K hours I've put into the game life to date - I thank the developers) It's our turn!!! woohoo. Its so good to build a 5 year team and then bring another 5 year team through because you had planned for it. Not have the game punish you in Jan, without fail,  for  not abandoning your plan.  Not everyone has a 15 minute attention span! some of us go long......RAVE OVER ! I'm going back to play another 1500 hours in this years installment. Thanks again!			"

												I owned FM series at Steam since 13, and perchased several CD version of FM before. As a loyal customer, I feel deeply hurt this year because of those comments by Mr. Miles Jacobson, the director of FM. His tweet in 2011 says that ""to do a Chinese translation, we'd need 20k of the people currently pirating to buy the game. And that's not going to happen."" After five years' effort, Chinese gamers make this happens, more and more FM fans choose to perchase FM from Steam in order to have Chinese translation version, however, Chinese translation never came.His recent replies cannot satify gamers who perchased this game, just making excuses. He never gave any detail reason about why they don't do that translation, just keep saying perchased people is not enough, people should keep buying. Those excuses make Chinese FM fans so dissapointed.As a soccer fan, I know that soccer is not limited by language that players use, so should this game. And it is not only about a translated version, it is about responsibility. As a game company, you should do what you said.As a FM fan, FM used to take up an important part in my heart, I played this game since I was a teenager. However, I will not recommand any of my friends to perchase this game. Because we don't deserve this discrimination.			"

												The people posting negative reviews were never going to be happy and probably mention that they haven't played FM in 5 years or longer. Game is great, improvement over last year. For once the improvments on the pitch really show. I love the new tactics screen and the new social screen(while it takes some getting used to) is pretty neat. Staff advice is far improved this year and is probably my favorite part of the new game.			"

												You'll see a lot of negative reviews by keyboard warriors complaining that this isn't 'as good as the 2012' version.  Ignore that; these people are idiots, with ridiculous expectations built out of the frustration of never having a girlfriend and living in their parents’ basement at age 35.  I swear to God, some of them won’t be happy until they can give up their sad pathetic little lives and exist full time in Jose Mourinho’s VR face, while they fantasise about living in a Manchester Travel Tavern and getting in public spats with VR Paul Scholes about the advantages of operating quick attacking wingers with overlapping full backs.I’m also going to have to get pretty defensive of the developers.  How dare some people say that this is a rip off at £35.  They have one release update a year, which acts as their main source of income so we can, you know, keep the getting the game; and they can, you know, keep feeding their families! If you don’t understand how that works then♥♥♥♥♥♥off back in time to Communist Russia you absolute momo.  Plus, if you want to moan at a company for stupid prices then look at Firaxis who are charging £50 for Civ 6, while they release 3 updates and multiple DLC over the next year which will set you back upwards of £150 in total.Anyway; let’s put it in perspective:·	Is FM 2017 perfect - No.  ·	Is the match engine a little sketchy - Always has been probably always will be.  ·	Is it addictive - Yes.  ·	Are the people giving negative reviews still going to clock a 1000+ hours - YES!·	Is it the best football manager simulator on earth - HELL YES!Positives:·	What can I say other than it’s a typical FM update with some fun tweaks and changes.  We all know what to expect by now; you can’t expect revolution, but it’s about as close as a sim can come to reality with the current technology available. ·	The staff development (sport scientists/data analysts) is great; I’ve wanted this side developed for years, as it’s as important as the players in modern football.  I do think that this is still rudimentary at this stage though, as I don’t think the ‘new’ staff really do much within the game, but certainly something that can be developed over the next few years. Negatives:·	The Social Media function is pointless; complete waste of time unless it is expanded upon and somehow enveloped into the news feed.Some really obvious glitches in the match engine (that I am confident will be fixed over the next few weeks), such as:  red card roulette, in that it is almost a challenge to finished the game with 22 men on the pitch.

												Many people in China who cherish great affection for this game will get it without any hesitation.Obviously I am one of them and got the beta as soon as possible.We bought FM for it is really a fantansy game but wheather customers in China deserve the languege of our own country is the question I just want SEGA to know.The moment we get Chinese in this game is the moment SEGA answer my question, I will modify the comment from No to Yes then .SEGA you should  really know it is not hard to add Chinese cause some of non-profit organizations has done this before.At last I will say again that I will get FM2018 despite the languege but I DO NOT wanna ""NO""again			"

Got a much smoother feel to it the graphics are better, all the little additions just make this game amazing. Definatly the best one yet.

People who are giving negative reviews becasue they can't pick up results is just stupid - it's like saying FIFA is bad becuase i cant score goal or COD is bad because I can't get kills. It just takes practice. Regarding the language issue - it is what it is. It doesn't make it a bad game. 10/10			"

												Well, As so many others, I'd like to give my opinion on this game. The game is good, like most other FM-releases these last few years.On the down side is all these chinese people, buying a game that they know not to be in their language and then complaining about it afterwards, giving the game a poor rating on that one condition.EDIT:As I have now seen there is a chinese language-file available for download, I expect all the reviews made just because of this lack, will now be turned into the positive reviews, these people have proised they would..I doubt it, but still.. Would be fitting, to avoid those people exposing a double standard..			"

												First of all, no Chinese, no good comment.As to the game, it can still keep me playing for the whole day without having a rest, from this perspective it is worth recommending.Some annoying features made me feel really frustrated.First, midfielders(and sometimes forwards) shooting from a fallacious position, it really affect my mood when watching the game.Secondly, forwards never score in one on one situations. I can see my forward score over thirty goals per season, however, he never scores one on one goals. HumiliatingThirdly, players exits contract talks so easily, for many times, they just quick, and giving me no second chances, after only one or two rounds of negotiation. This makes transfer extremely hard.Last but not the least, I want to reinstate my attitude. I can read English without any barriers, it really doesn't matter to me whether there is Chinese version or not. However, what really irritate our Chinese players is not the fact that there is no Chinese version, but the lack of respect and honesty of SI and Sega. Moreover, Miles Jackson's racist attitude will never be forgiven until  a formal apologise is given.We will not stop giving negative comments and protesting until a satisfying official Chinese version is released and an apologise to Chinese people are given. We must have our voice heard and our demands fulfilled. The power of Chinese people should not be ignored!			"

												I have played this series for several years and this time is the worst. Each year no critical change occurred in the new edition, and we only pay for a newer database, which is also becoming less accurate and reasonable.The tactic system provide choices but none shall work. Players do not follow instructions and silly mistake are stealing your victory in a foolish way. And with a large sale in the CN area, the Chinese language has never been paid any attention and respect. I think this is time to quit.  I will never buy this series anymore and will never introduce others into it. If you cannot make this game develops fine and keep attractive, let it die please. We now have plenty of choices. "

												The game plays well, but the same old problems persist.The computer controlled teams will convert almost every single chance they create, while player controlled teams will have to create about 10 huge chances per goal.Keepers are woeful at saving any and all long shots.Wingers shoot at goal for no reason other than to throw away possession.Tactics are woeful, but the same as last year, so if you liked that donkeyfeces then congratulations, fam.Review was posted during BETA period.

I can play this game in English, But Tegrity, Respect and Love,we need a Simplified Chinese version.			"

												first of  all the interface is better than 2016, and the 3D model is really impressive.secondly ,the simplification of training system and report system make us easy to begain.third ,there are quite few new stuffs like data analisit in coach system, i haven't figured out what is that but it seems interesting to me.  but is that a bug or something that if i want to hire coach , manager, assistant manager , scout or whatever in staff search, I put prefered job on, they just keep telling me that they dont want to take my job offer. they want to be a role else. for example, I want to hire a manager, so I go to seach list with prefered job is manager, i talk to those staffs, they want to be coach or assist manager extra.since I've played only for 4 hours , the over all is good and wonderful.However there is no Chinese and i think I am really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, you support 15 languages and you say that u cant afford Chinese translation?  what a international joke .... so , i give dislike.首先进入游戏界面比2016要好，踢球场面3D效果给人印象深刻。然后就是对训练系统还有报告系统的简化，让玩家更容易的操作。再有就是我发现了一些新的特征，比如资料分析师这样的东西也很新奇，还没搞懂到底是什么。但是有一个bug一样的存在，就是去搜索教练人员并且准备聘用的时候，我想聘用球探可是被选中的球探会说他想得到别的工作，其他的工作职位类似，即便我点上prefered job是球探 或者其他。因为我只玩了4小时，所以初步体验还是不错，给予支持。但是还是没有中文版，这让我很不爽。这游戏有15种语言支持，然后你告诉我唯独没有中文？ 开国际玩笑啦。。所以差评。			"

												I have to post this 'review' since many non-chinese speaking gamers doesn't realize the underlying racial profiling SI has been doing. There is screencap of a twitter conversation between @Talentconan and @milesSI being posted. Mr. Jacobson mentions that to release a Chinese version, 20k players pirating the game needs to purchase it. Which in itself is effing discriminatory towards the people who went out of there way to buy the game when Steam was hard to access in the mainland. So that's why when data from Steamspy shows that the number of FM16 purchase from China is way above 20k, Chinese gamers become furious. Mr. Jacobson seems to keep finding excuses when the screenshot was posted and adding community language support is just a easy way for SI to cop out. And may I say that only people that actually bought the game can review? They have there right to express their disappointment.Sure, because of the language barrier you guys might see this as bullying, but a similar situation happend for the Korean version of Witcher 3 that in the end CD Projeckt had to give everyone a copy of Witcher 1 and 2.For a game that only updates it's database and presentation with no attempt tweeking the game engine itself, it deserves its mixed rating even without this language debacle.

												OMG!!! Most of the reviews are negative!When asked why not add a Chinese version, SI answered that the sales volume in China was too small and there was no need to add a Chinese version.Since there are so few Chinese players purchased the game, almost 60% negative feedback has nothing to do with the lack of Chinese version, right? So the reason for bad feedback is that the game itself is really terrible, right?  Yeah, I think so.			"

												In the steam to buy for three years, every year looking forward to the official Chinese, but each time are disappointed, why even the Korean language has not Chinese? Football game is pay attention to timeliness, with the reality of the game hope to play immediately, rather than waiting for Chinese mod. I see is to promote fm online in China not deliberately Chinese, the Chinese players when the fool playing. Anyway, not the official Chinese 18 does not buy, steam the first negative feedback.在steam上买了三年，每年都在期待官方中文，但每次都是失望，为什么连韩文都有却没有中文？  足球游戏是讲究时效性的，配合着现实中的比赛希望马上玩到，而不是等中文mod。我看就是为了在国内推广fm online故意不出中文，把中国玩家当傻子耍。 反正18不出官方中文绝对不买，steam第一个差评。ps谷歌翻译的，md 我英语特好还要英文干嘛。			"

												买过FM2013、2016、2017，中国区这么多死忠玩家，希望SEGA和SI给予我们足够的重视。希望2017正式版可以推出官方中文，让更多的中国玩家体验到FM的乐趣。否则我将不再支持之后的FM2018。I have bought Fm2013/2016/2017 before.There are so many FM supports in China ,as we hope SEGA and SI can  feel our mind.We want to see official Chinese version in FM2017 .It will attract more Chinese gamers to enjoy FM.IF not, I will consider not to support Fm2018 .Thank u very much.

												This is the best Football Manager game ever made. People's only negativity is that it hasn't changed much from last years game, so they ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan and give it a bad review. It's better than last years game though, it has a few little tweaks, so they are all idiots.			"

												Is it hard to translate to Chinese?Edited:I just want to clarify something if you guys found this comment 'funny'. Since the steam has Chinese store, it is designated to sell games to people who speak Chinese. If those people don't buy this game, it would be totally fine to sell FM without Chinese. But you can check the statistic last year and that will show you how many people bought FM2016 from steam's Chinese store. So, the developers show no respect to us. Does this make more sense to those who think giving a negative review due to lack of Chinese language is funny?			"

												First, again there is no Chinese version when sega said they would.Second, the incredible and frequent injurary really ruined this game.(Why players always injured in the international game in 2-3 months？ I never heard that in real world.)Third, silly moves of players in 3D-mode has not been revised or cancelled. Can you imagine that the goalkeeper just see the ball coming and do nothing? Can you imagine that your famous defenders can be easily passed by some unknown player?) Besides, players always stay to watch the ball and wait for other player taking the ball and attack. And when you defend, you will see some of your players will run to some area where no one are there.I have played fm from fm2012 to fm2017. Before the beta released, I expect the better engine of game and Chinese version. However, none of my expection have been fulfilled.I will give a 4 from 0 to 10 of this game.			"

Most Chinese users want to buy legal version of Football Manager,  but illegal version always has Chinese and ironically the legal version doesn't support Chinese, so everybody in China just downloads the illegal version. Sad.And the Data does show that FM sales in China is NO.3-No.5 in the world, which more than 15 languages are available now, but still NO CHINESE.			"

												Previously had this game as recommended. Not anymore.Ever since I've played regularly, I've noticed a few major issues that others have pointed out.For a start, the ""stats"" are meaningless and serve no real purpose. They make no difference to the actual scoreline of a game no matter how many clear cut chances, shots on target or set pieces you have.Secondly, Tactics barely do s***. I've experimented with three workshop tactics, with a team too good for the league. I went on a 6 game losing streak, mainly against teams much lower than me in the league and two cup games which were against teams two divisions below me. Absolute b0llocks.Thirdly, as I said in my previous review the database is huge. And why is this a bad thing? Because it's riddled with errors and marks of laziness. SI, please take this as a note, if you're gonna flaunt your huge database, at least make sure it's all correct. I've seen so many players with so many details marked as ""unknown"", when, with nothing but a google search and a click the details are there. Not only the details, but the stats. Any player outside the first division of the ""top five countries"" will have stat errors. Guaranteed. And no, not like the odd attribute one number too low, no, I mean stats high and low in the wrong places. Take for example, Graham Carey. This may sound bias as an argyle fan, but I, we, and a lot of others rate him as the best midfielder, and possibly the best player in League Two. Oh wait, his stats are as good as Oscar Threlkeld and no better.There are so many bugs, some of which are mentioned in my original review.This game a short while ago was overly enjoyable.Not anymore.SI, stop releasing the same game every year. Eventually, it will stop working.Oh, and finally, Simplified Chinese.Nobody cares.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have to disagree with most of the negative reviews here - people just don't understand that SI hire thousands of scouts every year (Officially the largest scouting network for anything on the planet) to make sure that their database is up to date. This is a MONUMENTAL undertaking, and that alone, despite the cons, is worth a positive review.Yes, the game has cons. Players are injured too easily no matter the quality of your physio team. The social feed is lacking in depth and the player promises and preliminary systems are completely broken. But the game is still overly enjoyable and is worth the investment. I do have one major con, which is the price. I would reccomend buying this on a sale or third party site where it is cheaper. It isn't worth £35, but is still a very good game.			"

												WTF has happened to this game, it is now the WORST football manager game to exist, each update just makes it worse, the free weekend corrupted all my saves, and suddenly a tactic that worked unbeaten for 27 seasons got ripped apart like it was some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.half the achievements i should have earned a million times over but not been given, seriously this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks right now, i got the game during beta and complained on SI Forum and get banned for being too critical.SI is now just a bunh of hypocrital♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who are bringing the same unfixed♥♥♥♥♥♥out each year with a minor few tweaks to make it look different and an updated roster that is unfair to lower league players especially youth making out that virtually no youth players will be good enough for the first team, the game is getting slower with each update too as it seems they are just adding to the old database adding adding and adding rather than re working and as such each year i try the same settings and the rating drops by atleast half a star, there is literally no improvements to this game from what FM12 maybe a few minor additions like tactics, staff etc visually i think the game has actually got worse, the interview questions have literally never changed, a players appeal is literally always turned down and then banned for an extra two seasons.i said this last year but still ended up buying the game because i had heard during the first 2 days of beta it was so much better only to get it myself and at first agree, but then with each beta update the game got worse, as i said i complained about things that ha gone backwards, make suggestions etc like the forum was intended for but was banned by SI for being too critical, ofcause im gonna be critical of a peace of♥♥♥♥♥♥over priced ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.i dont really see this game getting another update now except for the end of free weekend that has ♥♥♥♥ed up my game, i literally cannot even be bothered to start again far too mch time was put in for the save to be corrupted on update to a free weekend i mean seriously why the ♥♥♥♥ would people who have paid for the game get a free weekend update seriously why it makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense.and this last bit goes to SI thanks to your behaviour towards me during beta, the backwards updates, games corrupting updates, have to start a new games for updates to take effect ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you have utterly lost my interest in 2018 and i will NOT be buying the game during beta unless it gets a serious price drop.

												Seriously!?!?!?.. I installed this when I saw it was free over the weekend just to give it a proper chance despite reading all the overwhelmingly negative feedback. Now it's confirmed even from me that this is nothing but a cashgrab with unrealistic and unbalanced match engine as well as virtually NO NEW FEATURES compared to earlier versions. I personally think this series might be put in the grave if the devs doesn't come up with a totally  fresh game next year. Don't get me wrong, FM must still be FM but for the price your'e expected to pay you also expect NEW FEATURES and a totally new match engine both graphically and functionally!. I'm tired of braindead players and random results!My advice to you all, DON'T support the devs and SEGA before doing your reseach on the next FM they release before buying..

												This is my first Football Manager game in 5 years and it is still as good as always. The database available and addictiveness is immense, with a wide variety of tactics for your team on offer. Also, the satisfaction of taking a team from the bottom division through to the Premier League is as gratifying as always.The only slight niggles are some licensing issues, the press conferences haven't been overhauled in ages and that it is too similar to last year's version if you are looking to upgrade.In conclusion, if you haven't bought a version of FM in more than 4 years or if it is for our first, I would recommend in a heartbeat. Otherwise, I would recommend saving your money.			"

												Not much difference to the last few Football managers, the only major problem I have with this game is the transfers of players.

												The negative reviews are mostly people who feel like they are just buying an updated player base each year - which is sort of true because there aren't a lot of new changes each year, but I personally don't mind since this is my third year on FM. I personally like the game and I fancy the social media feed. If you want the game, pick it up on sale.Now, here are some kick♥♥♥♥♥young talents you can sign: http://www.fmscout.com/a-football-manager-2017-wonderkids.htmlLeon Bailey and Christian Pulisic are some of my favorite players to sign, I recommend checking them out.

												Too many injuries, too many times i take one shoot one gol after few minutes (3 or 4). Players after my discussione in the dressing room have a good reactions and takes gol after few minutes they go in the field. My players took double yellow in 2 minutes in 3 games in a row (with not hard tackle impostation). I set cross impostation and i don't see a cross action in a whole game (with wingers with 15+cross). I do like 20/25 shoot per game and i never score while i take one shoot one goal. A lot of times you take 4 goals in 35  minutes.Well no way really. I play FM from 2006 and this is the worst ever made. I hope in some fixes.A waste of money right now.			"

												Overall: With yearly releases this is pretty much what you gonna get. Is it a massive upgrade compared to 2016? No.Is it better than 2016? Yes.Am I enjoying it? Yes.Would I recommend it? Yes.Dont believe every negative review you read. People's play this game different way's and many player's give away negative review's cause they lose lot of games and dont win every trophy in every season. Personally i think this game is most challenging FM that there has ever been. Of course it has some match engine bug's now and then but they often happen on both sides. Sometimes you win sometimes you lose. But if you have good long term save in FM15 or FM16 and you are thinking about buying this game i would say that maybe you should wait what FM18 will give to you.			"

												While there are a plethora of features I can recommend about FM17, the developers insistence on migrating from imported head coaching faces to their new head coaching avatar system has generated more headache than it's worth. In trailers, it looked like a great idea, but in practice it's been a nightmare. Currently, there is a number of graphical bugs involving avatar faces, most notably the shader graphics bugging out after players start 3D matches. Sports Interactive has made it clear in their forum they will not make any more modifications to player faces, so I've since dropped the product, and ultimately I regret my purchase.From now on, I will delay my FM purchases until I am assured through either Sports Interactive or fellow players that next year's version either has the option to import head coaching faces, or contains fixed avatar shader graphics.

												If you liked last years, which you probably didn't, then you'll love this years!In all seriousness though, the game is a much needed improvement. The match engine has been improved a lot, goalkeepers actually save things and your players can tackle again to name a few things.Furthermore, the social feed is pretty cool and even if it is not the most useful thing they could have added it is quite nice to see your fans reactions to things like results, injuries and transfers. Also, the screens that are new like training, contracts, who to scout and things like that have been made much easier to comprehend and easier on the eye.EDIT: 5/11/2016Why? Why did they update it!? The update has completely reversed everything, goalkeepers, who previously could save things, are now non-existent. Your tactics do not work any longer and players do not follow them. So basically the match engine is the same as Football Manager 2016!			"

												Buggy at times and prone to crashes frequently (usually when you aint saved for a while) and there isn't anything particularly exciting and new. More of the same old formula, though at times it feels a little less engrossing than earlier editions.The main issue that makes me not recommend the game is that it has still got the random, frequent crashes that 2016 has, yeah those ones that sort of force you to set autosave to weekly. Along with the complete lack of anything particularly new or exciting in terms of new features. The series seems to have stagnated new idea wise and has become a little like the Footy Management version of Fifa.... the same product rereleased each year with a new cover. Sad times.			"

												SI have made some changes since the beta and wage demands are no longer crazy from young players, also several players attributes have been changed to better reflect them in real life which is nice. Injuries occur imo way too often but it seems the devs disagree with this and won't change it, so if you have an injury prone player its best to sell them. (RIP Sturridge)The Match Engine The match engine has some new animations and players make more last ditch efforts to tackle and clear the ball, keepers seem to be improved as well. However the match engine is very similar to the last FM, crosses are king and the majority of your goals will come from a wingback running on the overlap and crossing the ball, the same applies for the AI. Players also still try and shoot from impossible angles on the wing instead of passing which was a problem in the last FM.Backroom adviceYou get advice now all over the game which is pretty cool I guess, honestly I don't use it too often but for newer players I think its a good change. The player comparison screens are much better though and player reports have more information.Team analysis The team and match stats are shown in much more areas of the game which is a really nice feature, you get heatmaps and much more stats about how teams play clearly in reports. This information was already avaliable in the last game however it took some digging to find.If you're a new player to the series you will really love this Football Manager, no other game comes close to this game for the genre. However for older players like myself its a very very similar game to FM16, you may be better sticking with FM16 and waiting for a sale to buy this. So my final reccomendation is YES for new players and NO for returning players if you really care about your money, otherwise you might as well buy it again because there is no competition....			"

Product received for free
												Every year I spend about 300 yuan, which is about 30pounds, on FM and FMM even though my laptop can only run FM at an incredibly slow speed. I used to play pirated FMH 2013 because I didn't know I could buy a genuine version. Now with more and more Chinese people choose to pay for their FM products, it really hurts that there is no simplified Chinese version of the game, especially when versions of  less spoken languages like Korean are available. Now in April, 2018, we finally have the simplified Chinese version of the game. Even though my computer cannot run this game smmothly and I have completely lost interest in it, I will recommend it to you.			"

												I might of only started playing Football Manager in 2015, but it has become my favourite games to play. It's a shame to see all of the negative reviews, as Football Manager 2017 is a good game, but it has its flaws.The addition of the social media tab was intriguing, but in the end almost useless other than the occasional funny statement made by a fan. But its point was to allow you to find out what the fans are thinking, but it showing you 3 different fans with differing oppinions doesn't help.I believe there has been an improvement on the match engine, but not to the point where the game should be priced this dramatically high. It's too much, and I can see why many people stuck with FM 2016. They did offer a loyalty discount if you've owned previous versions, which means if you owned the last 4 installments of FM you'd get 20% off, last 3 you'd get 15% etc. However, for me as an Australian and owning the past 2 installments, it still cost me just over $70 to buy, which is around the same price I pay for AAA game likes Call of Duty and FIFA. Price is the main problem for this game. You can't be asking people to shed out so much money for a game that is being quoted as the same every year, which sadly it is. If it's this price for FM 18, I'll probably be sticking to FM 17 until either on special or cheaper in other places. I still do recommend this game, it's always a blast to play (even when you're smashed by Bayern). This price would be fine if SI introduce some amazing features for the game in FM 18, but at this point. I'd stay patient and wait for a sale.			"
