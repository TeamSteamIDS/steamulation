												In a nutshell you're a goalkeeper and your job is to...save the goal!The game is basic but is also 'to' realistic and immersive. When you play it you get so carried away with the moment you really think your there, on a football field, between the goalposts, in a stadium and your instincts will make you dive to save the ball like you would when you were a kid - I did it as a 42 year old man, and it wasn't a pretty site for my wife to see me dive over the sofa head first and end up in a crumpled heap chasing a virtual ball that didn't exist! Embarrassing!As I touched upon - the environment is immersive enough to think you're there - this game needs at least 2 by 2 metre play space in my opinion - best to have 2.5 metre width. I think the graphics by VR standard are very good - they fool by brain enough to think I'm there. There's a big stadium; a noisy crowd; flashing camera, multiple moving footballers on screen - out of all sport games for the Vive this one feels the most realistic - well, as realistic as a VR can be with the current movement technology. The audio gives a feeling of a big match atmosphere.With this game, your buddy can also download a free app which enables them to take a shot at goal on their phone and then you have to save shots wearing the Vive.Though the game is basic at its core it also gives you an indication as to how a 'full on' football game could be played in VR in the future.  If ankle Vive sensors were to come out, we could all play online where one shoots and one saves. We could also have it where we could field a whole football team where the VR user doesn't run but just receives a ball, looks up, and makes the right pass - so many possibilities.I think this game should also have ability to header the game - that would be awesome. In this generation (without ankle sensors) we could have online play/local play where the computer crosses; one Vive user heads the ball goalward to score; another Vive user is the keeper and saves it. There's already football heading games for the Vive - this game should introduce heading and combine with goal saving - that would be awesome.I'm recommending this game. The smallest of play spaces won't be enough, you will dive, you will jump up and you will hit a low hanging lights from the ceiling - that's if you have no self control like me! You may not play it loads but when you do you may well enjoy it!The only final point I would add is - the game involves fast movement of the head when stretching to save a goal - I was fine with it, but if you're a First day VR newbie you may feel slight head lightness - everyone else should be fine.

												Final Goalie: Football Simulator:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Well here I am, a 40 year-old frog, somewhat vertically challenged but a massive fan of Football. Sorry guys, I have to do this. . .  GO THE GUNNERS - ARSENAL all the way! I must admit I feel great now! Anyhow, if you are like me and have always dreamed of keeping a clean sheet for your team, it’s time to show your hidden skills in Final Goalie: Football Simulator!Final Goalie: Simulator is a VR/ Sport simulation game where you take control of the next greatest goal keeper of all time. Your mission is to make sure no balls get past you and into the net.The game has a few modes of play: a story, an arcade, a simulator and a multiplayer mode. The Story mode consist of country (or continent) cups with challenges. As an example, you might face the Iraq team and your challenge could be to stop all balls with your right hand without conceding a goal to win the Golden Cup. The simulator mode is pretty much the same as the story mode, with you facing a team and if you succeed at the challenge, you start again. Pretty much a practice run I guess. I have not been able to try the multiplayer mode at this stage but I am looking forward to it, to be honest with you. The arcade mode is truly the best mode of the game in my opinion. It is a very similar layout to the story mode but instead of facing a team, you will be against a set of canons which will shoot footballs (no kidding), bombs (no kidding either), beach balls (what else), tennis balls (if you unlock the unfortunate tennis ball icon, pretty much game over) and achieve the set challenge. For the game play side of it, the arcade is the most fun in this game.  You might find it a bit repetitive in the story and simulator mode. However, it is not that easy when one of your opponents shoots a cracker of a kick at you! 7 out of 10 - I could not save it; the ball was traveling too fast! Graphically, Final Goalie is really well done and I am sure you will enjoy the stadium atmosphere as much as I did.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Good Graphics and animations-	Several game modes-	150 levels to beat-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	No achievements-	A bit repetitive A solid Goalkeeper simulation in my opinion!7/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												This is sincerely the most fun I have had with my Vive since I got it back in May! For us football fans this is a must have. The atmosphere of the stadium (only one, but with cool weather effects), the ball physics and glove reactions make it really close to the real thing!. 10/10 and fully recommended!			"

												Said from someone not very interested in soccer, this game is impressive. It's super polished, with a stellar supersampling for extremely crisp images (smooth with my 970), great textures, lights and animations,  good music and sounds, it's even localized in my own language (italian) something absolutely rare in VR stuff. Even the world scale is great, the soccer field looks huge and very detailed, I can just suppose how epic would be a full soccer game with this level of quality.The game structure is a sort of Ninja Fruit, with three main modes: simulator (realistic soccer players), arcade (fun cannon with powerups and many kind of balls) and career (where you've a ton of achievements to unlock). All of them are extremely well done, where obviously the career is the more intetresting, with a great multi room trophy area.It seems the game fit the dimension of your football goal to your chaperone side. I've a pretty wide chaperone, and the goal itself is just as big. The game's nature require you to move a lot, so this is not the game to play in a very small area with fragile stuff on your edges.

												Very fun, the goal is very wide but the movement accelerator makes it playable in my limited space. The goal is tall and you might hit the ceiling, you can adjust your hight but it makes the in-game ground lower than the actual ground making low balls sometimes hard to block.			"

												Bought this on sale, I don't think at full price it's really worth it for such a simple game concept. That being said this is a very good game, presentation and visuals are top notch. It does get tough very quickly, so it could do with some difficulty level options and more advanced user height adjustment.As you might expect you'll need a decent amount of free space around you, it's very fast paced so you'll be hopping around and lurching far out to the sides, it's very easy to hit your surroundings.

												This game is definitely one of the best games in VR that I own. This game makes you feel like you're a goalie and you don't need a huge play space. You can just increase the movement assistant. This will make it so every one step you take two steps, three steps, etc.. I would suggest this to anyone especially if you would like to show of your Virtual Reality to your friends! You can play competitions between each other and just have some fun. But you also might want to increase the height of in the settings menu. I hit my celine at least four times now, haha. So if you're looking to spend your money on a game I suggest it would be this one, even if you're not a soccer fan this game is a blast! Would recommend to anyone looking to buy an awesome game.

												Pretty much you are a goalkeeper tring to stop people from scoring. It may not sound like much but it is. It isn definitly one of my top 5 VR right now. There are a couplr different modes : story, simulation, mutiplayer & arcade. My favorites are arcade and mutiplayer. Arcade is where there are cannons shooting balls at you and you can get power ups such as big hands & becoming big. The mutiplayer aspect allows a friend to download a free app from the appstore and then they are the ones shooting on you. My friend and I had a lot of fun with this. So all in all, I definitely recommend you get this game. It is definitely worth the price!!			"

												There are a few issues with this game which made me request a refund.The first and most important one is the fact that the developers seem to have forgotten to implement the option to rotate the playspace.I play with an Oculus Rift-3 sensor setup.  My playspace is 2 by 2.5 meters.  The game automatically selects the front two cameras to face the goal.  Sadly that happens to be the narrow field of my playspace (2 meters).  This prevents me from reaching the outer ends of the goal which renders the game completely unplayable as it makes me hit my walls.Yes, there is a movement-assist option but it makes me nauseous within seconds as even the slightest movement shifts your head sideways.  It makes me feel like I'm drunk.Apart from the gloves being way too big, they are also out of position.  My hands seemed to be located in the fingertips of the gloves.  Which leads you to miss the ball.The sound effects sound as if they have been recorded in mono at 56kbps.This is definitely not Triple-A quality.  The game could use a lot more polishing.I would not recommend this game unless you have at least 3x3 meters playspace and you don't care about the points I mentioned above.			"

												As someone whose not into football or soccer as it's called in some places I really enjoyed this one in VR. It was fun and the graphics are good, the stadium feel and players lining up to kick very life like. For a game I picked up in a VR bundle for 10 games for $3.40 it's one of the better purchases have made so far on the vive.Also Devs need more chick with big ♥♥♥♥ footage in the mixed reality video.

												Finally I can fulfill my dream of being a professional net master!The game starts with only simulation mode unlocked - you're faced with front kickers trying to score a net and once you grab their balls 5 times it unlocks arcade mode.Arcade mode fires balls from cannons and the cannons can turn into power ups - fling the balls back at these to enable Matrix style bullet time mode, tiny net mode, beach balls, giant hands, tennis balls or put 6 wall panels up that deflect one ball then break. Story mode gives you 2 rooms full of arcade and simulated kickball modes with loads of challenges, such as ""save 5 balls against Japan"" and ""catch 4 in a row and don't let your balls drop"". Multiplayer mode gives you a code, like in Just Dance Now, which another person enters into the Android or Apple version of the game on their mobile - they kick the ball and you master the net to stop them. To simulate a full size net place, the game accelerates your movement if your room is not massive - you can turn this down in increments or off completely if you enjoy breaking your face on furniture/walls. I would recommend making sure Steam VR is set up so the orientation has no physical walls to the left or right of you - it's better to punch your mate who is watching from the sofa than it is to break your controller on a wall. One thing, from the video promoting the game, they obviously want women to play but there's no way to play as a woman (everyone refers to me as ""he""). I would like to see more additions in arcade mode, such as Trump mode (tiny hands) and a variety of stadiums and players of both gender - the weather variety is nice, though since it can be sunny, raining or snowy.

												This is potentially a fun little game especially with two player. Unfortunately it's not very well executed and needs some work.Graphics are pretty good, with realistic rooms, pitches, goals and players. It's a simple game - people will take shots at you (or in arcade mode, cannons fire stuff at you) and you have to save them. Sounds good.There are two details which spoil it:- The AI takes crazy looping shots with insane amounts of dip and swerve. This means that unless you're playing in a huge empty space with high ceilings, almost every shot you risk hitting the ceiling, or smashing in to something.- To compensate for this they have a movement amplification mechanic - you can set it to move you further than you actually move. Makes sense, except that it's a total VR no no. It feels disorienting and weird. All the precise movement tracking that makes VR/Vive so good is ditched. Intuitively you know how far you have to move to save the ball - but the game messes it up.The crazy looping shots I would say is fine on some high level of difficulty/deep in to a challenge. But it's literally from the second or third shot that I can't play safely. And not just me, my 7 year old nephew either. This is in a space where we can play the likes of Raw Data, Onward, Table tennis, hattrick header and many others just fine.The movement amplification I think is just a bad mechanic. It makes sense right up until you actually put a headset on.Instead they should shrink the goal, 1:1 movement tracking is non negotiable.On the positive side, the multiplayer is a nice idea and works surprisingly well. One player is just playing one of those phone/tablet penalty games and the other is trying to save them. Fairly easy to set up, and it's actually the only game mode where you're facing penalties taken from the spot. Also weirdly, it's the game mode with the most realistic shots by far.Would not recommend this unless you have an obstacle free play area the size of a real football goal, with clearence above it.

												Pretty good game. I had a lot of fun with the multiplayer support, and it was worth it for 8.49. The one thing that NEEDS to be implemented is a way to recalibrate the height so I can play on my knees. Or, a way to make the player taller. I have a low ceiling, and it's very hard to save some shots without punching it.TLDR: Good, needs a way to change height.			"

Final Goalie: Football Simulator is a great VR football/soccer game in Virtual Reality, with both simulation mode, arcade mode, story mode as well as a very cool multiplayer game mode. Final Goalie is a HTC Vive roomscale game with full motion controllers tracking, impressive graphics and outstanding immersion - personally, I think this is a must-have game in every VR gamers library! Final Goalie is a realistic and extremely immersive football (soccer) goalkeeper simulator built with Unity engine. It has one of the best graphics and gamplay controls I´ve experienced in a sports game in VR, and there are many different game modes to choose between: The ""Simulation"" mode contains realistic goalkeeping gameplay and practice with different levels of scenarios and varying kicks as well as positions. The ""Arcade"" mode gives you a fun gameplay where you need to save the balls and watch out for bombs and other obstacles flying towards you. There are many surprising elements in the arcade mode, and the more you play it and higher your score, the more challenging it gets! ""Story"" mode is kind of a career-mode with loads of different scenarios to play, where you cope with challenges and even more advanced and demanding football-situations as a goalie. Multiplayer mode is awesome, because you can play Final Goalie: Football Simulator on your HTC Vive against a friend playing it on the smartphone or tablet. Watch my Final Goalie gameplay video and I´ll explain everything you need to know about multiplayer mode in this great game!By the way! I would like to give the developer of this game, Ivan, a huuuge thanks for fast support, fast replies and incredible fast update with new version on request. I reported that Mixed Reality-angle of view was not working in first release. Ivan replied after one hour or so, and fixed a new patch on Steam (latest version) same day in less than 2 hours. I really appreciate your help mate, big thanks and both thumbs up for this game, great work!I will continue this review when I have played more, and of course when more content gets added.			"

												Having a blast playing this game! The visuals are great! I have a 970 and can run the graphics on 100% without any issue.  I thought the goal looks small in the video, and while it definitely isn't a regulation goal, you definitely have to move around a lot to make saves. (note: I changed the settings in the game to have my movement be 1:1 as i have a relatively large play area. 3.0m X 3.0m)The different modes bring a lot to the game.  Arcade mode is a ton of fun. The different power ups are well thought out and bring some strategy into the arcade section.  Trying to block several soccer balls in slow motion mode is an incredibly cool experience!Sim mode definitely gives the feeling of being a goalie in a giant soccer stadium.  The biggest issue I have is that I forget I'm in my basement.  I definitely punched the ceiling a couple times when gettig a bit over zealous on a save.  The animationon the players is pretty incredible.  you can get a sense of where they are going to kick the ball based off of their body position just like in real life.  Of course the fakes and feints they do can trick you, but again, they are incredibly life like.  Some of their shots defy physics, but overall its a pretty damn good simulation of being a keeper.Story mode feels a bit like it was pulled from the mobile game.  The individual challenges(so far, have only done like 5 in sim and 5 in arcade) appear to lack in variety, but I've still thoroughly enjoyed the story mode so far.Multiplayer mode is a really cool idea.  It was a bit odd staring down a giant cell phone though.  Hopefully they can update this so it'll be your mobile app team instead of a giant phone sitting at you.  All the benefits of seeing the amazing player animations is lost in this mode.  My wife throughly enjoyed seeing me on the cell phone which was pretty cool.  Overall this mode has a lot of potentialBottom line, if you enjoy soccer, I think you'll really enjoy this game.  I enjoyed the physical activity in requires to play.  If, like me, you are a soccer player. Let me warn you.  The secon you make a save, you are going to try to drop the ball and kick it back to the player and become instantly disappointed..... some day we will have VR soccer, in the mean time this game is definitely worth your $10			"

												Great game and really fun, you almost feel like being in a real stadium. All soccer lovers should give it a try for sure. It must be said that you need a quite wide free space to enjoy it a(nd better with high ceilings), but the movement amplification works quite well from 0 to 60%, and lowering the game scenario makes it easier to avoid hits on the top.Said that though, It would be nice to have a better room adjusment like other games to allow rotation or reposition to have a more detailed position.There are still a few bugs that make game crash sometimes, but it's not a big deal. I hope developers keep updating, polishing and adding new features to this amazing game. Has lots of potential. Everybody owning a Vive or Oculus touch and a good empty space, should definetely get it.			"
