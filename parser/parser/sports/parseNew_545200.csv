												A tale of two games. The artwork and homage to Street Fighter II is lovely. They have everything down to the continue screen, the trash talk after battles, the stage select screen -- yet done with their own characters and artwork, plus a good sense of humor. Really nice job. The gameplay itself, unfortunately, is lacking. To win a match you either need to finish with more money than your opponent after 10 rounds, or one of you wins if the other goes bankrupt before that. Problem is, you don't really need to win these matches, you just have to try not to lose them. Bet a minimum of $50 every time and watch as your opponent makes all sorts of wild bets, doesn't follow basic Blackjack logic, and bets themselves into a hole they can't come back from, if not busts out before the 10 rounds are up.It's on the verge of being a solid, fun little game, but until the AI is improved, it's difficult to recommend. If they ever smarten up the AI to provide more of a challenge, I'll happily change my recommendation to positive.			"

												This game is pretty bad. The idea is good, the execution is terrible. First of all, the controls/interface are bad. For some reason, it switches which button is the ""hit"" button in different situations, which leads to unintentionally hitting on something you didn't want to. Why not just keep it the same button? Also, after doubling down on a hand, your next hand's starting bet will be the double downed amount. Nobody does that..  The AI bets like a god damn drunk madman at the table. There is no rhyme or reason and it's typically very easy to win. However, sometimes they'll get lucky and because they're betting like a madman, you're almost guarenteed to lose because they went full retard on a bet and you're trying to catch up to them for the rest of the game. But, all those things could be overlooked (to an extent, assuming they'd patch those problems) if the multiplayer even WORKED. It doesn't. There is no multiplayer. I had a friend buy this game with me and I couldn't even invite him to a match. As ridiculous as that is, we figured we could possibly work around it if we both searched for an unranked game at the same time. After 10 minutes of us both searching for a match at the same time, the game had yet to find an opponent for either of us. Same goes for the other multiplayer mode. This game is a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥and there was absolutely no care put into it. Avoid it.			"

												I must admit that this game caught my attention the first time I stumbled upon it. The combination of Street Fighter 2 and Blackjack is rare enough and promising. The artstyle is on point, the different nods and references are well done and detailed and anyone who played Street Fighter back in the days will get that fuzzy feeling of nostalgia in their tummies just a couple of seconds into the game. The characters, the cutscenes, the cheesy dialogues...everything's there.At heart, it is a Blackjack card game, each round you bet money and try to get a combinated card value of 21 (or near). But here comes the twist:  Not only do you play against the house in classic Blackjack tradition but also against an opponent from some corner of the world. You win by either your opponent going bankrupt or you having more money than him by the end of round 10. Here, some strategy is thrown into the mix: Betting high right from the beginning so you win big and your opponent won't the able to catch up? Playing safely by only betting as much as your opponent or hoping he gets unlucky? Many ways to play. Of course the game shines the brightes in online multiplayer as human opponents are way more interesting to play against. I think more and more players will show up over time and I was also being able to play a couple of rounds against others with a little patience.It will take you some time so see all the endings and get all achievements and after that you will have a nice and cool looking time waster for inbetween.

												Super Blackjack Battle 2 Turbo Edition - The Card Warriors:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Fans of Blackjack, here is your chance to become the best player on the planet and play the ultimate game against the notorious godfather and owner of the largest casino in Las Vegas. But before reaching this final match, you will have to face champions around the world to book your ticket to Las Vegas. The number 21 is all you must think of. . . Blackjack!Super Blackjack Battle 2 Turbo Edition - The Card Warriors is essentially a card game combined with Street Fighter 2 style of artwork and the fact that you have to beat several opponents to reach the ultimate face off with the godfather himself. The game offers four modes of play – Single player combat, Simply Blackjack, Versus unranked opponent and World Championship (the last two are online modes).Upon selecting the single player combat mode, you will have to choose one of the ten characters to play with. There are another two characters but you have to unlocked them. If you don’t know how to play Blackjack, what you have to do is to get to 21, or as close as possible, to win the round if you play against the house. However, if the house has a number closer to 21, or exactly 21, you lose. In Super Blackjack Battle Turbo Edition – The Card Warriors, you play against the house and an opponent. Each battle has up to ten rounds to complete, but it might take only one round to win or to lose.At the start of each round, you have to place a bet. Then the house will distribute two cards each to you, your opponent and itself. If you think your number is too low, you can ask for another card or stand if you are happy with your number. If the house is the one who is closer to the magic number, your opponent and yourself will lose your bet. If you are the one who is the closet to the number then you win. To beat your opponent and move on to the next round, you must have the highest number of credits after ten rounds, or your opponent will lose all his or her credits before the end of all the rounds. Whether you win or lose, you will be treated with a cheesy comment - a flashback to the Street Fighter 2 comments. Beat all your opponents to win the game. If you like to play just against the house, select the Simply blackjack mode. As I mentioned above, the remaining two modes are online but I didn’t have the opportunity to play against another user.  The artwork is great and nostalgic. In regards to the soundtrack, it’s pretty much the same style as in the iconic fighting arcade game.Positives:~~~~~~~  -	Great and nostalgic artwork-	Interesting combination-	Several modes-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	No trading cards-	RepetitiveFun combination and great homage to an iconic arcade fighting game.6/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												This game is sadly a real dissapointment. Definitely not worth the price they are selling it for right now, though if they can make some improvements that could change.Lets get the good out of the way first. Awesome artwork; The characters and backgrounds are really well done. And it is really neat all the little nods to Street Fighter. Unfortunately that is pretty much the extent of the good.There are four game modes:- Tournament: You fly around the world and play a 1v1 blackjack tournament against each of the different computer opponents. This means you both play 10 hands of blackjack, and whoever has the most chips at the end is the victor.- Simply Blackjack: This is just playing single player blackjack against the dealer. If you run out of chips, you spin a wheel to get some more chips to play with. There is a leaderboard to show who has the most chips at simply blackjack at any given time.- Online (unranked): Tried to find a online match for about 20 minutes, and either the online doesn't work at all or there is nobody else to play against right now. According to the description it is 4 player online tournaments which sounds fun if it actually worked.- Online (ranked): Same as above, couldn't ever find anyone to play.The main problem is the single player blackjack just sucks. The computer doesn't follow any type of basic strategy and just randomly hits or stands. I have seen it hit a 20 and stand on a 9. This makes the single player tournaments way too easy; feels more like a chore than a challenge. Also, they game has a very strange way of playing out the hands. When the dealer hits, it reveals their hole card and the hit card at the exact same time. This can result in the game telling you if you won or lost before you even see what the dealers hole card was. Removes any kind of suspense that you would normally have watching the dealer play his hand out.I really wanted to like this game, but it feels unpolished and not very well executed. I will happily update my review if they make updates to the game.			"

												I bet anyone who heard of a crossover between blackjack and SF would be genuinely interested, so lets see how this game holds up.Design, graphics and music-----------------------------No doubt, Super Blackjack Battle 2 Turbo Edition - The Card Warriors borrows alot from a certain game, even its title is straight from Street Fighter. It adds, in my opinion, to the charm of a classic game and also makes it stand out from a sea of blackjack games online. Characters look like they belong into a 90s arcade and the music fits every stage. All in all the overall design is well executed.Gameplay-----------------------------It's blackjack. Plain and simple. There is a single player campaign, where you travel around the world, beat the other characters and get rewarded with a silly quote after each battle and an individual ending after the campaign. Also there are multiplayer modes, with a 4 player mode and ranked and unranked matches. Haven't checked them out yet, as I was playing the campaign only but nevertheless I liked it. The first couple opponents play overly aggressive and beat themselves most of the time, the later ones act more cleverly. But since it is blackjack, it happens that sometimes either you, your opponent or the dealer get lucky. My guess would be that I would like playing against human opponents as much or even more as playing against the AI, so no major complaint regarding the gameplay either.Verdict------------------------------An entertaining little game with an special appeal, it delivers what it promised: A blend of SF and blackjack.

												Neat little Blackjack game, being a retro-fan the style really pushed all the right buttons. Yes, the AI is lacking, but I'd say the game's intention is to be mainly played online against other ""real"" opponents. And then, it can be quite fun.			"

												Liked the game. Nice crossover. As far as I have seen it is even the only decent blackjack game on Steam. So get it, play it, have fun with it. Don't know if the devs fixed it, but I did had the feeling the A.I was acutally harder to beat the more you get to the boss.			"

												Could not find many bad things about the game. It's Blackjack with a good dose of Street Fighter and humour. Great to look at, music is well done too. I recommend it to anyone who likes himself some Blackjack here and there.8/10			"
