								Well why would you pay 13 euros instead of downloading and setting up some free DAW with some free drums VST? That way you could actually learn how to create music on your computer.And this shouldn't cost more than 3, maybe 4 euros.			"

 Full disclosure: So when I first saw this game on steam I thought: WTF is this. So I got it (from a bundle) just so I could find out what it is and to make this review. First of. I play drums for hobby. And have done so for years. Meanwhile I've also accumulated a huge collection of audio software (VST, DAW, fx, etc) and misc instruments. Review: Is this a game or music software? Short answer is neither. For a game there is no actual gameplay. And is therefore classified as a “simulator”. And for a virtual instrument (VST) it perform very bad. Focusing more on the visuals of the drums rather than the sound. I have yet to try and use DvDrum with any of my midi instruments and controllers. If you want to make music. Then you are better off buying something else. Such as EzDrummer which is cheap, and easy to use. Do not BUY. There are better options for free..Edit 1: Went back and tried it to check out all the new updates. The midi and joystick is simple to get going, however. You can only use 1 midi device at a time. And there is no default controller layout for midi device or the controller. Which require yourself to set them all up. Personally I would also find it nice if you had controller options for each device as you can quickly fill up the 4 available spaces with multiple controllers and devices. A common feature in drum VST's that I would like implemented is being able to hit the drums and cymbals using the mousewheel. And depending on where you hit the drum/cymbal it will play softer or louder.			"

								DvDrum is a drum simulator where you played it with keyboard (I haven't try it using other devices). The improvement in this Steam version is really good from previous non-Steam version, especially at saving and loading your own keymap, soundset, and drum kit. (If you are non-Steam DvDrum user, you know that feel)Personally, I think the main focus on this ""game"" is customization.You can customize your desired keymap for your controller, customize your drum kit that will be displayed, and also customize the sound set of the drum that included in-game sound mixer (screenshot provided in Store Page).This game is good for practicing drum, so some feature are:-In-game metronome, you can set your metronome so you can practice at your tempo while you drumming.-Embed music, while you playing drum, you can add a music in game and played it on background. Perhaps you want to practice covering some song? (Beware, if you playing with keyboard, some song is too hard to cover)Other than that, the in-game drum sound is so great.Also, MAY causing lag in the ""game"" window when you played and/or recorded it with video recorder software. Be sure to close unnecessary background process.And here's my personal feedback/suggest:More simplified the UI (Also, the fonts too, if possible. If not, then it's okay)The main menu song is too loud!Taking screenshot with Steam doesn't work, even there's Steam Overlay. (There's a taking image, in-game feature, but that's limited to taking drum kit screenshot only, not the whole screen)You can record your ""game""play (video/audio), but you must set it first in main menu Settings. Also, you must have your own video/audio recording software, seems that this feature is useless[?].When you open this ""game"", then play it, the keymap doesn't load properly. Sometimes, the keymap back to default. The only thing to solve this, is to open the Keys >> Settings >> Return. Then it should set to your own saved keymap.Maybe the option to change resolution?Add shortcut/fix about placing/moving drum/decor part, I don't know, maybe by dragging middle-click?.Why? For example, when you ""accidently"" move your Toms beside the Toms panel like this: http://s6.postimg.org/s3qfh09dt/Screenshot_1.jpg , I can't move it again, probably because the button is conflicted?.........

								Really great product honestly i just tested my ps3 drum set on it and it responds really well. The sound is good, and i can even use multiple drumsets for more drums and have a full set. Great way to save 1600 dollars on a drum set and keep space in your apartment!			"

								Utterly useless.To play along to ""drumless songs"" the program opens your web browser and navigates to their site where you can play audio files by clicking on them. It's completely not integrated into the actual program. What's more, the ""drumless"" audio tracks are not drumless at all but just clumsily filtered tracks to reduce the volume of the drums a bit. Also, given the fame of the bands they are using I can't imagine they actually have permission to use these tracks: Blur, Dylan, Sabbath, Beastie Boys etc. There's just no way they are doing this legally.Similarly, the recording features are not in the program itself: instead you can set the program to launch an external exe to record video or sound.Then we have the quality of the program itself, which is also, surprise, suprise, bad. You can select different samples for each drum but once you have selected one, that's it: you will get the exact same sample played at the exact same volume every time you trigger it.You can play the drums with your computer keyboard or by clicking on them with your mouse. The mouse clicking is massively inaccurate: there are tons of places you can click on the drum and nothing happens. As far as I can tell you can't use a midi keyboard or other device like launchpad, maschine etc.The mixer has terribly unintuitive controls: instead of clicking and dragging to set the on-screen pots you have to left click on the pot to select it and then use the scroll wheel to set it, then click left again to exit!This program is utter garbage. It does next to nothing and what it does do, it doesn't do right.			"

								the only reason i bought this is because i learned drum through music lesson,but didn't finished it because something else and that's why i want to continue learning drum again.I'm still newbie,that's why i don't really care about anything else in this apps [change drum layout or background].I'm super super newbie about drum,so i don't have any idea about anything beside bass,snare,cymbal,cres,and hi-hats [don't laugh]Things should be added=-step by step drum lesson as dlc,especially with each music genre.

								It's Very good, really good. It's possible to stike two sound at the same time. It could be a little bit better if it's possible to stike three or more sounds at the same time. It have a lot of programable pressure level, and it is a diferencial of DVDrum. At least, The Software is really good, includig in capturing the sound to make a music track. My favorite. Good job Developers, Congratulations.			"

								As for value in virtual reality versus IRL, Drum Sim has thrift in spades.  One could easily spend a cool million on all of these world class drums.  Instead for a mere $13 you can make Lars from Metallica look like the noob he really is.  Don't get Rock Band, get the Ultimate Drum Simulator, run it through your speakers, plug in some controllers and go to town.  This is professional level sound and quality, easily translatable to the stage if your fingers can move fast enough.  Rock on.			"

								Looking pretty good already!Have some trouble trying to get my digital drumkit (KAT KT3) to work on it, so I hope a future update will bring midi support.I also think the graphics could be a lot sleeker, some people might find the interface too cartoony.I did play around on it, and the sounds are pretty good! I'd even say close to proffessional VSTI's like Superior Drummer and EZ Drummer.			"

								Been playing drums since I was a kid and well, it doesn't come close to a real kit, but if you're like me and live in an apartment and don't wanna pay $2,000 for an electric kit to match your acoustic kit, this is about as damn close you can get to playing drums. For newbies like me, it's hard as hell to tap out a beat, but just like anything in life, if you practice, you'll get good soon enough.			"

								I think a gameplay of DvDrum is good for beginners who don't know how to play the drums and just playing with the keyboard (like me) or don't play real drums in real life. DvDrum just a simulation game, not good music editor software, you have to play it by keyboard, control Drumkit. You can build your Drumkit, also modify audio, image or photo of backgound Drumkit with his little workshop and set up your keyboard input or input controller for creating style your play. You need some skills such drum beats, tones, .... and music theory, or do not have anything, it's very hard, you need to learn how to use it and train every day like I. A detailed, DvDrum not support recording software, you need to find the recording software to record your game play			"
