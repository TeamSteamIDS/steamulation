												In their infinite wisdom, Cyanide has decided that you need to create a multiplayer account outside of steam before you can play the game. If that is not enough to turn you off this game, their servers seem to be down making it impossible to create said account breaking the single player over a ""feature"" that has no value or use in single player.Update: The issue is now fixed .

												I played all the PCM games and I find the ""pro carrer mode"" the most interesting thing about this game atm.. Is this year edition better than the last? Yes, at some points did they improve the game alittle, but nothing major.Did they fix alot problems from last year? Some, but not all of th know problems.Did they create an unstable game, almost unplayable game? YesWorth buying? No Did you feel you bought a new game? No, seems more like an DLC or patch.. Worth buying @ 10-15 euro			"

												I am very glad that new PCM has so much improvements!Cyanide made great work with game. so we are recieving the best PCM we had, I can say that as owner of all Cycling Manager games from CM 1 to 2012 in boxes, and then in Steam. I can compare, and we got almost ideal game.+ Better graphics, so close to Le Tour of consoles.+ Better AI in mountains, sprint trains, and breakaway.+ Much more interesting controlling in Pro Cyclist Mode, when you are leader of team.+ Brand new multiplayer mode. There is no more Armada mode. You can play multiplayer as before, real teams, real cyclists, and the main feature, that it is almost lag-free multiplayer!+ Some interesting improvements in pre-race HUD, magazine, interview etc.+ New HUD in race, which I like more than previous, it is more useful and friendly.+ Steam Workshop support. It will be much more easier to install and publish modes.The problems, or minuses are the same:- Not fully licensed game, BUT, but it is fixing in one-two day on forums, all you need is fixing: names, shirts, bikes, wheels, etc.- Some rare crashes, but most of them will be fixed in two-three patches.- Little problems with optimization, but much more better than in PCM 2015. I have stable 30-40 FPS on maximum settings on HD7970.So, this is what I waited for, the same PCM, with new graphics, improvements in AI and career modes. And of course simplier multiplayer. This is great opportunity to buy the game.Cycling as a passion, love cycling, watch cycling, play cycling!			"

												Same old terrible commentary, in-race graphics, glitches upon increasing speed of game, etc. What's new is the menu system and the music. neither are for the better.I started two save games and lost them both after the game crashed. If you believe that football manager has a hard time improving and developing their product - you'll be shocked at how bad pro cycling manager do the same thing. This is basically the same game that's been issued for 7 consecutive years, with a few (wrong) names added and attributes updates. I feel scammed, and can't seem to get a refund.			"

												So, we are now four days after the release of the game, and I still can't play it, because it crashes when I want to play it. We know full well that Cyanide has a lot of bugs when releasing new games (and I should know it, I have played all the PCM and CM games before!), but this is at a whole new level. How can a game just randomly crash because you try to launch it? I really hope that I can write another evaluation later, after actually playing the game, but will I even get that chance?			"

												Playing this game was infuriating. On first day I played an hour and had +15 crashes. Sometimes by just clicking a menu button like load. Then when sending the crash report their servers just didn't work.Then next day I played for another hour managing to play the 3 pro cyclist intro races and it was exactly like last year. For real, there is absolutely nothing new about this game. Career mode is exactly the same as PCM 2015. I did not even play a stage because while planning the season it crashed several time and as this game is BS it doesn't save changes until you advance a day or go to the menu, my god, who thought that would be a good idea when you have to cross your fingers every time you press a menu button on this game. Absolute garbage, I've been buying this game since 2007 and I can't stand it anymore, got a refund and will skip this version entirely. Don't recommend at all if you have any PCM that's 2011+			"

												So this year's edition was advertised as an ""improved multiplayer experience"", and for the short while multiplayer has worked it seemed promising. However, since the release of the game the Multiplayer game modes have been unavailable for longer than they have been available. Furthermore, there is no news whatsoever from the developers in regards to the problem and a possible fix, so all the players are completely in the dark.I really like the PCM series and have bought many editions in the past, but this might be my last. I would urge anyone considering to buy this game to at least wait until these issues are resolved, as multiplayer is pretty much unplayable at the moment and singleplayer still has the well known random bugsplats throughout a season.

												I actually enjoyed the first season of my career. There are some bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking to me.However, when reaching the second season, I was hugely disappointed. As far as I can see, there are no variants, meaning that ALL stages are the same for all races in 2017, as they were in 2016. Not a single race route has changed for the new season, except for the World Championships. The Tour de France, Giro, Vuelta, etc. are all the same. Very disappointing and lazy by the game developers.The problem will probably be fixed over time by the communities who create variants, but since stages have to be updated in order to work with the new game, it's a lot to expect from the community in order to save the long-term durability of the game.

												Have been playing this game since cycling manager. Can;t say it has changed much sinds then. Still the game with the most crashes, where you can't even play 1 month in career without crashing. Didn't buy the last 3 games, because of this and i am not going to buy anything else from Cyanide ever again. The worst part is I actually enjoy cycling and if this game was stable it would be a good 6. To bad that in over 15 years the have never ever delivered a cycling manager that has been stable.			"

												Since 2012 I have about 1000+ hours of gaming experience each year with Pro Cycling Manager. I play career mode, pro cyclist mode and multiplayer. This is the most exciting cycling game on the market. Despite the fact some of the features are not working yet or need some improvements.Pro's:- Multiplayer allows people to rejoin the game after a crash. This wasn't possible in earlier editions.- Multiplayer: No more teams with Pantani/Armstrong, Contador, Froome, Nibali and Quintana in one team versus 5 copies of that same team, but they use the actual teams.- Multiplayer: You will be rewarded with more ladder points when you have results with weaker teams.- Multiplayer: You can play pro cyclist multiplayer!- Multiplayer: The interface is generally easy to use.- Multiplayer: chat function works during load screen, and having a friends list showing who's online is nice to have.- Pro Cyclists: There are objectives per race based on your team role.- 3D: In earlier editions the mountain and hill stat were based on the type of race. In a mountain race only the mountain stat was used and for flat races only the hill stat. Now it is based on the parcours/route itself, instead of a predetermined number.- Career mode: more simplistic approach when setting objectives (this needs some improvements to work as intended), saves hours of manually make a plan for each rider.- Workshop makes it easier to download community made databases and expansion packs (this needs some improvements to work as intended).Cons:- We have to wait until every feature as promised and as intended will be ready.- In their attempt to make the game easier for the casual gamer, they get rid of the more complex management tasks. Why aren't they making it optional to use the old objectives system? "

												The game is quite realistic and enjoyable.I see many people complain about crashes but i have only had 2 so far, and on re-boot you dont lose any game data, only if in middle of a race you have to restart it, which is not always a bad thing.The thing that bugs me is the commentator, has about 5 phrases that he repeats every race. could be alot more immersive if they were more like the guys on the telly.Also your charecter / team earns money but there is no shop to spend the cash in? I mean.. i want to buy upgrades which give my charecter better stats, jerseys, shoes that can be customized.The riders in the race are somewhat static, i mean, I never see anyone drink water, scratch there♥♥♥♥♥or grab their nuts cause theyv went numb.. they just sit there with there legs pumping. occasionally stand up.The safety / team cars drive right through the packs, like ghost cars or something.even the sound... im in a peleton with 120 other riders... cant hear any hum off the tyres.. that should be deafening.. i should be on here moaning about the tyre noises but im not.every charecter u make looks like nicholas cage from gone in sixty seconds..but on the contrary i do enjoy the game and will continue to play it, i just feel this COULD be a 10 with a little more effort put in to really make the viewer / manager feel like they were their and to let them customise and upgrade team / player bikes / attire			"

												A game blitzed with crashes. Whenever it feels like it. You can spend a good 45 minutes playing out a stage, get an incredible result only for the game to crash after the finish line and you lose your progress. However, that is not the worst...You can start a solo rider professional career, spend countless hours improving your rider & the game will crash a couple of seasons in and you will lose all progress gained. You will never be able to re-load & best of all nobody at the game developer or Steam cares one bit....they have your money already.So all in all, you'll buy a product which doesn't work (i.e. defective) as it should & you will never get a refund or any type of assistance/communication.Worst.

Product received for free
												Pro Cycling Manager 2016. A game that makes quite a few changes compared to 2015, while still being able to be called the same as last year's version. To be honest, this game is a bit difficult to recommend, but I am willing to do so based on how I play it. Right now I wish there was a ""neither"" option for recommendations on Steam. So without further ado, here's my ""10 second review"" of PCM16.If you want to be a cycling manager, get 2015. The mode is not ideal in 2016. If you just want to race in 3D or play Pro Cyclist mode, then this is the better version. There's been changes and additions to make it more exciting.			"

												Do not buy this game, I bought it two days ago (22nd of June) and I am yet to successfully open it. Initially I got a steam error code 51 whenever I tried to open the game but now I get a game specific one. I send repeated emails to the support team who have done nothing but send me copy and paste, general solutions.I have to send them about five emails a day to get a response from them and even if I respond to thier ideas straight away they won't reply to it. I have asked for a refund or a hard copy of the game several times but these requests have been ignored in favour of preset responses.I understand a game being buggy and have enjoyed previous PCM games but when you pay £30 for a game you expect to be able to open it, thier customer support is extremely poor and I am very dissapointed with this purchase. Don't risk buying the game. To cap it all I had to repeatedly open the game and have it crashing on me to 'play' for five minutes and  be able to write this review. The game still doesn't work.			"

												First time playing this game other than a quick trial a few years ago. A little glitchy, occaisonal crashes, but good fun. Mixes my two favorite activities: bike racing and video games. Like Zwift but without having to pedal:)Rider stat's are suspect in a few areas - I know what they can and can't do. Races seem to play out the same way every time so far, pretty predictable, early break gets chased down in last kilometers before sprint or mountain finish. It doesn't always go that way in real life. Where are the mid and late race attacks? I imagine it's different online playing other people, though. If I could just find a way to connect for more than a few minutes.Still waiting to see anything in the Steam Workshop, appears empty as of writing. Where is Wiggins team?!?! I wanna play as Dan Patten!!! :)Finally getting my revenge on theses dudes after 14 years of getting my a$$ handed to me in Pro races! ""Go get me another feed Menzies!""			"

												After my problems at the release of the game (The game didn't launch the whole launch day and i only got it fixed the day after) I have been enjoying the game a lot.If you are a cycling enthousiast looking for a game to play of the sport you love, then this might just be your game. For other spports fans, i'm not so sure. The game is very complicated in some aspects, and can often seem quite confusing for people not watching real life cycling.The game is enjoyable and has a large learning curve. There is a high ceiling for skill level, as the possibilities of strategies are ENDLESS. This can also been as one of the biggest weaknesses of this game though. Because this game can be very confusing and complicated for some people, it can draw people away from playing this game. Most of all people that have no clue what they are doing. (Attacking with their riders from the start and such).Overall this new edition of the pro cycling manager series has seen minor but great improvements. Would i recommend it to people who have never bought a PCM game? Yes. Would i recommend it to people who bought PCM15? Not as much. There are only minor improvements to the gameplay (New hud design, which is amazing btw, small improvements to career and pro cyclist), as the biggest change was the overhaul in the online mode. Would i recommend the game to people who skipped PCM15? Yes.The new pro cyclist mode has been improved, and as for that the game can be a total bombshell of new experiences.So to conclude, i would recommend this game, but only if you know what you are doing and what you need to do in the game.

												I love this game as much as I hate it. With the amount of bugs I have to deal with I should stop playing it long time ago and ask for refund. But the problem is this game is awesome! Yes, despite all problems I love it, particularly career mode.   The most irritaiting things are:- game crashes- log out error during game- no way to save game in traditional way (which means any problem with your profile save and 5 years of your career is gone)- grand tour stages omitted/ out of order- cyclist models blocking themselves in most important moments jet normally being able to ''go through'' each other- mountain sprint finishes (every mountain stage in grand tour finish in sprint), not worth to attack your gc contender as saving energy for last km is the best play you can make- breakaways cooperation is strange to say atleast (some riders does't want to relay, few km later they dictate mad pace, etc.)- cyclist role in simulation mode are awkward to swap- hilly finishes are weird and valverde takes them 90% of the times (regardless how fast we climbing he still got red bar to sprint at the top of the hill)- mountain points - everyone in the breakaway wants them, even riders that are not in contention for mountain jersey- equipment and camps are useless and I am not even bothering to use them- scouting is broken (regardless of scout reputation reports are still the same)- riders satisfaction not working properly as leaders are always unhappyAnd belive me that's only few I can remember atm. Would be awesome if Cyinide could address some of this issues before adding new features in next year as I really enjoy this game and would recommend it to all cycling fans.  "

												Takze nebudem to tu dlho obkecavat ako vlastnik pro cycling manager 2013 a teraz uz aj 2016 musim povedat ze nastala obrovska zmena ci u v grafike alebo v ovladani . Pride mi viac realistickejsie ale sem tam pri sprintoch tie zaseky este niesu tak vyladene . Musim vsak tuto verziu roku 2016 pochvalit neviem ju porovnat s inymi lebo 2014 a 2015 som neskusal ale tato verzia mi pride najlepsia ale jako vidim tak mena niektorych jazdcov su stale skomolene co ma trosku stve :/ ale okrem tych zasekov a skomolenych mien nemam co vytknut a pro cyclist mod je bomba vytvorte si vlastneho jazdca a riadte si karieru podla toho ako a co je pre vas najlepsie vsetky rozhodnutia su na vas takze jednoducho zhodnotim tuto hru doporucujem ;) 10/10			"

												This is a great game, no doubt about it. It runs much more smoothly with much crisper graphics, steam workshop works a treat and is so easy to work, pro cyclist is great fun, career is much easier to set up at start. It's just great. The only problem I have is that you can't control the training of some of your smaller riders. Although the 'leaders' concept is great and really easy, it would be nice to have the option to directly change your rider's training routine. Only fault in an otherwise great game. If you're suffering with the 'steamauthfailed' bug, a neat trick is to press enter whilst having the cursor clicked on your username, and then immediately press backspace. Works a treat.			"

												I experienced a crash with only 5 minutes of gameplay (tried to leave a lagging multiplayer room). Even the crash report tool didn't work as expected (received ""no contact to servers"" error). The multiplayer interface is slow in general. Sorry developers, but I did not have an ""ultra complete experience"".In general, this seem like a repackaged version of PCM2015. Parts of the GUI is new, other parts are identical.I am a huge fan of Pro Cycling Manager, but I was really hoping to get a better experience than last years release. I did not.I'll stay in touch if I see any improvements.UPDATE 1: Second crash occurred after running two stages of Tour de France. Two crashes within 30 minutes of gameplay!? I have not been able to enter a multiplayer session, despite several tries. I find the new in-game UI inconvenient and clumsy. Probably refunding the game - releases like this makes me so frustrated..			"

												I like the game very much. I only play single player and the races are nice and realistic. I like the career mode too, although you should know that it's a lot of arranging things before you actually play the race. For example you can make training schedules and be happy with the sponsor.			"

												2 days after release.... does not workEdit:3 days after release I got the game to work.. FINALLY. First impression: looks decent. Cant recommend for the simple fact that I took me longer to get the game working that my playtime. Will update when appropiateEdit2:Its been years since the last PCM that I played, think it was aroun 2010. So i skipped a few version, and I must say that that was a good thing. PCM 2016 is very enjoyable, eventhough its a shame you have to rely on the community to get all the names correct.Up to this point I have only played in the Pro mode where you are your own cyclist instead of the manager, but time flies when playing the game so that says enough I guess.Persnally I can see me spent tons of time in this game. But to be fair, as long as these annoying bugs are still present I cant recommend it. Most annoying one for me is a bug where the game just stops.edit 3:Bugs have been, mostly, solved for me at least. Still happens now and then, but expect them to be solved soon as well.

												New season, same problems. I cannot play the game due a creation of profile bug. I don´t know if is it a problem to test the game before launch. Idiots from Cyanide...I don´t know what else I should said about that.*** UPDATED ***It finally works. I start a game on Sunday morning (when the servers aren´t busy) and I can create the profile.So take a look on the gameplay:+Graphic - it looks very good and much better than the previous versions3D race interfacePro cyclist mode - I don´t like it, but for someone could be fun- Objective problem - The main problem for careerAt the start of the season in career mode the game choose me the leaders of my team. I could set them the objectives according them the fitness schedule is made. I set them the domestiques for key racing of the season at that´s the start of the problem. For a better understanding please let me explain:Leader A has a domestiques 1,2,3 - goals are Tour Down Under/Giro/somethingLeader B has a domestiques 4,5,6 - goals are Tirreno/Tour de France/somethingAccording that the fitness schedule is made...but when I need to put the domestiques no. 1 from leader A to domestiques for leader B, the fitness schedule for this domestique no. 1 remains the same. He should have a good fitness for Tour de France, but his schedule is made by AI for Giro. I cannot change it manually.I think that it doesn´t have any sense. The career mode is unplayable at the moment with this bug. In 3D race I found a problem with order to hold position, because sometimes the rider slip away to back of the peloton without any reason - during the easy paceSome problems with DB - for expample Nibali has ACC 50 :-D WTF? Overall, the game has a lot of bugs, and I think something cannot be fixed by patches. I spent 30 Euros for this game and it´s on of the worst purchase which I ever made.I played all PCM from 2006 to 2014, last year I rather wait for 2016 version.If I could recommend something, wait for a patches and look on PCMDaily if the game will be debuged, otherwise it´s a waste of money. What a shame :-(*** UPDATE***The game is patched by Patch 1.1.0.3 which fix the schedule problem now. There are still some problems with hold positions and with Nibali ACC is still 50 (WFT? :-D), but hey the game is running now good and I think it´s a playable at the moment. I´m looking for some PCM daily DB with real equipment which improves the game a lot :-)			"

												Tried to play Paris - Roubaix with Team Lotto Jumbo (for Sep Vanmarcke). Crashed midway through the race 3 times out of 3 attempts. The game, not Sep, fortunately. :)I guess we'll never know if he'll win it, because I'm not gonna spend any more time with this. Or probably any other future release, unless they can actually make a game that runs. Even for one single race would be an improvement. Until then, it's back to PCM 2013 for me, that one's always been stable, so far.If this game would not crash every time, I guess it'd be pretty good, but you can't tell if it's gonna work or not until you actually try it on your machine, so it's a gamble. If you're feeling lucky give it a shot, otherwise don't bother.A FEW HOURS LATER....So I've said earlier I wasn't gonna spend any more time with this, but since I had the day off and Support was quick to reply to my ticket, I followed their suggestions and did this:A. Please check that Pro Cycling Manager 2016 is correctly installed:1. Run Steam and click LIBRARY.2. Right click on 'Pro Cycling Manager 2016' and click 'Properties'.3. Click the tab 'LOCAL FILES' then click the button 'VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE'.B. Please configure Pro Cycling Manager 2016 in administrator mode at startup:1. Run Steam and click LIBRARY.2. Right click on 'Pro Cycling Manager 2016' and click 'Properties'.3. Click the tab 'LOCAL FILES' then the button 'BROWSE LOCAL FILES'.4. Right click on the application 'PCM' (PCM.exe) and click 'Troubleshoot compatibility'.5. Click 'Troubleshoot program' then check 'The program requires additional permissions' and click the button 'Next'.6. Click the button 'Test the program...'.7. Quit the game and click the button 'Next'.8. Click 'Yes, save these settings for this program' then click the button 'Close'.Now finally I made it to the finish in Paris - Roubaix (sadly only 8th for Sep :P), but just as all the riders crossed the line it crashed again. It's something, but what I said before stands: it seems to be a particular buggy / capricious game and you can't be sure it'll work for you unless you try it. Technical issues aside, it would be a good game, but with all these crashes I can't recommend it.AND FINALLY...After doing this:C. Please configure the graphics settings to Medium:1. Run PCM162. Click on the Options icon (gear) from bottom left.3. Click the tab 'Display device' et select the preset 'Medium'.4. Click on the button 'Save Changes' and restart the game.I finally managed to finish Paris - Roubaix and also get to the Podium and Results screens, basically completing the race. And not crash to desktop. And beat Degenkolb in a sprint. With Sep Vanmarcke. :DIronically, after all these tweaks and technical issues, it makes finally completing a race (victorious on top) even more rewarding. But still not recommended. After almost a year since release and a handful of patches, the game should not be as unstable and picky about configurations as it is. When I got it I was hoping the patches would have sorted out most of the stability issues that people were complaining about (and which put me off of purchasing it earlier), but it's disappointing to see that I have to run it on Medium settings and keep my fingers crossed just to have a shot at actually completing a race. Maybe I'm just unlucky and stumbled upon some kind of incompatibility related particularly to my machine, but this is definitely the most buggy / unstable game I've played in a while.If you're a cycling fan and catch it on a (massive) discount, then get it and see how it works for you. But don't put your hopes up too high.			"
