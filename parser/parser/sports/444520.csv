												Serious warning: Do what the title says ""Leave Me Alone: A Trip To Hell"" - leave this game alone at all costs, even for free. (I only payed $1 thankfully)A skateboard version of Slain: Back from Hell (Which apparently has since the awful launch been fixed?) The most horrendous underdeveloped gameplay (Jump against a wall and keep pressing against it to stay stuck in the air forever says it all) along with massively abysmal combat to top it off.""Partial Controller Support"" laughable, for a game like this there should be a focus on a Gamepad or at least both GP and KB/M. It's as if you smashed your controller and held it upside down for any other game and tried to play it, that's how ""Partially"" it's working for this game, using a flawlessly working controller for any other game.All in all this feels like a flash game made in a month or two back in 2004 or Unity to be correct (Yes, another Unity game) which seems to be 25% complete in every way apart from the soundtrack which is alright from what I heard albeit slightly out of place compared to the aesthetics, the game concept itself is interesting.However the fact that this got a Very Positive 90% at the time of writing is extremely worrisome. Look up some gameplay on Youtube like the below (Oh, it's an iOS port huh? Christ.) And you'll see what I'm talking about.

												Without controller support, this game is just hard to control. Not for me.			"

**QUICK THOUGHTS** While I can't say that the game is all that bad, it definitely isn't a lot of fun. Truthfully, I enjoyed the ""sports"" angle of using the skateboard to grind along certain pipes and obstacles, and greatly appreciate the hand drawn artwork. The whole thing reminded me of Comedy Central's series 'Ugly Americans' with backgrounds taken from one of the adult coloring books that are all the rage right now (and I own one of).What really killed it for me were the combat mechanics. Attacking on foot is absolutely useless so that leaves you only with the jump attack on your board, and it gets repetitive insanely quick. Even when you unlock additional attacks, which require you to grab some mr. yuck sticker pick-ups to use properly, their power even seems stinted and not as useful as you would hope until much later in the game.I'd also like to see the camera fixed to show more of the direction you're moving in, as I felt I had to stop sometimes and gauge certain obstacles instead of being able to flow smoothly from one to the next as I'm not entirely sure where I'm going. Maybe that's just me, but it'd be nice is all I'm saying.All in all, I put about forty minutes in the game, and I have very little interest in revisiting it. Can't really recommend this title based on that, but if the developer works on it a little more and adds a secondary standard attack, then maybe I can.			"
