												Ok so here we go.I am seasoned veteran of bike games since 1998 SBK from EA which i clocked many hours on and absolutely loved it. Then SBK titles from milestone motogp 13, 15, Ride 1.  I only play onboard view and only and only so i look for the right feel. I also owned couple GSXR 750s and raced them too so i hope my review will be somewhat valid.first of.. I loved this game straight up after almost 2 Hours cuz what they did was they got the onboard feel spot on at least for me. Bikes just feel great. Tracks feel more real and overall the immersion from onboard view is finally perfect and i mean it !!I use xbox controler on PC. Bikes are much easier to point in the right direction than with other milestone titles cuz in reality riding a bike is not that glitchy and ragged and oversensitive like it was with almost all milestone titles.game has plenty more content and feels much more alive.. Also the bikes handle much more alive.i have couple complaints tho as well.1. WHY DID YOU TAKE AWAY WIND BLASTING AND VIBRATION of the camera AS THE SPEED INCREASES ??? it was adding so much to the feel of speed and now its GONE !! 2. bikes feel like driving on perfectly flat surface.. no bumps no vibration of camera .. shame3. game is buggy, not even 2 hrs of play in and u start finding stuff (as u ride short straight on road america before the bridge.. WTF ??? fix it please)4. rider sometimes doesnt hold handlebars and throthle hand barely moves.. shame on you milestone, this worked perfect in moto gp 155. Performance is good but it stutters a little..on i7 4790 gtx970 and 32 gb ram.. SHAME ON YOU !!so usual milestone releasing unpolished console port whcih will never get fixed as we know.BUT SO FAR I LOVE THE GAME !!! CUZ THE RIDING ONBOARD FINALLY FEELS RIGHT !!so if u own other moto games even ride 2.. get it !  did i mention they took away wind blasting and vibration  effect on to your head with speed ?? if they didnt.. this is perfect riding game !!P.S. oh and for SUZUKI fans they took away GSXR K5 :((((( but u can buy hayabusa as i did already.. but still.. they took away k5 :((overall.. GET THE GAME !			"

												Background: I have 30000 km behind my back on motorcycles8/10 makes me a sweaty nerd, gives me the fizz when I nail corners, and makes me lament Northern California weather in winterIf you like motorcycles or are just curious about them this is the game to buyPros:Mostly accurate handling model that responds accurately to real world knowledge (e.g. braking, the difference between front brake and rear brake, trail braking, front behavior under braking, grabbing a handful of brake, throttle roll-on, late entry, difference in engine braking between L2s, PTwins, One-lungers, I4s, V4s, Triples; 2-strokes making more power than  similar 4-strokes, lighter bikes with narrower tyre widths are easier to throw around and push, etc etc etc)Good engine soundsLots of view anglesNordschleife, North-West 200, ImolaReal-world customization optionsMotorcycle performance matches up to real world testsYou can customize your riding positions (e.g. I dont extend my leg on braking, keep my inner leg tucked in in transition and exaggerate my shoulder and elbow position - all things you can configure)You can configure exactly how many assists you have - TCS, wheelie control, auto-tuck, etc etcCons:Credit boost percentages are way off, no sense in having AI at anything other than V. EasyControls are unintuitive: shifting, tucking and the rear brake are all fitted on the button padBike models are kinda ♥♥♥♥Who in the actual thought starting people off on a razor edge-sharp 2015 R1 was a good ideaNo Isle of Man TTThe alternative credit system is unintuitive and unexplainedThe inherent lack of physicality makes the helmet cam a bit of a challenge b/c you dont feel what the motorcycle is doingSeriously who the ♥♥♥♥ thought binding torso movement and both legs to a single button pad was the best control schemeThe closer you get to slicks the better your corner speed becomes, and since tyre wear and heart arent modeled theres no point in picking anything other than slicks, unless you're into self-harm, in which case you do youI cant say anything about the optimization of this game because I cant tell if the issues have been fixed or my system is just overpowering it (6700K @ 4.7 GHz, 16 GB RAM & GTX 1070)			"

												As a real life biker the initial Ride game i played was huge for me. Not only because Bike games have been given such little attention over the years but the bikes this game offered, Game physics and attention to detail were amazing. I feel the only thing the game lacked was the number of tracks available being pretty low, the sound of the bikes was not great and the Multiplayer was enraging. I pumped 35 hours of enjoyable gameplay into Ride 1 and when i heard of a release for Ride2 well, Lets just say i was excited.Ride 2, wow. What a game! Im currently up to 36 Hours of gameplay and would have happily continued if it wasnt for a certain issue that ill address within this review. The new addition of bikes made me well up with tears as i saw the new Rsv4, H2r, R1m and even the addition of beautiful 2 strokes and multiple Supermotos. The developers have clearly done alot of work around the sounds of the bikes as they make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up! Great number of Tracks and i was so happy to see the Nurb, Ulster Gp and North west make it to the lineup and they've even chucked in Rain just to make things interesting. There is so many good things i can say about this game.....However. I would not recommend the game to anybody as the one single bad thing that i can name is so enraging that after this review i will be uninstalling and not playing until the issue has been fixed. About 2 hours into playing the game my game crashed and a corrupted save message showed which in essence wiped all my data. I thought nothing of this as it was a brand new game and these things happen. Well unfortunately for me it has just happened again. I was ranked #1 in the world with all invitational events complete, all the bikes i actually wanted however i would of liked the full collection. Well now there all gone. Huge shame and after reading up about it, it seems to be a pretty common problem that has yet to be resolved. For this reason alone i would not recommend buying the game until a fix is in place as youll genuinely enjoy it that much for it to just destroy it with one crash.			"

												*** Update down below ***This is a first impression about Ride 2 because I'm thinking of getting a refund. I'm not sure, so take it for what it is, a bit less than two hours into the game.I have been patient with Milestone, even hopeful at times (silly me). I have played the last four motorcycle games they have made now and every time it is the same. I really try to like their games, and to be fair there is some entertainment to be had there, if you can swallow the anger, frustration and if you had any high hopes - your initial expectations. I don't know what the folks that are praising this game compares it to, given the fact that they somehow accept this. Well actually I think I do; they compare it to previous Milestone games, as there is pretty much no competition, and that would explain a lot.Graphics are not worse than before. The mirrors actually seem to reflect what's behind them as opposed to only the sky or the ground as in Ride 1. Too bad you can't turn your head more than an inch to actually view the mirrors (depends on the bike), or the rest of the things going on beside you, and on top of that you are not being able to adjust the field of view (what were you thinking Milestone? I'd really like to know). Still not up to what you would expect from a game this generation. Low poly bikes, low res textures and shadows - the usual stuff with a bit more polish. Xbox 360/PS3 graphics. Again.The helmet cam is, once again, a joke. This is really odd since there is a really nice one used during the replays. The one used there may be a bit too ""busy"" for gameplay but it features more realistic movement and a good sense of speed, two things not present during actual gameplay. Again, what were you thinking, Milestone? You have two first person cameras in the game in gameplay mode and both are pretty much the same exept one is just obscured by a totally unrealistic view of a helmet. I don't think any of the devs put on a helmet to see how it looks like. I just get sad during replays seeing what could have been there during the actual racing.The sound is a bit better than before. It is still not very good though and the lack of wind noise ruins the immersion for anyone who actually knows what it's like to ride a bike. In fact, this game fails on almost every level to replicate the feeling to ride. Quite ironic given the name of the title.Riding a bike in real life is an awesome feeling. You are out there in direct contact with the elements rather behind a shell in a car. The force and sound of the wind and weather fighting against your body and your bike while you, with the power of the engine and it's beautiful roar push through the air, victoriously. It's just awesome! This game makes it seem boring and that is a shame. It should be at least somewhat exciting even if you are on your first Scrambler or whatever the bike may be but it is just boring, even as you progress to faster bikes. They did include some really sweet café-like bikes, which I love, but they are just so boring to ride here so they are just eye candy at best, along with the other not superfast bikes. I understand that it is difficult to make slower vehicles exciting in games but with everything Milestone constantly does wrong it just ends up with below acceptable gameplay.Maybe no one at Milestone is a biker and they just don't know better. Maybe they are an underfunded developer with good intentions. Maybe they are just bad developers. I don't know. I am however constantly let down as soon as I think they might learn and improve from previous mistakes. To enjoy this game I'd recommend getting it on a sale, without expecting too much.I'm sure there is some fun to be had despite all this but so much here is so flawed I cannot recommend it at its asking price. It is a Milestone game in its purest form.I'll update this review if I discover I'm wrong about something or if something else needs attention, if I decide not to request a refund that is.*** Update ***Multiplayer:No option to communicate with others via text, not even in the multiplayer lobby. Connection loss has been very frequent for me. I don't know if it is because of netcode issues or just the host disconnecting (no dedicated servers) but it has ruined at least 50% of my races so far. If the host sucks att Nordschleife (3 laps minimum), don't expect to be able to finish the race. And there is no player list available in game so you're in the blind much of the time regarding player positions. I haven't had any issues with lag though.Quick multiplayer update: The game has frozen on me multiple times now while hosting races, followed by a message some seconds later saying everyone has left the race, so there seems to be some serious issues with the network stability. And you lose points when you're disconnected. This bloody game, man...Customization:Basically the same as in Ride 1 and it still feels tacked on. There are for instance sometimes five, six or so chains to choose from on some bikes, looking exactly identical with identical effects on the bike. The ONLY difference being the name in the selection box. That says something about the ambitions they had with customization and how they try to hide it (not very good). Many times you can't even change the base color of the bike. Visual customization is a joke and a lot of opportunities are lost. Just imagine what they could have done with the café-bikes. The rest leaves a lot to be desired as well. Nothing new here.As expected though, there are still some nice moments that contrasts all the negatives. It can be a really satisfying feeling when you nail a corner or a section. The replays are nice. Too bad you can't save them. I'm glad they included Nordschleife and Monza, two of my favourite tracks.The actual handling of the bikes is pretty good. It's just so undramatic and calm as opposed to what it should be. If you are not racing on the faster bikes it can be compared to a casual ride on your mothers scooter.In short; if you like Ride 1 you'll probably like this as well. Just don't expect any real evolution of any kind and don't be surprised to find most of the previous game's flaws still present in Ride 2.If there were alternatives I wouldn't touch Milestone's products. Most of the hours I've put down with this game is just me being an achievement wh*re.			"

 Short evaluation by Lythronax  Pros: + Many bikes+ Finally a stable multiplayer+ Nice customizations available for every bike+ Nearly every helmet, suit, etc. (I'm playing with my real helmet in this game! ^_^) Cons: - Not that many players online- Common Milestone bugs- Bad A.I. for advanced players- Same old graphics/engine like Ride 1, MotoGP, etc.			"

												This is straight up Forza meets bikes and it's ♥♥♥♥ing great more than great pure awesome! To put it quick for people that don't want to go through a long review, I have an R9 390 and I get 85 - 100fps at 1920 x 1080p and 50 - 60fps at 5760 x 1080p with everything turned up to the max! So this is a solid game! After my poor experience with MotoGP 14 I didn't want anything to do with Milestone I skipped all the games even the first Ride but this game I personally think is their slow come back and I hope they keep it up!Now the good the game has decent settings I wouldn't go as far as awesome or anything but it does the job. A simple launcher with a few options, aa, vsync, windowed, resolution, textures etc. The game for what it is, is stunning pure bike ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the tracks are always a treat to drive on, not sure what's changed but the physics feel different in a good way but that may just be my poor experience with only one game in the line up of Milestone bike racers. Sound effects are top notch bikes pur, pop blah blah all the good stuff while there is music there's not much of it but it does the job. I'm not too sure how much bikes were in the previous Ride game but the line is huge here and you can customize it as much as you want paint, engine, rims etc if you know Forza expect that but toned down for bikes! Speaking of customizing you can also do up your rider all the typical jazz you got from MotoGP etc, rider gear, name, country! You know this game isn't 10 out of 10 but I find it hard to really list anything bad here it's a solid game if there was anything to complain about it would be theses little things... Options are scattered everywhere some are in the launcher, some are in the main menu and some are in the race menu! While there is a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of bikes I WANT MORE! This game has no feel to it and by that I mean there's no theme that pops out at you no interesting things like what's going on what is this I can't just be racing on the streets for no reason?! Add music, add life to the game but other than that I don't like day one DLC! At least hold off for a little while sell it in a pack that make fans happy for wanting more things fairly at a steady pace rather than getting frustrated with day one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!If you lost faith in Milestone I think you would be pleased with what's happened here in this game, it's straight up solid and worth the price... that's if you love bikes! I wouldn't give it a 10 out of 10 but it's damn near close!			"

												To be honest I was so mad at Milestone for not taking care of the first game and let us all hanging with tons of promises, bugs to fix and more content. A lot of promises but they just moved on to the second title which is Ride 2.I have just played a few hours so I cannot give a full review of this game but so far it is much much better. Engine sounds are great so far, runs very smooth, graphics are more realistic and they added more details to the entire game. Physics seem to be better too but I have to try more motorcycles to give a valid opinion. I would recommend it so far because if you like motorcycles or racing games this is a must have. I just hope the game keeps surprising me and Milestone care this time. I keep this updated to say what’s good and what could be better.What I should mention about the bike physics, it is obviously not a real simulation, it is more arcade so don't expect accurate motorcycle impressions. The speed is just not there and that is a problem with a lot of games. But it still is very enjoyable.Update 12/10- Sounds should be redone in some motorcycles like the 2014/15 Yamaha YZF-R6R or the 2014 BMW S1000R etc. not very real.- The bike customization of this title maybe has more parts on paper but they are almost the same as in Ride + in some cases like the forks you have two stages. The first one is black the second one is gold, you have to get the gold one in order to max out your bike for competition and in Ride at least you could choose the color because you got booth stages in black and gold. Not a big issue but you are more limited customizing your bike.- Another problem is the AI, riding very defensive and constantly hitting you even when you have the better line and advantage. I’m not sure but I think they become a little bit better, still some work to improve here. - No difference between handling during a race in rain. Same response and that is a shame.			"

'Best motorcycle racing game on the market.' - MeEDIT regarding some of the negative reviews:The helmet perspective is better than before, because now you are still able to see the dashboard. They DID NOT remove the wind sounds at high speeds, they are just quieter than before (I liked it better when they were louder). If I recall correctly, there was also more screenshake in the prequel (which I liked), but they said they wanted to remove motion sickness triggers etc. and it is not that bad, you still get the right feeling when you go 300kph. There should be a setting to choose the amount of wind and screenshake but I doubt that will be added. End of EDITThere are enough thorough reviews, so I will keep it short and sweet:If you love motorbikes, you will love this gameIf you liked the prequel (RIDE), you will like this gameEngine sounds were majorly improved!more bikes, tracks, custom parts, vaster color palette for those parts, and added weather conditionsMastering 'Nürburgring: Nordschleife' on different bikes is tons of fun The Northern Ireland tracks 'Ulster GP' and 'North 200' (I think) are longer courses and feel like the Tourist Trophy (TT) if you were looking for thatwhen watching the replay after a race, make sure to cycle through the camera perspectives, because they added new   ones (e.g. from a camera mounted on the side of your helmet)when you turn off driving assists I would say you get a really good simulatorcareer mode now has seasons and feels like you're actually progressingonline mode now uses your steam account instead of forcing you to create a new account for the gameIf you do not want to spend 50€ on it, there are enough legitimate websites where you can get a key for 20-25€. If you are into motorbikes, at this price it is a no-brainer.Have fun! "

												Too long; didn't read:A fair improvement over Ride 1 and certainly a decent game in and of itself. A few issues, but decent track list and bike selection make up for it. Overall: 8/10Gameplay:Overall, not bad. Let down maybe by the lack of open maps (i.e: Not being able to use the dirt track on Franciacorta) and LONG auto-drives to the start line.Graphics:Great Motorcycle graphics - sharp and quite accurate. However, not so great track and out-of-track graphics (most notable around the Nurburgring)Sounds:Average music for the game (not necessarily a bad thing) and fairly decent Motorcycle sounds. Not too many complaints.Physics and Camera:Not bad all-round, however sometimes the P.O.V camera can be floaty which can be a little disorientating at times, but in all, not that bad. Handling is markedly different compared to Ride 1.Selection:Great bike selection, however, I think categories could be expanded (i.e: Classic-style Motorcycle). Tracks are great, however I would personally love to ride the Hayabusa around the Castelletto SuperMoto circuit.  Gear is a bit more than ni the old game, but generally much of the same. Chracter/Rider probably has less choice over Ride 1, but still isn't bad.Overall: Not a bad game and definitely an improvement over Ride 1. I would personally recommend using some sort of cheat engine to get your money to maximum and buy all the bikes and just mess around at first few hours. Then have a go at the races.Total rating: 8/10 - Improvement on the previous, but 1 or 2 areas could be improved further, but they are fairly minor areas.			"

												OK, First Impressions. Have only tried a few races and time trials but looks good so far. Big improvement over the original ride. Graphics are smooth and detailed with good lighting and appear quite realistic. I'm getting 60fps synced with everything maxed out except AA at 2560x1440 on a gtx980ti. Really good sensation of speed in the bike and helmet cams. The helmet cam is the one I use but I just wish there was a way turn off the helmet. Since you spend a lot of time tucked in, it would also be useful if the fairing windscreen wasn't so darkly tinted as it tends to obstruct your view. If you use the suggested line feature to get your legs it works very intuitively, not just coloured green through red, but the triangles stand as you approach a slow corner and lay down as you get toward the suggest speed. I haven't see any obvious pop-up, clipping or bike parts popping on and off that have sometimes appeared in previous Milestone releases. I'm not getting any framerate hitches or skips when going through corners either.Bike handling is arcade even on Pro settings, so it's no MotoGP or SBK. It's quite enjoyable, the relaxed handling doesn't feel off or unrealistic, just very forgiving of throttle and braking. I would be wishing for something a bit less forgiving at pro settings but they're definitely aiming at a more casual level. If I there was anything I liked about the original Ride it was just collecting the bikes more so than upgrading and customising; so I would probably say the same here. Haven't hit any trademark Milestone bugs, everything works rather smoothly. Remapped my controller without issues and haven't had any crashes or had to do any fiddling to get up and running. I'm enjoying it but don't buy expecting a hardcore simulation. The game makes the original Ride completely redundant so if you buy consider it a total replacement. If you have a Steam Controller you're in luck; the game doesn't have native support but using the gyro as left stick with a bit of anti-deadzone works great and is a really immersive method of control.

												I think I hate this game. I think I honestly and truly hate this game. I really wanted to like it, I love the thought of being able to ride bikes from all my favorite manufacturers, but this game has made it a grueling and utterly dissatisfying experience.I've rewritten this reveiw three times, but I think I finally know my problem with this game: it's arcadey enough to make the experience joyless. When I buy a racing game, like Asseto Corsa, I want to lose myself in the simple experience of driving. Just learning a car and seeing how it feels. In this game, unlocking vehicles is tied to money, which is tied to winning, which is tied to modding, which is tied again to money. Quite literally, this game's issue is ""mo' money, mo' problems.""Racing becomes a chore because to get the bikes I want, I have to save money. To save money, I have to mod bikes to the absolute minimum, so I wind up running in races I'm outclassed in, furiously cheesing other motorcycles by cutting them off and blocking them so I can just barely succeed and get that much closer to what I actually want. A racing game is doing it wrong when the racing itself is an obstacle to fun. Had this game just thrown up its arms and let you do whatever, like Asseto Corsa does, then it would have been a thousand times more fun. Had the game thrown out any semblence of realism and made the bikes balanced against each other (which they very grossly are not) then it would have been a thosuand times more fun. Unfortunately, simulation and arcade do nothing but get in each others' way, an experience only complicated by a load of poor technical choices like a bizzarely centered first person camera (in soviet russia, bike leans around you!), TCS that only feels like it slows you down, boring ""straight upgrade"" modding options, and suspension/gear choices that have no discernable effect on performance.In short, an arcade simulator that attempts both and acheives neither. If you want to simulate, get Asseto Corsa. If you want to arcade, get Redout. If you want a frustrating haflway point between the two, get this.			"

												#TOURIST TROPHY-PC#If you remember one of the best old school bike games,I bet that TOURIST TROPHY will definitely be one of your favourites.RIDE 2 - The essence of pure adrenaline and action can be easily seen in this game.The game doesnt have any optminisation issues and i can run this game on my Geforce 940m/i5 without any issues.Milestone has done a terrific job whilst giving  precise details for the motor cycles and the tracks.Likes & DislikesLikes1.The Optimisation2.Bikes/Tracks level of detail3.Bike's way of handling4.Intelligent AI5.Brought back the memories of old school Tourist Trophy6.Road racing iconic tracks featuring-(Ulster GP , North West 200 , North Wales , Macau , Kanto Hills )Dislikes1.Bugs - (Once you go for a qucik restart after your bad crash,the bike auto shifts even under manual transmission option)2.No ISLE OF MAN :( , though we have Macau , Ulster and even NW 200,,,,,road racing fans can get utterly disappointed   with ISLE OF MAN3.Online-I can hardly fiind either a lobby or a room set open,only few play the game 4.No joy stick-No fun----It is better to hook up a joy stick coz key board controls are messyFinally , I'd like to suggest the game for hard core bike lovers or people who'd like to shift the gaming pattern.I've been spending loads of time playing PROJECT CARS < ASSETTO CORSA < AUTOMOBILISTA < DIRT RALLY , though i'd love to play these simulators at some pint I used to get bore of and i'd wanted to shift over bikes.So, i found this beautiful game.What are you waiting for----GIVE A GO BIKER  : )			"

												Huge selection of bikes from a wide variety of companies. Physics are really nice, graphics are a step-up from the last game, sound is really decent too. Only complaint is that the default controls were silly, but it was just a matter of rebinding a few buttons.Couldn't have asked for a cooler game. I love motorcycles and this is what I've been looking for!60 FPS+ on high settings with a GTX960 + FX 8320 and 16GB of RAM.			"

												The best motorcycle racing game out there. Good customisation. fully branded bikes, including gear(leathers etc) parts. Amazing mechanics. Stunning graphics. and fully customisable suspension front and rear tweaks, Automatic/Manual. One of the best features about this game is that it tries so hard to suit your riding style which is what makes it one of the best! everything can be customised.The only negative side about this game is when you come off the bike, they could've done something extra, like stop the race. Also, very rarely when racing, if you dont have good lines you will find yourself getting rear ended or side shunting another rider. Which is fine, but it happens A LOT when leaning into a sharp bend. Overall, in my opinion. 9.5/10 easily. - If you're a rider, and track days interest you, then this game is deffo for you!			"

 Forza with bikes. If you love one or the other, then you’ll love this game. Long story short, Ride 2 is a vastly improved sequel that builds on the foundation of the first game and tops it with a variety of content that’ll keep everyone coming back for more. Everything from the physics to the sound has been fine tuned and the overall experience is a lot smoother. Here is my short list of pros:Large selection of motorcycles spread across different categories, all of them customizable.Graphics  and track details are much better with variable lighting and weather conditions. Sadly, they still don’t come anywhere close to the current generation of games. Bikes actually sound like bikes now.Good amount of real life and fictional locations. (Nurburgring, Monza, Macau and most of the tracks from Ride). Physics are good enough though i’m not really an expert on that. You can ride with assists on or go pro-mode if you’re up for the challenge.Milestone has definitely put some work into this title and it shows. As far as my opinion is concerned, Ride 2 is one of the best motorcycle games out right now. The AI could’ve have been better and the graphics could use some more polish but the game is still good at what it offers.			"

												Milestone's MotoGP games PC ports have been hit or miss, with mostly misses the last 2 years, but this one is a definite hit for me.Pros: 1. Love the new first person camera angle, with the horizon staying more horizontal it feels more natural compared to real life2. Track selection is terrific, especially love the addition of Nordschleife and Macau!3. Motorcycle selection is pretty large, including some real classics and favorites.4. Framerate is flawless on GTX 1070 and i5-2500k@4.5GHZCons:1. Only con I see so far is day 1 DLC, but since there are plenty of included motorcycles in the base game, and the DLC only includes a couple,  I don't plan to pick up DLC.Overall really enjoying this, really reminds me of Tourist Trophy which was a favorite.

												First thing to get out of the way:Whoever decided it was a good idea to hide all the options for controllers, binds etc and force the player into an intro race using keyboard only (including arrow keys)  before the controller options will unlock so you can actually use a controller or rebind the keys is a Major-League copper-bottomed ocean going ♥♥♥♥ of the highest order.  What  waste of time that was, you Bell-End.But on the bright side, it's probably the first decent bike racing game in years, probably the best since GP500 from Microprose in 1999, and it's a looker.Runs fine single player on i7, 16gb RAM, GTX750ti.   Multi-Player is a bit of a shambles, there are no dedicated servers so players host races.Split-screen 2-player mode is available too, and it works really well. Its a decent quality racing game with XBox controller support and several camera views including the in-helmet mode which is brilliant. Plus replays and ""take a photo"" modes.So it's a bit like Asetto Corsa, or Forza, with a huge number of bikes, but you have to unlock them all by playing the game, same applies to the DLC, which many may think is too much of a grind. (you can ""loan"" a bike which you haven't earned or bought in game yet for a race or time trial but if you do this you don't receive any in-game advancement, cash or awards). So If you are into bikes and want a game that you want to put a lot of time into look at Ride2 first.			"

												If you're a motorcycle fan, buy this. It builds on all the good things about Ride 1 and fixes the major issue from the first game... team races. It was so obnoxious that you had no control over your teammates skill level. Nothing was more annoying in that game than getting gold in every race, (which was my goal for that game) but getting stuck with bronze or silver in team races because your counterpart wouldn't place above last place. It didn't hurt your career completion, but it was sure as hell annoying if you were trying to 100% the game.If you're looking for a motorcycle game with the customization of gear and bike tuning like in Forza/ Grand Turismo for cars, this is as close as you're getting. And it's on point.If you enjoyed Ride 1 but felt it wasn't deep enough and got to be a grind fest, Ride 2 changes that.It has your standard races, championships, track days, time trials, team events, and special events. But it doesn't feel stale. The various bike classes, races mixed with the challenges, customizing of your bikes, motorcycle characeristics, and online races keep it fun.The level of difficulty is up to you. You can make it play like you're on a rail and can't brake too hard or throttle too hard. Or you can make it feel like you're playing DIrt Rally with every single assist turned off and the difficulty cranked up, giving you an equally challenging/ frustrating experience. In first gear and crack the throttle to 100%? You'll get kicked off. Gas it too soon coming out of an apex? You and your bike will go flying. Pass on the inside of a corner with too much speed then go into a slide off the track on the last lap? Have fun restarting.The performance ratings for parts and bikes the game uses is not perfect and there is still so much to build on. But being as this series is doing something new, that's to be expected. I would love to see more brands offered for parts with some more performance variations. Maybe just offer an EJK for a slip on/full exhaust. Or allow the ability to tune the ECU so you can use the same parts/bikes in various racing classes.Well worth the sale price in the current Steam Winter sale and still worth the full price after it's over. This can easily be a 70+ hour game not even including online races.I love the feeling of customizing the bike I own IRL with parts I can't afford yet and ripping around a track I dream of riding.Plus, Supermoto.

												Ive played Milestone games alot, I have many hours on many titles, and like to think of myself as a top 20 player when I start getting serious about Time Trials. You'll find the name gallimar13 around after the last few years.I am also a motorbike fanatic and ride every day IRLI had alot of bad things to say about VR46, MotoGP15 and MotoGP14 and Ride1 all being borrowed content, they felt copy and pasted and old, however Milestone has actually made enough improvements to warrant a good review hereOk yes, some stuff here is copy and pasted, but after every paste theres been an improvementLooks great, bikes, maps, riders, animationsSounds great, its not a 10/10 for sound, but its not massively rubbish either. Its better than all previous titles. Finally they updated something in this area. Sound is so important in the moto world with engine noises and airboxes for immersion The front and rear brake are way more fun than any MotoGP Game. The bikes have never felt this realistic before now. Its not perfect but there is not much to complain about either The tracks flow much better than any of the motogp titles and ride1. Grass, sand and curbs will take you out on Pro settings. The bikes react to the the track in a much more realistic way to bumps and cracks. The Telemetry button allows you to setup suspension and brakes brilliantly! Well done, this is my all time favorite addition and improves physics and bike setupUnfortunately Milestone has about another mile to go in some areas...Multiplayer needs its social options expanded. Its lack luster here. If you played any previous titles, be prepared to destroy the Artificial Intelligence. You are left with Time Trials and Multiplayer after that.Putting fresh oil in the race bike every couple of races is a pointless boring necessity that takes time out of my soulHaptic feedback on the front and rear brake are to weak on my xbox controller. It was much stronger in VR46. You can not 'feel' the brakes as muchIts not the most realistic game ever (It not meant to be), but if milestone copied pasted all this stuff into a simulator with super reworked physics and ;labelled it with a new name i will buy that to			"

												If you like this kind of game, it is an absolute must buy. If you even liked the 1st RIDE, then this is a must. Everything we all hated about the first RIDE has been resolved, the bikes sound unbelieavbly realistic (each model to their real distinctive sound)! The 2strokes are awesome and so much fun, as are the supermotards. I am a bit early on in the game to comment about superbikes just yet but needless to say they wont dissapoint. Currently got a zxr1200 at home and the similiarities to the game and my actual bike are fanstic. Milestone really have pushed the boat out to be honest, and its not a flop that some of you will be sceptibable about. Its little things like the amount of bikes there is to begin with, but when you modify or customize one of the bikes with a silencer/muffler, the exhaust note will change to its respectable sound. Things like that make it for me. But it all tops of the wonderful physics and graphics which for me is absolutely the best i have played yet in a motorcycle racing game.			"

												Ok Milestone.. Since MotoGP 13 you went downhill with each bike-game release (well since SBK Generations even)I normally have a 3 strikes and never buy again policy, so after Ride1, I only watched a (Ride/MopoGP) mate stream the next MotoGP game.. and we both hated what we saw..As I had some problems with my sleep lately, I needed a game that didn't shake the apartment down, from my FFB wheel, so I found this one cheap and I .. enjoyed it!?! The physics aren't that stunning, but a LOT better in ride, a new camera NEEDS to be added [Helmet view without the damn helmet!] As you almost nailed the cockpitview this time around!But as a game it's entertaining! I played more hour already, then I did in the steam version och MotoGP, and more then Ride1. And this one I've only been playing singleplayer, Ride1 were mostly multiplayer.And I might even get some of the DLC's when I get my Tax return.Really promising! Already waiting for Ride 3!A basic version of Nordschleife were a very welcome addition too. I have to click 'Recommend' on this one.			"

												I've tried a lot of Racing games, most of them lose my attention after just a couple hours, but this one is good for quite a few more. I love bikes. In real life I have my lemon of a triumph scrambler, and this game does manage to capture a bit of that excitement. The game runs well, even on my laptop (nvidia 950 M, I7, 8gb ram) and the progression feels way less grindy and ridiculous than a lot of racing games.The one thing I'd have to say is that the starting controls are terrible for keyboard. As soon as I successfully navigated the intro race (barely) I remapped the steering to A and D, Accel to W, front brake to S, rear to space, and shifters to Shift and Ctrl. With that fixed, its even pretty great to run on a keyboard, turning is smooth and intuitive. Over all a really great system. The degree of difficulty has a lot of range too. I like semi-pro with manual shifting, but I could see someone enjoying more relaxed play or more intense play too.The wide range of bikes is also pretty cool, but I refuse to believe that the Horex V6 actually corners as well as it does in game.

It even feels so much like Tourist Trophy, but I'd say the bike handling feels even slightly more engaging. I stayed away from Ride 1 due to hearing it was full of typical Milestone bugs and flaws, but I've invested a fair amount of time into to this one as the primary game I've been playing for the past week and it hasn't let me down in any significant or notable way. It's exactly what I've been waiting for in a production bike racing game.			"

												Haven't seriously done any league car racing for years now and as a ""PC only gamer"" I have typically cringed at the thought of ever purchasing a console controller for myself... but these days there are more and more controller type games showing up on the pc scene and since I received a new Xbox 360 wireless controller for the holidays this year I went ahead and bought some new games to try it out with during the big Steam winter sale.Ride2 was one of those purchases...and I must say that even though the game has a couple of small technical issues it is just a TON of fun trying to learn how to get these bikes around the track using the new controller. I don't think I've had this much fun racing in a long time. When you're able after lots of practice to put a string of turns together properly and start to keep up with the pack of AI bikes in front of you...it'll be grins from ear-to-ear :-)- nice graphics- beautifully rendered real world tracks from all around the world...some closed circuit and some road courses.- realistic & very fun 1st person driving view (and other views are included as options)- good sounds- good interface- progressive/unlocking system- race against AI or other players- physics are not simulated to real world accuracy, but are lots of good fun including wheelies, slides, falling off bike if not careful, etc.- must use a controller, no wheel/joystick supportIf you have a controller and have a tendency to enjoy realistic looking racing games, then this motorcycle based ""sim-cade"" title is likely to scratch that itch pretty well... worth every penny, IMO...

												Ride 2 actually does improve on the 1st one in a lot of ways and makes it a much better game, so I'll go ahead and split this into sections so anyone debating the game due to price gets a good idea of what to expect.Story/Campaign:They've completely redone the campaign mode from the original game, and it now flows MUCH better and makes way more sense. The campaign is much like driveclub and the original game, but separate sections are added in to help newer players go along and learn to actually handle bikes and figure out correct racing lines before getting a literbike and smashing into every wall (Though you do get to enjoy that in the first race).Upgrading bikes increases an arbitrary performance point value which are limited based on the event you're entering, so you actually have to watch what you do to your bike if you want to race. As far as it keeping you from becoming much faster than the competition, there's still room to improve there, as I used the NSR125 to gold every event in the first class.Bike handling:This is honestly the biggest part of the new game. Bikes handle MUCH better. They handle very realistic and it's much easier to control them as the game does give a bit of assistance with inputs from a gamepad for obvious reasons. As another review complained, bikes seem like they have too much grip in the rain, though this is due to the game limiting steering input (to lower lean angles) and smoothing out braking. Whether this is a bad thing is up to you. Motorcycles in the rain are very finicky and require smooth inputs, which are difficult to do with a gamepad, so I believe it's an elegant solution with a good outcome.The supermotos are also extremely fun to race, and require an entirely different method of racing compared to street bikes. The selection of bikes included is about as big as the previous game, but the bikes themselves seem to be modeled much better and handle much more realistically than the twitchy hell that was RIDE.Customization:There's been a large amount of customization for bikes added, and many redundant menus were killed off from the original game (I'm looking at the wheel menu that took 10 minutes to get to the end of).Everything has been streamlined, the race bike enhancements are a nice touch, and you can still customize a great deal on your bike. With this said, it's still a bit limited and very much like the old game, especially in terms of power modifications. I never had much of a problem with the old system save for the really long menus, but since those have been fixed I feel customization is at a very good point in this game.AI:The AI still leaves a bit to be desired thus far. They still seem to have trouble seeing the player and like to crash into you if you're in their way. However, it's improved by MILES since the first game.The AI in the first race shows this, as they all followed good lines, and only the riders below 5th seemed to be braking too early into corners. At some point, I even ended up leaving 3rd place by 6 seconds and got in a battle for 1st with the AI, which led to me finishing in 1st by 0.029 seconds. In my experience, they've at least made the AI okay enough that you can play through the races with them and not get frustrated by AI crashing into you at every corner.Graphics and audio:The graphical enhancements do show through in-game, and I feel that it looks much better than the original. The Audio in-game has also been GREATLY improved, with bikes no longer sounding like hair dryers, but rather actual bikes. You still do need to ramp up the graphics settings in the menu to ger a proper looking game, but all-in-all this entire section of the game has been greatly enhanced and you'll most likely enjoy it.Misc:I'll just use this for other little problems I feel the game has:Taking screenshots is a bit stupid at this point in time. You have to set the camera and wait for the menu to disappear so you can use steam's screenshot function, as it won't let you take a picture otherwise.The race starts are still very abrupt, and if you're not ready as soon as the track loads in you're probably going to miss the start.Loading times are still fairly long. They've been improved and load time gets cut in half after you've done the initial load, but it's still a good wait.			"

												GREAT IMPROVEMENT FROM RIDE 1Clocked in two hours so far...Its been good.What i like so far:Definetly a lot of improvents from the prequel.Better graphics and bike sounds.Tracks look great and are enjoyable to ride in.60 fps! with everything maxed.Bikes handle pretty well too.Lots of customization! What i dislike so far:Textures look a little bad in some areas but isnt a big deal.Little bugs here and there(Got stuck on the bike viewing menu,Had to ctrl+alt+del and force close the game,Happened twice.)The mini cutscenes need a little work.Slight stuttering while useing the rear view while in a race (happened only twice).These are things that i've noticed so far,I've only played for two hours so I'll update if i notice anything as i play more down the line.

												Updated review after playing 12+ hours:Veredict: IF you like motorbikes, this is a MUST BUY. If you'd like to play a motorbike game closely resembling the Forza Motorsport series, this game is for you. If you're looking for the Assetto Corsa of motorbikes, then keep looking. This is an accesible, fun, informative and nicely detailed look into the world of motorbikes, not a sim racer.PROs:- Graphics are two notches better than on Ride 1. Better effects, reflections, and a more realistic tone to everything you see on screen. They could be better optimized, though, I am getting frequent frame drops.- Control is vastly improved, especially in first person. It's now very fun to ride first person. The finer control is most noticeable when assists are off and the motorbike reacts to slides, changes in weight distribution, and the like.- AI definetly is better/faster than Ride 1. When bikes are equal, you need to stay on your toes and the smallest mistake usually results in lost positions. On the other side, AI is very cautious and never risks deviating from the perfect driving line, so you can use that to your advantage. Sometimes you can see them fighting for positions or going to the ground, too.- Loading times are definetly better, no more ""having dinner while loading"".- The starter 125cc races are a blast. Sound is great on those tiny bikes, too.- Each motorbike's description is very interesting to read. Seems more fleshed out than on Ride 1. Manufacturer's descriptions and history are also great for bike lovers.- The new circuits are a blast.- Supermotard is a nice addition. It takes some adaptation to ride those beasts, but it's quite fun.CONs:- First person needs more vibration to convey the feeling of high speed motorbiking.- Some circuits are too flat. Nordschleife in particular, is bumpy as hell and it feels -almost- perfectly flat in Ride 2.- Riding the cafe racers is a bit boring. Being highly tuned, hand made bikes, you should expect some less-than perfect handling or at least some differentiation from stock bikes, but that's not the case. The best thing about those bikes is their descriptions.- Invitational events pay a little too much. After a couple of them you're able to buy any stock bike on the market, even after only a couple hours of play. I guess they're there so you can buy the super expensive superbikes.			"

												Only a couple hours in and already absolutely loving it! I played the first RIDE and whilst I enjoyed it, I had some complaints, so I'll compare it to that a lot.Good:- Graphics are improved and pretty good. Still nothing amazing, but it runs superbly so I can't complain!- Bikes sound great! The previous game didn't sound very good, and few games do bike sounds right. Milestone have nailed it on this one!- Great variety of bikes and tracks- Customization is pretty good, though similar to RIDE 1.- First person view is actually useable now and feels very natural and fluid.Bad:- A few performance issues here and there, I get a solid 60fps (locked by vsync) everywhere, but on a few tracks, the game seems to slow down, I get input lag and my fps locks at exactly 30, before shooting back to 60, and goes back and forth. It's quite annoying, and definitely a bug as I have no troubles running the game otherwise, hopefully this gets fixed soon.- Textures are a little bit rubbish. I'm running the game absolutely maxed out, and some of the textures that you see closer when using the cockpit view are absolutely awful.All in all, a good experience, some bad bits can be forgiven, and hopefully some bugs will be fixed.7.5/10, best bike game available.--- 30 HOUR UPDATE ---Well I'm officially addicted to this game.Absolutely great variety of tracks and bikes. Don't think I've had a single race that I didn't enjoy. Credit to Milestone, the fictional tracks on this game are amongst the best I've ever seen in a game.I hereby upgrade the game to a solid 9/10.			"

												PROS: *Better textures and lighting*Supermoto is now a part of the gameCONS:*MASSIVE FRAME RATE STUTTERING AT THE LOWEST settings (GTX1070 8GB GDDR5 w/ i7 6-Core 3.6Ghz and 32GB RAM)*No real significant changes to be called a NEW game or Sequel.*Non-existent Online play*Tokens are used for?????*In game rider gear is more expensive than most of the upgrades. I'm sorry but an Arai RX7 gold plated wouldn't even cost 4000. This sim would be great if not for the horrendous frame rate stuttering. I have it on the lowest settings possible. And still I get massive frame rate drops.Second this is not a new game at all. It is basically a lazy attempt at one. It's only an expansion pack in my own opinion. You get a few new bikes and tracks, nothing more. If fact it has even less content than RIDE 1 had as far as upgrades went. There are only a very small handful of 2016 bikes, very small, like under 10.Knowing Milestone they will not fix this badly made CONSOLE PORT, yes folks that's right. It is not a PC game at all. Online play is NON-EXISTENT. Moto GP 09/10 had a better player base and that game wasn't good either, albeit better than this garbage.I have 8.2 hours on record. And I must say, I think that is a really honest try. I guess now I wait for Forza 7 to come out which is rumored to feature bikes as well. I really do feel cheated buying this. I can see now why it was on sale.			"

												Think of it as Forza but for motorcycles, I enjoyed Ride 1, but this time around they got it all right, ( except for the wheelie mechanics). Game looks awesome in 4k if your rig can push it.  On a side note , as a onwer of two of the faster race orented Harleys ( xr1200x and v rod) I'm sad to not see them in the game.

												A shockingly good little motorcycle game. I'd nibbled about on some of this developers' previous efforts but they had left me largely unimpressed. The buzz wasn't very positive for any of their previous attempts really either so it was very surprising to find myself plugging as much time into this one as I have. A small confession: I do ride IRL and have the grace to own several motorcycles although none at competition level. But trust me when I say that when you hear the street triple fire up in the frontend of the game it IS a Triumph triple. It is that attention to the little details that sucked me in in spite of dated graphics, sometimes glitchy framerate and questionable AI and physics. When the 675r tries to ground loop on me at the 'ring in second gear, when I'm actually ""out there"" and not focusing on the fact that it's a game controller and I can ""see"" into the apexes like we do IRL and set up for the corners, that's when this game shines. The physics since I've mentioned them are surprisingly good except for some apparent AI indelicacies in the name of catching up and where they will choose to path when bunched up. Physics are always moot with games as there is NO proper way to convey anyways, even Sega's Hang On was just a plastic bike that leaned.Another really cool aspect of this game is that the bikes are actually unique besides just the soundset and a paint job. Two strokes run flat out just like IRL and even have the characteristic fat spot in the power band . And yes, customizing them ala Gran Turismo is very similar. In fact that game is most directly ""like"" this game for its' portrayal of auto sports. The Devs obviously have patterned this a bit after that title and it shows. Which gives me a reason to actually play the thing I guess which probably explains why I like this one enough to make it my first review.Now on to the Warts:Multiplayer. Haven't gone in myself as I've heard it's abysmal but I can well imagine. I've had a couple of their previous titles and multiplayer reliability is not too hot. Then again these games don't sell to Yankees like me generally so US internet bias might be a factor, but I don't know.Graphics. These are fairly OK. They work well up to about 1920 but the source stuff gets a bit too blocky up past that and then again let's not talk about theFRAME RATE- Seriously,???!!! - I've got a Haswell 4790 @4.4, 32Gb matched,tested memory and a 1080GTX so you ""think"" I might avoid stutters. No such luck here though, once the traffic stacks up at Monza I'm in the teens and jerky. Still playing with settings though and most of the time it runs well with only an occasional hiccup. But for what amounts to PS3 gen graphics it's weak.Controls- As I said nothing short of a full 360 degree strapped on moving platform with projection could get close so that is kind of moot. Still I suppose some folks won't be happy that you can't use anything but a 360 wireless or Steam controller but there it is. Doesn't see my Logitech wheel at all and I'm not too sure about my Thrustmaster stuff.Now onto the good again to recap:Variety- Even without any DLC there is a LOT of content. I at no time felt obligated to purchase something else to progress- I was able to advance quite easily with upgrades and bikes available in the base game which seems to be a rare thing nowadays.Individual ""feel"" and character of the bikes- This is probably the biggest single reason I'm playing. By this I mean that obviously some time was taken to convey a good many of each bike's individual little nuances and quirks. Such as the tendency for the Daytona to ground loop easily in second, the way the power kicks in mid to 3/4s throttle on the little Honda smoker or the way the street triple sounds when stated, these details make the game.Controls: Funny, huh? But although you are stuck with it the wireless controller works well for this. There is a report of someone getting a new PS4 controller to work via Bluetooth so as to get the tilt function to steer ala Drive Club Bikes but I don't know how myself and have little inclination as I don't steer that way even in that title.Tracks- It comes with quite a few and should keep you busy for a while. They are pretty well represented for whatever discipline you are into and I still haven't ridden them all. There ""might"" be a mod that lets you import all the tracks from Valentino Rossi The Game as well if you happen to own that title. It is/was available on Racedepartment. The textures are far from the likes of Assetto Corsa or Project Cars but they convey their various locations well and aren't distractingly bad.In short it is a fairly decent little catch-all motorcycle title with a broad base of appeal to people who might be interested in motorcycles. No Isle Of Man or TT, but a worthy title with a bunch of different types of bike all under one all-inclusive sim-light umbrella. A bit of something for most everybody if you will. The AI while not brilliant is at least challenging and manage to follow the line fairly accurately and provide some challenge to you. The bikes are many and varied from hipster bobbers to full on GP grade assault machines. The DLC isn't onerous. If you are a motorcyclist just go buy it already to drool on the bikes you will never own. Just like Gran Turismo. "

												This is the first motorcycle game I have played that ACTUALLY got my heart racing!! The AI is competent, the tracks are dynamic, and the different models of bikes behave according to their specs, chassis geometry, and category. I was getting bored playing MotoGP-15 and decided to see if there was anything available that looked more fun. I have never been able to find very many motorcycle specific games available on the market and I generally play every one I find. Ride 2 is the best one so far, period. That's not to say this game is perfect, but the cons to this game are minor annoyances like limited controller compatibility and lackluster menus. But when it counts this game delivers, like easing into the throttle to keep your rear tire from melting as you leave the apex at full lean to drag race that darn Honda that has been dogging you for half a lap to the final hairpin. Get the game, get a Steam controller (if you don't already have one), and enjoy the best motorcycle game on PC available to date.			"

												Graphically, this game is stunning, almost flawless. Every bike is faithfully reproduced down to the last nut. Tracks are also well rendered, exhibiting most of the nuances you would expect to come across, without being completely anal. The bikes handle well, and differently according to each bike's particular characteristics - no mean feat considering you're probably sitting there with nothing more than a big plastic M in your hands. Caveats? Well, there is an issue with framerate stuttering, which has been around for some time - running with vsync enabled does help a lot, but it is something the develpers need to address. Some also complain that the sound isn't that realistic, but that's a minor niggle. Tracks are, unfortunately, somewhat limited but not enough to induce boredom. Online doesn't seem to be great (I have only looked briefly at that, but options to race against others doesn't seem to be as supported as some YouTube channels might have you believe - though a group of friends hosting their own races might negate that.Basically, if you're a biker, who is looking for a motorcycle game/sim, this is probably about as good as it will ever get. There's much to enjoy, little to whinge over and, all things considered, it's by far the best playing and looking motorcycle game available. "

												Didn't own Ride 1, so I have no frame of reference.However, I have played most of the SBK's and I have ridden motorcycles in real life (GPX600, Gpz 900, VFR750, CBR900RRR and the ZXR-9)Really enjoying this game. It's like Gran Turismo, but for two wheels.I'm still playing with the default NSr-125, but the physics feel pretty good and the bikes are no longer super twitchy - like in real life. I think MileStone are on to a winner here with regard to handling.Graphically, I wasn't expecting much, but was completely blown away. It looks exceptionally good and runs very fluidly - it feels like a next gen product.If you have only the slightest interest in bikes and would like to 'ride' some of the best road bikes out there, I would not hesitate to purchase this. Highly recomended!			"

												I went into this game with low expectations, having played the first Ride and not liking it very much, but I did really like MXGP and MXGP2 so I decided to give it a try. I was really impressed with how much the physics have improved, it's not a full simulator but just the right amount of both arcade and simulation. The bike list is incredible, and the customization is awesome. I do wish there were more liveries to choose from and I wish you could change the color of the suspension (sometimes I want to upgrade the shocks fully but don't want them to be gold) and a few other parts. The game runs and looks great at max settings at 60 fps on my GTX 970 and FX 8320. Overall I am very glad I bought this game and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves racing games and motorcycles.			"

												Decent enough game. It's an improvement pretty much across the board from Ride 1. Better graphics, better physics, better track layouts and a bit more game modes added. The AI is thoroughly stupid, though. If you have an AI rider or three behind you, they will torpedo you going into chicanes. Like clockwork, they come flying past (or into) you, on superior brakes. They cut corners without penalties, and just completely do not react to you being there. Ever. And in Supermoto, they tend to just randomly crash all over the place, making the hard bit going through the whole field the rather amusing task of not running over any of the crashed bikes mid corner. But, apart from that, I love the game. And I like the improvements made over the first installment. Pros:Lots of bikes. Lots of rider gear.Bunch of tracks.Pretty enough. Decent physics.Cons:Milestone never really seems to get online races to work in a consistent manner. The AI is just... Bonkers. Way too easy in some regards, and completely ♥♥♥♥tarded in others.Engine could be better optimized. Stutters, and a bit last gen looks.			"

												I've also played MotoGP 14, Ride, and VR46. I think the developer has finally refined the gameplay for these games. Hand down all of them have the best physics of any motorcycle racing games. Body position really affects handling especially when braking. There is a good variety of modificatoins that you can make to the bikes but there are some obvious oversights. For example you there is a selection of grips but no option for aftermarket rearsets. Some modifications have brands and models, and other things like brake calipers don't. Overall the game is well done. The only problem i'm having is figuring out how multiplayer works.			"

												It's Gran Turismo/Forza with bikes. What's not to like? The physics are simcade, and the sound/graphics aren't the best in the world, but they are adequate. Would have liked a wider array of bikes but what can you do? If your a fan of bikes and racing games then this is your best option.			"

												Even though fraps says I'm getting 75fps, it feels more like 25. The game is pretty to look at, and can be fun in small spurts, but like many Milestone games it doesn't seem to have a ""soul"". It's a much better offering than Ride 1, but that only serves to remind me what a bug infested pile that game was. After playing Ride 2 for a while I realized that for some reason I was just not having any fun. Oddly too, whenever I exit out of the game, it remains running in the Steam UI and I have to ctrl-alt-delete to stop the game and reboot Steam. Bugs like these are so typical for Milestone products.  I'm willing to bet that after getting deeper into the game more bugs will appear. Other people seem to love this game, so your results may vary, I know there aren't many good game choices out there  for people who love bikes, but unless you are really desperate, I would suggest waiting until Ride 2 is somewhere around ten bucks.

												Sicuramente un bel passo avanti rispetto al capitolo precedente. Bella l'idea di inserire le motard (anche se la meccanica di guida è la stessa del game di Valentino). Ancora però sono troppo visibili molte compenetrazioni, soprattutto in situazioni di bagare fra moto e moto.Il comparto di customization è rimasto praticamente invariato rispetto al primo capitolo, infatti per gli amanti delle moto elaborate sicuramente non avrebbe guastato qualche scarico,pneumatico o qualsivoglia modifica estetica in più.D'altro canto però la possibilità di usare l'elaborazione da gara su determinate tipologie di moto rende all'utente la sensazione di partecipare effettivamente ad un campionato Superbike/SUperstock o CIV.A mio avviso ci sarebbe ancora del lavoro da fare, ma sembra proprio che la Milestone si sia incanalata sul verso giusto. Bravi! "

So much better than Ride and they've done an amazing job between the two titles. Runs very smoothly on my 980ti in 3440x1440 (yes it works in 21:9) resolution on high settings as long as I drop the AA down to 2x and looks great now.

												Boring, Reppetitive. The ONLY reason id ever reccomend this game is if you wanna go round your local track (which 99% of the time doesnt even exist on the game) there has never been a track dlc, majority of the tracks aint even real tracks. just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ road courses. the only track i enjoy doing is donington, which ive been round irl. the zx10 bug still exists and makes it ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ to ride. the dlc bikes they add in are totally pointless, for example, Yamaha R1 Racing Team EPayMe. is literally a RESKIN OF THE ANVIL TAG HIRE BIKE there is NO DIFFERENCE yet its part of a paid dlc, the suter mmx 500 is also ♥♥♥♥. they added a ktm 390 racing version, any different to the road one? no actually its stats are lower, the weight is lower which is true and how it should be. but they couldve added this in as a racing conversion? but they added in an entirely new bike? stupid decision. all i wanna see is REAL tracks used in wsbk, bsb, and other REAL tracks. even if they had an email sent out to everyone who wanted a say and all you had to do was reply with a name of a track, for example Brands hatch. it would be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! but ride 2 will NEVER see a track expansion. i can guarentee that. it lacks content and eventually becomes extremely repetitive.Dear devs: make track expansions, and DLC actually WORTH buying and i will happily change this review...ALSO the online play is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, the ammount of AI lag is ♥♥♥♥ing beyond anything ive EVER seen in a game. and this is caused by ONE person in the lobby having a bad connection, and regardless of who's hosting it, you will see the ai lagging its ♥♥♥♥ off rubber banding all over the screen, i know its not my ping, because ive experienced this being a host and also a client. and we kick one person and the game is fine next race. WORST online play ive ever seen in a motorcycle racing game. also leads me onto another point, ai is crap :)			"

My PC has the capability to play the likes of GTA V and BF4 on ultra graphics as well as other racers like F1 2016 and MotoGP, yet for some reason, the frame rates on both Ride games are just horrendous.

It seems they reached the limit of what current engine can do. Maybe next step is to upgrade to a new engine allowing more sophisticated graphics and physics. Ride 2 is great game and great evolution from previous ride. Must have for those who lines bikes and racing in general.			"

												Ride 1 was a good game not great but not bad i really enjoyed it but i did get boring after a short while Ride 2.... Starting off with the lag in the first couple races of Ride 1 there was some random lag spikes (i have a pretty good pc) As for the lag on Ride 2 i havent had any so far. Ride 2 has started off alot better than Ride 1 With A better first race. The new Bikes Are AWESOME Having Motards Are Great But The steering is WAY to Sensetive Also a random thing with the husqy is when you brake and downshift, It is like you Stall The Bike the revs just drop and the bike stops making noise, its not untill you get back on the throttle does the engine noise comeback. The AI Needs to be fixed as the come barreling in to corners and wipe you out. Bikes Sound SO much better. Also Maybe Need to Add Some more Modern 750cc Bikes eg: 2008 Suzuki GSXR 750 Not just older ones. The Drag races maybe need to be More Difficult. But all in all A MUCH better game then Ride 1			"

And the behavior is not liner:it gets better lap after lap :) same as a player is suppose to - that's a nice touch I would say.Graphics.Has a bit higher requirements than MotoGP15, but wait - those are nice views, not just track.Bikes - they are just awesome... Very detailed, I can stare at each one all day long :DI even decided to upgrade my GPU and don't regret it.Gameplay.Haven't tried multiplayer yet - unable to join to any lobby for some reason...Solo - not bad, maybe somewhat boring because of physics, but tons of events andhuge number of motorcycles seem promising.Overall.Worth buying. For those who ride in real life, it will ease our waiting for the spring and new season :DHere and there you will find some nice touches that will put a smile on your face.Anyway, I don't know better game of this kind out there...

												You guys need to patch the crap out of the AI. I cant win a race on any f-ing track on very easy because the first place guy can run perfect lines through the track and the guys behind you can out run any motorcycle you ride. On top of everything the online servers are non existent. I check each time I play and theres usually 1 game thats private and nothing else, create one and just sit alone forever, join one thats made public and its just 2 people that meant to make it private and they kick you out. ok the online stuff will likely get better when the game catches traction but the AI are seriously flawed. I cant win on super easy making me look bad, but on the tracks I know really well I can beat out the AI on realistic...FIX FIX FIX AND all will be happy but I am now having to fix a fist sized hole in my wall because I came in 6th on the easiest setting and its upsetting.

												Ride 2 is here and with it some improvements like the AI, new iconic tracks and races, more models of bikes and improvements on level detail that give you a more realistic feeling of your surroundings.They also improved the game physics, wich improve your experience while riding any bike, the sound continues to be good and satisfying since you can almost feel the engines and the graphic engine far better than Ride and this is the big change since everything thing appear and feel more realistic in every way.There are a few custom things in game just like the previous game but i think they could have added even more, specially in term of bikes, but still on line with the previous title.All in all, Ride 2 is a improvement, thats no doubt about it, and the best on this theme since there isnt much choice in term of motorcycles games, Ride give players a virtual feeling of driving a bike under various conditions and at some points it does very good job by passing realistic feeling doing that.Until this point, didnt faced any issue or bug in game but also played only few hours and mostly MP wich by the way suffer from the same matchmaking problems that any other released milestone game, so its safe to say that Ride 2 is and feels more polished that Ride in term that singleplayer but nothing improved in multiplayer (so it seem).

Its a really sloppy attitude and bad buisness to. You know when you play this game you feel that they have the ability to produce somthing quite wonderful if they would only go the extra mile.How bout a mode for inreased reality where you can actually step out the rear wheel with ease on a powerful bike thats cranked over in the wet. The multiplayer is a joke and needs to be more in the vein of Asseto Corsa where you can see whats on offer and simply drop in. Come on Milestone you have the expertise to make millions of bikers happy if you start earnestly trying to improve these games you will get many many more takers.			"

												With Milestone, always this sensation to get an unpolished game. Ride 2 rides on this way.Maybe it's better than the first one, but there are some basic shortcomings that always give that feeling of frustration of a half finished game.Physics is more arcade than simulation, with a semblance of simulation.Graphics are just lost between fair and middling.Always this ridiculous rotation angle of view in the first person.Loading times always long for what it is.Engine sounds are good but no wind sound, no environment sound, no crowd sound.No real force feedback in controller, just some discreet vibrations.AI is poorly managed, too powerful even is very easy, and just on rails, sometimes it tries to avoid you, sometimes you just don't exist...Always this annoying launcher to start the game !That's it ! It's a Milestone game, as always.Ride 2 is not that bad, but clearly not worth the price asked !Too bad, once again ...			"

												F* u Milestone, online mode in this game SUCKS donkey balls, you never know if its going to connect, im getting random freezes, crashes, timed outs  over and over and over. But its not really a news for you Milestone, every freaking game has the same problems, mxgp, motogp etc, they are all broken. Im not judging game content because I must admit it - I like it, I like bikes, clothes and gameplay, its allright. But fix your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ online mode, its killing me. And yes, my internet connection is fine, theres no problem in other online games.			"

												Great game, but not the Forza of bikes I was hoping for. It's flawed but it's as good as we're likely to get until a big AAA developer does something based around 2 wheels.Pros:The bikes look great.Decent handling on pro and semi-pro modes.Lots of circuits, bikes, and hopefully incoming DLC.Great rider customisation.Well optimised, good performance with options maxed out on a GTX970.Cons:The same generic customisation options for each bike is dissapointing.Poor enviromental graphics and textures.Some bikes feel very wonky (supermotos and some of the superbikes).Career mode progression is very dull.Multiplayer is a laggy mess.Overall, 7.5/10 "

												This game got me very excited with the RR tracks & bike list but unfortunately i haven't been able to join a single multiplayer game for more than 30 seconds before disconnecting.  It doesn't matter if i join or i host but this is a total deal breaker for me and future milestone games because i can't race with my friends, even when they are setup up gaming next to me. On top of this it has the same bugs as the first ride such as the bike pictures getting mixed up and stuttery graphics.  Poor form Milestone.  That latest patch didn't fix a single thing either with online connectivity.I have tried port forwarding and getting other friends to host a server but we can't stay connect for more than 30 seconds before we we D/C.Last milestone game i'll ever buy "

												I really thought I would like this game. I read many reviews (Good and Bad) and watched a few videos on Youtube. I had trouble registering whether I was riding a motorcycle or a lawnmower; the sounds of the bike are hardly immersive or enticing, I dont care what kind of sound system you have, it sucks. The physics are alright, nothing great. Advancement or trying to win a race is frustrating. I Chose 1/4 of the starter bikes that the game grants you, a Honda NSR sport bike. I upgraded this bike twice yet I finished in 5th place every race I played; After awhile I found out this game was not worth my time or money. I am quite disappointed. The customization of the bikes is nice though. This game resembles Forza in a motorcycle aspect, but does not deliver in simulation. End of story.			"

												Indie game feel for full game price. going into the game i have no real understaning of whats happening. pick a rider and next thing im in a race. what are the controls? they kinda pop up on screen to let me know its set to an absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keyboard layout. there is no menu option (that i can find) to change this. also, theres no menu option to return to the main screen. once you've entered a race, if you want to leave the game, you have to ctrl-alt-del out. seriously?? who missed that in quality control?  i have tried my best to set my steam pad up to use, but it feels wrong. turning left and right does not take advantage of the controllers sensitivity feedback, its just full on left or full on right, feeling clunky and wrong. ill change my review when the following change;1 - full steam controller set up built into the game2 - proper menu options meaning i dont need to ctrl-alt-del out of the game just to return to the main menu3 - a basic tutorialsorry but i dont normally review games but i was looking forward to this one and its a massive dissapointment right off the block.

												Short first impression:+great game+great sounds (best ones i've ever heard in a moto game so far)+great visuals+great bikes... (I mean come on, it includes SUPERMOTO!! drool drool)However... I have some criticism, mainly about the multiplayer mode...-No spectator mode... i mean... milestone... the year is 2016... need I say more ¿ *facepalm*-When joining a race in progress there is no lap indicator, so you're just waiting waiting waiting without a clue... the year 2016... milestone...? are you listening??? checking your callender??? thats a 2 and a 0 and a 1 and a 6?And oh yeah if you think waiting is ok? Well... any regular racing gamers definately know the Nordschleife... yeah that track where 1 lap takes you around 7-8 minutes (on a superfast bike that it is!!) so if that race just started you will be waiting at least 24 minutes before you can join :D well... if you're an overly optimist you can take that time to produce something smelly at your toilet (while the race finishes and starts again... without you my man... better pray it isnt nordschleife or one of those other looooong tracks)In my opinion this game has so much potential.... I just wonder if Milestone is even really aware of thatBut this game is just begging for a better multiplayer system its 2016!!! echo echo echo echo			"

												The only nice thing about this game is graphics. The rest is average at best but depends what one needs.For me:- tracks are complete joke, not even close to something similar to real- the bike handling is super far from any realism, try riding a thou through grass cranked over in real life (and that's in pro mode)- I couldn't even ride the bikes I wanted. Only few are on offer while others you have to ""buy"" and work for it. Didn't I just purchase the game and all the pack? Huh?- No ""career"" mode as such- Joystick feedback is next to useless (it actually makes it worse): delayed by about 1s, sometimes just vibrates for about 3s for no reason while on the straight. Better without it unfortunately.Those are only few things from top of my head. Having said that, as an arcade to waste few hours it's okay.But I expected a lot more.			"

												Ultimately I can't recommend Ride 2, despite thinking that it has a lot of really good elements: pretty solid graphics, great bikes with excellent detail and it runs solidly on my machine. Generally speaking, I *like* the ""simcade"" style racing games, where traction and line and setting up corners properly are important elements, but I've just come off playing quite a bit of Forza Horizon 3, a game which has such a well-constructed loop of races, events and getting new vehicles that just moves you through the content at such a good pace--a game that feels great to just play--that Ride 2 is like hitting a brick wall of inaccessibility.I'd actually managed to forget that I went through this with the original game when it came out. If you don't play moto GP games, even if you play other racing games, prepare to place dead last in every race even on very easy difficulty, and to do this for a very long time. Slowly you will chip away at the difficulty, and over a period of weeks you will eventually start winning races, cranking up the difficulty, and actually get to the point where the game is tense and engaging, but this is a weeks' long project. There is no gentle difficulty curve or onboarding to speak of. You are going to need to accept having a bad time for a very, very long time before you are going to be able to have any fun playing this game. Assuming this turns out like the first one, there really is a fun game hiding in here, but it's the chipping; it's the long, tedious and unfulfilling process to get to the level of capability you will need to have to expose that game. It just kills me that once again they've made the decision to make this game basically unplayable by non-fans when all it really would have taken was the addition of easier difficulty modes that non-experts can play on, and massaging the reward curves for playing to make it just a little less of a grind to experience the game. Why throw all that hard work away on a great racing simulation by making such poor game design choices?So as both an IRL game developer and motorcyclist I have to give this a thumbs down. SO close to greatness, but just hamstrung by making it so miserable for new players to pick up and play.			"

It is proper simulation, for example don't put too much throttle when exiting a corner or you'll violently highside.Now I will go through the pros and cons.ProsDetailedA lot of knowledge about bikesFunPlenty of manufacturers to choose fromVast customisation ConsPriceand here is some logic for you... I have a GTX 950, the game recommends GTX 970. I played on the lowest presets with 30fps for about a good ten hours then i thought to myself, how many fps would i get if i go full settings? I got straight 60fps all way round the Nürburgring. RIDE 2 LOGIC = LOW SETTINGS 30FPS - HIGHEST SETTINGS = 60FPS...			"

												I think it's difficult to judge this game.In so many ways, it's better than the original RIDE.Better physics, better graphics, better engine sounds, higher difficulty, more tracks, supermotos (!).But online connectivity is the worst I've ever experienced in any game.Fot that reason, I'm out. Edit march 2017:  okay, server connectivity might not be Milestone's strongers selling point, but the truth is i've spend hours playing this game. Simply because it's too much fun and great online competition. Server connectivity improved a bit compared to 2016.For that reason, thumbs up.			"

												This game is gorgeous. Awesome. Gran Turismo for motorbikes, except this looks much better. When you are watching a video of the race you just finished, it actually looks better than Milestone's promo pictures above! Virtual bikes have never been this glorious before. Even Valentino Rossi the Game, Milestones jewel, an official Moto GP simulator, cannot beat Ride 2. Many may not agree, but I like the spirit of Ride 2 more. The game has enough difficulty options, everyone can learn to ride it. Physics feel believable enough. For me it was a little bit more difficult than virtual car racing in the beginning, took about an hour to learn basic driving in easy mode, but you will propably be faster, I'm an old fart.If you love bikes, you will love Ride 2. Gorgeous vehicles, awesome road sceneries, true to life race tracks. Ride 1 was somewhat unfinished, the sequel is finished and polished non-clitching A1 game. Riding feels fast and furious. Of course when you sit staring at a monitor... it can't be anything like riding a bike physically, oh why I wrote that boring no-brainer. But when you are doomed inside, there's -15 celsius outside, and the summer is just a far-off dream, Ride 2 can save your mental health.I recommend this game. Thank you Milestone for making it.			"

												Like the first Ride, this is one of the best Motorcycle games I've played since Tourist Trophy on the PS2.  It is as difficult as you want it to be with scaling that rewards you for turning assists off (much like Forza).  It's arcady enough to where anyone can pick it up, and with just enough sim aspects to keep you on your toes if you wish.  Race and bike variety is great.  Small displacement 2-stroke sport bikes, dual sports, top heavy naked bikes, supersports, touring bikes, classics, etc.  The PP (performance points I assume) system is new to this title.  Reminds me a bit of Grand Turismo's way of measuring overall performace.  Many people do not like it but it keeps the races interesting by having PP limits on events so you can't just max out the tuning on an eligible bike and smoke the AI competition on every race, which was a bit of an issue for me in the first Ride.  Tuning and customization options are practically the same as the first title, with just a bit extra.  The bike selection and tracks are great and much improved from the previous title.  It has a very accurate Nordschleife which combined with excellent controls always makes for a great racing title.  I recommend both Ride and Ride 2, but so far Ride 2 is the definitive title in the series thus far.			"

												i will start this review with a solid thumbs up, great game. spent many hours ploughing through corners and straights with ease and the simulated effects are great but............ the online play is laggy (even after update), i think the bike sounds could be more realistic especially after fitting upgrading exhausts there is no sound change???  know i consider myself to be a true biking fan eat sleep and breathe bikes but no game is complete without A. Nurbergring and B. Isle of man tt track!! i know before you all start kicking off that ride 2 has the nurbergring and for that im thankfull its one of my favourite tracks but a motorbike game without the most difficult and rewarding track known to man (isle of man tt track) to be missed out is a direct insult to motorcyclists around the world, only a true biker would concider my words to be true and milestone should be ashamed of themselfs for not including it!!!! but what makes it worse is this game is awesome probably the best bike game to date and if milestone concider themselves to be true motorcyclist enthusiasts then they should really think about there history!!! please add the isle of man tt track to make this game the best biking game for many years to come			"

												I've been waiting for this since the old Moto Racer games disappeared! I tried the demo of the original and something didn't click with me but I've got well in to Ride 2, lots of fun and loads of bikes and tracks to get excited about. I think the road courses are my favourite but it's nice to have the variety.			"

												2 stroke engine sounds are way better than the 2 stroke sounds that were in ride 1.The engine sounds overall are a lot more clear than it used to be in the first version of ride.I personally never owned ride 1 but i have seen a lot of conent and i could clearly hear the engine sound difference.It's quite awful that milestone doesn't really have any competition on these kind of games only the creators of the mx vs atv series and they have horrible games btw.I think that they could make this better but it is decently good the way it is.You can easily sink a lot of time in to this but after i bought it i didn't really get to play it because i got gta v for pc and that took me away from this game.

												Its a riding game and I gotta say, it feels good.Graphics arent AAA but overall game looks good. Peformance was mostly acceptable, noticed a bit of physics glitching with the bikes in my mirror.  Bike inertia and physics feel like the real deal however without actualy race experience I often find myself questioning how the bike is still gripping. ( this is with assists turned off ).Bike selection is acceptable but wanted a few more interesting options ( bikes like the 250rr, RVF400, lower capacity, 4 stroke racers)Customisation feels a bit generic but fairly realistic to what I know people do to their bikes ( e.g. replacement headers resulting in significant power increases, Ive got a neighbour with an RGV 250 and did research a while back).Needs a test ride mode labeled as such in the garage view, there's only a quick time trial mode but requires you to pick the bike from the garage then going through the options. Makes me want to go for a track day.Looking for a bike racing game? this certainly feels like nails it. Hoping next one goes open world. Money well spent considering the lack of competition and the higher demands, yet the quality and feel of the physics. Good price point.			"

												Coming from a bikers perspective (lol like 98% of people that buy this are bikers) its a super fun game. 9/11 for sure. something they could fix:- *cough* you guys missed the 09-12 ZX6R but got the 03-06 and the 07-08 like wtf? maybe that can be added in a free DLC- more drag racing would be awesome or maybe even full events of drag. add in full drag racing bikes (i know HD and kawi are strong in the racing dep for that)- where are the GSXR 750's at, you know anything that is around 4 year old LOL. would like to see maybe 08-10 GSXR 750 and maybe even the 11-now ones			"

												Ride?Riderideride?Expands on the original Ride,has slightly updated physics.Games plays out fun,But the campaign does get a bit repetitive seeing as most races are just 3 lap stints to the finish line.Anyway, a tonne of new bikes including cafe racers, more old school sport bikes and some supermotos.You can now steer slightly while pulling wheelies.Most bikes sound less digitalized.Most 600cc inline 4's still sound vague - For god's sake I'll lend my 07 ZX6R if you guys want to record a more authentic engine sound.Still a fun game for anyone into motorcycles.This isn't hyper realistic as you can still carry brakes deep into corners,But the games physics have been redefined to give you much less slack when making mistakes or riding too hard.Fun.

												Pros:- A bunch of bikes- Many gear options- rain mode- Traction control options from full to off- wheelie control options from full to off- AI is hard enough- generally speaking the game is realistic enough but still fun- good bike performance and looks customization- game runs well- multiple view angles, including first person and in helmet view pointCons- most motorcycles sound realistic when idling but almost all sound fake when redlining and accelerating- riding in the rain is way to easy!- bad music (I recommend to play with music off)- not many people onlineHopefully Ride 3 will have better engine/exhaust sounds, more tracks and I would like to see a bit more realism when it comes to riding on cold and wet tracks. But generally speaking, from a motorcyclists perspective, this game is a blast.			"

												I am enjoying this game. If you're into motorcycles  this title is for you.Positives;Customization of everything. Your machine, helmets, suits, gloves, and boots.Gameplay is excellent and has good feel.Graphics are good, not going to astound you though. No bugs, runs smoothly. I've had no issues with performance.Tracks are accurate, at least the ones I am familiar with. I assume they all are.Many  modes and challenges on single player. More than enough to keep you busy. NegativesMultiplay is lacking and at times hard to find a race to join. $49.99  is a bit steep to pay considering the poor multiplayer system. *Purchased during the Winter sale for $34.99 a more reasonable price to pay. Get it while its on sale, It'll keep you interested.			"

												The problem with motorbike games versus car games is the lack of a suitable peripheral.  Car games have a very sophisticated range of wheels and pedals to choose from and this greatly adds to the immersion factor for the gamer.  So for us bike fans we cannot even get close to the quality of simulation that car fans can.Any PC gamer that has tried a bike game over the years will have experienced the frustration of keyboard or joystick ""riding"".   No matter the potential of the game, it was always limited by the player input device.   The general advice surrounding Ride 2 is get an XBox Controller for Windows.  For the PC player this is a new experience and does take some time to get used to.  But if you are interested in Ride 2 and are a PC player I would strongly recommend it.   Make use of the easier settings in the game and build into it.  The graphics on Ride 2 are satisfactory for a contemporary game.  Plenty of options to find your playing level to keep frustration levels at bay early in your playing experience.  The fun factor is the big compensator for any other deficiencies you may perceive in the game.   Early in your Ride 2 game time it may seem a bit too arcadey but as you get more competent with the controls the game delivers a more satisfying ""riding"" experience.At some stage would love to see a peripheral that mimics a bike's controls - to some degree.  Maybe one that attaches to a steering wheel and has a twist throttle and levers - existing pedals could substitute for gear and rear brake.  But in the meantime it looks like the XBox Controller is the standard. Overall, Ride 2 is worth a punt if you are into bikes, but get an XBox controller if you do not have one.			"

												Milestone, we meet again...Out of my three favorite companies I follow in the racing game genre, Kylotonn, Codemasters, and then Milestone.Ride 2...I'm blown away, I truly am.I honestly got the game late, I'm glad I did!The game has improved so much, finally updated the bikes physics engine(if you say thay didn't, you're new to Ride or you've only played Ducati 90th), done a lot that we've asked in terms of bikes, and just went all out for this game.The physics engine did need a bit of tuning, you guys did it!You're able to push bikes a lot farther and gain from it.Engine pulls feel more accurate, riding and tucking feels smoother, if you use a different style bike for a Sports Bike event you can tell a real difference just in watching on track behaviour.I do think that trying to modify the Supermoto physics from VR The Game however didn't work, I'd started off with the Supermoto from the start and was immediately able to tell what had been done, solid but didn't play into Ride's engine all too well. The Supermoto class for people who ride manual has a gear skipping issue, engine lag issue out of corners, and the swooping feels awkward on this game. For the whole Supermoto Improv I'm gonna toss a 6.5/10 on how well it was done. The reason I'm throwing a number there is simply due to how well it turned out being a direct port from VR.If there's one thing I loved the most from this game I'd have to say it's the ambition for it because the team has always showed that they love to work hard for their fans.Ever since they learned they had a presence in the US Gaming World they've tried to fill in things that everyone wants since we're all different from country to country.From the mix up of bike classes, I'd say this was a VERY smart move letting different breeds finally meet on one track and duel to see who's the strongest.The bikes themselves have been worked on! Unlike in Ducati 90th, & Ride 1 when you upgrade an engine to a bike you've gotta put new breaks on it, make it run wild but have an actual payoff, you're punished if you don't.Having a bigger track list also helped out a lot in this game, because I swear if Milestone kept that small list of actual Bike Circuits, & Scenic Circuits I'd have lost my mind in this review. Thankfully there's enough to call this a true expansion in the way of tracks.Some have even been improved! This blew my mind away! Here's my take on some of the tracks.-Sierra Nevada finally got its final corners fixed, and I'd even go as far as saying that a few of the corners felt lifted a bit to give you a good chase down of the rider ahead of you if you get a good run.-Hellenic Towers is probably one of the better looking tracks in this game, also good for hot laps. This track has pretty much already become abused online, everyone loves to set it up for the super street bikes.-Imola feels very slippery compared to the Imola in Ride 1. I feel like even when I run a good setup the bikes always get hung in some corners, the detail to the track is better and represents how it should, though I like the fact that it's not too realistic.There are more, also I hate to say it but I think since the tracks were pushed to be updated I think some things got missed which let down a lot of the tracks.My overall opinion falls along this game being one of the best Ride games to date.Milestone, please keep it only SLIGHTLY realistic, otherwise it takes away from what Ride is.I'm happy I got this at $25 or I wouldn't have got it. If you can get this game for cheap I fully recommend playing it if you're a Milestone fan.			"

												Best motorcycle game in my opinion. It feels really close to forza. The only things that bother me is no mod support. There are several mods out there, but no workshop to make the game cater my desires. Customization feels a little bit limited but it is a really good looking game (Not the best. it can do more). There is so much potential in this game, and it is one of my favorites. Unfortunatly, until there are more games to compete with it, I'm sure this is all we'll get.7/10			"

												This game is currently the best motorcycle racing game ever made. It's definitely not without its faults, but overall it's both fun to play and makes a very good effort at realism, which is more difficult to capture in a motorcycle sim than a car sim. The pros are:- Motorcycle selection- Parts and upgrades- Grip and steering simulation- Lots of contentCons:- Too easy to upgrade bikes--this should be throttled and gradual so players can learn how certain things will affect the bike- Range of upgrades is limited and pricing often doesn't make sense (2000 cr. for tires??)- (Nit pick) Most bikes come with lights, mirrors and plates which race bikes would almost never have- No way to fine-tune input device, so steering/accelerating/braking often feels like an on/off switch- (Nit pick) Turning is unresponsive with almost a second of delay as the rider moves over before starting the turn. I guess you could argue this is realistic and it forces you to plan your turns- The main menu is inaccessible from most places in the game. If you want to change certain options, you have to quit everything and go back to the main screen			"

												Very good game, I'm a racing sim fan and am not disappointed by this, pretty good physics, good enough campaign and plenty of good bikes and customisation, only niggles are stupid things like a few bikes such as MT10 don't have upgradable exhausts!			"

												A massive improvement on the first one and an absolute joy to play. Track graphics arent bad but are not in the same realms as other racing sims. Most of the bikes are absolutley gorgeous, as if they could be in a real showroom, on the other hand theres some inconsistency as others dont look quite so good. +Quick load times+Great gameplay+Great range of bikes+Great range of tracks+Includes Wet tracks+Stable gaming+Keeps me coming back for more-More like the game the first one should have been rather than sequel-DLC bikes are pretty much same which were previously free in RIDE 1 (Also have much less customisation)-Some engine noises arent right and feel like theyve just been copy and pasted (a v4 that sounds the same as an inline? come on..) Overall I do love the game and with some tweaks it could be perfect. For any motorcycling gamers this is essential. Thank you Milestone for giving bikers the game theyve longed for.			"

												First Impressions:  Its a bit better than Ride 1 and the best motorcycle game on the market imo.I have 20 years experience riding real motorcycles from Harley to Ducati and this is a good balance between sim and fun. Make sure to take off auto-braking, I hate that feature feels like im barely in control then.+Looks a little bit better than Ride 1 and MotoGP15.+Handling is a bit easier (maybe a little less sim)+Nice new tracks and scenic routes (just not enough)+Good selection of bikes/upgrades, even vintage.-Optimization could be better, get some drops despite a solid rig (can't even adjust or lower the graphics settings?)-Lots of load screens, but fairly quick-Wish it had a few more scenic route tracks (even recycled some from R1 like Miami etc).Rating 7.8PS If you like dirtbiking in real life as myself, MXGP2 is fairly good too!  Lots of nice uphill and downhill slopes.			"

												Think Forza on two wheels and your are pretty close.Ample tracks, weather and modification options.Difficulty on realism is nice and punishing and makes a great challenge once you know the tracks.The daily and weekly points challenges are all fun.Online is fun, coding makes it all pretty smooth, think forza again.The sounds could use some work but are pretty good - in this regards its more like Gran urismo - remeber those motor sounds - good but never as cool as forza..Game direly needs to be modded and access Steam Workshop without it breaking online access.
