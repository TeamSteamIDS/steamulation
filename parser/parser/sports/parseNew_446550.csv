Early Access Review
								Early access review for Infinite Minigolf with a TL;DR (+, +/-, -)at the bottom, as always this is just what I think and as it's early access some opinions and statements can (and hopefully will) become redundant as progress is made.Alright, to start I'm not usually one for sport related games but something about user created levels (within the game, not workshop) plus power-ups just made me want to give it a go, I was not disappointed. When you open Infinite Minigolf you're instructed to create your avatar with only a few options available now, but more as you level up. Then you're off without much instruction, while this is a pet-peeve of mine and is a negative to me, I was able to pick up on the controls fairly quickly as there aren't a lot of them.There are no built in developer levels (hence no tutorial), it's all the communities ideas, though a few of the devs may or may not make a few courses. This has the potential to be both bad and good and I'm happy to say that for now the courses are generally fun, interesting and challenging in most cases and only very few are disappointing or bland. In all courses you compete against others in the world for the right to be top dog, via a leaderboard. There doesn't seem to be much meaning in getting a high score other than getting over a ""goal"" score and even then I'm unsure of if that gives exp for a level or even how much.Levelling up gives you access to more clothing, hair styles, golf clubs/balls and accessories, which is alright as the early stuff is pretty basic and I'm hoping the later items are impressive. Only problem I find with the levelling system is that it doesn't inform you that you've levelled up or even store your earned experience over the level up, so after completing ten holes over goal I thought I'd hit maybe level five or six, but only went up one. So if you're after levelling you almost need to go back to the main menu each time you pass a hole. On the plus side you seem to level up very fast early on which lessens the blow of losing experience a little.The editor itself and the source of all the courses online is fairly easy to use once you know how to use it, but with a lack of another tutorial it can be a bit of a hit and miss. It doesn't help that the tutorial tells me to use RB, LB and RT, LT which implies that I had a hand controller connected, I did not. Apart from that the tutorial is very close to being a top quality editor, my favourite function being the function that snaps two pieces together and it does it in a smart way that feels intuitive. It's also not an editor that requires you to type in the X, Y, Z positions, but this can be weird if you want to do something amazing but there are work arounds for those kinds of things so it's not a problem. Not only that but each map has it's own editor space with unique pieces (at least it seems that way for now) though only one map type is out now more is to come as progress is made.Speaking of progress, they have said that there are two more themes to be released, online multiplayer with up to 8 people, skills and a single player campaign with over 300 holes. It sounds like it's going to be chock full of things to do by the time it's fully released and I for one am awaiting more content eagerly.To sum it up, Infinite Minigolf has lots of potential and lots of promised potential and not a lot of problems or things barring your way to having a fun time. A simple tutorial or set of tutorial holes would vastly improve the ease of getting into the swing of things but for now you'll have to learn on your own. Apart from that, pick it up, go play it and make some holes for the world to enjoy.TL;DR+ Smooth Graphics not noticed frame drops+ Very easy to use editor+ Lots of customisation options for your avatar (only cosmetic)+ Plenty of levels already+ Simple controls+ Global leaderboards+ Lots of extras promised+/- Visuals could be a little cartoon like for some, but this comes down to personal preference+/- Lots of experience given out (early on anyway)+/- No multiplayer... yet- Editor having RB, LB, RT and LT instead of keyboard keys when no controller is connected- No tutorial or instructions for controls or abilities- No list of holes, it randomly picks a hole from those available- Experience lost if not used as you level up- No notification of leveling up= Worth your time, worth your money and worth it = 85/100			"

								A fan of Zen's Planet Minigolf on the PS3 but only found out about this after looking for other mini-golf games since playing Golf with your Friends (which is also good - you should get both!). I'm not sure why this isn't getting more attention - it's a good, solid mini-golf game with lots of options (single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer), plenty of holes already and a really easy to use editor so anyone can create their own holes in next to no time. My kids and I had a blast playing our first couple of rounds. Even in it's current state it seems very playable and I haven't spotted any obvious bugs or flaws so far. Hopefully they can add a few more options (like stroke play and match play for instance) but even if nothing changed from now on, I'd say it looks good value for money.			"

								I like that this type of game with features exists and is being developed further. I am not so much a fan of the powerup items being the focal point of gameplay. I wanted minigolf physics and this game has made it into bloody tincup on shrooms. I wish there was a course mode for normal minigolf and the powerups were a bonus part of the game. despite that it is challenging AF. There are some bugs as far as clipping and not having real curvatures. The atmosphere is a little too safe for my taste, but i guess they want kids money or something. like kids have money. HAH! characters are horrifying looking like Sims 2 horrible. i wouldn't be surprised if they started speaking in blurp with easy listening muzak oh yea the music is terrible it's also sims music. So if you turn off the music and ignore the characters and the terrible modelling and physics... ok i shouldn't recommend this i'm just trying to justify my interest in having a minigolf game, but i'm going to still, because it's the only one that is actually getting made. the power on the joy stick swing is also unforgivingly touchy. I hope they make it better so that my recommendation isn't in vain.			"

								Addicted! It's very much a case of 'just 1 more hole'. Also love the editor with the ability to create our own holes for everyone to play. Highly recommend this game, by far the most enjoyable minigolf game I've played!			"

Early Access Review
								NOTE: I received a key from Zen Studios. This review is also on Gamergeddon.Infinite Minigolf is currently available in Early Access on Steam, and today I’ll tell you what I think about the games’ progress so far.This is the latest title from Zen Studios, one of my favorite developers from the last gaming generation, and the creators of Zen Pinball/Pinball FX2, so naturally I’ve got some faith in them.  When I first booted up Infinite Minigolf, I was a little surprised to see such a clean, smooth user interface… it’s not their style. Since this title isn’t officially released, you’re currently limited to playing solo or with a local friend. There are some unavailable options on the main menu including Online Match and Duels, so there’s hope to see some online multiplayer added to the game at a later date.If you jump into solo, there’s no developer-made courses so-to-speak, but there’s an endless supply of user-created holes to play, which in some sense makes the game endless. Of course that also means there’s a course creator for those of you who want to make your own mini-golf holes for your own enjoyment, and to share with others. Like Mario Maker, you must complete the course successfully before it can be shared with others. This helps to avoid people filling the servers with impossible courses… but you can definitely make ‘em challenging.Course physics will definitely take some getting used to in Infinite Minigolf. Courses are typically made of cardboard and can be littered with random items from smartphones to VHS tapes, ramps, and jumps, and of course…power-ups.  What I don’t like about the game is that some power-ups are really confusing, and you have no idea what they’re going to do, whether it be help you or hurt your score in the game. There doesn’t appear to be an explanation for any of them, and you are left on your own to figure it out as trial and error. This isn’t a huge issue though since you can restart any hole in mere seconds, and try again if you didn’t like your outcome. The same can be said during the course creator – very little explanation on how to build a course, no descriptions for categories, or how to move stuff around, and its trial and error. I wish it was a little more user friendly.Infinite Minigolf has a solid start on its competition, at least on Steam – since the majority of the other similar games don’t look nearly as pretty, and this one features full controller support so you can play with a wireless Xbox 360 controller, or whatever else you may have.  The game doesn’t have a ton to offer right now, but we hope to see those new modes open up soon, giving players a chance to face off against others, and maybe earn some sort of in-game rewards.			"
