								The Good:An excellent multiplayer experience that hearkens back to the lively days of Nintendo couch co-op playing Super Smash Bros. or Super Mario KartFast and frantic racing-style gameplay that constantly sees twists and turns as far as who is in the leadOutlandish and colorful characters and maps that really complement the ecclectic nature of the gamePower-ups are an absolute riot with constant changes to the way the player moves through the levelMy personal favorite was the grappling hook, which grabs the closest player to you and throws him backwards, hilarity quickly ensuingControls are very tight and responsive, which is crucial in a platforming game of this natureAnimation and physics are spot-on and help convey the sense of motion and weight to the charactersGraphics are sharp and vibrant, which are very welcome in a 2D gameMaps are intricately made with what appears to be a pain-staking attention to detailTurbo generators, swing-able ceiling tiles, lasers, and buzz-saws are a some of the well placed items in a map that can make or break your “speed run”Current content on this “Early Access” title is more than enough to have a good time with your Steam friends, but the promise of more content updates just sweetens the pot on this gameActive developers that constantly respond and engage their audience in the development of the gamePrimarily in the Steam ForumsThe Bad:The good times had while playing the game is diminished when playing without friends you know, but that’s not to say it still isn’t funCan you play it while the children are awake?:Absolutely.  In fact, I played it with my 7 year old and had a blast!Did I make time to complete it?:With a multiplayer-based game, completion isn’t really a question.  Did I have a blast playing numerous races with my friends? Yes.  Do I foresee myself doing so again in the future? Absolutely.Redlight or Greenlight?:A most definite Green light on this one.  greenThe great times already had with this title make it worth picking up nowRecommended Purchase Price:$9.99A Quick Look at Those Games You Might Buy:http://www.gamersglance.com "

								A creatively imagined multiplayer game. A surprisingly pleasant alternative to the brawler-type of multiplayer that has become so commonplace (e.g. samurai gunn, starwal, towerfall, bit-brawlers, brawlhalla, etc...), SpeedRunners offers players a spectrum of depth in gameplay. At its base, this game is a racing platformer, rewarding players who learn the turns and obstacles of various unique levels while punishing those who make mistakes. Perfectionism at its finest. This fine work does offer a deeper level of competition, however, if players chooses to exploit the nuances of the game's physics. With the mention of the glory of this game, I must also point out the negatives, which are frustratingly apparent within the first 5 minutes of gameplay. The matchmaking system is extremely unreliable, despite the implementation of a ranking system (albeit new). There are constant bugs in just about any multiplayer game, which would be endurable in a more forgiving game. The glitches can be brutal, and, due to the competitive nature of this game, they do not come off as humorous as in other games. At the rate at which this game has improved recently and with the massive community of stakeholders which it has garnered, SpeedRunners, while still in Beta at the moment of this review, will doubtlessly become one of the flawless go-to's for just about any friendly LAN party and competitive tournament. Each complaint I have for this game is tied to a problem that any early access game would have, and they are no reason to avoid a purchase. Currently an 8 / 10, this game is an easy pick-up and a difficult put-down!			"

								Not played a game in a LONG LONG time that offers tons of fun, replayability and humour, but when a friend gifted me this I had a feeling that this game was a MASTERPIECE... and I was right.I played with two other friends and the experience was absolutely amazing, I was shocked on the Price mainly and how low it was for a game with such quality (It is ONLY in ALPHA too!). You become extremely focused and attached to the game, focusing on beating your opponents on a variety of maps, using powerups on each other, taking different routes and constantly gathering more skill each time you play and that is what I enjoyed the most about the game. Each time you play it, you feel like you are getting better, leading to you becoming attached to the game. It is also a great laugh with friends, using powerups on each other and just being the biggest troll ever. What amazed me was how easy and simple it is to create maps, also the game is workshop supported! Create it in-game, share it instantly to workshop for all of the community to see... it isn't as complicated as map-making when it comes to Source Games (Garry's Mod, Team Fortress, Counter Strike). There is also ranking if you feel confident enough in beating other players and being the absolute best speedrunner.The only downside is that the Keyboard Controls are yuck... I have began using a Gamepad and find it easier. You can customise the controls of course but I just cannot find the right setup for me.Just make sure you have friends to play it with!			"

								Let me preface this with the following: SpeedRunners is worth all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the 10 dollars earned for buying this terriffic game. SpeedRunners is a god damned anomaly, being in Early Access has not hindered this game's meaningfullness as a medium for entertainment and competitiveness. SpeedRunners features some really balanced gameplay, your skill is your skill, nothing else is the determining factor for success. You will run, jump, slide, and grapple your way through a series of levels, designed by mere mortals, as if they were designed my gods. The only downside of this otherwise shining example of video game excellence, is the gosh darned lag! Lag can sometimes mess up an entire match, however, lately the net code has been polished to a shine, and is suitable for those who can't afford the highest internet. Overall, I would give SpeedRunners a 9/10, it's fun, it's competitive, and it's everything you want it to be.			"

								Overall, this game is great, but there are a few things that I think could've been done better.+Main game is incredibly fun. I still find myself coming back to it sometimes. This game has an original concept that they executed very well, and in result the main part of the game is great.+Lots of characters, with different customization options+Lots of maps (not a whole lot of official ones, but that's what the workshop is for)+Workshop is great, you can make your own levels and submit them, and play other people's as well. There are also top levels of the week, etc.+The game keeps updating and in my opinion the updates point to a good direction for the game+The community is pretty large, you can usually find people online and there are lots of tournaments and such that are supported by the dev team+Leagues, XP, etc.+-The community is so-so ingame, everyone you play with online is either very nice and mature or just very rude and immature. I haven't really found a lot of the in betweens, though I don't play online a whole lot either.+-The AIs can play some workshop maps fine, but others they just get stuck, go the wrong way, etc.-The soundtrack can get horribly repetitive. It's okay, but I usually turn my sound off because a lot of the time it's the same song and it just gets on my nerves tbh.-The campaign is bad. Like, not a little bad, REALLY bad. They should've just kept it out in my opinion. There's basically no story (well there is but it's not much of one), only about less than an hour total to complete it, and almost every single level in it is either way too easy or way too hard.-It is crazy the amount of bugs you can find by just playing it for maybe 30 minutes. I understand it's in early access (the time I'm writing it is), but there are so many times where the screen borders aren't really the borders for the level, AIs go the wrong way (only seen this on a couple maps now, they fixed most of them but it's still weird) and the wrong person will get the point sometimes. However, they are also fixing a lot of these, so soon hopefully most of these will be gone.Nonetheless, despite the bugs (the game is still very playable, please don't take what I said the wrong way), this game is awesome. It is so much fun to play by yourself, even more so with friends (jk, like I have a social life or something), and is just overall fun.Rating: 8/10			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: SpeedRunners Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Racing; Multiplayer; Action; MOBA My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A Multiplayer Aspect: Primary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Novelty seekers; Multiplayer gamersI received an activation key of this game from a press kit for the purposes of writing a review.  This did not affect my opinion; I will only recommend games that I like. If I do not like a game, I will not recommend it. Period. View my mission statement.REVIEWSpeedrunners is a 2D-sidescroller that mixes in some elements of speed-platforming, combat-racing, and modern MOBA-lite games.  It plays like something you may find as a minigame mode in a Mario Party game.The matches are played as a footrace through 2D circuit maps where the object is to get so far ahead of your opponents that they fall of the edge of the map.  There are boosts and grappling hooks you must learn to use effectively on each map to move quickly.  There are also pick-ups like rockets and freezing laser beams to add that right touch of chaos to the races.You have the option to play custom matches with bots, or with local players for good-old-time couch coop with your friends.  There are both quick match and ranked match options for automatic online matchmaking.  The ranked match mode has a progression system and point leaderboards.Most of the variety in the game comes from the various maps.  And the Steam Workshop means infinite possibilities for maps.  Some users have already created some pretty interesting maps.  There are also many characters to choose from, with several of them being crossovers from other games.   They seem to have differing animations but no differences in abilities.The graphics are pretty much what you would expect from a modern 2D-sidescroller.  The music and sounds fit the style of the game; and I believe there is a community guide available that shows you how to easily integrate your own music into the game.  The controls are fluid and intuitive; I personally used a controller and thought the controls were pretty optimal.  Lastly, I didn’t experience any glitches or crashing… although some people have reported crashing on certain Workshop maps.The game does what it does well, undoubtedly.  With the Workshop and the ease of modding of this game, there is definitely a bright future ahead for Speedrunners and a vast sea of possibilities.  I look forward to seeing what else is added to the game in the future.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												For those people who are concerned with long term playtime: I've played this game for about what now... 2 years? I've had many moments of success and shortcomings. If you want to grab a game and play it competitively, this is your game. It won't be long until you see how far you've gotten. Now how do you begin? Well I recommend grabbing some friends and playing with them for a short while so you can get used to the controls and all the maps. As you play through the game you'll recognize there will always be better ways to run them. With that being said now go have fun with this game!			"

								For this game, simplicity is what makes SpeedRunners so effective. The concept is very straightforward - and makes you rethink about the traditional style of typical racing games. You control a motley cast of random characters (with some specials guests here and there) and you race by trying to outrun each other. The core mechanics of SpeedRunners are implemented just fine, and can be quite exhilarating with the use of the grappling hook, as it's very satisfying to pull off, and will get you massive air and acceleration when used correctly. Visually and aesthetically speaking, SpeedRunners keeps things simple for the sakes of getting players to remain focused on racing, with a pleasant, cartoony art style that gets the job done. The soundtrack isn't that diverse but has a few catchy songs to keep the races tense. There's also a bit to do, with a standard story mode, an online and offline playing system, and even a workshop to create new stages for you and the community to play with, SpeedRunners is quite a bit more indepth with it's content. The game as of this review is still holding the status of being ""Early Access"", so in the future there may be even more to do.I do have some issues with balancing: which is primarily centred around the use of items. They're a welcome addition as a whole, but I wish that they were taken out of competitive online play (ranked matches) as they can heavily interfere with your progression in levelling up in a way that just isn't fair. Ranking systems in online matches on multiplayer games that punish you for losing by taking away rank points is a practice that generally annoys me, but the chance of items does bug me even more.And I just wish that some of the items themselves were tonned down a bit. The golden grappling hook is just not fun to play against. And from my experiences, the game crashes on me almost every ten minutes. Other times it can take a while to crash, once I've booted up the game, and over times it can take under five minutes to crash. My friend doesn't have this issue at all, but from my research, this happens to many people who have played this game. It may be due to the game still not being complete, but if this issue could be addressed as soon as possible, then my enjoyment of this game would be even better, but as of this review; I can't play this game for more than about twenty minutes at max before the game crashes, and I have to reboot it. Overall though, I'd recommend SpeedRunners if you're looking for something simple to get into, yet enjoyably challenging to master. this game requires practice and patience when playing against good players. It's a new take on racing games, and especially for an indie, early access, the product as of now is a well crafted game.			"

Soundtrack is amazeballs.3. Progressively challenging.4. Wide variety of funky characters to choose from.5. Brilliant level designs.Cons:1. Minimal amount of players during matchmaking.2. Lack of advertising for the game. Not many people buy it. Please, buy it.It may not look visually appealing, or promising, but that's what even I thought before I actually went ahead and bought it.

								To put it simple, could be described as 2D Mario Kart with legs. Four players running around a map with varied obstacles collecting different power ups and weapons. Game really shines when played with friends, especially if you can get them in the same room. Can be played against bots and also has little singleplayer campaign. Controls feel tight and races get really exciting. Could use some more of official maps, some workshop maps are a bit buggy or just confusing. All characters perform the same, but all have their own unique and sometimes funny animations that really add tasty flavor to the game. Also more varied soundtrack would be welcomed. Really fun game that works well for early acces.[Score: 84]			"

tl;dr -> Mario Kart on foot. If you ever wanted to punch your friends in the face, play this game instead. 11/10 you'll want to punch them in the face anyway.I was fortunate enough to get this game gifted to by a friend, and I was very excited to try it out after seeing all the powerful positive reception. I was very satisfied with my experience, and this has easily become one of my top (local) multiplayer games. If you like comedic racing with item pickups (in the vein of games like Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing), then you will really enjoy this game. The aesthetics are good - the detail in the environment is nice, and the artsyle is colorful and matches the tempo of the game. The different character models are well-done, and some of them have interesting jump animations (ex: the shark character dives forward and the cat character rides a broom). The music and sounds are very good, however, I usually play my own music to add to the intensity of the gameplay. Controls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with. I strongly recommend playing with a controller - especially if you are doing local multiplayer. The tutorial is quick and very helpful in showing you all the game mechanics. The learning curve is mostly minimal, however, mastering the game and understanding each map takes some time. Maintaining momentum is critical to success, and practice will really help you understand the most efficient way to traverse through each map (ex: knowing when to jump vs. double-jump to get across a section). Whenever I play with my friends, we like to start from the first map and play through all the available ones (they are ranked in ascending order of difficulty). Gameplay really shines if you can play (local or online) with a few friends - this is my top local multiplayer game at the moment of writing this review. As you race, the screen gradually shrinks toward the middle, and touching the red edges (usually happens if you are trailing behind) will cause you to explode and be knocked out. Interestingly, there have been rare moments where being in the lead too much has caused me to die (but I think it's because I touched the ""ceiling"" before the lagging players could be knocked out. 4 players can play at a time, and the round ends whenever only one player remains - the first to 3 points wins the map. Whenever a round ends, all players will respawn in the immediate area (this can cause hilarious situations if the starting point is somewhere very inconvenient - like a multiple wall-jumping area). My friends and I have gotten the screen to shrink into an extremely tiny square in the middle (we don't know if there is an upper limit for how small the screen can get) before someone won. Throughout the map, there are hazards like spikes/lasers (they will stun you for a few crucial seconds), boxes (usually a set of them in a row), and drops (insta-death). Boxes respawn, and a common technique is to let someone take the lead initially if you are unfamiliar with the map - especially since momentum can cause you to hit multiple boxes if you aren't fast enough in recovering. Usually, there are switches throughout the map that allow the person in the lead to manipulate the field a bit. For example, triggering a switch (you just need to run over it) may cause a route to be blocked off, opening a new one for the people behind you that is longer/more difficult. Sometimes, however, it is a better idea to avoid the switch, as they may also open routes that act as shortcuts for people lagging behind. There are also items you can pick up, and this is my favorite part of the game - I am an item ♥♥♥♥♥, and will purposely go for items just to see what I randomly get. Pickups may be things like homing rockets, a set of boxes you can drop, a pulling hook (switched places between you and the person in the lead), or a freezing beam. I do not know if this is a bug, but something I've encountered is a delay when you use the ice beam right before a round ends - instead of having the item wasted, it seems to activate right after the next round starts, freezing anyone in front of you. There are white areas on the ceilings that allow you to use your grappling hook to swing around. Some advanced techniques include swinging to propel yourself up a wall-jumping area and swinging to redirect your forward momentum (in the right direction). Boost areas also litter the map, and using a boost will make your character move considerably faster. Your boost gauge carries over even after death, so one technique I use it to save my boost for an ideal situation (ex: don't waste it if I am extremely far behind). All of the DLC's are for purely cosmetic - there are no differences between characters except for the movement animations. From what I've experienced, the online multiplayer community is both active and friendly.Overall, the game is fantastic for anyone who enjoys comedic, fun racing. It is currently a steam daily deal, and this price is honestly a steal - even if you were to treat it as a finished product with no future developer support.Strongly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

Early Access Review
IntroductionSpeedrunners is a brilliant, 2d, sidescrolling, racing game where you race against up to 3 players, locally or online in a battle of speed and wits. I used to dislike this game, until very recently when it was much less buggy and I got to understand the mechanics of the game. It is early-access, but a very good one at that. Continue reading, to learn more.GameplayYour goal in speedunners, is essentially to win the race. However, there aren't any laps, nor are there any special objectives. Instead, all of you have to do is be so far ahead of the rest of the racers, that they vanish off the screen. The race screen follows the leader, so it is key to stay close to the leader in order to stay alive. Once the opposing racers have hit the bounds of the screen, you as the leader win a round. Winning 3 rounds makes you the overall winner of the race. Sounds fairly easy? Well it would be, if this game didn't have items or grappling hooks.The grappling hook is one of the most useful and essential items in this game. It allows you to traverse terrain rapidly, or continue your momentum, which is key for this type of game. Any roof-like area with a white patch can be grappled at any time once your hook can hit it.Items complete this game, turning it from Need for Speed, to Mario Kart. A well timed shockwave can block enemy yellow grappling hooks, while an Invinci-Drill can bring a player from last place to the lead in a matter of seconds. The items give this game an important element of skill and timing. Wasting a valuable item can leave you open to attack from your opponents, and many times, it could be the last mistake you ever make as your opponent speeds his ways past you with a well timed grapple, into boost.There are also unique stage elements which make the gameplay vary. There are usually multiple paths to get to a destination, Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some paths may have a boost charger, but may trigger a lever that opens a path with item pickups. If you're careful enough you can dodge these levers, but it's not always possible.Momentum is a key mechanic in this game, which seperates newbies from pros. Learning the levels, as well as timing your grapples, boosts and jumps are essential to going through an area at top speed and leaving all the competition behind.There are many unlockables in the form of characters and outfits, as well as a rewarding levelling system. Fancy a more serious challenge? Head to ranked where the bravest challengers make their names known.VisualsThe visual style of this game is simplistic, yet effective. I especially love the visuals for super speed. The game really emphasizes the sense of speed you get after well timed jumps, grapples and boosts. However it's nothing mind-blowing, it's just neatly done.AudioI like the sounds in the game. The music is always upbeat and gives you a proper adrenaline rush especially in those clutch moments where you're neck and neck with your opponent. Summary & ConclusionSpeedrunners is turning out to be quite the impressive game. I normally don't recommend early-access games to people very quickly, however I must make an exception here, as right now this game has a lot already, and feels pretty well polished in all aspects.For a highly competitive, super fun, racing and parkour game, Speedrunners is defintely worth playing.8/10 Worth buying9/10 With friendsIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												This game is absolutely stellar.The game's strong point is the online multiplayer where you battle it out in what can best be described as a amalgymation of MarioKart, Sonic, and Smash Bros.  This is an excellent party game if you have friends over.The mechanics seem simple at first, but as you play through the game you'll realize that they are all intertwined in such a way that you can play in ways unimaginable to your newbie self.  You constantly encounter people who have mastered aspects of the game that you weren't even aware of.  There is virtually no limit to how good you can get.  The gameplay is a nonstop adrenaline rush as you vie to dominate the poor saps (or the no-lifer!) who got matched with you.  Knowing what I know now, I would gladly pay 10x the price for access to this experience.  Very entertaining, very addictive.  I foresee this game being a part of my cycle for decades to come.  13/10			"

								Not gonna lie, this is probably the most fun I've had in a multiplayer game in a long time. Nothing beats playing with three friends over the internet, and hearing their cries of despair as you hook them and drop bombs on them. There's a good amount of maps, different game variations, and now an xp system for you to unlock stuff as you progress through the game. There's also a story mode, if you're into that kinda thing. Overall, 8.5/10 would spend 80+ hours playing again.			"

								I read over and over and over that people give a game ""Addictive"" reviews. I try them and sure, they're fun, they get me hooked, but usually, after the first few hours (2 or 3 if I've made it that far into the game) i begin to get bored. This happens especially if the game is of a new genre to me. NOT THIS GAME. On average I play maybe... 3 or 4 hours of video games per week? I mention this to put the following into perspective... I bought this game, and precisely 48 hours after purchasing it, I already had 12.5 hours of gameplay in my record. This is the first time I've ever used the ""HIGHLY ADDICTIVE"" in any review for a game. I highly recommend it. It's fun, you can improve on how you play it, and the matchmaking is really sweet. You (generally) don't get stuck with amazingly good players. If you're in the US just dont play it during school hours (7am-1pm), you'll get matched to people outside your rank, and usually on the other side of the world, so the lag can be felt sometimes.			"

												Alright, SpeedRunners is a fast-paced racing game that looks nothing like (and plays nothing like) a normal racing game. It blends elements from platformers and other genres seamlessly... kind of.The game has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs, but it's been improved considerable since I first reviewed this game and it's a much closer to flawless.There's a lot of glitches that I originally complained about, and I think the dev's edits and fixes to them has been phenomenol and deserves it's own mention. There's still a few issues, mostly with lag, but that's hardly a fixable issue due to poor ISP's and everything.That being said, the game is still an amazing game. I would play this 24/7 if it didn't have it's road bumps (and, as you can see, I've still played it religiously). From what I've seen, the ""Story"" mode is mainly bug-free, and if you can't handle the lag from online players, you can always play with AI and friends in a custom lobby. There's a built-in  solution for every issue I have found, so in reality, by the end of this, a LOT of people might be saying ""SpeedRunners is an amazing game and you're wrong!"" and I'd agree, especially since it's much more tolerable than other games *cough* Monstrum *hacking*, and it runs at a very smooth framerate for a game of this size and quality (most games I can't play in a resolution above 800x600. This game I certainly can).Finally, I say buy this game for 3 main reasons: it has surpassed many MANY more games on the steam store, it's no longer Early Access, and it's an amazing game already. who wouldn't want to race their friends in a cartoon world of a guy in a unicorn suit, a cat, and a detective dog? I certainly do.			"

 SPEEDRUNNERS REVIEW   Speedrunners  is an extemely fun 4-player party game. The game has you racing your opponents through many different stages and your goal is to off-screen the other players to get a point. If you get 3 points in a match then you win.  Speedrunners  has extremely fast-paced gameplay that is so god damn fun, and is a game you have to play with friends to get the full enjoyment out of it, like Super Mario Kart, Mario Party, Super Smash Bros, etc. The game is a 2D platformer, so I'm going to instantly recommend the use of a controller, because the keyboard is way too annoying to use. Speedrunners  like many other party games, contains many different items that you can use to get the upperhand in a match. You get experience points from successfully using the items and you can level up to unlock more characters and skins for those characters. The game  does have a somewhat lack-luster soundtrack. With it as a whole, getting extremely repetitive at times. To be honest this is a flaw, but most of the time you will not notice this if you are talking to friends over Skype and when  things get really intense. Visually  the game is very simplistic. There are solid colors throughout the whole game, but it actually adds to the charm of the game in my opinion and doesn't detract from the overall experience of the game. This actually makes Speedrunners a perfect game for low-end rigs, so that is always a plus.  RUNNING AGAINST THE ONLY 3 FRIENDS YOU HAVE IN A SPEEDY WAY. 9.8/10  "

								Speedrunners, a game of reflexes and grapple hooking your friends.You really should get this game, honestly. It's definitely worth the friend rage. Also, the only issue I have right now would be the blast zone lines aren't transparent, which they should REALLY do. Analysis:Speedrunners is a game of running around a big map, grapple hooking your way to first place. Of course, it's only possible to grapple white ceilings, so the majority (unless allowed) of the map is going to be running, picking up item boxes, and trying to get to first place. What you have to do is make sure you keep on running til you can't. By that time you've hopefully won your first round. The game is in Early Access right now, but it's getting a lot better! The controls are also configurable and it's really best with a controller.The items while not that plentiful are actually really fun regardless. You have rockets to shoot at people, EMP blasts to destroy: grapples, golden grapples, boxes, and also rockets; invincibility shield drill which protects you from harm, golden grapples which hook onto the closest player in the direction you face, and 3 boxes.Speedrunners also has a nice twist to it where you can choose different modes to play. The most frustratingly fun has to be the mirrored track mode. Rapture just shoots rockets everywhere, lethal spikes, all X (X being either rockets or golden grapples last time I checked), and there may or may not be another I'm forgetting at the moment, but that's the fun of this game.tl;dr Speedrunners is a REALLY fun friend rage-inducing game that makes you want to keep trying to aim for the top, but also can be played casually enough for fun.I'd give this amazing Mario Kart-esque game a 9/10.

								This is a great side stroller type game. It's based around fast movement and tight controls, think of early SNES era games like Mario World.The game has a lot of potential, the only **major** thing currently holding it back is faulty netcode and lack of dedicated servers (currently P2P only).Hopefully this changes as the game grows, the only minor problem I had with the game is the camera can be a bit buggy. It doesn't always stay with where your character is.If it wasn't for the netcode issues I would give the game a 9 / 10, but It will have to settle for a 6/10 until this issue is resolved.			"

								SpeedRunners is an action platformer that pits you against your opponents in a 4 player race! The aim of the game is to outrun your opponents by forcing them to fall off-screen. There are also items, switches and a few other mechanics that assist in your run. There are various different maps to choose from, including a level editor that allows people to share and play custom levels.Let's start with the gameplay. SpeedRunners is very enjoyable to play, especially with a group of friends. You'll be racing each other for hours; running, dashing, sliding, grapling, and whatever you can do to retain your lead position. Although it is fun, the gameplay is a little bit repetitive with the same goal all the time. However, the level editor does nullify some of this repetitiveness, as well as the random wheel thing that rarely spawns and altars gameplay for that round.In terms of graphics, this is the main area where the game is being let down the most. The textures themselves are a solid effort, but the particle systems are lacking a lot. The game could use some more particle effects to polish it. Yes, it is still in Beta, and polishing is usually left till last, but it is still valid for the current version. I do hope they improve this when the game is out of Beta.Overall, a solid effort still in the works. I hope to see something spectatular with this when it is out of Beta. I cannot write a full review just yet, and the rating will have to wait.			"

Early Access Review
								For anyone that hasn't caught on, this is a racing game. You race either 3 other people or bots, depending on what you are doing, and gain points which go towards your rank and gain another set of points which goes towards your level. You have a couple of options when playing as you can play 'Ranked Match', 'Quick Match', 'Custom Match', 'Local Party' and finally 'Tutorial'. Ranked Match - The only (As far as I'm aware) mode where you gain points which go towards your rank but if you lose the match you will lose points based on their rank, if you won any of the possible games and so on. In this you also gain points which go to your level. You will be put with players based on a similar rank as you and if that's not possible you will then be placed with people on a rank lower or higher than yours by one and if that's not available then it will go to two ranks. In this mode you will also have Lethal Spikes where the spikes automatically kill you (This and Custom are the only modes which have this though Custom CAN have this if the Wheel of fate lands on it) Quick Match - In this, you wont gain points which go towards your rank but you will gain points for your level. You have the same system when it comes to placing you with people. Other than that there isn't much to this mode, though this mode is good for training on some of the basic skills or learning the basic maps. Custom Match - It's pretty obvious what this mode is about, though in this mode you can invite your friends to play with you instead of random people, you can also have bots in it and you can set their level of difficulty which ranges from easy to hard. In this mode you can also set up a wheel of fate this will mod your game or the current match/map depending on what the wheel of fate lands on. The options are called 'SpeedRapture' 'SuperSpeed' 'SpeedHookers' 'srennuRdeepS' 'No Items' 'Lethal Spikes' 'RocketRunners'Tutorial - You will play against bots who are set to the easy difficulty and along with that you will have text on the map which will tell you where to jump, slide, grapple and such. Local Party - Never really used this so I'm not going to go into this one.Also to add on, the wheel of fate has a chance of appearing in Quick Match and Ranked Match randomly. So i explained you the gamemodes other than one, so why did I recommend this game? Well, it has simple graphics, simple controls though they can take time to get used to (Recommended to not change them as it only gets complicated if you do and they are quite easy to get used to),  has some competitiveness though it depends on who you are playing with, and this game easily consumes time if you ever need to just waste your time away. Now I'm going to move onto the negatives of this game as I'm not gonna sugarcoat anything. Camera Angles, this is one of the most frustrating things especially on custom maps which I absolutely despise. You're in first running, but wait suddenly the camera angle glitches or changes and you can't see anything! What can you do? Blindly guess where the next grapple, powerup, boxes, spikes and ect are gonna be! As the camera usually focuses on the second player than the first which gives them a chance to catch up as you struggle to regain your speed. Another con of this game is the picking map system, you and two other players wanted Silo? Oh wait the fourth player picked Theme Park! SO we're going to play that!  This doesn't happen often but when it does, it's simply frustrating especially when the map they picked is one you hate. One of the big things is also not really the developers fault but it's the players. Say you got in a match and you start beating them there will be a guy or a girl who will get really mean and nasty to you, calling you noob, hacker, cheater and all sorts of things because they are mad that you are dominating. There is of course a mute button but do you really have time when you are mid way in a match? I don't think so.For anyone interested the levels does nothing for you other than give you new characters or different themes of the characters and also some powerups or some of the fate of wheel things? I never really paid attention so i can't say. You start at level 6 which gives you all the basic characters and their themes and you make your way up to level 24 which is currently the highest and the character which you get at that is a golden Unic.

Early Access Review
								As a silver leaguer with 282 hours logged, I feel that I can make this review both informed and fair. This is not a positive rating, fair notice.SpeedRunners is a game in which a stage is selected, and using speed and items you try to outrun your opponets. Easy to pick-up, quick tutorial, and will get you in a ranked match will players of your own skill level. This is done through a point system which is distributed by your position when only one person on the screen is left on the screen alive three times. Sounds easy and fun, right? Learning the controls and movements, sliding, bouncing off walls, grappling off ceilings. jumping are very easily learned. And Item knowledge comes at a very natural rate. The curve for player skill is impressive up until bronze, but that will be brought up later. Overall for, what I am calling, the first part the game is rather enjoyable with much motivation to continue to get better. And not to mention that you race against 3 other people. and you can set up various custom games and invite your friends to race along with you. Much fun, much merriment. Well geez, you're probably wondering, how is this a negative review when everything up until now has been so upbeat and balanced? That's just it, it's highschool and college roping you in with the concept of what their 'perfect' class should be. And we ALL know that it never is, and all you can do is pray that they don't do a complete 180 before you can change out of that class.Beginning of this game, great, fun, ignorant bliss. Get to bronze league and beyond, this game is a completely a different beast than the kitty you once knew. You'll see people that are at least 100 times better than you, and I can say this from personal experience. I bought a second account just to use as a smurf, so that I could train and be their equals and instead of coming in last place every game. But there are more bronze leaguers now so it may be a bit lighter than when I was first playing, but this leads to my next game killer. The God-Abhorrent-Game killing-Making me uninstall this game 4 times due to frustation lag. Did you knock the person off the screen and they are still going? Did you get hooked, but you were sliding (negates hook)? Did you hit someone with the 'cheese ball' but it went right through them? Did you place boxes down, but the opponet went right through them as well? Did you grapple on a platform and were sent flying in the opposite direction instead? Can you not hold the lead because your opponet is sooooo off the screen that they should have lost for 20 seconds now? If you have experienced any of these problems, you may be the victim of someone's (**Cough Lucas from Venmo/Pam Beesly looking directly at your laggy Butt**cough) lag. Call 1-800-Unresponsive Devs that will never fix these problems, quite literally. Why do you think I waited until I was silver league to review this game? So that my account/record would be sufficient enough so that it could withstand the straw man of ""They're working on it, or just give it a little time, or it will be fixed in the next update."" LOL XD, I joked about a possible theory that there were no true updates, and they just update bugs, and it seemed I was correct for the most part. Once R34 came out, that was when new  bugs were approaching!!! I noticed the opposite swing glitch, curl-up into ball glitch, and now a completely odd dead stop in air glitch on the map silo that wasn't even there before. I have given them plenty of time to address these bugs, and they have failed to give me any hope of restoration.(Not to mention of the 11 maps you can play in ranked SpeedRunners, 4 of them have been labeled as taboo by Bronze and upper classes for focusing on Randomly generated numbers=op items, and some that are just completely broken altogether. But no, let's change Theme Park again, k? K.)You will find good pings up till expert league, but bronze is where it starts to get iffy. Did I mention that to get to Bronze you need 6000 points, and for winning a game the highest point amount you recieve for beating your own rank is 30?!! I'm sorry am I at Chuckie Cheese, or playing a speed parkour video game? In Silver is the worst it can get, and that is where I am currently stuck at, and the motivation for writing this piece. The amount of people with bad pings at this level overtakes the good 8-1, matches aint fun. Especially at that difficulty and the need for pinpoint precision.I don't want to keep dragging on like I have done now, but I want to make a closing statement. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL A STATEMENT IS MADE REGARDING THIS GAME MOVING TO A SERVER. Oh did I forget to mention that too? My b. No server for your 10 bucks, p2p allllll the way. Hell, pardon my tongue, if you want to buy an outstanding title, get SHOVEL KNIGHT. 15 bucks, Retro throwback, no lag, original content for days, and amazing interactive gameplay.TLDR: This game is a poopy butt, does not get anywhere near close to a tenouttaten. I would rate it 7 asses and 5 guys outa ten. If you do not want to rage, torture yourself, or just generally like yourself DO NOT buy this game, ESPECIALLY early access. Thanks for reading, I appreciate it. Have a wonderful day! =)			"

												Best fast-paced, racing, multiplayer game I have played so far.I enjoyed every minute playing it, especially when played with friends.The community is awesome.Community maps are very well done and some of 'em are even playable in competitive.Some items will make you laugh your a** off when used properly - but sometimes they make you wanna smash your controller against the f*cking wall.10/10 would buy a new controller to keep playing.

												Speedrunners is a fast paced online parkour-platformer with 21 different characters.Nowadays its pretty difficult for beginners because there are very many good players which already played the game for hundreds of hours and there arent many new players.Four players have to try to shake off each other by running faster than the others.Items which you can grab:-Speedboost   (limited amout)-Hook   (to get one place ahead)-Bomb (slows the ones  behind you down)-droppable crates (slows the ones  behind you down)-Freeze way (freezes the ones in front or behind you for a short amount of time)-Shockwave (pushes everyone away from you)(great if you want to listen to music while youre playing a game because there arent any relevant sounds) :DRating: 10/10			"

												This game is literally all I play now. SpeedRunners is a multiplayer racing game with up to four players where you choose and unlock all sorts of comical characters to play as. Racing on foot has never been this fun. Wait, it's never been fun... Well, this Makes it fun! You can play this game both casually with friends, and competitively with anyone. Learning the physics of this game and it's crazy tricks raises the skill ceiling so much higher! You can play ranked with people of your skill level, or jump into a quick match and have just as much fun grappling and kicking off walls to your leisure. There's even a single player story mode, with unlockable comic book chapters! Not to mention, this game's soundtrack and art style makes it feel all the more like you're inside a comic book! While many players buy this game on sale and give up early, this game is most definitely not dead, and seeing its success and competitive scene, won't ever die. This game is simple fun for absolutely anyone! Grapple far and hit slopes hard, runners! This game is amazing, and I'd recommend it for anyone who likes any sort of platformer game!			"

												Updating my review in line with release to be much more comprehensive, I'm going to use the spoiler format thing again since if people just want a quick look at one aspect of a review it should be easier to find than a wall of text, there's bound to be a better format but meh, it will do.Rating: Look at my time it's kind of irrelevant what I say at this stage, right?Overview of gameplay: High speed elimination based race, up to 4 players compete to travel through maps as possible using a combination of a traditional double jump mechanic and a grappling hook mechanic. Game also has weapons which can be used to mess up your opponents.Some gameplay tags: Very Fast-paced, High skill cap, simple mechanics, repetetive, addictiveRecommended Audience (my opinion):1. Groups of friends looking for an easy game to pick up and have fun with (probably wont pass 30 hours gameplay if in this group)2. People who want a competetive multiplay platforming/racing experience3. Anyone (Seriously it's a damn good game, I'm far too lazy to write a review like this for most games :DPros:Easy to get into I highly recommend learning the game initially with friends who are also new to the game, the start of the game has alot of just learning maps and can be very rough unfortunately if you are not partnered with friends/other newbies, even a few hours could give someone a massively unfair advantage over a new player and hurt the experience for them.Very FunFast PacedHigh Skill CapLive Update: New content / bugfixes regularly implementedCustomisable graphics (Trails, characters and object mods)Not very resource intensivePro-active Developers  This is a very important point, the devs of this game are constantly looking for feedback and, while I might personally disagree with some of their choices and initiatives, I think they deserve massive praise for their approach to the development. They listen to the community and always try to look out both for the experienced players and the newer players.....I just happen not to be in sync with the community on several discussions hence the disagreements. Streaming and community content on front-page:  Not a big deal but just a nice touch, if you release a good video or guide you might be featured on the front page after the game opens and if you stream the game there is a tab which will show your league, your current viewers and give an easy link to your stream, just a nice little touchCons:Heavily repetetive:  It's basically a racing game with, imo, slightly mechanics and weapons, there's 35ish? tracks at the time of release that are curated or official and gameplay off of these is rare unless you personally go looking for itRanked System: (Due for an overhaul according to devs, will update this review if it is updated and improved)Extremely simple mechanics: This is both a pro and a con, on the one hand it makes the game much better for picking up and playing, on the other hand it often feels like levels are all played the same, the techniques used for speed rarely vary and weapons provide most the varietySpeed Cap: This won't affect your gameplay for a very long time after you start but if you go for long enough this becomes a big issue. You take routes or do tricks that should give more speed but still everyone ends up travelling the same speed making route variation pointless and suboptimal Other comments:Soundtrack is only ok, not necessarily a con but worth mentioningDoesn't handle latency amazingly well but vastly improved on this issue so no longer worthy of a con, I have no major issues even though I can't get wired net where I live.Player count is currently a bit low which prevents the implementation of certain gameplay refinements that I think the devs would like to put in but this shouldn't put you off buying the game, games are always available and community is (mostly) nice			"

												Great four player competitive platforming!Pros:-Lots of playable characters and skins-Secret characters-Easy to pick up really hard to master-Great for casual parties, and competitive playing as well-Fun items to help you and ruin your friendships-Every offical map is tagged, so you can see how hard it is-Level editor, workshop support-Theres a random workshop map option in ranked so you can play some curated workshop levels in that mode as well-You can enable fun effects in custom play-Online rank system-A rather short story mode with four difficulty options and unlockable comics-XP system wich unlocks stuff with progress-Twitch integration in the menu-Community events-Custom trail editorNeutral:-Trail shop, where you can buy trailsCons:-The game still has some issues and bugs, however the devs are really active and fix bugs with every patch-Even tough theres a ""tutorial"" in the game it hardly explains anything about the basic mechanics of the game.Its not a problem for casual players but if you want to play ranked beyond expert league you will have to look up some videos. Fortunetly the menu shows some great tutorial videos for these purposes.Overall this is a great game if you are looking for an online competitive oriented game. I wouldnt recommend it for the story mode because its really short and theres no real story to the game to be honest. Its definitely worth it for the countless hours you can play in online.			"

												SpeedRunners is one of the games that can be proud that it broke the early access curse and was fully released not too long ago. SpeedRunners at least in my eyes is one of the most fun games I've played in recent memory. The thrill of being in first and the feeling that you can't be stopped by your opponents is just purely amazing and I think everyone needs to experience it.In the story mode of SpeedRunners you play as Speedrunner and you try to become the best by overthrowing the other speedrunners. But enough about the story, let's get into the gameplay: The entire game is based on speed. You try to outrun all your opponents and the last one alive wins, win three times and you win the game. Anything goes, you can use weapons,grapling hooks, explosives and all sorts of stuff. Some stuff can backfire on you so be careful on how you use the power ups.The Graphics are awesome and I love the art style. Everything from animations, backgrounds and characters, everything looks amazing.The soundtrack at first, I liked, but it get's tiresome really fast and I just really prefer to either mute the game and put on something else or just don't wear headphones.The main campaign took me 1 hour to finish, and there is some replay value. You can go through the campaign more than a few times and unlock more stuff like maps and characters. I didn't encounter any issues while running this game and I highly doubt anyone will too, so you are good to go.Overall I don't have anything bad to say about SpeedRunners. It's an amazing game and I highly suggest you check it out and you will get sucked into it. Pros:+Great gameplay+Outstanding Art Style+Outstanding multiplayer Cons:-Incredibly short campaignFinal Rating:9/10If you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about it.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Speedrunners is a amazingly fun competitive game that's easy to pick up and hard to master. Offering great fun on a couch with friends as well as a intense competitive experience.Full Video Review:


YouTube™ Video: Speedrunners - Logic Review 

			Views: 1,285		

			SpeedRunners is a 4 player competitive racing, running, platformer developed by DoubleDutch Games. This is uploaded at 1440p (upscaled from 1080p) for best visual fidelity.		

Textual summary:The summary can never compare to the full video, so i always recommend watching that for the best possible impression of the title.First things first: The game is a TON of fun, which is as always, the most important part of a game. The fast paced and hectic nature coupled with the various items that throw a curve ball at the players means that it's unpredictable and a great way to spend time with friends.On the competitive side the various leagues are set up quite well and while the lower leagues might have some issues with smurfs, I've found them to be less of an issue than they appear. As with all competitive games, knowing the tracks and timing are often the most important part of a game and provide a barrier to entry to those new.Thankfully, the game offers a variety of ways to practice from Bot and Solo runs as well as non-ranked mode quick matches. All in all the game provides quite a few tools outside of the ranked play to both learn as well as enjoy the game.One criticism i have for the title is that it REALLY doesn't like you fiddling with alt-tab and options. while recording the review i experienced several crashes. Theses never occur during normal play, but it's still worth noting.Other than that i have nothing but the greatest of recommendations for this title. It's quick, easy to pick up and understand and a absolute BLAST to play.  "

Easy to Play, Hard to SpeedRunI received a key from the developers (tinyBuild). As with all reviews, my opinion is not affected by this.SpeedRunners is a simple and fun multiplayer game that presents itself with frustrating matchmaking, but incredibly fun mechanics and well-designed maps!Pros:Simple but complex mechanics and physics that all players can grasp and eventually master!Levels have a quantity = quality system where all of the levels perfectly adapt and use the mechanics.Items are fair and require a fair amount of strategy to properly use.Local Multiplayer is always fantastic!Decent Workshop tools!Runs on lower-end software!Nitpicks:The Ranking System is unfair and doesn’t count ranks by the number of wins/loses.The music is decent, but there aren’t as many tracks, making it all sound repetitive.Resolution should be configured at the start/before you open the game for the first time, because the window might be too large for you to adjust upon opening it.Cons:Single-Player content is ultimately lackluster.Matchmaking needs considerable improvement, as it struggles to find players your rank easily and will end up matching you with higher-leveled people. The ReviewSpeedRunners’ main hook is it’s emphasis on competitive skill. It emphasizes map memorization, a good understanding of the game’s momentum, and effectively using/dodging items in order to win. It stays as a comfortable party game while also being something that those seeking high-level play can pick up.

And this is what really makes SpeedRunners a really fun game to play. It’s mechanics are all well-built, with it being meticulously designed to be easy to pick-up but hard to master. Items can be used to get yourself an edge if you use it right, and the maps are designed so the multiple paths don’t always favor towards players picking the shortcut. The level design, while simple, is incredibly effective. And there’s a lot of these high-quality, well-designed maps in the game. It’s the case where Quantity = Quality.The game’s mainly built on its multiplayer, which is definitely good fun. When playing with friends locally, it was a blast, and almost no issues were had with the game’s overall performance. Online Play is a bit unstable, but still playable. For some reason, getting matched up with players your own skill is incredibly difficult, and this is when you’re not being matched with players two leagues above you and literally playing from the other half of the continent. Unfortunately, the game’s matchmaking is quite problematic, although it’s nothing that they can’t fix over-time.

Another problem I have with the game’s Ranked Play is it’s ranking system. It has the old Rocket League points system that I really hate where you’re almost eternally stuck to the bottom rank due to ranking up requiring such a high number of points.The game’s single-player content is sorta just there. There’s a story mode that’s really uninteresting unless you want to unlock in-game comics, but the bots are fairly well-designed for single-player and you’ll be able to practice alone if you wish. It’s a OK offering for a mainly multiplayer-only experience.The Custom Level Editor/Trail Editor are nice additions, and certainly help bring another side of the community together. For the most part, the tools presented are already good enough for players who want to design levels or make cosmetic trails, and this is apparent due to a lot of the Workshop maps being well-designed.The game’s presentation is relatively decent. The art-style is nice, but the UI is a bit messy. The game’s soundtrack is repetitive due to it being only a handful of in-game tracks, but it’s definitely well-composed and invokes the excitement that comes to the game’s matches.

It can run alright on lower-end hardware too, so you don’t have to break the bank to get it to work. However, I noticed considerable framedips on my lower-end laptop when playing it, and when the game got anywhere below 50 FPS, it was practically unplayable.For the most part despite the technical issues I’ve had with SpeedRunners, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game. There’s some real potential for a brand new competitive e-sport, but on it’s own, it’s fantastic fun with friends. If only the Online Multiplayer wasn’t quite the mess.TL;DR - SpeedRunners is a well-designed game that’s sure to take a spot at LAN Parties, despite it’s bad matchmaking and minimal single-player content.For more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!Be sure to check out the rest of my reviews for LOG on OpenCritic @ http://opencritic.com/outlet/380/lots-o-giveaways "

												This is a fantastic platformer racing game.  I invested in this game back when it was in early access and it was worth it even back then.  The multiplayer racing is really fun.  Since then they have also added new characters, new levels, new skins, and a singleplayer storymode which can be used to practice before you get into the PVP.  It's a good thing too because jumping right into online multiplayer can be discouraging since the people still playing this game are very talented.  All of the characters are pretty original and the short discourse before each race is just enough to give a good sense of each characters personality before racing to your/their death.  But the thing that makes this game is the fast paced grapling hooking, item throwing, boost using racing where you have to keep up with the fastest person otherwise you go boom.  It goes with a number of games which are easy to understand, but difficult to master (In a good way).  It's a lot of fun to play with friends and it makes for very exciting and intense multiplayer experiences.			"

								I've given up on this game. I first played during a free play weekend and was thrilled! So much fun! Then I got it in a Humble Bundle and the fun was already fading away.Even in the Entry League, players are very good and you have to know the levels very well to have a good chance. I made it twice into Beginner League, only to be demoted very soon after that. In almost every lobby there is someone who should be at least two leagues higher and wins the match with 3 wins and all others having zero. Balanced lobbies are very rare, I'd say one in twenty.And now that I started to know my way around the official levels, everyone is selecting workshop levels and the ""fun"" is starting all over again. The levels are so much harder and pure frustration for the ""Beginner"" I seem to be in this game.This is my biggest problem with this game: The difficulty curve is so steep, you can barely get better. If you get matched with better players, which is very likely when you start playing this game, you have almost no chance to get to know the level. And if you don't want to spend multiple hours per day to learn the levels in private lobbies, you're lost.When I play 10 games per day, only one or two are fun. The rest is frustration either due to much better players in my lobby that don't leave me any chance or workshop levels that are so much more difficult than the already difficult official levels that I spend most of the time waiting for the next round.It is a shame, because I really started to like this game. But it has changed so much that it became a source of frustration and anger, rather than enjoyment.P.S.: The community is basically the same. You do meet very nice people, helping you, explaining moves, levels, etc. But more often then that, you meet elitists that don't give a damn about you being a beginner and struggeling with the game.

AUDIOExcitingVISUALSimpleDIFFICULTYModerateVIBEIntenseCRAVINGFun with friendsON SALEOftenPROS: Great animation, balanced and intense gameplay. Easy to pick up and plays very comfortably on controller. Taught intuitively and very fun with friends. Has a series of story-related single player levels to get comfortable on. I see this being a multiplayer staple of mine for a very long time, rather than something that will be fun for a few weeks and then uninstalled for good.CONS: Lots of trash finds its way in the user-submitted levels. ""Youtuber packs"" will undoubtedly date itself. Many older levels have been memorized, exploited and gamed to the point of being impossible to enjoy with habitual players. Such is the existence of a racing game where the leading players control the speed.WORTH: If you don't have many friends on your list that own this, you may not have as much fun with it.OVERALL: Not many titles can say that they single-handedly revived a persons trust in the words ""Early Access.""SCORE:9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

								Speedrunners: Gotta go fastDo you like racing games like Mario Kart, 1950’s esque artwork, superheroes, well designed video games, and having fun? Well, my friend, then SpeedRunners is for you!Because it’s all of those things wrapped into one really well made package.SpeedRunners is a racing game, first and foremost. The setup being that various superheroes are racing to the scene of a crime, or emergency, and trying to beat each other there! At least that’s what I got out of it, the game is light on story; but it honestly doesn’t need it, the gameplay is what shines here. And boy, let me tell you, it really shines. This game is polished. It’s incredibly smooth, responsive, and just feels good. Like peeling the plastic off of a new cellphone.And surprisingly, SpeedRunners is an Early Access game! It’s still in Beta! I continuously find myself being shocked at just how good this game handles. It feels like a full fledged release, and I give the developers, DoubleDutch Games, credit because SpeedRunners is fantastic. This is in part because of the wonderful ‘track’ designs present here. A good racing game is crippled if it doesn’t have fun courses, which SpeedRunners delivers on. There are twelve or so levels, and only two that I dislike. That’s a pretty successful margin.Now, unlike any other racing game I have played, SpeedRunners involves… running! Who would have thought, right?And despite being a foot race, SpeedRunners maintains an excellent sense of speed. Four players all running at breakneck speeds trying to usurp each other. Throwing missiles, freeze-rays, hooks, and crates left and right hoping to trip each other up. The highs are high, and the lows are looooow. Being in first place, getting hit by a missile, tumbling around and ending up in last place-- and then dead-- is jarring. You’ll get mad at your friends. But when you do it, it’s oh so sweet.Each race is an elimination race where each ‘lap’ continues on until only one runner remains. Other players are eliminated by advancing far enough ahead that the edge of the screen touches someone. Then they explode, are out of the race, and the screen’s border progressively closes in until it’s just a tiny rectangle big enough for two players. This requires you to memorize the tracks very well, because at that point you’re almost literally playing blind.It gets real intense real fast.As with most multiplayer games, SpeedRunners is best with friends. But the game also offers some really, really, good bots that actually offer a decent challenge. And it has a very active multiplayer! I’ve never not found a game, which is great… Although I have occasionally run into some particularly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥y people… But it is the internet so that’s to be expected.I beat another player using the hook, this game’s equivalent of the ‘blue shell’, and he promptly told me in all caps to leave the game and engage in sexual congress with myself. I called him out on this, and he told me I was being rude for using the item. I proceeded to handle this situation quite poorly. But that’s another story!Internet antics aside, SpeedRunners is fantastic and certainly one of my favorite games of 2015. Even if it came out in 2013. 2013’s 2015 racing game of the year.SpeedRunners is just a joy to play. Even alone. And for $15 it’s a total steal. There is tons of content in this game, with like a billion different Runners and like ten skins for each one. They also have workshop support so that the community can create levels… Sadly I have only played a few workshop levels that even come close to the amazing quality of the developer courses.I will wholeheartedly recommend SpeedRunners to anyone looking for a cool local co-op game. Or, hell, anyone looking for a competitive racing game.It’s that good.Seriously, go buy it. These guys deserve the support.Like this review? Check out more at 100hoursave.com.			"

								Speedrunners is one of the most addicting games I've ever played and it's very rewarding when you spend time learning all of the tricks and strategies for each map. The game also has a ton of replayability since there are so many great user maps and you can always make your own if you'refeeling creative! I really hadn't played any videogames (consistantly) for several years and this one has kept me occupied for the past 22 months or so! Highly recommended to anyone that likes competetive games with some really cool mechanics! :)			"

								I'm enjoying this game so far.  As other reviews put it, it's like Mario Kart on foot, with the powerup-induced laughs and frustrations that brings.  I think it's reasonably well paced, once you work your way up the brisk learning curve: deaths are annoying, but I almost never felt like it was unearned.  Good twitch gameplay.The aesthetic of the game is fun too.  A good homage to lighter campy-style superhero cartoons, in visual and audio.It's still in beta, so it can have its bugs from time to time, and they may tweak the balance at some point.  But I had fun playing it, and you might too.			"

								tl:drScore: 7/10Pros:- smooth and colourful- easy to learn but challenging to master- cheap- still being improved- quick matches make sit easy to fit in schedulesCons:- lacks content still- will start to get repetitive- no real reason to play rankedSpeed runners is an indie developed, 2D sidescrolling, racing game that is fit for all ages due to its unique appearance, availability and 'quick to pick-up' controls. This combined with its fast paced gameplay and short game length allows it to be played anywhere and anytime (i myself am guilty of sneaking it in and about while doing homework and assignments,""just 1 more match!"") which can explain its overwhelmingly positive feedback even while it is still in 'Beta' development. Included with this gameplay is the intergration of the ranking system which involves the use of the leaderboard which tracks players in you league and how many points they have which allows the player to check their standings compared to others which allows for a competitive environment that increase the games longegevity and also seperates casual players to more serious ones.Speed runners appearance is fit for all ages due to its bright and bold colour palette which distinguishes the background from the runners that the players control, giving the game a 'quirky' and fun feeling. Its availability comes from its low price of 10 dollars while not on sale and 2 dollars while on sale which is a cheap price compared to most other games in the market that usually range from 15 to 25 dollars. Speed runners is also a 'quick to pick-up' game letting players get into the game faster and also making it less daunting for newer players to the genre. This combined with its cheap price and colourful appearance sets this game up for long-term success due to its wide target market and the fact that cartoons are better than realism long-term due to realism always being outdated while cartoons itself are a unique and personalize genre of presentation.Its rank system involves the use of leagues which are different groups that players are placed in due to their skill. Its uses a point system which is the way you rank up to a higher league in Speed Runners in which points are earned according to you succes in matches. However you may ask how they balance out the points lost or gained if you in a match with higher ranked people? Speed Runners makes it so that if your vsing a higher ranked person, the points you lose in the match are decreased and if you vsing a lower rank person, the points you lose are increased. This, combined with the quick matches that speed runners offer makes the ranking environment, friendly and less daunting for any player. There are the reasons why Speed Runners in my opinion is worthy of a 7/10 rating which can be improved through increased content, different styles of gameplay e.g. new gamemodes, perhaps a unique character customisation (might be going a bit too far xD) and general bug fixes which i strongly believe will be achieved when this game is out on full release (maybe not the character customization).

  (WARNING) First (serious) review of a game for me  Alright, this game is really great! Don't get me wrong when I say I dislike some aspects of it..The maps are innovative and require a lot of learning in order to be competetive. But learning the map and the game without friends playing with you in a custom game can be really hard when these semi-pro people just dunk you in few secs every time you queue in a non-custom game. Guess it can also be reviewed as a plus that its skill cap is really high. Almost rogue like, for some players.I might have over-exaggerated the 'pros' of the games you encounter solo, but the only way  I  truly enjoy this past the initial excitement (~1 hour in my case) is with real friends, not random people. Think it as a Super Smash Brawl game. Social fun is where this game is at.  As it is for the ranked system I can't say, it's not been available while I've been playing (during steam winter holiday sale 2014). I give it  4/5  ..for fulfilling the graphical and mechanic-wise aspect.  Having workshop availability where you can add your own created maps is also a plus increasing the amount of different maps available. Only reason I'm deducting one point  (NOTE, things might change as game leaves early access) is for shortness and how quickly it becomes repetitive. I'm missing the lack of different game modes. But with friends at equal skill levels it's one of the most enjoyable experiences on steam. That is, until you get all the achievements and play it till boredom without anything new to experience. Then it's time to switch game, and that can't be blamed on the game. Totally worth the minimalistic sum of money I had to spend for this game. Also one of those exceptions, when it comes to buying early access games for me.  Thank you for your attention.  "

But there are so many alternative ways where you can go to be faster. Good game to watch videos nextby. The Power-Ups are just amazing! The only thing that I dislike are the characters, which I think could look a bit cooler. Also I have some minor lags sometimes (once in an hour), which is quite weird, because my pc is a lot over the requirements.Cool local-co-up game! Wow that was a unorganised review. - 9/10 Riggy			"

								Despite a lot of the glitches and other variety of issues I've had with this game (if I or another person I'm playing with lags for a split second it's like game over with how badly everything will glitch across the screen/getting randomly stuck in walls/etc etc), it is an immense amount of fun and definitely worth the money. It's a ton more fun to play with other people, especially your friends. On the upside though, 8/10 friendship breaker next to Mario Kart.It's occasionally offputting with its updates on the maps, and usually the workshop levels have way more to be improved upon (for the most part they aren't worth playing in my opinion). Most of the changes on the maps so far are pretty good and add a bit more variety to the game play.Playing a lot of ranked doesn't feel like a chore, both due to just how the game runs and that the community is pretty laid back about the game as well.

												This is a fun, addicting game and (probably) a great local party experience.You will notice bugs once you get to a high rank but that would be several hundreds hours in.I would recommend since it is a good way to kill time quickly and has a insane amount of replayability.			"

												It's a side scrolling racer where the object isn't to finish laps ahead of your opponents, but instead only to get far enough ahead of your opponents to push them off the screen to their explosive death.  It's got a bronze/silver age comic book feel to the aesthetic.  It reminds me of the racing game included with Kirby Super Star.			"

												Ever since I tried the demo of this game I was hooked. No pun intended. I love the art style, the music, the speed. It's pretty intimidating at first but it gets easier the more you play. There is a tutorial and you can play against bots to get better. Pretty much everyone in the community that I've played against in MP were really cool and willing to ""show me the ropes"". This is a fantastic game and is super addictive. You've been warned lol. Get this game!			"

I bought it and im not regretting.AND ♥♥♥♥ THE GOLDEN HOOK!! URGH!!			"

								Very enjoyable game, great with friends! It's kind of like a racing game - but the twist is that it's 2D, and you control people instead of cars, and you get to shoot rockets, get powerups, that kind of thing! It sounds simple but it takes a while to get the hang of it, and knowing the map gives you a huge advantage in outsmarting your opponents, just like a race track there are side lanes (that are tricky to get to but can send you zooming past other people). I'm comparing it to car racing to give people a better idea, but then again it feels different and is a refreshing game to play! I'm playing with a controller and love it, they're still updating things and smoothing out bugs that I still encounter once in a while (mostly with multiplayer connection) but since I got the game it's seen substantial improvement and I'm looking forward to its release! Also thanks Tom for the hours of fun!			"

								Upsides:FastpacedEasy to catch onGreat musicGreat character lineupDownsides:Still buggy at times, accidentially clipping a wall, getting stuck on something, etcBad ranking. Game is supposed to choose players in a match based on nearby ranking, but a lot of the time you'll just end up as a beginner against advanced rank players, or an advanced rank versus entry rankers, ETC. This is very frustrating when you're expecting someone witha bout the same playtime hours as you.Overall, still worth the buy. Especially during a sale.			"

								I came into this game with low expectations, purely because my friend told me to get it without ever playing it. It was half off in the summer sale so I said why not. I prefer this game over ACU, ArmA 3, and other games I spent 60 dollars on, and I only spent 5 dollars here. I highly recommend this game to those of you who are competitive yet spirited. It's not too much money relative to a lot of other games on Steam, and it's a fun game where you can meet other people. As you rise through the leagues and ranks you become to know and race a tighter group. I've been playing this game for 6 months  and loved every second of it.			"

								What's SpeedRunners? SpeedRunners is a game that puts you in a foot race agasint two to four players.  This can range from CPU, Online And Local Players,  or if you're feeling risky adding them all into the mixture.  It gives you a range of characters to choose from and a DLC pack for all of you youtube gamer followers at a reasonable price.  Let's now talk gameplay.  Fast,  It's the only word to really describe it,  Yes that does sound overwhelming at first but that's what makes this game stand out.  You have to focus,  and it's not a button masher.  There are tips and tricks,  slides and more that you will need to look out for in order to make sure you are the last runner... running?  Upon that sometimes the normal levels can get a little bit boring,  but never worry as they have a workshop community where players and even you can make and submit your own levels and even download them to play in your game.  It never gets boring and is quite addictive.  8/10. :)			"

												Speedrunners is a fast-paced (obviously), two-dimensional, 4-player racing game with a surprisingly high skill cap and a good amount of progression.  Quick matches are around five minutes in length, which is quite a refreshing break from the 45-90 minute games of CS:GO so many of us are intent on playing every day.While it is fun, fast-paced, and cheap, it DOES have its issues...  The main mechanic of the game is a steadily decreasing screen size which bottlenecks the players' view of the map, where any player that falls out of frame is immediately killed.  The major problem is that in maps that are more vertical than horizontal, the camera does not know who to follow.  Oftentimes, players that are lower faze out a higher player or vice versa, entirely out of luck.Besides this and a few other issues (random deaths when getting too far ahead of your opponents, stuck in walls, etc), the game holds its weight fairly well for such a cheap title.  They NEED to implement a Group Queue option for ranked and quick play, though.  This game is far more fun to play with friends, and finding them in Ranked is difficult - particularly when they're a few ranks lower than you.			"

EDIT AS OF 20TH APRIL 2016Well, it's finally out. Hooray!And to sweeten the deal, owners of this game from Early Access automatically get No Time To Explain Remastered, if they don't already have it. :D=================================================================EDIT AS OF 6TH APRIL 2016I finally took a look back at this game due to it releasing out of Early Access 2 weeks from this edit, and I gotta say wow, they've really improved a lot since the last time I checked in (date in my edit below). There's new music (the old one was nice but repetitive after a while) and new sound effects, they've put the local party mode into the game, and there's going to be a story mode too!But the thing that I was clamouring for the most in my initial review? It's FINALLY HERE!If the game had any option for setting search parameters to half the world by default (or maybe even the whole world, since I never even saw that), that would be great.And indeed, to my joy, they did. They've now added the option to specify which region to search for matches. THANK YOU!Also, the character trail shop is now live. I think this works particularly well - none of the trails, as far as I know, improve your character, and are mainly for cosmetic effect, so this isn't pay to win. Another nifty idea to generate more revenue after this game's been bundled quite a lot of times already. (But, as reported[tinybuild.com], it has helped to boost the online community so well.)I'll leave my old review as it was, just note that it is partially (with respect to the matchmaking) outdated. I have however increased my EA rating, and this only makes this game much easier for me to recommend now.=================================================================EDIT AS OF 19TH AUGUST 2015 After changing Steam's download region, a method which enabled me to find online multiplayer matches in another game, I was able to join a match nearly-instantaneously. A VERY odd workaround - I shouldn't have to do this to even begin with, but at least I was finally able to find matches. ================================================================A fresh and vibrant concept that marries platforming and racing in an almost seamless manner.It took me a while to really try SpeedRunners, and that was on a whim after watching several Youtubers and Twitch streamers play the game. It seemed like really great fun to play with some friends, and it proved to be as such.Another gem published by tinyBuild games (wow, they're really starting to make a name for themselves in the world of publishing) and developed by DoubleDutch games (I checked, they are based in the Netherlands, hence their name...LOL), SpeedRunners tells the story of up to 4 superheroes all racing and sabotaging each other in order to get to crimes the fastest. (And yet, the funny thing is that every map is basically all the runners going in a loop without actually getting to a crime scene...)The game does seem like it needs more polish, despite the great concept here at play. Once in a while I get the occasional game crash, sometimes I find (oddly) that the game doesn't respond to my controls, there are a few weird bugs here and there where I am eliminated from a round a lot earlier than expected......but all these pale in comparison to the fact that online matchmaking for me is incredibly annoying and almost always fruitless. Being on the other side of the world as compared to most people doesn't really help, since the matchmaking starts from your continent, and only switches to half the world after an increase in 2 leagues. Seriously, how many leagues does this thing have? I actually searched up to 23 leagues in half the world once before I threw in the towel. I don't even know why I searched that high either - I'm a novice! If the game had any option for setting search parameters to half the world by default (or maybe even the whole world, since I never even saw that), that would be great. Refer to my edits at the top of this review.Otherwise, the core elements of this game are incredibly great. There are a wide variety of powerups to frustrate your opponents with and slow them down or pull them back. Not that many official maps but there is a theoretically infinite supply with in-built Steam Workshop support. If you can grab a few friends to play a few rounds of multiplayer, you're probably going to have a fun time. (Or you might end up becoming ex-friends with those friends. It can swing either way.)If you don't have any friends to play with, and/or cannot be bothered to play online with other people, you can actually practice your skills using bots. There's also a single player ""Origins"" mode where you have to reach a goal within a certain amount of time. This has been replaced with a new story mode where you race bots. Very decent alternatives that are adequately able to account for any lack of real life hoomanz.Now if only they will do something about the matchmaking, I could probably play this for a lot more time yet.When to buy The game has been bundled a few times; the cheapest it has gone is 75% off. Quite worth picking it up from these sources/at these prices, it's great. :)9.0/10This game was previously demoed on the Who's Gaming Now?! Twitch Channel[www.twitch.tv]. We regularly demo indie games on the channel, consider tossing us a follow. "

								SpeedRunners, I never thought I would enjoy this game until I actually played it. It's a high adrenaline game that always forces you to be thinking about what to do next.But this game has quite a few pros and cons.PROS:- Fun- Challenging but not too annoying- Unique Characters that aren't just a cosmetic upgrade, but are treated like a whole new person- Many ways to play, including a story mode.- The way the game is made, you can play it for a long time and it won't get old- The game is really rewarding when things start going your way.CONS:- Story mode can get a bit boring- After you have become a complete expert at the game and you don't have anyone to play with, you may want to use multiplayer, which can be laggy.- The running can get a bit repetitive after a long time.OVERALL:The game is really fun at the moment and is great, only dropped down by multiplayer and repetitivity. 8/10			"

Run, jump, swing around, and use devious weapons and pick-ups to knock opponents off-screen! One of the most competitive games you'll ever play.""  good description.  Has Bots too, who are very good players.  Side scroller with Comicbook looking graphics.  Hard to master.  Many maps.  Runs but was set odd on my screen.  The campaign game was a bit glichy, keyboard kept losing movement keys, has to restart map often. Has Steam achievements and trading cards, controller support.Played on Free Play weekend.

								SpeedRunners is a 4 player platforming game based in a city where there isn't much crime so the superheroes SpeedRunner, Unic, Cosmonaut Comrade, Hothead and Moonraker (more superheroes may be added after this review) must race towards the crime.I absolutely love this game, the controls are simple, the levels are beautiful, amazing community, the character design is simple yet great, the powerups are awesome and you don't need friends to enjoy this game even though it's a multiplayer game!I have spent hours on end just playing this game and finding people who love this game as much as I do and start trying to find who is the ultimate SpeedRunner or just try and run the map backwards.This game is ultimately worth my money and most likely yours. 10/10			"

 An Excellent Fast Paced Platformer!The concept of this game is very simple to grasp, outrun your opponents off the screen and don't get eliminated by falling behind. However for such a simple concept this game has a fair bit of depth with many levels to play through. What's more is that there are many levels that have been created by the community that you can play through the steam workshop, and you can create your own level if you wish and submit it too. This is a great game for playing with friends, as it caters for a fun and casual experience if you wish, or as my group discovered hours into playing the game, a very quiet experience where everyones concentration levels are through the rooof trying to time each and every jump,slide, grapple, and powerup perfectly. There are also modifiers to the rules available so that you can choose what weapons are available in your game.This game is a must buy as there are certainly many laughs to be had, and friendships to be destoyed (just like in mario kart) :D			"

								While Speedrunner started life as a successful flash-based browser game, having currently been played well over 8 million times, it gathered more attention when it was released on Xbox live Indie Games in the summer of 2011. Since then, it has been critically acclaimed for its tight controls and exhilarating local multiplayer mode, receiving high review scores and the Indie Game Magazine award for Best Xbox Live Indie Game of the Year 2011.Well, now it’s time for Speedrunner to take on PC’s biggest platform and prove itself as one of the best multiplayer platformers out there. Listening to feedback from players and critics, DoubleDutch Games have taken their time to improve the game by offering over twice as much content, an advanced leaderboards and matchmaking system and  a much-requested online multiplayer, allowing players to show off their grappling hook skills against friends and foes around the world.In short, SpeedRunners is a 4 player competitive platformer with grappling hooks, power-ups, and interactive environments. Run, jump, swing around, fire rockets, grapple onto people to knock them off screen to prove you are faster than them!			"

That took a lot out of the fun for me.Also the menu screens barely work and look very dodgy.Overall the game feels more like an early access or 2000-era flash game.			"

								Incredibly addicting fast paced racing game with a *huge* learning curve of tricks, jumps, and routes, with a colorful cast of characters. One of the few games capable of replacing my adrenalin addiction with natural adrenalin.Best played with a group of friends who are at the same skill level, but has a small but friendly online community and matchmaking system for when your friends rage-quit (expect to run into the same 8-10 people over several weeks).Easily the most fun I've ever had in the multiplayer game, and no matter how good you get, there's always someone better.Better yet, it runs great on Linux with Wine.

								Great fast-paced game. The use of power ups allows for even gameplay and has similarities to the Worms franchise, Mario Kart, and parkour related games.The most fun thing in this game is to be able to grapple yourself around on those white edges, and double jumping. Or what about jumping up those dotted walls? There's a lot of fun little features that will make you fall in love with this game.Would like more personalised characters instead of the preset ones, or just more colour variables on the existing ones.Best played with friends!

												SpeedRunners is one of the most fantastic small titles available on steam, as a multiplayer game it's one of the most fantastic around. The gameplay is extremely fun the overall concept is pretty different and it has a good amount of gimmicks to practise and learn to get an upper hand. It's very fun and I haven't had so much fun since that first night playing with a group of friends. Recently announced is a level editor too which will also be a fantastic edition to an already great game. High recommend.			"

								Fun multiplayer Speedrunning game for up to 4 players.  Gotta go fast like Sanic, right? Yep indeed you do!  It's a highly competitive game.If you play with people that are much higher rank than you, just do it.  Don't rage.  You will learn the tricks quite a LOT faster than you would playing with people the same rank as you!  With enough practise, you'll be ace.You may find that people say it's impossible to play with over 80 ping, but it IS possible!  You just need to time some things earlier & predict where they're going to be.Recent update made it harder to find lobbies (playing with 200 ping isn't that bad, come on).  It's when a ping is unstable which ruins the play.This screenshot was taken when the US/UK/Europe people would still be awake.


Broadening search to 169 leagues above or below your rank. 
A Screenshot of SpeedRunners
By: NoVa🌛




Change the Download Region in Steam to get around this. Or add ""+search_distance worldwide"" to the launch options.Fun fact about unstable pings:  The game is more likely to break, and can be quite hilarious sometimes.  See this video if you would like to get an idea of what I mean:

								A game simply amazing at what it does, running, and with immense speed. It raised my competitive spirit to an all-time high with the ranked online mode, which encourages you to beat other players of same skill, attain points, and rank up! Playing with friends is a blast and mostly just hilarious. I have barely touched the time trial-esque singleplayer mode, though, only because the multiplayer is just so fun to play and so difficult to put down. Just don't slam your controller at the screen because of the professionals that'll surely beat you everytime.                                                                           10/10			"

								This game would make Gabe get off the couch and start running.Okay, seriously now. This game is amazing, it actually is somehow addicting, I like it so much, it is fun when you play with friends. Especially when you encounter them in a league match and start beating them, ;). I don't find anything wrong with this game except for some bugs that you encounter rarely, I believe. I encountered some of them it wasn't really hard playing the game with them tho. There are two Downloadable Content packs.The 1st one is called 'YouTuber Pack 1'It contains the following characters;1) Markiplier2) Peanut Butter Gamer3) UberHaxorNova4) Jesse CoxThe 2nd one is obviously called 'YouTuber Pack 2'It contains the following characters;1) PewDiePie2) Strippin'3) CinammonToastKen4) DodgerIf you would like to have fun, get to know new friends etc. this game is good for that. So, conclusion;I fully recommend this game. It's pretty amazing, go ahead buy it and have fun with your friends!			"

BUT THEN! I tried a match...against living people! That is right! I'm telling you right now I went into a match with other humans behind their own computer screens. yes sir. and It was the funnest♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever experienced. Let me tell you something, There's a chance my username sound familiar. That's because I lurk /b/ and I'm in over half the beg threads. I DO NOT BUY MY OWN GAMES. I don't do it. If I can get something for free, you bet your jail-bait♥♥♥♥♥I'm going to get it for free. So you know this game is ♥♥♥♥ing excellent when I reach into my own torn up wallet, pull out my debit card, and buy a game for myself after only playing it a few hours.If you're on the fence about buying this, get it. 10/10 would get cheek blasted by veteran players again.

												Fast-paced racing game unlike any of you have seen before. Instead of cars, the game is a symbolic representation of how some gamers blast through a game without fully enjoying it. However, you actually enjoy it in this game! You play as one of numerous speed-bent characters with Steam-exclusive editions such as TF2's Scout and Payday 2's Wolf in a thriving array of maps as you race against other players and/or bots to eliminate your competitiors by getting them off of the screen while staying in the lead. There are numerous items and gameplay mechanics that can help you achieve that, such as a grappling hook, C4s, homing missles, freeze rays, wall-jumping, fireballs and more! The story is told through unlockable comics and each character has its own purpose in the game as well as multiple skins to stand out in the crowd. The game has a multiplayer mode, ranked mode, and allows you to easily play with your friends. The game is purely skill-based and while you can spend real-money, you can only acquire cosmetic speed trails that have no effect on your character's performance. If you are looking for a way to pass-time in a thrilling yet entertaining way, this is the game for you!			"

								A fast-paced racing game that tests your timing and skills, as SpeedRunners is very crazy (in an awesome way!). Got both Youtuber packs as I don't see much competition about them xD (they are all awesome in their own unique ways).What I think of the game so far is:PROS:- Get more DLC Character Packs! (I quite enjoyed buying them and putting it in the collection!)- Custom Games are good for training for future online games.- Origins makes a good decent Single Player Campaign.- Markiplier and PewDiePie. Need I say more???CONS:- Certain lag spikes happens at certain times.- No functionality on the pause menu on Origins.- Has a chance to crash when you want to even up the screen size.- Why is Strippin' wearing a princess outfit?! WHY?!? O_OI will update this once I discover more PROS and CONS.			"

												Speedrunners is a game that can build or destroy friendships. Mostly destroying tho.You can only become better by practicing and when everybody is good at the game, it's an amazing experience.Or you can annoy the f*ck out of your friends by playing way better than them. It's always fun when they rage and call you a hacker instead of admitting that you are way to good at the game. Aaah... nothing better than watching your friends suffer.			"

								Just a quick recommendation before this short review begins: play this with friends. Trust me. It's very fun.SpeedRunners is a very fast-paced fun little game which keeps you on your toes. There are 10 characters you can pick from so far, including a pink unicorn, a Soviet spaceman and a scout from a certain game (I'm looking at you, TF2).As it is still in early access, more characters and stages are likely to appear. And, if you can't wait long for new stages, build your own in the level editor. For $10, I'd say buying this would be worth the risk. "

								Sidescroller racing game, with really really intense gameplay. If you liked Super Meat Boy, or liked playing with the ninjarope in any worms title, you gonna love this.Are you leading? You just got hit by a giant rolling boulderLeading again? You trip on a barrel that you jumped over like a 100 times beforeLeading? Surprize freeze ray!Leading? Someone just grappled you to the last position.Again? Homing missile!This game is full of surprizes, and sudden changes. I got the game barely an our ago and I fell in love with it.Definitely worth buying a 4 pack for buddies.			"

								A frantic and fun co-op experience that is getting new features all the time. With all the workshop levels and new official ones still being developed, there is plenty to do. It's the type of game that would have been a star in any arcade it was in, and those kinds of games are right up my alley. Want to know more? Check out my In The Lab impressions video which was recorded for Geekenstein.com.

								(SPOILERS!!!!!! IT’S SUPER ADDICTING!!!!!!!!)Even though this game is early access this has to be one of the best indie games that I have ever played in my life. The controls are fantastic, the user created maps are great, and is a great game to play with friends. This game has hours and hours of replay value so it never feels old especially with all the maps that are out there in the steam workshop.My only complaint is that the match making system is pretty flawed and kind of broken, but it works.Overall this is a great game to buy and it is something that I think every gamer should give a try.Also I would recommend a xbox controller to play this with. 10/10 "

								At the time of writing, this game is still in early access so bear that in mind when considering the purchase if relevant!Speed Runners is an incredibly fun and competitive platforming racing game. Each match can have up to four players and throughout levels you can pick up power-ups to either gain an advantage or to screw others over by using the golden hook or by dropping a load of crates down in front of them. I love the art style personally and the levels are pretty well designed and the user created levels are equally as good! One problem that I do sometimes experience however is network problems, namely lag when I'm spectating a match after being eliminated but also whilst participating. But, it is to be expected as this is an Early Access title. To be honest you can't really go wrong especially for the price.			"

								This is a highly addictive game, with a simple, yet effective concept. It combines repetitivity with creativity and simplicity (I won't ity much, I promise) in such a way that I keep returning. Admittedly, when it comes to online play, I'm not very good, but I constantly strive to improve, and it is that which makes the game addicitive and how the combination mentioned above is so effective.EXTRA (23.06.14): With the inclusion of the 4 new characters, and with those the new animations, this game has gone from comic book style to comic book HD (that made sense in my head).I guess I'll finish this with a simple rundown. The basic review shenanigans.Graphic: 9/10Simple and clean, reflecting the comic book style.Sound: 8/10I wish there were more songs, but what there is is nicely made. Also, the female characters sound male when hit :/Length: n/aIt's a game about going as fast as you can. There's an origin mode, but it's mainly for online play.Fun: 10/10Addictive. After this, I'm off to play more XDTotal: 9/10, highly recommended.			"

												This game is a sorta mix of Mari Party meets Mario Kart meets nearly perfect platforming.Meaning that it will destroy friendships, ruin lives, make you rekindle them in the same moment, and the entire time you keep going ""just one more round""A game that on paper I thought wouldn't work but ended up being yet another great title that I played a ton of.

								SpeedRunners will put your fingers/thumbs to the edge in this fast pace coop/versus racing game. The controls are tight with both a keyboard and gamepad, the racetracks have a great design. The workshop makes this game have never ending amounts of content, now all you need are some people to play with and this game is golden. Whether you play this game in single player against bots, play with randoms online or play with friends you will have a good time. SpeedRunners is a must have if you want to play some games while friends are over, the couch coop in this a vastly supperior than some $60 AAA games I have played in recent memory. However nothing is perfect, the soundtrack to this game while catchy at first does become quite annoying, since it's pretty much the same song in a constant loop. It's nice that the developers let you disable the music. Graphics settings are a little disappointing, however this really isn't that big of an issue for a title like this since the game is pretty easy to run. Overall i'd say it's a good 8.0/10 if your only able to play by yourself or with randoms onlineWhen you play this game with friends you can easily bump the score up to a 9.4/10, it's that good			"

								It's fun, quick-paced action, simply to achieve a certain goal which is to win or wreck other players with mini power-ups. It's like Mario Kart on a 2D sidescroller game on just one main screen.I like how this is a quick-paced game where you can absolutely enjoy this with your friends (internet friends included) or your family.This is also a great game for killing time, having fun, or play serious as it has competitive ranked matches.So far, I haven't encountered any bugs, glitches or crashes. Will update this review after any update is released from this game.I do hope this can provide more seeing as they will also release this game as free to play but restricted access to online play.

								This is a seriously fun game. I got it while it was on sale and it's incredible. The gameplay is super smooth and everything works great together. The items are fun and fluid. This game is very easy to learn but very hard to master. One con is you can't watch other's matches in game. (In my knowlage) But watching good players on YouTube is very fun and you can learn a lot. This game has me hooked (hehe) I definetly recommend this game.			"

												People told me before I bought it that this game is a Mario Kart in 2D. They were totally right. I used to play a lot of Mario Kart Wii when I was younger and got better and better at it with each race I did. SpeedRunners works a lot in the same way. You'll pass through the same levels over and over again, but you'll always find a new technique to go faster or trick your opponents. With time, you'll get better and better, and after a few hundred hours, you'll be as skilled as the hundreds of other good players out there. All it takes is some practice.I love this game. It's so fun and interesting, especially the multiplayer. :3			"

								Before I begin, I want to say that I have watched this game develop hugely from the beginning of 2014.Now, SpeedRunners is a fast paced racing/platformer game which relys heavily on map memory. The game itself is simple, but trying to master it is another question. I've played just over 260 hours, which is a fair amount of time I assume, and have found that the game has developed amazinly since 2014 and quite frankly I am shocked how many people now play it. Whether it be through youtubers or humble bundle the SpeedRunners developers are very friendly. From hosting tournaments where the winner gets special perks in-game to creating a level designer to the game which adds so much more depth to the game. This game will always be one of those games where I go ""Gosh, don't you remember SpeedRunners. What a great game.""I love this game and will keep playing for a long time.			"

												This is another one of my favorite games of all time and I have been playing it since the xbox 360 days. Destroying your friends has never been more satisfying. Also has a friendly community, (not at all toxic) which is a nice change from LoL. With its' full release the game has never been in a better state and I love all the new features it has brought to the table. Would recommend this game to anyone even if this isn't near their taste of gaming. Also all of the workshop content that users make keeps the game very fresh because original maps can get old eventually. Personal rating has to be 9/10 for its' amount of fresh content, trail making, fair pricing, the amount of fun with friends, and replay-ability the game has. (Speedrunners 2, please?!?) Love the game guy!			"

												Originally bought SpeedRunners on sale for the Payday 2 collaboration masks. Skeptical at first, I decided to play it and now I have barely played Payday 2 since.SpeedRunners is a fantastic side scrolling 2-D racer, in which practice and strategy are key to keeping up. You have to push the limits of speed and discover unique ways to use the course to your advantage. If you watch high ranked players on live stream, holy crap. The focus and determination is incredible. SpeedRunners community is pretty chill and it's fun working on skills and showing them off against people.One of my favorite games and will continue to come back to it.			"

								Ahh. Speedrunners: the death of us all or as I like to call it, The Friendship Destroyer. Introduction and anecdotes!Yes, that's right this game is overwhelmingly competitive and would spark rage into your opponents as you all battle it out on 13 official maps and a variety of workshop maps that are being made everyday by the community via their very own level editor! What do you mean, ""the friendship destroyer""?Well then my friend, let's just say that continuously blowing them up with rockets and bombs (two of the many item pick ups in the game) didn't really appeal to them as much... Turns out they must've un-installed the game or something... Shame really I would've loved to hear the sweet sound of keyboard smashing :( But in all seriousness, this game is fun, exciting and unpredictable. Full of intense 1 on 1 situations as the death border comes closing in on you and your rivals masking the map behind it relying on your knowledge of the map to guide your superhero player in the right direction...Speedrunners is a very easy game to get into..... or should I say, get addicted to; wanting to win just one more game or to just get that final few points to rank up to the next league it's definitely hours worth spending...When you first open speedrunnersThe game puts you straight into a tutorial as soon as you load it in teaching you the basics of speedrunners and the controls you're using to jump, slide and swing and all the other jazz such as using your pick-ups... This means that new players will pick up the game quickly and will be soon off to get to their dream league...How long I've been playing and what to expect from ranked:I've been playing for at least 74 hours now (in total aha, as addicting as this game is I don't think I'd do 74 hours in one session :P) and I've managed to get up to expert league and I'm in the top 10 in getting to the bronze league... Which is harder than you'd think... The higher league you go the more advanced players will be and the more skilled they will be too. More experienced players would know the best routes and would be quick on their feet to secure their wins using all tactics built up from previous experiences and knowledge built up over time.This amps up the competitiveness of the game and draws you in. Tips, tricks and routes:As you do this, you tend to pick up on some of the tricks other advanced players use and you'll notice tips such as saving your boost and being sure to hit those angle blocks to gain more momentum and speed.. It will be vital that you learn new routes too for the individual maps as going certain routes will be faster than others and some may be more advantageous than others too such as getting into the VIP Area on Nightclub, A tricky route to learn at first (how to get there) but getting there or not can be a great game changer and would definitely score you some easy rounds IF your opponents don't manage to get there.AdditionalThe artwork/visuals and mechanics of the game are very good and look very pretty (you won't get bored of it too easily is what I mean) and it's being updated constantly; this includes layouts, new characters being added and even secret characters which you'd have to do some digging around to find out how to get them ;) and many more. The animations for all the characters are great and are unique to suit their design and style and they are all fun to play with. Some characters have different skins such as the main Speedrunner can be blue, white, yellow or black for example so you can personalise your favourite characters to suit you..ConclusionI would totally recommend this game for anybody who is competitive and/or wants to have heaps of fun in one single session. There are a few bugs scattered around the place which is reasonable for an early access game but with an amazing community and an active team they're being fixed regularly thanks to the wonderful community reporting them and requesting ideas or changes to the game that are always considered by the developers to make the game ready for launch.And for a game only worth £6.99 It's definitely worth it!OutroThank you for taking the time to read through my horribly structured reviewIf you would like to play sometime then don't be shy to add my steam and let me know you came from this review! :)-Syrunner (/Cloaker is MINE!)

												Looking at my profile, at 25.09.2016 1:30 o'clock (<- night) German TimeClicking on the review menu on my profile and looking at the date for the review:Posted: 26 Sep, 2014 @ 12:15pm	Updated (Nr 1): 26 Nov, 2015 @ 7:09pmThis clearly needs a new review, I thought.Well, it's original review was about 2 years ago and the fresh one was about 1 year ago.Time to post a new, that have said everything about it, but is also short, review:This game is great. And the devs (and everyone else involved) behind it are awesome.			"

								The game is really nice and the community around it is very active.You can have some fun (with online and offline multiplayer)You can unlock stuff (with the built-in XP system)You can be competitive (with Ranked matches)You can be creative (with the Map Maker)The community even bring up events sometimes (like tournaments, challenges and other stuff)If you keep in mind that the game is in Early Access and you don't mind the bugs you can encounter the game will bring you many hours of fun for you and for your friends (did I tell you that this game is great for parties?)

								Crime-fighting.  Its a difficult job.  In the world of ""Speedrunners"" its difficult for reasons you might not have considered.  What would happen in a world where Superheroes were as prolific as those with an AA in business?  Where only the hungry and competitive get to be employed for their unique anti-villain skillsets, while the rest are relegated to fry cook duty at the local deep fry eatery.  Speedrunners casts you as a fledgling costumed vigilante desperate to break onto the scene as 'This City's #1 Hero!""  The catch?  You are not the only one.  Thus, we come to the core of the game, which is not actually fighting crime at all; rather, its a mad dash to beat your fellow would-be champions of justice to the scene of the crime, by any means necessary.  What does this translate to?  A Mario-Kart-esque footrace across rooftops, through buildings, and any other place you could seemingly run at semi-full bore.  Players (up to 4 of them) pick their hero of choice from a multitude of excellent original characters (and YouTube personalities!), and then beat feet (and each other), picking up power ups, swinging on grappling hooks, and tripping each other as they attempt to leave their opponents in the dust.  The action is quite simple.  Heroes run in a repeating/looping level, attempting to have their opponents leave the shared screen by being outpaced.  This is accomplished with the help of numerous tools.  Players may find themselves in possession of seeker rockets to sling at opponents, remote mines, drop-able crates, and Scorpion-esque ranged grappling devices, just to name a few of the tools available.  Players are able to double jump and wall jump, as well as deploy grappling hooks to avoid obstacles (with mechanics similar to the ninja rope from Worms Armageddon). You can even build speed by manipulating gravity and centrifugal force with well-place grapples.  Once the first opponent is knocked out (by meeting an untimely end at the edge of the screen as the rest of the dynamic do-gooders race on), things really begin to heat up.  The music changes, and the edges of the screen shrink, giving the remaining players less and less room to maneuver.  This can continue to a point where skilled players continue their parkour punchfest in a screen roughly 1/3 the size of normal.  Last man standing wins the round; first to 3 wins takes the match.  Sounds delightfully simple doesn't it?  And you'd be right to think so, given the initial smattering of levels from developer tinyBuild.  The game features Steam Workshop support, and the level of complexity in some of the user generated levels can really ramp up the difficulty when it comes to twitch reactions and puzzling out the fastest, most appropriate route.  The game sports competitive multiplayer, as well as local and online play.  You may play with a keyboard or controller (the latter being this authors preference).  Having said all that, I offer you this review and endorsement with full disclosure.  Having played this game at length with people of varying skill levels, bear the following disclaimers in mind:- There is a bit of a learning curve here, particularly in the competitive scene.  Its ok to fail, as long as its still fun, right?- This game is in Early Access.  Its not perfect, but it is pretty darn good.- Furniture and peripherals may be at risk during gameplay.  Specifically, gamepads and keyboards may experience stress fractures during tense matches, or become heavily moistened by an abundance of palm perspiration.  Furniture, on the other hand, may become damaged due to severe body contractions, particularly during close matches.  To elaborate, whilst racing you may experience ""butt fist,"" a tensing ones backside that may result in loss of underwear and damage to ones gaming chair.If I haven't scared you off with the potential dangers above, Speedrunners is a no-brainer buy.  So, what are you waiting for?  Break out your spandex, knee-high lace boots, and cape, and prepare to race..... FOR JUSTICE!!!!!!Stop by and see our other reviews at:http://www.dustimusprime.com/ "

												This game has really nice fast paced gameplay and something MANY games lack and that would be local multiplayer. This game is beyond fantastic when playing with friends to pass some time. I often play it on the train with a friend of mine to pass the two hours.And even though this review so far seems positive, that only applies to the local MP and VERY few online matches.This game is overflowing with cancerous smurfers who abuse every single glitch, bug to just steam roll you. When you come into this game you're a legitimate entry or beginner league. So are those idiots who need to compensate something and take it out on new players. All of them either make new accounts solely to buy the game or de-rank in ranked by just letting everyone beat you.The end result is you (newbie) getting paired up with up to 3 pixel perfect virgins who do absolutely nothing but play the game from the looks of it. You'll know it when you see it for yourself.But as I said at the start:This game IS fun if you have friends (People you actually know IRL) to play with. I would have made this review positive but it's more likely that anyone who gets the game will go play a random game online than a game with their friends and that is why I can't recommend this game.If you're looking for local MP, feel free to get it. (I honestly waited for a sale because I kind of knew what I was going into with the Online and I suggest you do too but it's your money.)			"

								Played SpeedRunners for a free weekend, out of the 2 days I played, I spent about 5 hours. I love the game, it's addicting, and fun, fast paced, and keeps you moving. Great graphics, gameplay, music and sound effects, and the controls are great, even using a keyboard, although a controller would probably work better. My only issue, and this is a big flaw, finding a game online, sometimes you will sit in the lobby for up to 25 minutes. Other then that, this is a must buy!			"

												This is one of the best and most addictive indie games, ever. It's a very unique game as it combines three quite different genres -  racing, platforming and grappling (if that counts). It is playable in single-player with its campaign and the option to play against the CPU but it's definitely more enjoyable playing with friends. With its DLC, you can even play as famous YouTubers such as PewDiePie and Markiplier. There are also a wide variety of maps and modifiers to choose from to spice things up. In addition, the Steam Workshop allows players to race on heaps of community-created stages or even create your own. Overall, it's a great, competitive game that you can play with friends.			"

								I'm really loving the game so far, and at this price could already recommend it to anyone.Edit (19-9-15): As of the last update, most of my concerns aren't valid anymore. Though I haven't had the chance to play a lot, I noticed a variety of music tracks got added, and the game hasn't crashed since. The only issue I still have with the game is the fact that it can at times be hard to find a match, especially during off-hours. Hopefully this will improve in the future. Other than that, it's still a great game.Positive:-a lot of fun, and fairly original gameplay-a lot of variety in characters, though this doesn't really affect gameplay (which I suppose is yet another good thing)-the game seems quite polished in the sense that most things seem to work as intended, and there are a lot of things that make you go 'oh yeah, good idea' while playing (though, of course, I can't think of any now)-multiplayer works rather well, though it can take a minute to find a game, which I'm guessing will improve as the player base grows-ranked matches-pretty cool community so far. Seen some rage quits, but no proper moaning/swearing as of now-community made content (just maps as far as I can tell, but who knows)Negave:-the game occasionally crashes for me (haven't yet looked up whether more people have this, but I'm guessing they do). This doesn't happen frequently enough to be a major issue, as restarting and loading the game doesn't take much, but it still sucks when you happen to be in a ranked match or with a nice bunch of people-the music gets rather repetitive, which isn't that big a deal. It would be nice if the music selection had some more variety at some pointAll considered, I'd really recommend it to anyone who enjoys the idea of a side-scrolling racer (runner...) which had me actually laughing out loud at times.

								Okay... gue edit lagi dengan menggunakan bahasa Indonesia.SKOR: 9 dari 10.Wait, serius lo Wing?Kesan pertama: ini adalah game platformer tentang balap lari. So, lo dengan 3 orang lo berlomba lari menuju.... nope, tidak ada garis finish. Menariknya adalah ada buanya tantangan disetiap map, mulai dari duri, jurang, angin, dan sebagainya. Belum lagi kalau player lain memberikan roket, menarik lo, atau mengebom lo. Iya, ini semacam lomba lari tetapi juga survival. Grafik: Kartun sederhana. Bukan berarti sederhana lalu jelek. Justru game seperti ini sebaiknya memang pantas dengan grafik kartun yang sederhana. Tujuannya adalah agar bisa dimainkan disemua tipe PC. Walau pun begitu, Dev nya termasuk Dev yang rajin dan terus mengembangkan animasi dan berbagai macam bug yang ada di game.Gameplay: ADDICTED! Serius game ini itu bener bener dibuat untuk main bareng dengan temen lo. Bayangin lo dan 3 orang temen lo saling tarik menarik, saling membuang roket, atau saling meledakan bom sambil berlari menuju lingkarang yang gak ada batasnya. Eh siapa bilang gampang? Justru dalam waktu kurang dari 1 menit lo tau tau berada dipaling belakang, keluar dari 'layar' dan akhirnya kalah. Game ini mungkin waktu pertama kali agak susah untuk dimainkan, tapi semakin lama lo memainkan, lo semakin teradaptasi dengan map nya, senjatanya, turbo, dan berbagai macam rintangan lain.Storyline: Biasa aja. Story line disini menurut gue bagaikan practice ground. Jadi sebelum lo head-to-head dengan teman lo, ada baiknya lo memainkan story line sendiri agar 'lenjeh' dengan gerakan gerakan yang ada didalam game. Gue berani kasih skor 9 dari 10.Kenapa? karena developernya rajin update, gameplaynya addictive, grafiknya sederhana tapi menarik, dan terdapat steamwork sehingga lo gak bosan untuk memainkannya lagi dan lagi.

												A good concept with decent game play. I don't think it's worth it's stated price but it's still in early access. Time will only tell! My hope is that they add some mini-game functions or attempt to play with the rules of the game. (This game is local co-op)!Speed Runners is a game about running the fastest, being first while leaving your enemies in the dust. By being last, you risk the chance of being eliminated by being off the edge of the screen. The gameplay itself for the moment is decently good but has a lot -First player controls the pace and controls the camera. Take the long route or risk grabbing a pick-up may cost you a life. The scoring system as of current requires three wins. This means you need to win three times in order to take the game. You do not need to win consecutively to win the game. There are about a handful of characters to choose from at the moment. Some characters are available to unlock while others are DLC's. All character designs are quite unique and all move differently from one another. I haven't noticed any significant diversity in speed between the characters. More or less, all characters seem to jump just as high as one another and move as fast as one another. Is this a good thing? Depends. It offers a level playing field for everyone but mixing up the game is never a bad idea. One person may prefer speed while another may prefer brawn. The only issue I have so far is that players are not able to melee or hit one another without a power up. Sure, this may be good as people aren't whacking one another always but some players I have played with mentioned that a melee addition would make it more engaging. Nonetheless, the game is still enjoyable and power ups provide a great addition to the game. Some of the power ups included are a grappling hook to grab the nearest opponent that pulls them back and you forward, boxes that opponents can run into, a force ball that completely slows and pushes opponents and a homing rocket missile (just to name a few). Levels themselves are quite challenging and take a bit of time to get used to and really good at. It is a bit overwhelming at first playing online and getting completely smoked by veteran players. If one's really persistent on getting good, it does take a little grinding to familiarize yourself with the level design. Visuals are quite simple and suit the games needs. It's not over the edge 3D but the graphics do fit the atmosphere. I wouldn't mind seeing a little more done in regards to animations or things happening in the background. Heck, why not have players influence some of the backgrounds/graphics. Why not even have them alter the stage? This is possible to a certain extent as levers are present throughout levels. These levers open and close paths and definitely add some more interest to the game. Sounds are pretty decent at this point and aren't extremely varied character to character. Dialogue is slightly different but wouldn't hurt to add a few more sounds to the voices. Overall, not a bad game in it's current form. There is a lot of opportunity here to take the game beyond being a simple linear running game. Although be it so, there's some serious fun to have online or between your buddies. I'm really, really, really hoping they add some mini-games or some more diversity into the game. They got a nice engine, let's do more with it!Indie Rating : 7.6/10EARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.95/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  C+PS - Why can't you take in-game screenshots with F12?

								People in other reviews say that it is like Mario Karts with legs, and they'd be right, when you're low skill.Now this isn't to insult anyone who's new to playing the game, but when you've learnt all the mechanics, unlike mario karts there is a way to counter every single item you come across, only sometimes would you need another item to counter. Also unlike mario karts, items are not the largest part about it. There are 4 things that make you go fast 1: those boats that give you boost which you can use at any time 2: the bubbles that are in some parts of levels 3: If you have alot of velocity downward and you grapple you get alot of horizontal velocity 4: Same applies with number 3 but with slopes(stairs included) that are in the level.3 & 4 is where I say that high-skilled players are separated from the low-skill that makes it unlike mario karts. Because most people who are new to the game don't know this(you should probably add it somewhere in the tutorial devs, or choose a different level that demonstrates these 2 well).  Anyways, these 2 important mechanics are what most of the useful tricks in speedrunners are basically derived from, it basicallys makes up the speed in speedrunners. Its these 2 mechanics that make it fairly different from mario kart, because in mario kart, without the items its basically who knows the map's parts and who's learned which kart is best to use and how to do the turns well(which isn't very in depth).That's what I wanted to say about how this game is not mario karts. This game is extremely fun and very competitive. I've been playing it for at least a few hours every day. I've put 229.5 hours into this game, just the last 2 weeks I've put 21.9 hours(which is more than what other people writing these reviews as of now have even ever played).Sometimes speedrunners is buggy, and perhaps it could use some more maps, but this game is top-notch, no doubt about it.the characters also amuse me. 10/10.

Started it to get the Steamcards and was bored enough to try it meanwhile... and got hooked. Played through the whole single player-part and had a blast failing hard in multiplayer. Absolutely worth a try - also for people normally not into this kind of games (In that case get it when u find it for a really nice price).The 2 missing Kittens are angry on the following points:- no real Tutorial- to long waiting for not rated matchesHope they will fix this before release and throw in some catnip - so the 2 can come back.

It should be changed back to how it was.The maps have changed and are now easier. I understand that you're trying to make it more appealing for new players but the whole idea is to play, learn the maps and improve. Not have it easy from the start.I love this game.			"

								I really enjoy the game, yet I think the presentation and overall DESIGN (not the gameplay) is somewhat unpolished. The music is excellent and uplifting, yet I'd prefer at least 10 more tracks to the overall package.Right now, the design, personally, it feels more of a potpourri of singular good choices, that however don't really want to fit together as a whole:-> The stage design is very ""clean"" and sterile of some sort, yet the characters and overall design is aimed to be quirky?-> The music ranges from upbeat funk to Ska (please add more ;D!) and fits the quirky design, yet clashes with the sterile stage design, and even with some meaner looking characters-> the red ""borders"" when one player died are just ugly to look at - how about some fire animation of some sort, to actually ""see"" the danger?-> character design is highly (!) uneven in quality and ""charme""-> German translation is amateurish. It seems like somebody posted the stuff on google translate. And I'm not even kidding. English wordplay and puns are translated 1:1 and is REALLY wonky in german.-> I'd like to see instant emoticons or ""taunts"" in gameplay. Just add another button ingame for ""well done"" ""haha"" or ""lucker!"" :D Chatting while playing is nearly impossible - so why not allow ingame-taunting and ingame-feedback :)The gameplay however is very much fun, and I recommend you playing it! :o)Right now, in Beta R44 : 8/10 (With high potential up!)

								Really fun + awesome game! :) If your into fast-paced platfomers with action then this is the game for you! :) SpeedRunners (the name kinda gives it away) you have gotta go fast (sonic reference intended) but really, you do. If you fall behind (go off the screen as it is constantly scrolling as you run) then you will be elminated (first to win 3 games). Think its that easy to keep ahead of the pack? not necessiarly as the items may change who wins, you have items that can give you a boost (Blue rocket) and items you can throw at your opponents to get them to the back of the pack (golden hook is known for doing this and rockets can help too) there are many items in the game and they are all are great in their own way :). Many maps to choose from both Dev created and community created and many characters to choose from also (if you put /gangbeast in superchat you get to play as him in game in any colour) you can do this with the payday 2 chraracters too just by putting /Payday2  character so you can play as one of them e.g. /cloaker /wolf. The game is still in beta/early access so you can expect updates to this game (one was character commands and this new XP system) which is cool :). You may encounter some glitches but beta + very rare that i find them to be honest. The game has online and local play so this game is great for couch play too and online play :) the community is a mix really as you can get poor losers XD and players who are lke ""fair play gg"" but again, rare you'll see poor losers so don't let that put you off + bots are in this game too along with a single player origins story mode. With many modes to choose from (like ranked where you progress leagues) and custom match where you choose the rules (one being this wheel that decides your fate) you will be coming back to this game quite a lot as it is a lot of fun :) if you see it in sale or at full price (£7) its defo worth it as it also supports the devs! :) (check out the demo if your un-sure about it though :))			"

								This game is so much fun. The premise is simple, don't get left behind and be the last left running to win. As other reviews have pointed out it is a lot like Mario Kart in that you pickup weapons along the way that you can use to get ahead of your oppoents, except it's a side scroller with levels that can twist and turn and be as dangerous as the other players!It's still in Early Access so there are still some bugs but hopefully these should be ironed out for when it's released officially :)If you enjoy Mario Kart, side scrollers and like to play with friends, this is definitely a game for you.

												This game's controls are a little odd but they can be adjusted. The graphics are subpar and the character selection is massive and unique. When it comes to what you can do with them or how different they are from each other, it's another story. There's no special abilities or features that would convince you to play as someone else; this makes for close competition with no one person having an advantage, which can be viewed as good or bad.SpeedRunners does offer lots of gameplayer, as it boasts both an un-interesting but none the less existent singleplayer and a plentiful intense online. Simply put, SpeedRunners is an interesting spin to the racing/parkour scene with little variety, unique graphics, extreme competition, and character differences (mechanics wise) so non-existent that they're sure to make you quickly unenthuastic about their large roster.As you can tell, I have mixed reviews about SpeedRunners. If you have some money lying around and you're looking for a competitive game to play with friends, get it. But if you're looking for singleplayer content, or unique artwork, or character variety, don't get this.			"

And its constantly expanding and adding new stages, so its only going to get better!Its at the moment a little trickier to get into a group joined game than it probably should be, but once you get going its a blast.  All the weapons and hairpin turns and shortcuts, it has all the qualities that make Mario Kart such endless fun.			"

								Speedrunners is easily one of my favorite multiplayer games. Think 'Mario Kart if it was a platformer' or 'Smash Bros if it was a racing game'. The gameplay is super addictive once you get a handle on the controls (supposedly it's easier with a gamepad/controller, but I like the keyboard controls fine), and the community is pretty nice for the most part. My advice for new players would be to try out the origins mode in addition to the tutorial: it allows for instruction/practice on individual game mechanics as well giving some backstory on the game (even if it's pretty basic).The workshop is super cool too. It's really interesting getting to see the creative and challenging level designs made by other players.			"

												Played this game back in the early access/Beta, well damn its just as fun as it was back then, even more fun now-a-days, its a pretty good challenge.Basically, you and up to 3 other people race around a map, wall jumping, grappling onto ceilings and launching yourselves for more speed and mess with others with items like rockets and crates.The Maps are pretty well designed, some have a ""Theme"" to them such as nightclub having LOTS of Grappling hook-able ceilings, King of the swingers style map.The goal? Knock everyone else off the screen, once one person goes off screen (if its not just 2 players), Red border appears, as the remaining runners keep going, that border gets smaller and smaller, meaning the players are gonna have to get tighter together and pull some fancy stuff to out-speed the others.The music? i havn't really played much since they added the new music, but from what i've heard so far, its really nice, fitting, up-beat and active, tempo and feel gets a bit more ""Chaotic"" when the red border comes into play, Gives you the feeling of ""Don't slip up now!"".Game worth it? Totally, it was worth it back in the early access beta, and its worth it now, The game's basically more polished since then, and more characters, hell, even a story by the looks of it.			"

								The game is very good but being that this genre of games platformer parkour gets stale kind of quickly and the fact that the characters are all the same they just look different is a bit of a disapointment. There should be this kind of ""speed ability"" that if you go fast enough you get to activate this special unique ability that your character has.What the special abilities are I'll leave the developers to figure that out.The game now though I still recommend though it's a killer when you first start playing.The controls are good it's just that many people are used to pressing the up arrow key to jump that when you force them to press z to jump they just get smacked in the face and basically run into every box when they begin.

								I know I did not play the game quite long compared to the players who played if for more hours but I got a good grip on how the game goes about.Speed Runners is only for the people who love the fast and crazed pact. Clutch through the various maps, dodge spikes and  plan out stratergy to take the people out of competition. I love the game before and after the update even more.>>Description<<Speedrunners is a game where you need you need to move your pace up with hooks and take shortcuts to be in the lead. Use your weaponry pack to take out the other participants and shoot them off the screen only to win. Level up through different leagues to unlock Manly, and weird characters which would suprise you and perhaps get into using it yourself.>>Positive<<This game has provided less lag free gaming and the bots in the game are quite smart to play with. Plus you can increase your XP through them to get more awesome characters. Adding to that, The smoothness compared to the past is quite noticable and vivid too.>>Negativity<<The game does not have many negative points. It takes quite a long time to get into an online server. (Basically for me to get an Online game or ranked game, It would scan half the world to join a game). I wish they would make a ""Room Collection"" thingy so people can make room and people or friends can join in. Or just a Random server can be chosen with a low ping can be joined in. The new characters needs to smoothen out like the old characters.>>Improvement<<Needs more Maps which are suitable to Bots, Increasing variety of fun and joy. Another powerup they can add would be like ALL STARS. Which can give different heroes a powerup which can states them different from each other. >>Rating<<4/5			"

You will see yourself improving weekly, and the players you look up to as being un-beatable will be replaced with even supperior players.  You ALWAYS get better and that's my favorite aspect of the game.  I can't reccomend this game enough for the value.			"

								I really enjoy the game, yet I think the presentation and overall DESIGN (not the gameplay) is somewhat unpolished. The music is excellent and uplifting, yet I'd prefer at least 10 more tracks to the overall package.Right now, the design, personally, it feels more of a potpourri of singular good choices, that however don't really want to fit together as a whole:-> The stage design is very ""clean"" and sterile of some sort, yet the characters and overall design is aimed to be quirky?-> The music ranges from upbeat funk to Ska (please add more ;D!) and fits the quirky design, yet clashes with the sterile stage design, and even with some meaner looking characters-> the red ""borders"" when one player died are just ugly to look at - how about some fire animation of some sort, to actually ""see"" the danger?-> character design is highly (!) uneven in quality and ""charme""-> German translation is amateurish. It seems like somebody posted the stuff on google translate. And I'm not even kidding. English wordplay and puns are translated 1:1 and is REALLY wonky in german.-> I'd like to see instant emoticons or ""taunts"" in gameplay. Just add another button ingame for ""well done"" ""haha"" or ""lucker!"" :D Chatting while playing is nearly impossible - so why not allow ingame-taunting and ingame-feedback :)The gameplay however is very much fun, and I recommend you playing it! :o)Right now, in Beta R44 : 8/10 (With high potential up!)

								Not gonna lie, when i bought it, i didn't think I'd like it that much. It's a really fun and intense game, since you have to learn the stage you play on and time your boosts and powerups accordingly. Sometimes you can make a comeback from the direst of situations, some others you lose because you totally messed up your swing timings. It's a game that is made for online play, totally recommend it!			"

												This game's controls are a little odd but they can be adjusted. The graphics are subpar and the character selection is massive and unique. When it comes to what you can do with them or how different they are from each other, it's another story. There's no special abilities or features that would convince you to play as someone else; this makes for close competition with no one person having an advantage, which can be viewed as good or bad.SpeedRunners does offer lots of gameplayer, as it boasts both an un-interesting but none the less existent singleplayer and a plentiful intense online. Simply put, SpeedRunners is an interesting spin to the racing/parkour scene with little variety, unique graphics, extreme competition, and character differences (mechanics wise) so non-existent that they're sure to make you quickly unenthuastic about their large roster.As you can tell, I have mixed reviews about SpeedRunners. If you have some money lying around and you're looking for a competitive game to play with friends, get it. But if you're looking for singleplayer content, or unique artwork, or character variety, don't get this.			"

								For those of you who are wondering, SpeedRunners is basically Mario Kart meets Smash Bros. The goal? Race ahead of other players using items, speedboosts, and grappling hooks until one by one your opponents fall behind, touch the edge of the screen, and die.This game is a blast both local and online, and run pretty smoothly for the most part. I do occasionally run into weird bugs where the game will randomly kill everyone, refuse to kill someone, or follow someone other than the leader, but it's never much of a problem.The single player time-trial-like mode isn't that great, but you'll probably have too much fun in the multiplayer to notice. There aren't as many items as a Mario Kart game, but most of them are pretty cool: a hook to latch on to a player in front, a bomb that can be remotely detonated, a homing missile, a drill to speed you up and make you invincible, and crates to block incoming missiles and hooks or to trip up opponents. The stages are also great, featuring hard to reach shortcuts and alternate paths that can be closed off. Also, I have to say, once you master the grappling hook, getting around the stages feels so good.			"

								The game plays awesome. Simple, yet spot on !It has a fairly steep learning curve, even after 50 hours of gameplay I can still find a faster route, or even a way to get from point A to B.It is your typical 2D chasing game with fun elements up to 4 players. Rules are simple. If you fall behind the edge of the field-of-view, you are out. There are multiple routes you can choose from,  boosts, items to pick up and use against the opposing players, and you can trip them as well. There are a handful of fixed maps to play (they just don't get boring for some reason), and also every week there are new featured workshop maps.I play it with 5 of my friends, so I would say the game has it's replayability in playing co-op with your friends, tho ranked matches provide enough fun fof quite a few hours.May the fastest win !

								Where to begin with this one.. I love it. Made some custom maps (which aren't GREAT, but demonstrate my appreciation for the game) Imagine Mario Kart, but without split screens. You get power-ups and momentum from swinging around with your hook (45 degree angle, keep that in mind if you intend to play) and the point is to stay in the screen, and eventually ahead of your opponents (up to 4 player matches). When you move out of the screen, your OUT for that round.The downside is that it is in Beta (hence the early access thingy). So expect frequent reload from your desktop. Ignore if it isn't in early acess anymore. Also, for now, there is no league and so you will sometimes face very skilled opponent who won't give you any chances at all (unlike me; i will wait for you and show you the good path for a ""speedy run"" if you are new to the game). Also the music is not really varied as of now, febuary 2014 (only one track for all the stages... enjoyable at first.. but you might want to drop the music down and use your own playlist after a couple of hours.)But, again, this is a really enjoyable, very competitive racing game and you can play local co-op or online co-op or even a mix of both! >I would also recommend that you use a controller if you want to be the best, but then again I havn't really tried on mouse/keyboardPlease forgive my poor english			"

Then it will crash when that game launches. It will be the buggiest, most annoying game you've ever played and you'll put fifty hours into it because it's addicting, stupid, and a lot of fun.

								im not gunna lie, im a bit addicted to this game xDI recommend this to anyone and everyone, it's really fun to play with you friends and people online.I really enjoy the rankings, gives people something to aim for (instead of just aimlessly playing over the same maps over and over, however i'd be fine with that ;3 ) It's great how you give players the opportunity to create levels and have the chance to be featured for others to play.I would suggest maaaayybeee creating a couple more official maps? Just because during the ranked matches, i prefer to stick to the maps i know well (the official ones), and replaying them can get a little bit boring. not complaining though, just a thought :)the only two things i think need fixing are the few bugs in the game. sometimes the camera is set completely away from all players- this can go on till the game ends, or just for one or two rounds. Rarely happens, but can get quite annoying when playing in ranked matches. Also, happening once or twice, my player randomly flew off the screen, causing me to die.The other thing, which is a lot less of a problem, is upon opening the game, the window is opened half on-half off my screen. Not sure if i'm the only one, but it's happened on both of my computers. overall great game, you should deffinitely have a play of this when you can!			"

								Pros:- A very fun original game- Doesn't get boring too quickly- Balanced powerups (No unfair op ones that change the game completely to your favour)- I have not encountered any bugs or map exploits- Really fun with friends (Private lobbies can be made without third party applications)Cons:- Being at first place does handicap you, as most of the time you are put at the edge of the screen without any vision for incoming obstacles. To overcome this you need to memorise the maps and where the blocks and obstacles are, which is not very fair for newcomers to the game- Ranked matches can be very toxic sometimes (Like pretty much any other game you play on ranked these days :P)Overall I think it is a very fun game and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time!

								First I played all the origins levels to get a feeling for the jumps and the items and then playing with 3 friends is really awesome and funny. :)In the ranked online matches are really nice guys and girls, too. So if none of your friends own this game or no one of them is online, dont be shy and create an public lobby or join an already running online match.It's a very good game to have fun without complex tactics. So it's the perfect game on occasion.Have Fun & Good Luck ! :*C ya runnin' ^^ \(oO)/			"

								Very Fun Game. Can't wait to play local co-op with friends back at college. The ranked match level system is suprisingly addicting. I was skeptical of the pricing point at first but, after numerous hours of gameplay i can safely say this game is worth it. The various characters you can play as make for some good variation and the ability to create and download extra levels from the steam workshop makes the gameplay always seem fresh. I definetely recommend this game and it is worth the $9.99!			"

								SpeedRunners, it is a fast paced intense indie game that is in beta right now. It takes a little bit to get used to. It has great music, funny characters, and DLC to play as some of your favorite YouTubers! It is a great game to play with your friends, including a build feature to make your own maps to try out! I think the people at DoubleDutch are doing a very great job on this game! By the way, it ends friendships! I recommend this to anyone that likes competitive multiplayer and can handle the intensity this game holds. Hope you found this review helpful and I hope you enjoy playing SpeedRunners!			"

Really fun couch multiplayer game - I cannot stress this enough. We have played alot of this, and certainly will play alot more. It plays waaay more fun than it looks, trust me on this.Pros:+Plenty of little control details that rewards knowledge of the play system (i.e. sliding will dodge the golden hook - there are lots of little details like this)+Lots of levels, plus Steam Workshop+Awesome ranking system for online playCons:-Music is meh-Graphical/art style is meh IMO-DLC is not worth it - although I bought it to support the devsThe Pros far outweigh the Cons. Pick this up for some local fun and you will not be dissapointed. "

								SpeedRunners is a fast-paced, competitive and enjoyable experience especially if you're playing with friends or with other individuals around the world. What makes this game so thrilling, is that you're trying to become the best runner within the match while facing some frustrating obstacles and hazards, but the real dangers are the players within the game what makes this game so exciting and worth playing. However, if you do want to play online and go up against people with bad WI-FI signals, then that takes the fun out of the game, but I'd recommend you playing with individuals you know, but if you don't have friends pray if you find people who have good WI-FI connection while playing ranked or quick match. In the end, that's what the game is all about fast, fun and a crazy experience and I truly recommend it if you want something simple, but competitive.			"

								Amazing 2D racing/platforming game.The barrier of entry is low and the only thing seperating new players from old is map recognition and reflexes. It's refreshing to see a game where everyone has the same possibilities form the start and the only thing seperating winners from losers is skill.The art style compliments the action, the motions are fluid and the characters distinctive. The maps are all distinctive, though a lot of them have sections that you wouldn't know were coming up unless you had played the map before several times.The only downsides are the rare camera issues of it not properly tracking the players current position if you have alt tabbed after death and try to get back into the game. Also, there is an annoying minority of players that never play ranked, so they'll stay beginner rank and be matched up with new players in unranked play. This could be solved by adding a rank up if you're outperforming the other players by a huge margin. On the plus side, connectivity issues are really rare, and it doesn't take a lot to run this in maximum settings with buttery smooth fps. Overall, it's the best of its kind currently available on steam. Polished and fair, although will shorten your lifespan when you're getting too into it and manage to fail to grapple that one spot you know you can get and lose the match because of it.			"

								Really fun + awesome game! :) If your into fast-paced platfomers with action then this is the game for you! :) SpeedRunners (the name kinda gives it away) you have gotta go fast (sonic reference intended) but really, you do. If you fall behind (go off the screen as it is constantly scrolling as you run) then you will be elminated (first to win 3 games). Think its that easy to keep ahead of the pack? not necessiarly as the items may change who wins, you have items that can give you a boost (Blue rocket) and items you can throw at your opponents to get them to the back of the pack (golden hook is known for doing this and rockets can help too) there are many items in the game and they are all are great in their own way :). Many maps to choose from both Dev created and community created and many characters to choose from also (if you put /gangbeast in superchat you get to play as him in game in any colour) you can do this with the payday 2 chraracters too just by putting /Payday2  character so you can play as one of them e.g. /cloaker /wolf. The game is still in beta/early access so you can expect updates to this game (one was character commands and this new XP system) which is cool :). You may encounter some glitches but beta + very rare that i find them to be honest. The game has online and local play so this game is great for couch play too and online play :) the community is a mix really as you can get poor losers XD and players who are lke ""fair play gg"" but again, rare you'll see poor losers so don't let that put you off + bots are in this game too along with a single player origins story mode. With many modes to choose from (like ranked where you progress leagues) and custom match where you choose the rules (one being this wheel that decides your fate) you will be coming back to this game quite a lot as it is a lot of fun :) if you see it in sale or at full price (£7) its defo worth it as it also supports the devs! :) (check out the demo if your un-sure about it though :))			"

												This game's controls are a little odd but they can be adjusted. The graphics are subpar and the character selection is massive and unique. When it comes to what you can do with them or how different they are from each other, it's another story. There's no special abilities or features that would convince you to play as someone else; this makes for close competition with no one person having an advantage, which can be viewed as good or bad.SpeedRunners does offer lots of gameplayer, as it boasts both an un-interesting but none the less existent singleplayer and a plentiful intense online. Simply put, SpeedRunners is an interesting spin to the racing/parkour scene with little variety, unique graphics, extreme competition, and character differences (mechanics wise) so non-existent that they're sure to make you quickly unenthuastic about their large roster.As you can tell, I have mixed reviews about SpeedRunners. If you have some money lying around and you're looking for a competitive game to play with friends, get it. But if you're looking for singleplayer content, or unique artwork, or character variety, don't get this.			"

								Mix Mario Kart, Bionic Commando (kinda) and Sonic and you get this game. I've been playing it for a long time, back when it was released to XBLIG. When I saw it on Steam, I didn't hesitate for one second and still don't regret it.Buy this game, it's great and the devs are not the kind to let the baby die. They add stuff now and then, and the multiplayer mode, though still a bit buggy, is enough to justify the early access purchase.			"

								One of the best zany multiplayer games, especially now that it has ranked matches.  Create your own maps and go head to head against your friends, do a quick match against random people, or fight for the top of the leaderboards.  Subtle nuances make this a game of not only luck, but skill.  So learn from your opponents to master this fantastic game.			"

								Good game, specially to be played with friends. Some pros and cons:PROS:- Good Game Mechanic;- Fun gameplay;- Balanced powerup gameplay;- Workshop support (infinite levels);CONS:- Lobby has some issues (ranked matches with custom maps, no kick option, some game-crashing bugs)- Custom maps easily exploitable;- Ranking system is not the best, and not 100% balanced;- Game is filled with bugs.Overall, a good experience, but it might outerweight to the negative side very easily.Since it's a UNDER DEVELOPMENT, I'll keep a watch out, and I hope they fix all the bugs and balance out the minor tweaks. Great potential, great game.			"

								SpeedRunners, it is a fast paced intense indie game that is in beta right now. It takes a little bit to get used to. It has great music, funny characters, and DLC to play as some of your favorite YouTubers! It is a great game to play with your friends, including a build feature to make your own maps to try out! I think the people at DoubleDutch are doing a very great job on this game! By the way, it ends friendships! I recommend this to anyone that likes competitive multiplayer and can handle the intensity this game holds. Hope you found this review helpful and I hope you enjoy playing SpeedRunners!			"

												Played this game back in the early access/Beta, well damn its just as fun as it was back then, even more fun now-a-days, its a pretty good challenge.Basically, you and up to 3 other people race around a map, wall jumping, grappling onto ceilings and launching yourselves for more speed and mess with others with items like rockets and crates.The Maps are pretty well designed, some have a ""Theme"" to them such as nightclub having LOTS of Grappling hook-able ceilings, King of the swingers style map.The goal? Knock everyone else off the screen, once one person goes off screen (if its not just 2 players), Red border appears, as the remaining runners keep going, that border gets smaller and smaller, meaning the players are gonna have to get tighter together and pull some fancy stuff to out-speed the others.The music? i havn't really played much since they added the new music, but from what i've heard so far, its really nice, fitting, up-beat and active, tempo and feel gets a bit more ""Chaotic"" when the red border comes into play, Gives you the feeling of ""Don't slip up now!"".Game worth it? Totally, it was worth it back in the early access beta, and its worth it now, The game's basically more polished since then, and more characters, hell, even a story by the looks of it.			"

								SpeedRunners is a competitive racing game that is undeniably fun to play! The game is in beta at the time of this review, so I will note that there are bugs that exist in the game; these bugs are not game-breaking but you may find yourself a bit confused at times as to what's happening. The game has a very straightforward control system that can easily be learned. The learning curve to the game is relatively low, just about anyone can play it and have fun. One thing I was really impressed with, were the animations for the characters in SpeedRunners. There was a lot of detail put into every frame for the actors in the game. The stage design may be my only gripe with the game. I think all of the stages are fantastic, but there are some awkward placements of traps in the game that will make you question the purpose of its location. SpeedRunners doesnt have much of a story mode, its multiplayer aspect is where the game shines. So if you're looking for a game to play with a group of friends for some friendly trash-talking fun, I'd suggest buying SpeedRunners!			"

												I'm going to preface this by saying that I've only played through the story mode, but I feel like that actually captures the essene of what the game is, if not the entire spirit of it.I first purchased SpeedRunners as a sort of replacement for Runbow.  I didn't want to have to plug my Wii in all the time to just play one game.  Why not just buy a new running game, and let my litle black box gather more dust and grow more and more redundant in peace?The game is hectic.  Chaotic.  Deliightfully retro.  There were many times I was mere milliseconds away from an untimely elimination, only to boost and swing just right and propel myself to a dashing finish.  Oher times I was not so lucky, and was left groaning in annoyance and even frustration.  I can only imagine how that would look with three other people playing on the couch, too.  Probably a party.Long story short: buy it.  It's a good time, even on your own.  It only gets better from there.			"

												It's literally just a game about going ♥♥♥♥ing fast. Also has items to screw over your opponents. Has workshop support, mostly for maps. It also has plenty of maps to choose from in the vanilla game. The only negative about this game is that it puts the 1st place runner on a disadvantage, because of the way the camera works. So basically, The first place runner will have a smaller field of view than all the other runners.Edit: also, you get lots of skins throughout the game as you level up. They're really cool. I think they're 70% of the things that make me keep playing the game, to be honest.			"

								This game is crazy awesome. Its a great time kill when you have a bunch of friends to play with. My only concern is there isnt enough items. It gets kinda boring after you get used to the whole thing. -maybe once a player dies, they can do distracting things to the other players like throw rockets at them or throw fruit or something, It would add a whole new aspect to the game, kinda like one of those friend only lobbies.

								OH MYYYYY GEDDDD!!!!I am almost in-love with this game, I've bearly played it and already if ive got nothing to play i will play this, the mechanics as basic as they are, (a little buggy, but easy fix) are fantastic, everytime i do a successful swing that was better than the guy in front of me and gets me in front of him makes me feel awesome, i cannot and will not stop playing this game whenever I get the chance, it is absolutely fantastic and would recommend this game to anyone who likes a game where trolling is the best way to win.

								This game is so much fun. The premise is simple, don't get left behind and be the last left running to win. As other reviews have pointed out it is a lot like Mario Kart in that you pickup weapons along the way that you can use to get ahead of your oppoents, except it's a side scroller with levels that can twist and turn and be as dangerous as the other players!It's still in Early Access so there are still some bugs but hopefully these should be ironed out for when it's released officially :)If you enjoy Mario Kart, side scrollers and like to play with friends, this is definitely a game for you.

								Really fun + awesome game! :) If your into fast-paced platfomers with action then this is the game for you! :) SpeedRunners (the name kinda gives it away) you have gotta go fast (sonic reference intended) but really, you do. If you fall behind (go off the screen as it is constantly scrolling as you run) then you will be elminated (first to win 3 games). Think its that easy to keep ahead of the pack? not necessiarly as the items may change who wins, you have items that can give you a boost (Blue rocket) and items you can throw at your opponents to get them to the back of the pack (golden hook is known for doing this and rockets can help too) there are many items in the game and they are all are great in their own way :). Many maps to choose from both Dev created and community created and many characters to choose from also (if you put /gangbeast in superchat you get to play as him in game in any colour) you can do this with the payday 2 chraracters too just by putting /Payday2  character so you can play as one of them e.g. /cloaker /wolf. The game is still in beta/early access so you can expect updates to this game (one was character commands and this new XP system) which is cool :). You may encounter some glitches but beta + very rare that i find them to be honest. The game has online and local play so this game is great for couch play too and online play :) the community is a mix really as you can get poor losers XD and players who are lke ""fair play gg"" but again, rare you'll see poor losers so don't let that put you off + bots are in this game too along with a single player origins story mode. With many modes to choose from (like ranked where you progress leagues) and custom match where you choose the rules (one being this wheel that decides your fate) you will be coming back to this game quite a lot as it is a lot of fun :) if you see it in sale or at full price (£7) its defo worth it as it also supports the devs! :) (check out the demo if your un-sure about it though :))			"

												Speedrunners is a game where you race in a map until one person achieves 3 wins at which point the lobby chooses another map. It is played with 2-4 players and has a variety of uses. At first when I played speedrunners I got it for a fun party game as well as online play with my friends. It would be a lot of fun running, jumping, and grappling around the map as we laughed. I didn't play it much like that when I started playing Online Matchmaking. People started crushing me in speed and that's where the game took more of a competetive feel. It wasn't until I felt like I was good enough to go on Ranked, where the real fun begins. I would've never expected such a simple game to have so much depth to it. The great thing about this game is that it has a variety of aspects that all do well. It is a party game for if friends come over, it is a fun online chill-out game to have a laugh as well. Then it is more about winning in online. After online and into ranked you start in entry league and it is pretty basic. It is around when I am now expert league and I am facing bronze league's where the game really starts to show what it has to offer. Serious competition, but still about laughing and having a good time with random people you are facing. This game is for almost anyone except people who rage easily for no reason. Please don't get the game if you are that person. Nobody wants to play with that person. Actually nevermind, just don't get any game that I play. I never want to play with that person.tl;dr  The more you play, the more you discover about the game, the more you have fun. If you don't want to pay full price that is ok because if you want to support the devs more you can buy trails for .99 cents each. It's an in-game store I actually enjoy having for many reasons. Whenever you are playing, always remember that there is room to get better so don't worry!			"

												It's literally just a game about going ♥♥♥♥ing fast. Also has items to screw over your opponents. Has workshop support, mostly for maps. It also has plenty of maps to choose from in the vanilla game. The only negative about this game is that it puts the 1st place runner on a disadvantage, because of the way the camera works. So basically, The first place runner will have a smaller field of view than all the other runners.Edit: also, you get lots of skins throughout the game as you level up. They're really cool. I think they're 70% of the things that make me keep playing the game, to be honest.			"

												I'm going to preface this by saying that I've only played through the story mode, but I feel like that actually captures the essene of what the game is, if not the entire spirit of it.I first purchased SpeedRunners as a sort of replacement for Runbow.  I didn't want to have to plug my Wii in all the time to just play one game.  Why not just buy a new running game, and let my litle black box gather more dust and grow more and more redundant in peace?The game is hectic.  Chaotic.  Deliightfully retro.  There were many times I was mere milliseconds away from an untimely elimination, only to boost and swing just right and propel myself to a dashing finish.  Oher times I was not so lucky, and was left groaning in annoyance and even frustration.  I can only imagine how that would look with three other people playing on the couch, too.  Probably a party.Long story short: buy it.  It's a good time, even on your own.  It only gets better from there.			"

Its not a pay to play game! Everything you buy just effects how it looks and not how its played, to be good you must play! The soundtrack fits the tone of the fast paced, cut-throat gameplay! All the sound effects are great and really immerse you! I hate long reviews so ill keep it short. The game is fast paced, fun to play, cut throat and with every victory your friends will hate you more and more! Mentioning hate, Ive sseen NONE of it in  the games ive played, everyone is nice and fair with each loss, and complementary with each victory! Worth. Every. Penny.			"

								This is just a 2D Mario Cart. Fantasticly frustrating, but is so fun that you never become overly frustrated with it or other players.It is extremely fast paced so when you first start you will lose immediatly guaranteed but the game is so simple and straight forward that in half and hour you will be right on the tale of the people that we leaving you for dead just a shot time before.This is still the beta so the solo missions are a little bare. But its the multiplayer that you want, it is smooth, connects quicly and so far I have not had a single flame or troll. When we die we are laughing with each other, even when its your own character that has just completely messed up. The game has the game play and skill level that it could be extremely competive if thats the sort of game you want. However as I said before it is fun and cute enough for those that simply want to have fun  can enjoy it as well. And you will have fun.  As its the Beta their is only one weapon to be collected in the multiplayer at the moment, a freeze ray that turns anyone it hits into a block of ice, but soon there will be more weapons added such a missles that seek the nearest opponent. (Red shells anyone ;) )At only £1.74 around $3 as its on sale at 75% off I would advise you to snap it up as its a really simple idea, but has been carried out extremely well by the creators. They have obviously put both love and time into this game which comes across in its easy going humour, In doing so they have created a wonderfully addictive, social and fun game. If they continue at this rate when it comes to the final and full version it will be chasing Mario Cart for the most fun racing game around and its freeze ray is more powerful than a blue shell.			"

												Played this game back in the early access/Beta, well damn its just as fun as it was back then, even more fun now-a-days, its a pretty good challenge.Basically, you and up to 3 other people race around a map, wall jumping, grappling onto ceilings and launching yourselves for more speed and mess with others with items like rockets and crates.The Maps are pretty well designed, some have a ""Theme"" to them such as nightclub having LOTS of Grappling hook-able ceilings, King of the swingers style map.The goal? Knock everyone else off the screen, once one person goes off screen (if its not just 2 players), Red border appears, as the remaining runners keep going, that border gets smaller and smaller, meaning the players are gonna have to get tighter together and pull some fancy stuff to out-speed the others.The music? i havn't really played much since they added the new music, but from what i've heard so far, its really nice, fitting, up-beat and active, tempo and feel gets a bit more ""Chaotic"" when the red border comes into play, Gives you the feeling of ""Don't slip up now!"".Game worth it? Totally, it was worth it back in the early access beta, and its worth it now, The game's basically more polished since then, and more characters, hell, even a story by the looks of it.			"

								This is game made me laugh so hard! :D Oh why!This game reminds me of Mario Kart from Nintendo. Which is really fun to play with friends. If you asked me its worth the shot. The online play is fun but there were some glitches where the other player looks like they are flying or pass through an obstacle but overall this game is worth it.I got the 4pack then gave the extra copies to my friends. There is so much grappling and laughing here. I was trying not to laugh and concentrate on whats on the screen but can't contain the burst of laughter. I give it a BIG THUMBS UP! The game is intense I must say.Here is my gameplay video. (Warning: Too much laughter can cause stomach pains and watery eyes).

Easy to pick up but incredibly hard to master.This game does feature crashes and hangs, it's early access. Both have only occurred in online multiplayer so far.			"

								I was skeptical when I first bought this game but in my first 10 minutes of playing, I was already having a blast. Speedrunners keeps you entertained with many unlockable characters, maps, and gadgets you can use to take down opponents and take the lead. With its fast paced action and competition, Speedrunners keeps you having fun for hours and hours and has a huge selection of maps because of the community creations.The only complaints I have of this game is that it usually takes a few minutes to join in a game with 4 people but once you do join, you can expect to have a great time.

								My gosh, I'm not sure what to say. What i can say so far is this game is CRAZY addicting. I keep saying ""Just one more round"" and then 10 rounds later i show no signs of stopping!If you watch the videos the game looks hard and complicated, but it's really pick-up-and-play. Granted a lot of skill will seperate the average player form the masters, but everyone can have fun with this. It's wild and crazy platforming action. The community is really solid too, plenty of custom levels are available. It may be free to play after it launches, but if you pay any money for this, any at all, you will definitely get your money's worth.			"

								A great multi/single player game, Friendly devs, great updates.I'm serious, speedrunners kind of took over my life. After the first round I played against way to hard online opponents I knew this was a game where skills, routes and the use of pickups are extremely valuable. Multiplayer:  The multiplayer is extremely intens and fun. Grappling your friends across the screen dodging grappling hooks, planting   bombs, spawning inside blocks, it all is enjoyable.Singleplayer:  Speedrunners (In terms of being as fast as possible) and people with not that great internet will like this. Find the shortest ways in the levels and get above your friends' scores.Conclusion:  Speedrunners is a game suitable for most of the steam users. (Try it while being drunk)To those who are creative: Since r22 (I think) speedrunners has  the ability to create levels and upload them to the workshop.			"

								So I grabbed this on sale about a year ago, and sent 3 copies as gifts to a bunch of my best pals, and guess what? We went crazy all night over this game.Starting out, control felt weird, but this quickly changed over the first 10 minutes as I got used to the flawless, fluid control scheme. The game is responsive, and character animation was fast.As for Graphic, this game for built for portability, so don't expect some Battlefield Standard graphics here. It can run on Integrated Graphics on my other laptops, but I played this game on a Dedicated GPU, making framerates over the top, which added to the overall experience.Gameplay wise, I have to warn you, this game, will make you have sorethroats, spasm attacks, uncontrollable laughter, and make you throw tantrums at your friends. In this 1v3 game, the objective is to outlast your opponents/'Friends' by using evil item pickups. Some overpowered ones are dodgable, and the weaker ones are hard to pull off, making this game very easy to play, at the same time competitive. Having 5 characters to choose from, i have no complains as it only helps to differentiate whom you want to scream at!Community wise, the community is quite a friendly one, but has the occasional hiccup of a laggy player, due to international hosting. No complains in this sections.Overall, this game has brought me loads of fun, and sorethroats. Pros outweigh the cons, making the game a valued one. Recommended to anybody whom wants to lose a friend:pPros:-Excellent Multiplayer-Fluid Gameplay-Comfortable Controls-Portable-Easy-to-Run-Inexpensive, compared to other titlesCons:-Somewhat bad servers-Some unstability9/10			"

								this game is really fun multiplayer wise. best way I can describe it is like a 2D platforming race smash brothers. It's not very accurate I know, but it's basically like if you touch the edge of the screen in last place you die and if you touch the edge of the screen in first (while running the right way) you'll win the match. There's also items you pick up, kind of like mario kart I suppose, but actually dodgeable (for the most part)There is a single player mode, but its really really meh and I don't think the game is meant for single player at all anyway so don't buy it unless you have friends to play with or don't mind randoms online. Even for early access I think the game is certainly worth it and really fun. There's lost of custom levels to mess with too and at least a good handful of them are decent and fun enough. It's a pretty cool game and I haven't seen a concept like it before so I found it really interesting. Should try it out when you can. ignore the crappy youtube dlc btw, it adds nothing but youtube ""celebrities"" characters that don't do anything. I don't know why you would want to play as some lame nerd over a communist super hero			"

								I was skeptical when I first bought this game but in my first 10 minutes of playing, I was already having a blast. Speedrunners keeps you entertained with many unlockable characters, maps, and gadgets you can use to take down opponents and take the lead. With its fast paced action and competition, Speedrunners keeps you having fun for hours and hours and has a huge selection of maps because of the community creations.The only complaints I have of this game is that it usually takes a few minutes to join in a game with 4 people but once you do join, you can expect to have a great time.

Also in rankeds workshop maps should be disabled because if 1 person knows the map he haves the advantage and can take easy win. Long, long time ago when this game was inviting to closed beta not even on steam you could match with some mlg-no-scope SpeedRunners taht weren't even trying to win because you were killing yourself.

								I rate this game strong 9/10. Why ? Because if you go really fast it feels great. Game feels kinda dead because sometimes (1AM) you can't find opponents in your leauge. Also in rankeds workshop maps should be disabled because if 1 person knows the map he haves the advantage and can take easy win. Long, long time ago when this game was inviting to closed beta not even on steam you could match with some mlg-no-scope SpeedRunners taht weren't even trying to win because you were killing yourself. Had much fun learning this shizze, Detheto is gud senpai i rate him 11/10.			"

												Fantastic, competitive, fast paced fun. Easily the best use of money I've made. Swing, jump, slide, and, yes, run through a variety of original and user made levels. Use items to make your friends (or enemies) fumble, stop, and get knocked out so you may burst through the pack. In that sense it is similar to such masterpieces as Dokapon Kingdom and Mario Kart and Party, it is a fun ""friend destroyer"", Level up to get new items, maps, characters, and skins. The only problems are that it's best with friends, so you'll have to convince friends to purchase the game, or you'll have to buy the 4-pack, the story lacks, though that isn't the main focus, and that, without expansion packs, there are few characters (but the workshop makes up for that). I give it a 9/10.			"

I don't think the game would be the same without it.If you ever want to mix it up add triple rockets, they are OP and definitely evil. "

I see funny loading screens, punny characters (fat butterfly for the win!), I press like. Totally addicting, my boyfrind is always complaining how I can play this game so long. Some of those work shop maps should be checked more often, but sometimes its just funny when you see how fcked up maps can be. Thanks for this good game! I hope it will get more viral soon.			"

												This is that kind of game that you buy not to write a review or to get achievements, but to have fun. If you bought this game to write a review, you probably already forgot it and have a few hundred hours now. It's absolutely an immersive experience - it is simple, fast(depending on your skill... or luck), fun and interesting. I don't know any similar games to this and it is indeed how they describe it themselves. It is really interesting to play with better players and get knowledge from them, while also it's really cool to teach some. And apart those two things, then there's insane fun when lots of unintended things happen, where you could accidentally win by insane luck against a pro.I have it since the early stages of the game, been watching it even since it was r2x or so. The gameplay is absolutely amazing, at the start it might be confusing, but with time it gets only better. It is fast, and you get a hook. And items. I think that is fun enough to do insane s*** haha.GraphicsWell, its obviously not a realistic 3d real life game. Personally I love the art style and the design. It's a really nice style, an open style I would say. The animations are really nice, plus the taunts. Wonderful. The animations at times is like a type of communication between players, and it is interesting for how many expressions a single taunt can be used.Fancy styleGood animationsGreat tauntsStoryWell, it just got there not a long time ago. But it is not what you're buying this game for haha. It is what will probably introduce you to the game as a new player, and for a new player the unfair difficulty can be really unfair.Short storyRather newbie-friendly, but good introduction to the game mechanics as a storyVery easy for early access players.Sound(track)The sounds in the game are really well done, the soundtrack is amazeballs. it's really fun to play listening to it and it gives you lots of fun. Great sounds(grapple, swing, items)Fancy and fun soundtrackA little con might be:Characters do not talk or suchOverall, yes, this game is worth every cent it is sold for. It gives you all the features you need to have a great time and to get hooked to spend a million hours of playing. If you see it on a discount, grab it immediately.			"

												This is a fast paced insanely fun game with a great art style (reminiscent of the movie Incredibles) and a fun soundtrack. The beginning of SpeedRunners is a bit problematic for example it took me a while to figure out how to change the controls. And the story is only useful because of the new characters you can get, but the dialogue is painfully cliche. It's obvious that this is truly a great game but I would only recommend getting it if you have someone else to play with. PDHD gives this game a 7/10. Fun.			"

												So i'm only silver league but i've been playing this game for nearly 2 years and heres my honest opinion:I have always loved this game and it was such an exiting, enjoyable and competative experience. But since its released most of the few good Australian players stopped playing, or at least arent as active as they used to. This makes at least in my case very difficult to find a game at all. Let alone being evenly matched.Gameplay whise this game opens up so much room for skill developement and the constant strive to be the best. With the limited singleplayer replay value this pushes most players to the online area of Speedrunners. Online can be very pleasant and fun to play whether it be playing with some old mates or making new ones by yourself everyone on there seems to be mature and friendly.As the online connection is P2P (No servers), one person with faulty internet can pretty much ruin the experience of everyone else as it breaks the game most the time and you end up frozen in a game.Recently with the games release they have introduced trails for people to buy with microtransactions, this really felt out of place with the whole arcade style of the game and I have rarely seen people using them.Alltogether this is quite an amazing fun to play game, I reccomend buying a 4 pack and gifting it around as it is best played with friends!

												I seriously looked at this game a while ago and thought it wouldn't be interesting. A couple friends and I decided to buy the game and check it out and 4 hours later we had some of the best fun in a LONG time. It's basically a fast-paced platforming game with powerups to hinder your friends (or foes) from beating you. The catch is after one person ""dies"" by falling off the screen, the screen begins to get smaller and smaller until it's small enough to barely fit 2 people. It's some of the best fun you'll have and I can guarantee you'll be angry and laughing at the same time.			"

												SpeedRunners - My personal reviewI bought this game in the official steam shop after it was mentioned in one of PewDiePie´s slightly older videos. It has been reduced by 75% from the original price so I payed about 4 euros in total, at this point my expectations weren´t that high so I first thought that i´d spend about 20 hours in the game. After a few matches and when i started to figure out the special mechanics that the game has it really started getting interesting and fun to play. Now I spent 46 hours in the game and that after about 6 weeks of buying it and after all this time its stil enjoyable and on top of that it became one of my favourite games i´ve ever played.It is a jump n´run multiplayer game without any type of story you need to mention, so there is a tutorial but the game is just about the gameplay and not about the graphics or the campaign.You shouldn´t buy this game if you´re looking for a revolutionary game in every point but if you´re into games like this its definetly worth youre money although i have to say that you should wait until its getting reduced again.-----EDIT------After they ve added a new ""ELO"" system, ranked gamplay isnt fun any longer. It is super buggy (f.e. some players do get around 20+ points for a win while others including me only getting +2 for every match, nevermind if they beat high or low elo players). If youre looking for a ranked focused jumpNrunner game i would not recommend you this anymore!			"

								OMG what a game, I don't recommend you this game, no, I put a gun in your head  and I'm gonna shoot if you don't buy it. Is one of the best game ever. Is like, playing an old game, but, multiplayer, online, and competitive, is like... I don't know, play Mario or Megaman with a friend who is in another country, but both are competing who beat the level faster. Let's make it clear, you don't shoot, you dont jump in enemies, you just run and throw items and usea some kind of nitro, but it have that old retro controller just like Super Meat Boy. I'm happy with this game and I know is gonna be free when it will be released, but, you have to pay for it, trust me (and of course, when the game goes free you will not have multiplayer online♥♥♥♥♥♥.9.9/10(There is no 10 points game never in my life)			"

Me and my friends played this game so much we started to realize we played it for three hours and have no more maps to play. This is the only reason that makes this game weak.

								SpeedRunners is an awesome game.While it mixes up the playstyle of Super Meat Bot, it also adds the speed of a racing game, the power-ups of any mario kart game and the grapple hook mechanism similar to the Just Cause series.The main plot of the game is cool, while there's a lot of main characters, there's still 2 Youtuber packs (which I find waaay unescessary to have, since they're only reskins and the players have no audio or anything, it's just visual), there's hidden characters too, while you can play as Wolf from PAYDAY 2 and as a potato.The game can be played up to 4 players, on an online match, or you can play with bots, choosing one of the three difficulties: Easy, medium or hard.Even that the game is competitive and smooth, it doesn't and won't lack the sense of fun. Just like in Mount Your Friends, if it wasn't by the hanging dongs and the nude characters, the game would be totally focused on the competitiviness it has, while in SpeedRunners, the game has a gayish character with a pink unicorn costume, and another character with a big red ball head with a star on it, symbolizing the comunism.The game has a nice plot, by first sight, since it involves all of an hero world where you need to save scientists from bombs.93/100			"

The fact that this game is in early access shocks me and I think it is a splendid game as it is already. I would reccomend buying this game in early access because it is (almost) completely bug free. I say almost because I have only encountered one bug so far and it wasnt too game breaking. It is a joy to play anytime of day. 10/10 Would run again.			"

It is in my opinion played best 1 on 1 with a friend that you can beak at the entire time.  Online with 4 people certainly is fun, but can become fairly chaotic and 4 people with items can make it seem like luck changes the game instead of skill.  Nevertheless it is a blast.Overall an amazing game I would recommend to anyone.  the perfect casual time-waster, yet it can get extremely competitive.5 ""Grapple Hook Fails"" out of 5			"

												Speedrunners at it's core is a very addicting game and is something you can easily come back to if you want to have a fun time, I highly reccomend it to people who wish to try something different.Pros: Lots of unique and wonderfully animated characters, easy to pick up and play, skill level friendly (most of the time), workshop levels, trails, overall good community, soundtrack (except for 2 specific ones)Cons: matchmaking can be very unreliable when wanting to get ranked with people your rank, number of players drop to low amounts (usually from 12 AM to near 5-6 AM), smurfs, some cancerous people, and item spam on a few occasionsIf you can manage to get past all the cons, you have a fun, challenging game that's sure to reel you back in from time to time, and unlike a few other games I know the devs actually care for their game (having just recently come back from porting the game to consoles) and it's pricing is just right, but if that doesn't tickle your fancy, wait for a sale.

								It's fair to say I love this game. With 110 hours and counting I keep coming back for more. It's super competitive with a relatively high skill ceiling, but regardless it's still easy to get into. Tons of fun especially with friends local or online. The net code is excellent and even shows the connection quality of your opponents. Buy the 4-pack and have a blast today!			"

								SpeedRunners is an awesome game.While it mixes up the playstyle of Super Meat Bot, it also adds the speed of a racing game, the power-ups of any mario kart game and the grapple hook mechanism similar to the Just Cause series.The main plot of the game is cool, while there's a lot of main characters, there's still 2 Youtuber packs (which I find waaay unescessary to have, since they're only reskins and the players have no audio or anything, it's just visual), there's hidden characters too, while you can play as Wolf from PAYDAY 2 and as a potato.The game can be played up to 4 players, on an online match, or you can play with bots, choosing one of the three difficulties: Easy, medium or hard.Even that the game is competitive and smooth, it doesn't and won't lack the sense of fun. Just like in Mount Your Friends, if it wasn't by the hanging dongs and the nude characters, the game would be totally focused on the competitiviness it has, while in SpeedRunners, the game has a gayish character with a pink unicorn costume, and another character with a big red ball head with a star on it, symbolizing the comunism.The game has a nice plot, by first sight, since it involves all of an hero world where you need to save scientists from bombs.93/100			"

								10/10Would grapple again.A lot of fun, especially with friends. Whilst there is a level editor I feel like there should be a lot more official levels or a better way of searching through currently available levels.I would also like to see a few more playable characters and more parts for inclusion in the levels. The AI is pretty good but I think modifying it slightly so each character has different traits and paths would help (i.e. SpeedRunner might take the path the gets him to the most boosts, whilst HotHead will try and get the most items.

								Let me be clear: This is one of the best multiplayer games I have ever played. I bought FIVE copies total because you can't wait around all day for your idiot friends to buy their own copies - sometimes you have to take action yourself. This game is incredibly fun right now while in early access. You do not need to wait for release if you want to have amazing fun with your friends. You can do online and local multiplayer. If you can't tell from the store page, this game is a foot race with items to help you defeat your opponents. There are many advanced techniques you can use to defeat your opponents. After someone falls far enough behind to touch the edge of the screen, the screen will slowly get smaller and smaller eventually forcing out the other players. This is great as it doesnt allow rounds to go on endlessly while you are stuck waiting. Matches are very fast and there is very little not playing time. Some other games make you spend at least as much time waiting around in lobbies and loading screens as you do actual playing, but not this game. You are always right down to business. In conclusion, definitely buy this game.			"

I've seen some crazy tricks, etc.  It's great.  Highly recommended.ONLY con is that there are some bugs and glitches but what game doesn't have it.  Also I would REALLY like a time trial mode where you can speedrun a map on your own and beat someone's time, etc.			"

								I've got 4hrs on my own record now and I've been playing this game at a friend's for countless hours. If you want to have great, competitive fun with your friends then this is a really great game. It's tons of fun, easy to learn and you can easily play it for a few hours straight and it's not getting boring. Great Game for local multiplayer. Get 3 friends with controllers and have fun!The online-multiplayer on the other hand is buggy as hell. You've got glitches, bugs and game crashes and sometimes you just keep losing your connection time after time - After all it's still in alpha and you really notice this in online-games. This will frustrate you. A lot. In conclusion: Great offline game for local multiplayer! (Right now) horrible online experience!			"

You can poop Box's on peoples heads.  10/10Edit:  After Several Hours Later i have a few things to really say about these games. As i hate those one liners that give a ten out of ten without explaining why. so here it goes.SpeedRunners is a awesome 4 player MultiPlayer  Hit and run type of Game. It reminds me a lot like Super Smash Brothers without as many weapons or players.  But its still in Beta.  Also  The Community.  Now there is no Speech to talk.  There is very little Chatting.  but its Jestures that show what type of player or peroson you are.  If you are a little bit or a lot better than other players.  Most players will wait up to make it more of a challenge for themselves, and to allow people with lesser of skills catch up.  Wonderful Community without Communication in game.  The Fun:  Non stop hours of fun you can use a Controller and up to 4 controllers i believe or 3  and a keyboard and mouse.  making this a fun game for the Big Screen TV on Big Pictuer mode playing your PC like a Consel.  Sweet!Being able to catch on Quickly.  This is important because some games it takes a real long time to catch on. Or they make something easy very hard.  this game is very str8 forward. The one player is fun and will teach you.  When you first turn on your game it immediatly puts you through  tut, that is short but to the point. you dont need to do these as the best way to learn is to jump in the action.Ranks: They have a ranking system that is very cool.  And i foresee this being a cool portion to SpeedRunners.Custom Levels and Level Modifier.  You can create your Own levels, or play other well built custom maps. one or two not so well built.  But most of them Rock, and can be voted on. i have yet to figure that part out. But they have WORKSHOP for this game. So Rock on!All in all if you want to play with your buddies this game is way worth the asking price, its worth the Full asking price. hell id pay 20 bucks for it.  Just to support the Developers and i do hope Tiny Build makes money off this and expands.   HAVE FUN AND RUN RUN RUN			"

								It's fair to say I love this game. With 110 hours and counting I keep coming back for more. It's super competitive with a relatively high skill ceiling, but regardless it's still easy to get into. Tons of fun especially with friends local or online. The net code is excellent and even shows the connection quality of your opponents. Buy the 4-pack and have a blast today!			"

												Speedrunners at it's core is a very addicting game and is something you can easily come back to if you want to have a fun time, I highly reccomend it to people who wish to try something different.Pros: Lots of unique and wonderfully animated characters, easy to pick up and play, skill level friendly (most of the time), workshop levels, trails, overall good community, soundtrack (except for 2 specific ones)Cons: matchmaking can be very unreliable when wanting to get ranked with people your rank, number of players drop to low amounts (usually from 12 AM to near 5-6 AM), smurfs, some cancerous people, and item spam on a few occasionsIf you can manage to get past all the cons, you have a fun, challenging game that's sure to reel you back in from time to time, and unlike a few other games I know the devs actually care for their game (having just recently come back from porting the game to consoles) and it's pricing is just right, but if that doesn't tickle your fancy, wait for a sale.

												SpeedRunners is as if Mario Kart and Super Meat Boy had a baby. It's a fast paced platforming race where you knock your opponents out with items found on the track, going off-screen results in death, and the last person alive wins the race.I'm not a multiplayer person at all, but I enjoy playing this competitively in ranked mode, or casually with friends. To my knowledge, there is no other game like this, so I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys platforming games.			"

								I found Speedrunners because some friends wanted to play it, so I picked it up and had a blast. The music was fantastic, the mechanics were solid and the controls were tight. Now that that's out of the way...This game is glitchy, sometimes game-breakingly so. It's not rare for someone to go into the blast zone and not die. The physics gets janky sometimes too, I remember sliding up a wall and then flying 300 feet in the air and instantly dying because of it. Also, some stages are very...random as to deciding who's in first, expecially when a player is able to do something that doesn't follow the regular path of a level. This makes it frustrating for experienced players who find shortcuts, because about 1/2 of the time they work and you win, or the game just decides to kill you. Glitches aside, there is a lot of variety in the maps and qualities unique to each one, but there's just too few of them. As of right now, there's only 9 stages to play in the whole game. Granted that the devs have done SOMETHING to try and solve this by allowing players to make custom stages publish them so that everyone else can play them too. In theory, that's a great idea, let the community make their own maps, and the good ones get upvoted and the bad ones will be lost to the sands of time. In reality, in a game where the only objective is to run around a stage the fastest, mediocre level design sticks out trememdously. Also, I am damn sick of Smash Bros remakes.Lag really isn't much of an issue, and if it just so happens someone is lagging, the chances are very small that their lag will decide the game. +1 Paragon.What would decide the yay or nay for me is very simple. ""Is there tension in this racing game?"" The answer is yes, gratuitous amounts of it. The individual skills of each player grinding against one another creates tension in itself, but there's also items that you can pick up. This monumentally increases the depth of the game. For casual players, most items are used immediately with moderate effect  which gives the game a mariokart-esque feel. At higher levels (which surprisingly enough isn't that hard to reach) items are held until the exact moment where that specific item is going to be most effective. There's also a bit of thoughtful game design which I really wish we had more of in games in general. There's also a bit of game design genius surrounding the Golden Claw, the most powerful item in the game, but I won't get into that.Movement is tighter than a longbow string, no doubt about that. This makes it so that when you lose, you have only yourself to blame. Or that one♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who used the Golden Hook RIGHT OVER THE SPIKES YOU SONOFA-Overall it's a fantastic game that's worth the ten bucks especially if you have some friends to play it with.			"

								Do you have ANY friends? Do you want tears of laughter? Then buy this game. The game is simple enough to learn in 10 seconds but hard enough to take quite a long time to master. Run, dodge and dodge again only to fail the third time, hook your enemies and imitate tarzan all the way. You may think that this would become a bit repetitive after some games but the addition of community-made tracks gives many more hours of hilarious gameplay. This game also has the quality of being a quickround game where you can indulge in 10 minute hilarious sessions without the need of any setting up. The characters could've been more though...UPDATEThey have added twice as many characters in a recent patch			"

								This game is far more fun and entertaining than I first thought when I got it. The idea is simplistic, 2d side scroller racing game, yet it has provided my friends and I hours of entertainment. It's great for LAN parties, where you can hear your friend rage at getting blown off the map by a bomb you set or being caught by your golden hook. The good:- Fun, fast paced gameplay- Well balanced items. None of the items seems overpowered and there is a way to dodge most of them if youre quick.- Wall jumping is well implemented and very smooth.- Grappling hook is fun.- Workshop level editor and the ability to play user created levels along with the official maps.- Ranked and unranked matchmaking, as well as the ability to make custom lobbies- Can use the keyboard (my preference) or game controllerNeeds Improvement:- Can be a bit glitchy sometimes, such as players teleporting through walls or floors, people winning when they weren't in first place sometimes, etc.- If your or your opponents internet connection or connection to the server isn't great it can cause your oppenents to teleport around the screen- Limited official maps. You go tend to memorize them pretty quickly.- Having to buy some of the characters is annoying, but understandable I suppose. Would be nice to have the ability to unlock them through gameplay- The single player campaign story is ok, but its kind of boring. Basically just a bunch of time trials (get to the bomb before it blows up) I don't have any ideas on how to make it better, but a little variety would go a long way.- The bots can be kind of dumb sometimes, running off the screen in the wrong direction or getting stuck at a paticular point and not being able to move past it.- The matchmaking needs a little work- Sometimes the ranked matches don't record your points properlyMost of the ""Needs Improvement"" section is just nitpicky stuff that I'm sure will be cleared up by full launch. I really have nothing bad to say about the game, and woudl definitely recomend playing it. It's easy to learn, takes time to master some of the techniques and is great to play with friends. Easily worth $10. If you can shell out $70+ for a carbon copy fps every year you can afford to drop $10 on this great game. "

												Speedrunners is a great game to play with friends, Speedrunners is a great game to play alone. No matter how you play it, speedrunners is a great game worth every penny. Don't be discouraged by the fact that it's still in early acess, because it still has a decent amount of developer maps, and a seemingly infinite stream of good player created maps. I have played for quite a while, and the only bug i have encountered out of all the games I've played, was a small item glitch, and that should say something. If you haven't already bought it, stop trying to convince yourself not to and buy it!TLDR: early acess? yes. no quality content worth your money? ABSOLUTLEY NOT "

												The perfect party game for classic platforming fans, yet easy enough to master for new players, SpeedRunners has a bit of everything that will keep you and your friends addicted. Watch out for items (which can be toggled on or off) as well as the  continuously shrinking screen. The best comparison I can think of is Wii U's Runbow.			"

								   I got this game because others have played it over YouTube, but once I saw that I could play as a girl dressed up as a fox, I threw my money at the screen to buy this game, and don't even get me started on once I found out about that orange skin for Lucky Cat. With the use of grappling hooks, boost pads, and a mulititude of different items to slow down the competition, (those confounded golden hooks) this makes for an epic leg race around the track.   I'd recommend it to anyone who knows how to react quickly and who also has a large memory for knowing where things are on different tracks.			"

It is addicting and nice.The game is quite nice & it's up to 4 players max per match / lobby. You can gain power-ups during the map & you can ""destroy"" your friends with it. Well not exactly destroy, but slow them down & they might die if they disappear out of the screen.The game is really nice, but it is still in early access so it has some bugs, but overall, you should REALLY give this game a try.

								Speedrunners, it's a fast paced indie game that's currently in beta. This game offers great gameplay with some bugs here and there. It's also very competitive, has good music, creative characters and ends friendships. This game also includes a level builder and some of your favorite youtubers. I would recommend this to anyone who likes competitive multiplayer and can handle the intensity of this game. Hope you like this review and Speedrunners.			"

								Great party game. It has fast-paced action and replayability similar to Mario Kart, but with an interesting take on the conventional gameplay often seen in the genre. I'm not a great fan of the art style and I do feel the game's interface is clunky at times. It's also hard to distinguish between certain characters and for some maps it's hard to spot the proper route, even after a couple of rounds.But key component for any party game is strong gameplay and SpeedRunners has that in abundance. Although it's certainly not the perfect game, it is highly enjoyable.			"

								Speed is everything!! :D Well this ia a really nice game - still in beta stages but playable - with a lot of excitement.If you enjoy games like Bit Trip Runner, Super Meat Boy, VVVVVV i'm sure you will enjoy SpeedRunners. About this game, is main feature is the online here you play against 3 others players to see who finish first. It also has a Single Player component but is week, it has 4 world with 5 levels each.Since is in beta stages there is still a considerable amount of bugs but i'm sure they will be fix in the final release. I recommend you get this but not at full price, is not worth it.~ 6.5/10PS: Usain bolt must love this game x)			"

								Let's face it, Speed running is a thing. It has exploded in popularity thanks to YouTube and Twitch, and has even spawned gaming charities. It was only a matter of time before a game based around this phenomena was released. While there is a decent single-player component to the game, the real light shines when you take it online and join in with the community. It's fast-paced mayhem with plenty of strategy involved. Not only will you develop your own playing style, but it will have to change on the fly depending on the level as well as the strategies of the other players. This might be why I love this game so much - you have to prepare for constant change.			"

								Scream at the screen as you try to get ahead of your opponents with an arsenal of weapons and instigation. It is fun with friends and strangers alike. The editor gives it a lot of replay value and there is nothing like it! The violent-free game is a nice coffee-break game from the other stuff you fill your head with.			"

								Speedrunners is probably one of the most addictive games out here on steam. I've seen alot of streams before I decided to buy this great, amusing/entertaining game title. First of, I've started with some of the singleplayer missions which, in my opinion, are not necessary to get into the real multiplayer gameplay. Mutliplayer is fun, you can either do custom matches or hop in into ranked matches directly. I've played 80% of my gametime with friends in custom matches, beside normal maps we've tried maps from the workshop - some were good, some more like mehhhh. Anyways, if you've ever played this game, you won't stop playing it. I just stopped playing it because my friends got bored by me beating them :pSpeedrunners is often for sale, just come back regularly and check the price - I woudl recommend buying it for the normal price, but as a student I feel anyone else in the same situation where money is rare. Anyways, the game is worth the 10 bucks - Buy it, love it, get addicted to it.			"

												I used to go for a morning jog every day, then the Communist Robot Pirate Army decided that everyone should be fat. I was very displeased at first, until I found out that Steam exists. I really wanted to find a running game since I could no longer run. I found SpeedRunners, and I can safely say that this game made me want to kill myself. My friends say I'm so good at SpeedRunners, so they all quit talking to me because I was such a God. Kim Jong Un found out about it and challenged me to a duel. I used the golden grapple ability move and pulled him into the spikes. Bad idea. He exiled me from North Korea and I had to suck off the Canadian Prime Minister in order to become a citizen there. Now I can have my morning jog every day, and I can play the occasional game of SpeedRunners with my friends and Kim Jong Un.			"

								This is the new Mario Kart/Smash Bros for Steam, but instead of swearing at one screen together with your friends you get to hear your friends swearing on voice chat while you screw each other over with grappling hooks.The level design is great, the character design is great, the controls are great.There are a few kinks being early access and the menus and level/character select can be finicky but everything else is fantasticI give it  ""ANOTHER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GRAPPLING HOOK!?!"" out of 10			"

												Don't buy this. It's 15 dollars for a game thats fun for about 3 hours. Not to mention, you unlock characters/levels/items through leveling up, and this game literally has one of the slowest level up systems ever. It takes up to 50 matches to go up one level, and one match can be anywhere between 2 minutes to 20 minutes. The online community is full of incredibly toxic people and annoying kids who won't stop spamming the chat with ""♥♥♥♥ing hackers, stop using the golden hookshot!"". The maps are very bland and short, and despite the fact there are about 25 or so maps, only 4-5 ever get chosen. The ranked matchmaking system makes no sense and unfairly places people, no matter how many matches you win or lose. The art style is simple and sleek, and I do like the art style, but the interesting artistic style is wasted on the poor character designs. Look up some of the characters, and just see how ugly they look, not just in game, but also in their menu screen images/round win images. Characters like the Japanese cat, Sherlock Bones and the Shark are just painful to look at (I just call them by what they are, because I'm not taking the time to remember the names of over 30 hideous characters).The servers on online are also terrible. Every 1/20 games you play or so you will have nobody that lags. Every single game, everybody is lagging, or someone is lagging out the server, or the game is glitching. It also doesn't help that there are only at one time about 1600-1800 people online, and despite that it tries its best to pair you in the same server multiple times. I played a match in which it was me and 2 other people. I managed to beat the other person, but the camera was stuck on an AFK player, playing Skullduggery. I couldn't even see my character, yet i was alive, and I ended up just being stuck and running around. After about 2 minutes, I just exploded and Skullduggery won. The game is incredibly buggy, full of toxic children, and people that shout ""HACKER"" at good players, and every once and a while a legitmate hacker shows up and ruins the fun. Seriously though, over 40 characters, over 20 maps, and yet almost every character is poorly designed and only 4-5 maps are chosen? Barely any content, stupid, overpriced game with overpriced sell-out ""YOUTUBE POPULAR MEME!"" DLC, and overall I just can't recommend this game. It's too small, has no playerbase, and has very little content. Fun for about 3-4 hours. It sucks that I played for 3 hours and 10 minutes, because if i didn't spend that 10 minutes I would definetly request a refund.			"

								Memory based running game... not really ""racing"".This game is more of a memory game than a ""racing"" game. The game handicaps players for being faster or pulling ahead of others.  The game's camera will only really follow the second place runner, so if you're in first place, you're running blind (at which point you hit obstacles, traps, and other pitfalls.)  The game punishes 1st place runners, and offers endless ""catch up"" opportunities for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place.Basically, if this were a racing game, it would be the equivalent of a car racing game where the further ahead you were in 1st place, the darker your screen gets; until pitch black.  It's a very fun game, but the camera handicapping the 1st place runner is enough to make me dislike it.			"

												Speedrunners is nothing more than a cheaply made, terribly produced, and poorly functioning sonic the hedghog rip-off. I mean just thunk about it. The main guy is sonic, and everyone is also sonic! It's like they're stealing food right out of poor sega's starving mouth. How could they ever think to do such a thing!!!!1!!21!! I mean lets look at the gameplay. What do you do> GO FAST! What does sonic do? Go fast? WHAT? A COINKYDINK? I DONT THINK SO! DO YOU?! Next up we got graphics, and you can twll with this one based off of the colours and all of the shading as well as the pixels that they were going for a sega megasis look from the originol Sonic 1. Clearly a rip off. Next up we got story. It is clearly mocking the early sonic trend of having literally no story, I mean cooommme oooon. At this point the only thing this has above sonic is that you can race with other, slightly different coloured sonics. Next up, is sound. Musics good 10/10			"

												No game is playable if the mechanics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thankfully, SpeedRunners game mechanics are pretty great, some glitches in maps under special circumstances (SuperSpeed is huge for breaking maps) but overall definitely a game I'd recommend picking up, however, only if on sale. I don't think this game is worth near $20 given there's DLC that can definitely push your wallet overboard. Pick it up on sale or through a friend.Another fix needed would have to be ping problems while on competitive. Place a max ping so those rubberbanding don't get a free shot at winning because the others hooked a rubber banding player. Just not fair.9/10, overpriced and a tad bugged but totally a great play.

								Excellent game.A combination of simple controls, fast gameplay, and a competitive (yet easy to learn) atmosphere makes this game difficult to put down once you start. The constant urge to improve allows for high tension games where you'll be on the edge of your seat at all times. If your group of friends (or yourself) are looking for an excellent party game SpeedRunners is a great choice.See you in-game!			"

								Saw a few 'tubers playing this game and liked the idea behind it, picked up a four pack and for past week or more, me and friends have not put this game down or even become tired of it one bit.Very addictive multiplayer features, nice selection of base maps and also plenty of community made gems in the lists as well.Controller suppport is seamless, online has had very few hiccups, and even the single player maps are good for getting the hang of jumps, grappling angles etc10/10 Would grapple my friends into spike walls for cheap wins again.

												I like this game alot, but thats not all! here, have a baking recipe for fried chicken(for those who are smart enough to realise i said ""bake"" instead of ""cook"". Congratulations)Ingredients3 eggs1/3 cup waterAbout 1 cup hot red pepper sauce (recommended: Texas Pete)2 cups self-rising flour1 teaspoon pepperHouse seasoning, recipe follows1 (1 to 2 1/2-pound) chicken, cut into piecesOil, for frying, preferably peanut oilHouse Seasoning:1 cup salt1/4 cup black pepper1/4 cup garlic powderADD CHECKED ITEMS TO GROCERY LISTDirectionsIn a medium size bowl, beat the eggs with the water. Add enough hot sauce so the egg mixture is bright orange. In another bowl, combine the flour and pepper. Season the chicken with the house seasoning. Dip the seasoned chicken in the egg, and then coat well in the flour mixture.Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep pot. Do not fill the pot more than 1/2 full with oil.Fry the chicken in the oil until brown and crisp. Dark meat takes longer than white meat. It should take dark meat about 13 to 14 minutes, white meat around 8 to 10 minutes.House Seasoning:Mix ingredients together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months.got this recipe from: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/southern-fried-chicken-recipe.htmlEnjoy			"

								SpeedRunners is a mainly a multiplayer runner in which the goal is to run off the screen and leave the other players/bots in the dust. There's many obstacles in the way such as items from other players/bots, spikes, and sometimes the map it self. There's things that hold it back though, and I'll talk about them as well. Single-Player When I first launched SpeedRunners singleplayer I played it for a bit before going back to playing with my friends, I didn't touch it since. When was this you maybe asking? This summer (2014). So that's telling you 2 things: 1) my experience wasn't very good (this might also might make you think about buying it if you're planning to play it SP alot) and 2) My experience and thoughts aren't very fresh. Now you know this, I'll go on to my SP review.The singleplayer side isn't very good. You can play with bot, or some little missions. The missions are only fun for a bit but then, you'll be wanting to play with people soon after. I played with bots but I don't get the same laughs or great fun I get with real players.  Multi-Player Ah, the meat and potatoes of the game, the multiplayer. This games biggest feature is the multiplayer. I spent pretty much all my time playing online  with friends  . The multiplayer contains: online with friends, online with randoms, and local. There's more to talk about so I'll break up the 3 big ways of multiplayer.Online w/ Friends- Playing this game with friends and talking to each other on Skype/Teamspeak/Mumble is the best way to play this game. It goes along so prefectly that I really think this game should be bundled with Skype/Teamspeak/Mumble. The game itself online with friends without any voice chat opened will make the game become stale fast. The game will just turn into playing with bots and (maybe) some lag. If your planning on playing with friends, your most likely going to talk on a voice chat anyways.Online w/ Strangers- Sorry I can't really give out much about this mode becuase, I really haven't played this mode at all. But it's pretty much the same as playing with friends w/o voice chat and I also belive that some of the match  customization is gone.Local- Again. haven't played much of this mode to fully give you my opinions on it. As of right now, I'm guessing this is the one of the best ways to play with friends becuase, it'll cut away the potential lag and plus, gaming localy is always fun. Verdict The game's biggest thing holding it up is the gameplay with friends. If your not planning on playing this game with friends there's also online with strangers or singleplayer options but, if your planing on playing this w/o friends I wouldn't recomend this game at all. It's not worth the $11 price tag. 7/10  Please don't just look just this review, there's better reviews out there that show more than me  "

The reason why you can´t stop playing SpeedRunners...isn´t just as easy to answer ;) A few weeks ago we stumbled across the Steam sale of SpeedRunners. Since then I spent some time improving my racing skills on that game (sharp tongues assert that there is no improvement ;-) )  Tzzz! Ok, the game is really hard to play against opponents online within the league sytem. But I would highly reccomend it playing against friends and family. A few days ago I had a close race against my husband. If you´re interested watch the video below. Sorry, it is in German but it has English subtitles. Anyway, it´s a good way to see the variety of maps, weapons, traps and gameplay if you´re deciding whether to buy it or not. There are also a lot of custom maps avalaible. It seems like there is a highly active community. Definitely a game to keep in mind! See you there! tRini

								Excellent game.A combination of simple controls, fast gameplay, and a competitive (yet easy to learn) atmosphere makes this game difficult to put down once you start. The constant urge to improve allows for high tension games where you'll be on the edge of your seat at all times. If your group of friends (or yourself) are looking for an excellent party game SpeedRunners is a great choice.See you in-game!			"

								SpeedRunners is a mainly a multiplayer runner in which the goal is to run off the screen and leave the other players/bots in the dust. There's many obstacles in the way such as items from other players/bots, spikes, and sometimes the map it self. There's things that hold it back though, and I'll talk about them as well. Single-Player When I first launched SpeedRunners singleplayer I played it for a bit before going back to playing with my friends, I didn't touch it since. When was this you maybe asking? This summer (2014). So that's telling you 2 things: 1) my experience wasn't very good (this might also might make you think about buying it if you're planning to play it SP alot) and 2) My experience and thoughts aren't very fresh. Now you know this, I'll go on to my SP review.The singleplayer side isn't very good. You can play with bot, or some little missions. The missions are only fun for a bit but then, you'll be wanting to play with people soon after. I played with bots but I don't get the same laughs or great fun I get with real players.  Multi-Player Ah, the meat and potatoes of the game, the multiplayer. This games biggest feature is the multiplayer. I spent pretty much all my time playing online  with friends  . The multiplayer contains: online with friends, online with randoms, and local. There's more to talk about so I'll break up the 3 big ways of multiplayer.Online w/ Friends- Playing this game with friends and talking to each other on Skype/Teamspeak/Mumble is the best way to play this game. It goes along so prefectly that I really think this game should be bundled with Skype/Teamspeak/Mumble. The game itself online with friends without any voice chat opened will make the game become stale fast. The game will just turn into playing with bots and (maybe) some lag. If your planning on playing with friends, your most likely going to talk on a voice chat anyways.Online w/ Strangers- Sorry I can't really give out much about this mode becuase, I really haven't played this mode at all. But it's pretty much the same as playing with friends w/o voice chat and I also belive that some of the match  customization is gone.Local- Again. haven't played much of this mode to fully give you my opinions on it. As of right now, I'm guessing this is the one of the best ways to play with friends becuase, it'll cut away the potential lag and plus, gaming localy is always fun. Verdict The game's biggest thing holding it up is the gameplay with friends. If your not planning on playing this game with friends there's also online with strangers or singleplayer options but, if your planing on playing this w/o friends I wouldn't recomend this game at all. It's not worth the $11 price tag. 7/10  Please don't just look just this review, there's better reviews out there that show more than me  "

The reason why you can´t stop playing SpeedRunners...isn´t just as easy to answer ;) A few weeks ago we stumbled across the Steam sale of SpeedRunners. Since then I spent some time improving my racing skills on that game (sharp tongues assert that there is no improvement ;-) )  Tzzz! Ok, the game is really hard to play against opponents online within the league sytem. But I would highly reccomend it playing against friends and family. A few days ago I had a close race against my husband. If you´re interested watch the video below. Sorry, it is in German but it has English subtitles. Anyway, it´s a good way to see the variety of maps, weapons, traps and gameplay if you´re deciding whether to buy it or not. There are also a lot of custom maps avalaible. It seems like there is a highly active community. Definitely a game to keep in mind! See you there! tRini

								SpeedRunners: Gotta Go FastSpeedRunners is a 2-D Race Battle game that pits you and three friends (or Random Online Gamers) against each other to see who can best out-run, out-trick, and out-trap.You start off by picking one of the four characters you want to play as. There is no real difference in who you choose, as this game is all about the skill of the person playing. Once everyone has decided, the stage must be selected. Each zone/level is comprised of different layouts, paths, and ways to get around. From lasers to platform triggers to speed boost paths and beyond, this little game has a surprising amount of awesome contained within. From left to right, the stages increase in complexity, with the first stage being simple & memorable and the last stage being somewhat frustrating.Sometimes upon start, a ""wheel of fortune"" style level mod will pop up, but as far as i've been able to see, it is completely randomized. It has the possible outcomes of: Increased Speed, All Items Are Grab Claws, or Rockets Raining Down From The Skies. Speed is fun, Grab Claws make the match very tricky, and Rockets are pretty annoying.After the 3,2,1, you're off. (On a personal side-note, I highly recommend playing this game using an Xbox 360 wired controller as opposed to the keyboard. It is by far easier.) Characters have several different abilities: Jump, Double Jump, Slide, Use Item, Swing Grapple, and Speed Boost. All of these being mastered are absolutely essential to winning, but without a doubt, timing is the most crucial asset. Swing Grapple at the right time for a speed boost, slide under a wall to take a quicker path, speed boost when your opponents are far behind, you name it. There are numerous strategies of ways to win, and most come with experience & learning the layout of the stages. In order to win, opponent players have to fall behind/get caught off-screen. The first person to acquire three wins in the winner.-------------------------------------Overall Ratings-------------------------------------*Gameplay: (9/10) - Smooth & Fun.*Graphics: (7/10) - Not too much on the design/some empty feeling areas, but on the flip side, that prevents distractions.*Sound: (7/10) - Generic sounds & music, but they can get you pumped for the race.*Character Designs: (8/10) - Definitely some unique choices.*Stage Layouts: (7/10) - Some are more frustrating than fun.*Items & Weapons: (9/10) - Add fantastic strategy to the game. *Replayability: (10/10) - If it keeps your interest, all you do is replay it.*Fun Factor: (9/10) - Overall, this game is fantastic. I'm always down for a few rounds.Quick Matches, Fun Gameplay, Endless Replayability, Clever Weapons & Items, and a great original game like nothing i've ever played before make for a fantastic gaming experience.~9/10~			"

								Saw this game randomly on a video and thought it would be a nice little fun game. Little did I know that every emotion I knew I had would be coming out of me at every instance this game offers. The game's premise goes off the main title: You are speedrunners. Your goal: to run speed-ily. The mechanics are very close to being a 2D MarioKart. So slap on three other friends and you're having yourself a yell-fest. Tension, frustration, sadness and joy are all had (Just trying to connect sometimes!). The item balance isn't always perfect but if you know the maps well enough you can come back from almost anything. I highly recommend this game to friends that play in a group of 3-4 people, it's given us more than enough replayability.			"

								While the recently added single player adds a lot of fun and allows you to learn the basics (and not so basics if you want to get a mean score), this game is clearly more suited for couch co-op. Having weapons that not only speed you up but slow others down is fertile ground for yelling at people near you. It's really cleverly balanced too, because as everyone shares the same screen, the person in the lead can see the least amount of screen and therefore must simply react to what the level gives them, instead of purposefully moving in the fastest route.Looking forward to having some more stuff to do online (stat tracking etc) but I've got high hopes as most of the work seems to be done.

								Possibly one of the most hectic games I've ever played, yet one of the most strategic.  The music is also completely amazing.  The only real complaints I would have are that there isn't more amazing music in the game, and the fact that the stages can get a little bit buggy at times, though that's very far and few between.  Despite it being an Early Access game, it sure seems like a full release, and I would be completely content if the game's content stayed how it is.  Though, this means that anything new added to the game is just better and better.			"

								SpeedRunner. Ooooooh boy...What a game.First, let's start off with the good things. The grappling system is really, really fun to use. The races are fast paced. The items, while all of them very useful, have ways you can block them, so they never seem unfair. The maps are well design with many ways to get ahead of the competition. The occasional gamemode roulette always adds some variety to matches.There are some bad things, however. While there five characters at the moment, and each of them has 4 color variants, they don't differ themselves gameplay-wise. Conection issues can be a problem as well. And there are several gamemode roulettes that are really annoying, such as the one called ""SpeedRapture,"" where missiles rain down from the skies. However, there aren't a whole lot of bad things wrong with this game.Overall, I really enjoy this game. 8/10.			"

								Often times I tell myself that I will only go for a round or two and end up playing for about an hour or more. This game is, once you've learned the basics, addictive as heck. The comic style looks fantastic, there isn't much variety in music as of now but I hope this will change with time, seeing as it's Early Access. Mechanically, everything is intact, however some of the backend still needs work. For example, there's trouble with disconnects and lag in game, leading to (sometimes) unwinnable rounds that only end when you quit. Let's hope that this gets fixed, as this is definitely a game to look out for!			"

								Grappling hooks are the finest form of movement in games, and thus in life (followed closely by jetpacks). The developers of Speedrunners recognise this and have thus created a masterpiece in pick up and play design with a meaty core.

Admittedly, one's enjoyment is increased by many orders of magnitude when playing with friends.Unlike many games under the Early Access banner this is no lazy alpha.

												No game is playable if the mechanics are♥♥♥♥♥♥ Thankfully, SpeedRunners game mechanics are pretty great, some glitches in maps under special circumstances (SuperSpeed is huge for breaking maps) but overall definitely a game I'd recommend picking up, however, only if on sale. I don't think this game is worth near $20 given there's DLC that can definitely push your wallet overboard. Pick it up on sale or through a friend.Another fix needed would have to be ping problems while on competitive. Place a max ping so those rubberbanding don't get a free shot at winning because the others hooked a rubber banding player. Just not fair.9/10, overpriced and a tad bugged but totally a great play.

								SpeedRunners is a mainly a multiplayer runner in which the goal is to run off the screen and leave the other players/bots in the dust. There's many obstacles in the way such as items from other players/bots, spikes, and sometimes the map it self. There's things that hold it back though, and I'll talk about them as well. Single-Player When I first launched SpeedRunners singleplayer I played it for a bit before going back to playing with my friends, I didn't touch it since. When was this you maybe asking? This summer (2014). So that's telling you 2 things: 1) my experience wasn't very good (this might also might make you think about buying it if you're planning to play it SP alot) and 2) My experience and thoughts aren't very fresh. Now you know this, I'll go on to my SP review.The singleplayer side isn't very good. You can play with bot, or some little missions. The missions are only fun for a bit but then, you'll be wanting to play with people soon after. I played with bots but I don't get the same laughs or great fun I get with real players.  Multi-Player Ah, the meat and potatoes of the game, the multiplayer. This games biggest feature is the multiplayer. I spent pretty much all my time playing online  with friends  . The multiplayer contains: online with friends, online with randoms, and local. There's more to talk about so I'll break up the 3 big ways of multiplayer.Online w/ Friends- Playing this game with friends and talking to each other on Skype/Teamspeak/Mumble is the best way to play this game. It goes along so prefectly that I really think this game should be bundled with Skype/Teamspeak/Mumble. The game itself online with friends without any voice chat opened will make the game become stale fast. The game will just turn into playing with bots and (maybe) some lag. If your planning on playing with friends, your most likely going to talk on a voice chat anyways.Online w/ Strangers- Sorry I can't really give out much about this mode becuase, I really haven't played this mode at all. But it's pretty much the same as playing with friends w/o voice chat and I also belive that some of the match  customization is gone.Local- Again. haven't played much of this mode to fully give you my opinions on it. As of right now, I'm guessing this is the one of the best ways to play with friends becuase, it'll cut away the potential lag and plus, gaming localy is always fun. Verdict The game's biggest thing holding it up is the gameplay with friends. If your not planning on playing this game with friends there's also online with strangers or singleplayer options but, if your planing on playing this w/o friends I wouldn't recomend this game at all. It's not worth the $11 price tag. 7/10  Please don't just look just this review, there's better reviews out there that show more than me  "

The reason why you can´t stop playing SpeedRunners...isn´t just as easy to answer ;) A few weeks ago we stumbled across the Steam sale of SpeedRunners. Since then I spent some time improving my racing skills on that game (sharp tongues assert that there is no improvement ;-) )  Tzzz! Ok, the game is really hard to play against opponents online within the league sytem. But I would highly reccomend it playing against friends and family. A few days ago I had a close race against my husband. If you´re interested watch the video below. Sorry, it is in German but it has English subtitles. Anyway, it´s a good way to see the variety of maps, weapons, traps and gameplay if you´re deciding whether to buy it or not. There are also a lot of custom maps avalaible. It seems like there is a highly active community. Definitely a game to keep in mind! See you there! tRini

								The Best: ~ Multiplayer: The competition amongt friends and randoms is amazing. ~ Item Variation: The different tactics on using items (when and where). ~ Levels: Enjoy the variations in level design and routes to beat the competition. The Okay: ~ Sometimes unstable score reporting for Origins. Got a higher score but never sent it to the server. ~ Maybe it is just me but the different characters have a different feel. Recommendations:All in all the game is great multiplayer game and a great time-trial aspect with Origins. An added feature that I would love to see is to disable the items to see the true potential of people running the maps. Sometimes too much chaos is a bad thing.LOVE THE GAME.			"

								I love platformers. I love local multiplayer games. I love this freaking game. Even with it being early access it is very polished. As people have mentioned, this totally brings me back to the days of playing Smash Bros. ans Mario Kart. Crazy competition, people yelling back and forth, beer being spilled from wild flailing. There are some excellent design decisions made here.The way a player wins a ""round"" is genius and leads to incredibly tense moments every 30 seconds. The powerups are also well done and perfectly compliment the rest of the gameplay.I can't wait to see where the devs take this concept. They've really got something fun and unique here.			"

												The community is what makes this game the most fun. Mostly fun in the lower ranks, and maybe it's overly competetive in the upper ranks. I'd play it more if I had friends locally who'd get together and play in the same room. This is similar but maybe less inviting than Mario Kart, in that it requires seasoned players some patience and grace to make this game fun for anyone who is playing for their first time.			"

								SpeedRunner. Ooooooh boy...What a game.First, let's start off with the good things. The grappling system is really, really fun to use. The races are fast paced. The items, while all of them very useful, have ways you can block them, so they never seem unfair. The maps are well design with many ways to get ahead of the competition. The occasional gamemode roulette always adds some variety to matches.There are some bad things, however. While there five characters at the moment, and each of them has 4 color variants, they don't differ themselves gameplay-wise. Conection issues can be a problem as well. And there are several gamemode roulettes that are really annoying, such as the one called ""SpeedRapture,"" where missiles rain down from the skies. However, there aren't a whole lot of bad things wrong with this game.Overall, I really enjoy this game. 8/10.			"

								Often times I tell myself that I will only go for a round or two and end up playing for about an hour or more. This game is, once you've learned the basics, addictive as heck. The comic style looks fantastic, there isn't much variety in music as of now but I hope this will change with time, seeing as it's Early Access. Mechanically, everything is intact, however some of the backend still needs work. For example, there's trouble with disconnects and lag in game, leading to (sometimes) unwinnable rounds that only end when you quit. Let's hope that this gets fixed, as this is definitely a game to look out for!			"

								Grappling hooks are the finest form of movement in games, and thus in life (followed closely by jetpacks). The developers of Speedrunners recognise this and have thus created a masterpiece in pick up and play design with a meaty core. Few things embody the old adage of 'easy to learn, difficult to master' quite so well as this fine game. Admittedly, one's enjoyment is increased by many orders of magnitude when playing with friends.Unlike many games under the Early Access banner this is no lazy alpha. All the important elements are here and the developers frequently add to the experience, responding quickly to bug reports and player feedback.			"

								The Best: ~ Multiplayer: The competition amongt friends and randoms is amazing. ~ Item Variation: The different tactics on using items (when and where). ~ Levels: Enjoy the variations in level design and routes to beat the competition. The Okay: ~ Sometimes unstable score reporting for Origins. Got a higher score but never sent it to the server. ~ Maybe it is just me but the different characters have a different feel. Recommendations:All in all the game is great multiplayer game and a great time-trial aspect with Origins. An added feature that I would love to see is to disable the items to see the true potential of people running the maps. Sometimes too much chaos is a bad thing.LOVE THE GAME.			"

												This game is a great game for parties (You can play local with controllers for twice the fun). This game can and cant be competitive you decide. Sadly you need gamers to play this game if you are a gamer yourself this is because you absolutely smash them XD  (If you like teasing and killing plebs this is the game for you!!!!)			"

												Spent over 10 hours playing this with my friends (don't mind the playtime on my account, spent most of the time playing this on my friends's PC) and believe me, this game is an endless fun generator.You may think it gets boring over time since there's nothing new to discover or to do but no. Original characters, cool power-ups, great levels (thank you based Steam Workshop), and addictive as hell gameplay. You polish your skills with every run and the more experienced you get, the more intense the battles between you and your friends get. And that's what makes this game fun. Many would say this is a pretty much skill-based game but the best thing about it is that skill doesn't matter here as long as one mistake / competent power-up (even the ones which some players may find useless) usage may change the situation completely. Local versus mode makes it even more fun than it already is. We spent the whole night playing this game with my friends  and just couldn't stop. I hope you'll like it just as we did. If you need something to play with friends - get this without any hesitation. You won't regret it, ok?			"

								Do not buy unless you are in possesion of a gamepad and up to 3 friends you want to throw in the dirt with your superior racing skills.It's a good game for what it is and it delivers superbly.A 2D sidescroll racer which lightens the competetive heart of everyone who plays it and with taunts that tear friendships apart. A variety of tools, depending on how you use them, to either help you win or lose a match by your own hands.Challenging maps and the ability to create your own hellish maps to fullfill your dirty and wicked fantasy.For a seemingly small game the online multiplayer capabilies are existing AND working! That's something not every DEV can be proud of.Facit: buy a 4 player pack in the next sale, lure your friends to play with you with the intention to make them regret they did.#Wurf #FriendshipBroken			"

There are various items that you can pick up and use against your opponents (similar to the Mario Kart games) that add to the enjoyment of the game. It also gives you the option of playing a race with various different rules such as all pickups are one particular item, or everybody runs super fast, or the course is flipped around. You can select a specific rule or you can have a wheel spin before the race and the wheel selects what the special rule is. Or you can just play the game normally with no special rules. If you're looking for something in the racing genre that's a little different, and also enjoyable to play (especially with family and friends), I highly recommend SpeedRunners			"

								Pros: Speedrunners installs super fast. It's fun, very fast-paced, and really cutthroat (which makes it more fun.) :DVery colorful, nice art style. Nice music/sound effects. Seems like it will run on just about anything.Cons: Controls take a little while to get used to, as it's all keyboard. Set your controls from the main menu, not in game!(it doesn't like to save your settings every time otherwise.)Sound's a little broken sometimes, but nothing that really effects gameplay.Overall: Totally worth the money for how addictive it is.

Seems like it will run on just about anything.Cons: Controls take a little while to get used to, as it's all keyboard. Set your controls from the main menu, not in game!(it doesn't like to save your settings every time otherwise.)Sound's a little broken sometimes, but nothing that really effects gameplay.Overall: Totally worth the money for how addictive it is. GET IT! :D			"

								This is my 3rd review on this game as it is constantly improving.  My original review was a ""not recommend"" and they have already fixed most of my original gripes.  I highly recommend this game for anybody that is competitive that enjoys a tough challenge.PROS:  Very competitive onlineSkill depth (look up Taters McShit on youtube)Fun and Addictive for any skill levelCONS:Items Ruin Ranked - This is a biggie for me.  Basically the cheesier you play, the more you'll win and the saltier your opponent will be.  I think this is cancerous for the community and probably why so few people play this game.  Small Community - I find myself playing the same people every day. A lot of the time, nobody's online so I get mis-matched with players that are either way better than me, or way worse than me.Join Lag - If you're in a race and someone joins, the game lags out and will usually cost you the round.  Very frusterating.SUGGESTION:Make ranked matches without items.  Or atleast make it to where people can choose their own item settings and item options are randomly chosen between player's preferences each game.  Or you could reward people with extra rank up points for using no items.  It would also be great if there was a way to tech hitstun from an item (kinda like smash) to get up faster if executed properly.  Either way, their should be a way to offset the items.  Look at any game that has items/pickups (smash bros, mario kart, Halo, TF, etc.).  All of those games competitive ruleset is to play without items/pickups.  By forcing people to play with items on, you're closing the door to more potential players.			"

the ranked game matchmaking is so trash that it doesn't work.i'm beginner league, rank 2 (doesn't really fit for me honestly, because i joined in late), and i get paired with someone 3-4 ranks above me.i lose most of the time of course, but even when i lose i gain ELO.also half the time the ""winning moves"" are really just exploits that weren't really planned to be used in the orginal mappros:- fun racing game with friends.- skill impacts (WAY) more than RNG, item drops.- made it out of early access, i guess that's kind of a pro.cons:- camera is literally so attrocious, it's a joke. and because the camera matters in win/lose situations, it's kind of a key element, and doesn't really pair well when ♥♥♥♥ed in the other direction.- (VERY) easilly exploited.- matchmaking works half the time.- limited gameplay.- you can gain and lose ELO from playing workshop maps in ranked, which aren't usually played for obvious reasons, and to add insult to injury, you don't even gain XP from playing these maps in non-competitive modes. please remove workshop maps from ranked pool.- very small base of players (<750 when i play, peak is usually 800).is it a bad game? not entirely, more like a ""the community makes it bad"" kinda game.it's definately worth the money, if it's on sale. also, if you don't have friends to play it with, it'll be way less fun. are more cons than pros a bad thing? not always. like i said, friends make this game 10x more fun.beta was a blast, release was somewhat underwhelming, and still kinda feels like a beta game, with several bugs.

												Speedrunners is the best: Racing, Obstacle and Speedrunning game I have played in a while. This game is incredible and it is by far, my favourite competitive multiplayer game. It has a very nice gameplay but has been brought down by the lack of connection to almost every player although I have low ping on countries around the world in games like CSGO and Rust. I am hoping this will be improved and the community will grow. Want to find out what I think of this Audio - I think the explosions and soundtrack is very intense, especially in ranked. I think they need to add some other audio tracks instead of having the exact same one every level i play. It does get annoying quite a lot so. I rate Audio 7/10. Gameplay - There are 4 game modes and over 10 different game add-ons (i.e Lethal Spikes). Practice, Casual, Ranked and Story. The goal of each level is to outrun your competitors and outrun them out of the screen. Once they are off screen, they are dead. There are also power ups which could be like; missiles, grappling hook, fireball, freeze ray, drill etc. These make the game intense but for every single powerup, there is a way to dodge it. For example, if there is a grappling hook coming out of nowhere, all you have to do is press the slide key and you can dodge it. There are many obstacles like blocks which you have to slide under, spikes that if you land on them you are stunned and more. Finally, we have game add-ons. These can be acquired by levelling up. This means while ingame (practice or online), the host can put these on. For example, ‘Lethal spikes’ means that if you land on the spike, you die. Characters - There is not much to say here. While levelling up, you also unlock new characters and skins. When you start, you are given the default 4 characters. Comrade, Unic, Hothead and Speedrunner. While levelling up, you also get characters like Neko. There is one thing i found out recently. If you do a command like ‘/gangbeast’ or ‘/wolf’ you get characters from different games. /gangbeast gives you all the colour gang beasts from the silly physics game. ‘/wolf’ ‘/dallas’ ‘/houston’ and more give you the famous characters from the Payday series.Trails - There is hardly anything to say. When you start off, you get the normal boring trail which is your character moving fast. BUT, If you go to the trail store or community store, you can buy trails like i have and others like ‘Angel’ and ‘Spectrum’ and ‘Unic’. In the store, they range from £0.79 / $1 but in the community hub, they range from £0.49 / $0.70 - £1.49 / $2. These are recommended if you want to look like a famous player.Graphics / Visuals - The visuals are really nice and smooth. They have no pixels and look very well designed.+ Good graphics+ Good Sound Effects+ Incredible Gameplay+ Fun obstacles+ Many Gamemodes+ Secret Characters+ Many Characters+ Cheap Character Trail+ Not many microtransactions required (unless you want the Youtuber packs)+ Difficult but fun- Repetitive Audio- Terrible Connections- A ton of hackersOverall, 9.5/10 game "

												Speedrunners is the best: Racing, Obstacle and Speedrunning game I have played in a while. This game is incredible and it is by far, my favourite competitive multiplayer game. It has a very nice gameplay but has been brought down by the lack of connection to almost every player although I have low ping on countries around the world in games like CSGO and Rust. I am hoping this will be improved and the community will grow. Want to find out what I think of this Audio - I think the explosions and soundtrack is very intense, especially in ranked. I think they need to add some other audio tracks instead of having the exact same one every level i play. It does get annoying quite a lot so. I rate Audio 7/10. Gameplay - There are 4 game modes and over 10 different game add-ons (i.e Lethal Spikes). Practice, Casual, Ranked and Story. The goal of each level is to outrun your competitors and outrun them out of the screen. Once they are off screen, they are dead. There are also power ups which could be like; missiles, grappling hook, fireball, freeze ray, drill etc. These make the game intense but for every single powerup, there is a way to dodge it. For example, if there is a grappling hook coming out of nowhere, all you have to do is press the slide key and you can dodge it. There are many obstacles like blocks which you have to slide under, spikes that if you land on them you are stunned and more. Finally, we have game add-ons. These can be acquired by levelling up. This means while ingame (practice or online), the host can put these on. For example, ‘Lethal spikes’ means that if you land on the spike, you die. Characters - There is not much to say here. While levelling up, you also unlock new characters and skins. When you start, you are given the default 4 characters. Comrade, Unic, Hothead and Speedrunner. While levelling up, you also get characters like Neko. There is one thing i found out recently. If you do a command like ‘/gangbeast’ or ‘/wolf’ you get characters from different games. /gangbeast gives you all the colour gang beasts from the silly physics game. ‘/wolf’ ‘/dallas’ ‘/houston’ and more give you the famous characters from the Payday series.Trails - There is hardly anything to say. When you start off, you get the normal boring trail which is your character moving fast. BUT, If you go to the trail store or community store, you can buy trails like i have and others like ‘Angel’ and ‘Spectrum’ and ‘Unic’. In the store, they range from £0.79 / $1 but in the community hub, they range from £0.49 / $0.70 - £1.49 / $2. These are recommended if you want to look like a famous player.Graphics / Visuals - The visuals are really nice and smooth. They have no pixels and look very well designed.+ Good graphics+ Good Sound Effects+ Incredible Gameplay+ Fun obstacles+ Many Gamemodes+ Secret Characters+ Many Characters+ Cheap Character Trail+ Not many microtransactions required (unless you want the Youtuber packs)+ Difficult but fun- Repetitive Audio- Terrible Connections- A ton of hackersOverall, 9.5/10 game "

												This game solves the biggest problem most other racing games have, it moves the finishline with the racers. Most racing games conform to reality a little too much by having an static finishline, which is easy to understand for player of all ages, but at the same time makes for a race that is exciting for only 10% of the actual racing time. This game makes 100% of your racing experience thrilling by having the finishline SO CLOSE and SO FAR at the same time, all the time. Its the perfect compliment to the digital format of being a video game, that we dont have to conform to physical laws of reality by shifting what would have been a static destination.This game is great!

The game was great at one point, but that was when the community wasn't a bunch of drooling, moronic, egotistic ♥♥♥♥♥ who like to think they're the greatest in the game and get incredibly salty when you thrash them claiming and I quote ""YOU MOTHER F***ING SPEED HACKER."" Um, this is a game based on speed, I just got a speed boost genius. Otherwise, don't buy it unless it's to play with friends.			"

												It's not that it isn't a fun game, it is. But it's glitchy as all hell. There are hundreds of spots that on each map that are goning to mess up you game due to some glitch. Mayby it's a ledge where you get stuck, or a platform where you get stuck or a wall where you get stuck or ""name a thing"" and you get stuck. That's not including any user submitted maps, And I haven't even started about the Online or Ranked part.Literally, literally not figuratively, everyone and their grandmother is cheating. You thought CoD was full of cheaters? You haven't seen nothing yet!Everyone who isn't cheating is lagging out their♥♥♥♥♥ Rarely do you play a game where at least, AT LEAST! one of the players has a♥♥♥♥♥♥connection.The ONLY redeeming factor is that on custom games it's more stable, which means you can easily play with you friends.

								SpeedRunners is one of those games that has a simple concept and a gameplay that is really easy to understand but also has a lot of room for improvement, it requires a lot of practice to get good at. I've watched this game grow and get better in so many ways and I simply can not recommend it enough, even in the early acces stage. The gameplay is fast, just like the name suggests, the controls are responsive and player skill makes a huge difference, to the point where, the only only way to win, becomes consistency and the strategic usage of items. The community isn't as big as I wanted it to be, but it's enough for you to find players in the same league (leagues being some sort of rank system within the game, the first one being the Entry League); but you might get in a room with someone a league or two above you, which isn't completely bad, since you can learn a lot just by looking at what those that are better than you are doing.

								One of the best racing games I have ever played... its a bit hard to advance up in high ranks though, because there are few people who have and the few you meet are far out of your leage. Other than that totaly recommend!			"

								The game is fun and can get rather competetive if you are playing with friends. Trashtalking makes it even better. There are some minor annoyances left (like when someone is really high in the air, you get kicked out even though you are still on track), but I hope those will be fixed in course of the early access phase.

												This game is the boss. If you are a fan of competive and fun local multiplayer games then very few games match the finess of this title. Its fast, its hectic,there is a fair amount of skill involved and you have a wealth of opportunities to screw your friends over. Its awesome.The game mechanic and the goal is very simple. You have run , jump and grapple a head of the pack and then extend your lead until all the others are out of the screen.  Only thing is, you cant see too much ahead and your friends have got nasty abilities to screw you over with. So good luck and good speed :PAs always with local mp games, 4 is the perfect number of players.Exellent entertainment.9/10PS: do yourself a favor and dont play it alone, you will only find it a lesser game than it really is. This game is designed to ruin your relationships and loose frinds over.			"

								This is what it's like in North Korea, as you try to defect from the state, you try desperately to dodge hooks, missles, explosions, fire balls, ice waves and all the while you do this? You are alienating yourself from your former friends, neighbors and family. In the end, is freedom really worth that much to you? The answer is yes. As you bask in the freedoms of South Korea you take great pleasure knowing all those who tried to rat you out or kill you, are starving and forced into labor camps.Life Simulator 201510/10			"

								Well to start, this game is insanely fun. This never gets boring and it never will get boring. I've had countless hours of fun playing this with my friends. I bought this game in christmas and I stopped for a while. Then we started playing again and we haven't stopped since. It's a fun game to play in any occasion. When I'm looking to have fun with friends, I look toward this game. When I'm bored and looking for some fun, I look toward this game. When I'm stuck without internet, I look toward this game. The bots in this game can use some tweaking and improvement. They're fun to play though to make yourself feel good. Even if you have no friends like me, online with total strangers is still fun.(Depending on who you play though) I have 40 hours now but I look to having more in the short future. Like I said, this game is fun and I will never get bored of it.			"

I would try to learn one of the new maps then another would come out before i even learnt the first one, it was a good game but community maps ruined it.			"

												Hello!Speedrunners Is a really good game for a party or if you just want to play a small game where you can stop (almost) instantly.It is really handy if you want to make a decision for example you want to decide wich game you play the guy who wins chooses the game.4 pack recommended but if you want to play online it's also fun because you can rank up.And the developers are interested in your experience for example map making contest!

								This is another one of those games that makes you want to kill your friends, like Super Smash Bros. In fact, the best way to describe Speedrunners is ""Mario Kart meets Super Smash Bros."" The gameplay is essentially one huge looping race, and you have to outrun your opponents until they hit the border, and thus killing them.Each math has 3 rounds, and if you win 3, you win the match. The game has a lot of Parkour-esque platforming that is really enjoyable and fun; double jumping, wall-jumping, sliding and grappling your way to victory. The real fun comes with the items though, as you can use these to mess up the other players and  get in their way. Every item is useful, and every item needs to be used correctly. They also require precise timing to hit, and precise timing to dodge. Every item in the game can be countered, making none of the items feel overpowered at any point whatsoever. Much like the item usage, everything in this game is precise. You need precisely timed button presses and jumps in order to win. You usually have no one to blame but yourself for losing, and it's great...usually. One of the major issues is the lag when playing online. On several occasions, I died due to horrible lag in the game. Luckily, this only happens while playing online with random players. When playing with friends or locally, it seems to run just fine.The level design is fantastic; every stage looks great, and they are well-though out, with multple shortcuts, and how to get them, along with many traps. Sometimes, these traps can feel a bit cheap (the spikes in particualr are really bad), but they are overall pretty good. The character designs are also pretty awesome, as every character looks cool, and you want to play as all of them jut to see what their animations are. However, I wish that the characters played differently from eachother. There is zero difference in playstyle between characters, and that is disappointing to say the least. No stats, no special abilities, nothing. It makes the game feel devoid of strategy and tactics. And while most of the game is reaction and skill-based, it would've been nice to have some strategy involved, outside of item usage.Something else that's disappointing is a lack of a story mode. I like stories in video games, and if the game doesn't have a story, that's understandable. But the problem is that the characters and the stages are so well designed, hat I would like to know about the world. In fact, during loading screens, you'll occasionally see characters making a remark or two about another character, and it just makes me wonder what is going on in this world. But comparatively, that's a minor complaint, as the gameplay is good enough to make up for it. The gmae also lacks content, as every race is pretty straightforward. I would've liked to see a few extra modes such as a battle mode, or something to mix up the gameplay. I also think that the game is very had, as you start out in the entry league, and so you are matched up wih players who are also in the entry league, and are more or less just as good as you are at the game. If you win a match, you get around 40 to 60 points, but losing will make you lose around 5 to 20 points. And trust me, you'll be losing ALOT at first, due to the slightly confusing controls and play style that takes alot of getting used to. This makes it almost impossible to reach higher rankings and be paired up with people who are really good at the game to get some challenge every now and then. However, despite all my complaints with the game, I still highly recommend Speedrunners. The gameplay, while it has a learning curve, is extremely fun and addictive. You'll play for hours on end, not realizing that you just wasted 3 hours of your life away. The complaints, though plentiful, aren't that bad and they are outwieghed by the good that the game has. And frankly, most of these issues come from this game being an Early Access title. Most of these issues will most likely be fixed down the road. Speedrunners is definately worth your time, and for $10, you'll definately get your money's worth out of it. I rate it an 8/10.			"

								So this is platformer based on fast phase running, precision jumping, precision wall sliding, precision grapling hook usage and some powerups usage. You and up to 3 competitors are thrown into running arena. You lose if you are last and touch screen borders. Winner of the match is the one who is last stanging or i should say running.You will need some time, like an 1 hour to pick up how to play and learn controls. Controls does respond well, but i had some issue on wall jumping/sliding, that jump does not work, and it got me frustrated, and i think it is not a bug. There just are some conditions when jumping on walls does not work - this means you are kinda doing it wrong or something like that. That set me back a lot, because fluidity is important thing in running games like this, and this felt like a cheap trick how to distribute luck factor in the game. Of course devs can keep opinion tham it is like that by design, and that i should invest more time learning controls.Overall I really enjoyed invested couple of hours in this game. Not really my type of game, but cant complain. Can see this as a fun game with friends, but they also have to be familiar with game before.Definitely bonus that there exists tutorial + kinda single-player mode.			"

								I've played quite a bit of this game.I bought it on the Holiday Sale after seeing some YouTubers play it and I've been in love with it ever since. Speedrunners is a surprisingly fun game that is fun for both casual and serious gamers, with the ""Quick Match"" or the ""Ranked Match"" multiplayer system. You can also create custom games and invite your friends to play.While this game is incredibly fun and is totally deserving of the money, in my experience I have experienced a few glitches that actually cause the game to break and/or crash. These glitches are actually pretty hilarious (and they aren't too frequent for me), so I really don't mind them personally, it's just something for you to keep in mind before you make the decision to purchase it.

								This game is very fast-paced, and a lot of fun. It contains obscure and not so obscure references. The best part is when you think you are winning, and then your friend gets the ONE ITEM, that will allow him to catch up. It's immpossible to tell who is winning because the game can change in the blink of an I. 10/10 would ice beam again.(definitely a lot more fun with friends, just a tip.)Regarding the friend issue, 4 players is great for playing against randoms, however their should be a custom game option that allows you to have up to, lets say, 8 seems like a good number.So 8 players in custom mode for a fun hectic, insane game that allows all of your friends to have fun and mess around.

								Super Meat Boy meets Mario Kart with a little bit of Bionic Commando thrown in.  If any of that sounds remotely interesting then you will enjoy SpeedRunners.  The first few nights playing this game with friends my thumbs were hurting from playing the game so much.This game is still very much a beta.  The game can be a little buggy at times and it's best to play this with friends due to no matchmaking, but those little issues don't get in the way much of what is a very fun game.			"

								Super Meat Boy meets Mario Kart with a little bit of Bionic Commando thrown in.  If any of that sounds remotely interesting then you will enjoy SpeedRunners.  The first few nights playing this game with friends my thumbs were hurting from playing the game so much.This game is still very much a beta.  The game can be a little buggy at times and it's best to play this with friends due to no matchmaking, but those little issues don't get in the way much of what is a very fun game.			"

								SpeedRunners is a fast paced game with a very nice art style at first when I was playing it I didn't enjoy it mainly because I wasn't playing with people I knew (don't get me wrong it's still fun but not as enjoyable with people you know) so i played with my brothers and sat there and played for hours it was really fun and what kept me playing was how competitive it was it made you feel great when you use the grappling hook to take out the other player for the win.

								This game is very fast-paced, and a lot of fun. It contains obscure and not so obscure references. The best part is when you think you are winning, and then your friend gets the ONE ITEM, that will allow him to catch up. It's immpossible to tell who is winning because the game can change in the blink of an I. 10/10 would ice beam again.(definitely a lot more fun with friends, just a tip.)Regarding the friend issue, 4 players is great for playing against randoms, however their should be a custom game option that allows you to have up to, lets say, 8 seems like a good number.So 8 players in custom mode for a fun hectic, insane game that allows all of your friends to have fun and mess around.

								Edit: gave up trying to join multiplayer, 3 hours tinkering and no dice. Uninstalling, and will leave this negative review as is.And no, I have good connection to play Dota 2 and CS: GO and even always online Diablo 3. Not my connection problem. Just a badly designed netcode in this game.Screenshot: http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/screenshot/526140762130117960---Original review:Not fun when:1. You can't find any room although you've been searching for many minutes. Search range: worldwide. Probably Strict NAT issue for me, but it's still a minus point since many MP only games I play peer to peer even can pass thru Strict NAT.2. You don't have controllers (currently this game supports xinput but not dinput).It's fun when:1. You have local friends to play with (guaranteed 'room').2. You can find online rooms to play with.3. You have controllers.Game has single player mode, mostly for training purpose.Game has workshop support for additional free levels. Thank god no more paid mods after Skyrim fiasco.Game apparently has been on Early Access for so many months. Either no longer supported / slow-paced development or no more revenue to be taken from this game or combination of both.At the moment, no, I can't recommend the game. If you can get this cheaply from trading or free giveaways (so many recently) then go for it. At least you can play Single Player for 1 hour worth of content.			"

You don't have controllers (currently this game supports xinput but not dinput).It's fun when:1. You have local friends to play with (guaranteed 'room').2. You can find online rooms to play with.3. You have controllers.Game has single player mode, mostly for training purpose.Game has workshop support for additional free levels. Thank god no more paid mods after Skyrim fiasco.Game apparently has been on Early Access for so many months. Either no longer supported / slow-paced development or no more revenue to be taken from this game or combination of both.At the moment, no, I can't recommend the game. If you can get this cheaply from trading or free giveaways (so many recently) then go for it. At least you can play Single Player for 1 hour worth of content.			"

												Yes I agree this game is great, original, fantastic etc.. exept when I found unfair mode and what exploits can be found to beat the game now once I found these exploits, I've been dashing through these AI games and regular games, which to me make this game completly broken and doesn't require any skill, once I learned the exploits it became second nature ultimately making the game skilless, the only good parts of this game I'd say is regular matched without exploits and no AI that can run faster than you.In my opinion, when you've played enough and learned enough, you become a god creating no challenges, but thats the point of games right? They have a goal and getting to the goal is a challenge, not in this game.But it's still great and fun if you don't come across anyone else in public games using these exploits, just play normally.Anyway I'm done with this game as soon as I've got all achievements.Still don't like unfair mode, almost directly forces you to use the exploits.

Get three friends to play with you and you can literally play for hours and not feel the slightest bit bored. Something different happens every single game and it doesn't take long to get the hang of. If you value your entertainment whatsoever, buy this game and get some friends to play too. Hurry up and buy it while it's still in beta! The price will go up eventually!			"

Basically Mario Kart but with running, wall jumping, and grappling hooks.Very fun and fast-paced but easy for new players to pick up and enjoy.  Great for when friends are over, and a perfect title for Steam Link.Pros:- Endlessly fun and replayable- Online and local 4-player multiplayer- Online mode handles opponents with high ping fairly well- Very fair price and a 4-pack discount is available- Workshop support for player-made mapsCons:- Only a modest selection of official maps (16 currently) but they're high-quality- Not much variety in weapons/powerupsOther:- It's been in Early Access for a long time without many noteworthy changes but it felt like a ""complete"" game when I first bought it months ago, so I don't consider it worth complaining about- Originally it had only one racing music theme and it was so spectacularly perfect in every way that the newly-added music just can't match it- Recent updates have lowered the difficulty level a little bit too much in my opinion; hitting spikes and other traps used to be challenging to recover from but this is now only a minor setback9.5/10 "

								The funniest competitive game I've ever played in my life. Seriously, the game is a 4-player parkour racing game. Get three friends to play with you and you can literally play for hours and not feel the slightest bit bored. Something different happens every single game and it doesn't take long to get the hang of. If you value your entertainment whatsoever, buy this game and get some friends to play too. Hurry up and buy it while it's still in beta! The price will go up eventually!			"

								Even though it still is early access, this game is probably one of my favorite indie titles to come out this year.  The gameplay is fluid, the controls are tight, and the maps are evenly placed.  With even further updates down the line, I highly reccomend this game to anyone that likes a tight competitive joyride.			"

								I bought the 4 pack during the latest holiday sale and gave it away to my friends.  It looked fun.   Playing it is more than just fun.  This has become the go to local co-op game for my roommate and friends on the couch.  It is a great game in the sense it balances simple play, amazing ability to push your play to a graceful sublime edge, and it is quick enough a match to make you always want more.  As yourself and the group you play with get better the levels themselves start to change a bit.  Not as much as in other racing games i've played but enough that you can see who knows what they are doing and who doesn't know yet.  It is worth more than they are asking at $9.99 and the game isn't even done yet.  All I can ask for is more runners, more tools, more stages, and for more people to enjoy this gem.			"

								This is a rad little game. Kind of like a Grapple Boy meets Fancy Pants adventures I guess?? You and 3 other players are racing around a stage over and over again, trying to get so far ahead of the others that they fall off the screen and die. Once the first player has died, the visible area of the screen starts to shrink, and the threshold to stay alive becomes smaller and smaller until one person's left. First to three points wins. It's still in beta so the game will glitch up every once in a while, but it's really fun. There's already a metagame developing for when to use items, the best ways to get through each path, etc. This game is a blast.			"

								So in normal multiplayer platformers, you've got that pesky screen-sharing limitation. Well, this is what happens when you take scrolling deaths to their logical conclusion: a racing platformer that revolves around getting everyone else off the screen! Throw in a Mario Kart-esque item system, and there' a recipe for ridiculous fun.There aren't any blue shells, either!			"

You can hinder your opponents with little power-ups like grappling hooks that you latch on to them or bombs that you leave behind. With its local and online-multiplayer its a must have for everyone, that likes fast paced action and competetive gameplay. The slogan doesn't lie: It might be the most competetive game ever.
