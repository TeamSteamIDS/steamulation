Early Access Review
								Such a fun game at heart, I am really excited to see how this game shapes out.  Its visually stunning especially for being early access, and I experienced very few bugs.  To see my first thoughts as well as some gameplay you can check out a video here.

Early Access Review
								Great fun with and without controller! Its very fast and motivates to climb new records. The gameplay reminds me on mirrors edge, which i already loved. The cubes make a great addition to the fast gameplay and are difficult to master. A real challange if you are into highscore racing!!			"

Early Access Review
								It's a fun, fast paced game. That's for sure. And it's competitive. You need some skills to get through those cups.I love the idea and the new perspective given to the kinda old genre ""jump-n-run""...It's only Early Access, so yeah, way to go, much to do...But I'm already into the game and going to wait for the updates and look forward to the process.

Early Access Review
								Very beautiful visually, and the soundtrack is well done. The core mechanics are nice and fluid for the most part. Not much content as it is of course, but I very strongly hope that this game will continue developing because what's there is a lot of fun. I would love to see an easy to use level editor and sharing mechanic, kind of like Trackmania's.Suggestions: Wall running (not just jump refilling from touching a wall), longer levels, some sort of gliding mechanic on some levels would be a ton of fun, mod support, some tweaking on the dash function to not feel as choppy at times			"

								Love it! As said: easy to learn, hard to master! Goes along with: the more the merrier. Just a really beautiful game with a huge fun factor even if you found no. 268 of how-to-get-reseted-the-stupid-way. It's already totally addicting, perfect for long hours of gaming sessions as well as the ""10min before you have to do anything else"". The beautifully created level and lounge designs along with the music are creating an atmospheric environment. Definitively a recommendation to buy!Hope to see you guys soon to Rumble the Jungle.PS: No server/lag problems here -> WestEU on EU Server			"

Early Access Review
								Love on the second sight ;) Kinda...I had this on my wishlist for a long time. And now I'm really happy that I've got my hands on this gem. Please ppl remember: This is an EARLY ACCESS Game!!! Which means (for me) getting in touch with the devs is easy and rewarding (because these guys rock!). Tell them your opinion before giving a negative review ;) For the Game itself:Well if you're searching between ""A Story About My Uncle"" (because there's no story as far as I've played ^^)  and a smoothly Mario FPS, this is the Game you're looking for.It's entertaining, challenging as hell (but motivating, too) - and best thing: You can play it in Singleplayer, as well. (I'm on the road for most of my sparetime, and so it's great to have only you against your score.But yeah, you should play it online with some teammates. But you should DEFINITIVELY pass though the Tutorial Stages (which you can play against other players as well) to learn about the different Cubes.So what you're waiting for? I'm waiting for you in the Lounge ;)  "

Early Access Review
								Hi,I had a good time playing the game so far and I can definitely recommend it as the core gameplay is already fully functional for it´s early access state. Pro:-Fast paced gameplay similiar to track mania-Love the double jump and dash and the feeling of speed they provoke-Solid visuals-Challenging and motivating tournaments-Love the idea of the Lounge but I couldn´t find a chat system. Did I miss it?-Fast loading times-Rarely any bugs although the double jump triggering seems not to work sometimes. -Great, scaleable fun for smaller and longer play sessionsCon:-Big Roots in the temple complexes and more ""complex"" blocks like the blue and green one heavily interrupt the flow. Might be just unskilled though ;) The roots are painful though.-The contrast between lit and shadowed areas is too high, making the exposure go nuts and shadowed areas hard ro read.-I understand choosing a high bloom as an appealing visual element but for the most part it´s too much for my taste if the gameplay needs everything to be clearly readable.Stuff that might be worth a thought:-Smiliar start/restart system to trackmania using just a quick button to restart the run and not having to restart the whole map. If one goes for the highscore, probably the slightest misstep will make you want to restart completly and this adds up.			"

Early Access Review
								Hover Cubes has a genre that I would normally not consider my cup of tea, mainly because I'm not that much interested in action / sport related games and also happen to suffer from motion sickness.The early access serves on first sight as very polished proof of concept, that lacks only a few things I could imagine on my wishlist. I found it a bit confusing in the beginning to learn the controls for example.However, if you approach this game with a bunch of friends, Hover Cubes opens up a way more complex and tactical dimension beside scoring within a good time frame. As you probably saw, the cubes act as bridge elements that make the puzzles possible to begin with, however, other players can of course interfere with your strategies, which lead to a bunch of super fun cups, both from the players and spectators perspective.The motion sickness element is something you should consider, however, I actually avoided it, by playing on very low graphics and doing breaks in between.All in all, I feel very positive about the current outlook of this game. I voiced some concerns in this review (Mainly tutorial aspects and motion sickness), however, I doubt that the communication of gameplay elements can't be improved and given that this game is an early access title, it has established a solid foundation already.I tried to keep this review as objective as possible, however, I enjoyed a free copy so you might want to consider that too.

Early Access Review
								**EDIT: This review is based on my play experience on a US server from Japan, so it's likely not accurate**It's a cool concept, but it doesn't run very well. Constantly having to reset the stage because of server lag, even though I was playing by myself.			"
