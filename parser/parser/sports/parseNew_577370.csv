Early Access Review
								Mechanically, this is very solid. It is simple and fun, with everything that happens feeling like it was the correct result (this is important in a paddle game).It has one major flaw. The room size retirement is completely unnecessary, and yet it makes the game unplayable. I am rating this positively since it lists that requirement on the store page.In my 2.2x2.2 meter space all items of the menu are easily reachable. The main gameplay (volleying the ball) works perfectly as well. The only problem is that every single mine spawns outside the play space. That gives a hard limit on how far I can get because sooner or later (usually within ten hits) the ball hits a mine that I can't deal with.Giving multiple room options (possibly with adjusted scoring to compensate) would make this game far more approachable.Edit:After writing this I thought to myself ""What if I could reach the mines? All I had to do was shift my z position forward half a meter (thanks SteamVR Advanced Settings!) and I could reach them just fine. My high score is now 160 and I worked up a serious sweat.The ball still sometimes gets shot outside my play space, but for the most part the game works great just by offsetting myself forwards.Edit 2: According to the Dev's response, the playspace can be repositioned via the touchpad. I have not tested this however.			"

Early Access Review
								The Boost dev sent me a free game key to test Boost with my hardware.As everything ran fine and I mostly enjoyed the game I wanted to give a review and help the dev with my feedback. Pros:The graphics are nice (I can set application supersampling to 1.5 without getting frame drops)nice tron-like settingit IS an active game and in it's current state the difficulty is HARDit combines the pong like gameplay with a 2nd challenge for the player: getting rid of spawning mines after each 4th hitthe AI helps you and is not the enemy, your game ends when you're too slow or make a mistakecatchy music which is building up the tension as your game progressescommitted and friendly dev who is interested in community feedback and quickly implements changes (He already sent me a test build where he switched the shield into a racket with handle, because I suggested it might match most of the potential players' muscle memory better)the gameplay offers possibilities for funny additions, such as powerups to clear all mines with a xortex like explosion or something like that...Cons:The difficulty is getting harder very quickly, matches don't last longer than a few seconds at firstthe game doesn't show you where to aim the ball in the first place (the AI only returns the ball within a certain area that you have to hit. The problem is: you will only see the accepted area after you have missed it)the angle of your virtual hand/shield doesn't match your real hand  (this made me grab the Vive wand 90Â° rotated out and press the trigger with my thumb, because it felt more intuitive)there is a speed limit for the ball atm, so it feels as if your momentum is getting lost after you hit the ball - feels weirdsometimes the mines spawn directly in the ball's trajectory, making it nearly impossible to destroy the mines AND hit the ball in the correct angle within 1 second (see video sample, I have suggested making the mines transparent a little moment before spawn so you can prepare to destroy them)there's only one gamemode at the moment, it's singleplayer without leaderboards (more gamemodes and leaderboards are of course planned for future updates)there are bugs (as in pretty much all EA titles), but they don't destroy the funsometimes the ball gets returned by the AI but crashes against your platformTL; DR:Boost is worth a try if you like active racket games like holoball AND can accept Early Access as a phase of development.It is far from being a full game but it has potential and a cool dev who wants to develope the game with the community.
