												I don't know why anyone would give this the thumbs down? It's free for crying out loud! Also I think it's alot of fun. There is leaderboards and I currently hold the golden chainsaw! Come and get it loggers...			"

												If this is what commercials/advertisements become, at least they're fun.			"

												This is a great game that just screams competitive gameplay.  Controls are really easy to get used to and there is something satisfying about cutting the limbs off a long log.Really attractive graphics; clearly some effort put into making a good looking game.One of the little features that made me smile was being able to throw the chainsaw into the water to get a high score for distance thrown.  Would definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes competitions with friends or who just likes to try and beat their previous score.PS. Best method for typing your name into a leaderboard.

												It's a decent little experience where you cut limbs as fast as possible and try to throw your chainsaw the furthest. It's annoying that it requires such a huge space though, I was able to cut all the limbs from the wood without any problems but I couldn't reach the majority of keys on the virtual keyboard, but still was able to type a few Zs and Xs as my name.Overall i'd give this a rating of ""Damn, nearly broke my hand smashing my lamp whilst throwing a chainsaw"" out of 10 :^)			"

												Cool experience but not that much to do unfortunately :) Sure it's cool to get better and better at limbing and also cool that the experience is free :) I made a let's play of it:

												Unrealistic and barely fun.First, the graphics of the surrounding is good. But the hands/gloves are tiny. First immersion breaker.The sound of the chainsaw is garbage. There are no effects when sawing off wood (nvidia gpu physx could have helped) and there is no real sawing involved at all. Stuff just dissapears and spawns. Easily and just roughly scripted.The chainsaw is often not steady enough and glitches around, even two handed.I dont see a the challenge at all.Best part about this game was throwing the chainsaw in the water.

												Horrible mechanics. The chainsaw is linked to a single hand and is impossible to use properly. No interesting mechanics. Lackluster sound and feedback. No matter what, avoid this title.			"

												Not every VR game is gold.  Just being up and moving isn't enough.  The content needs to be fun.			"

												I found this to be a fun little game with nice graphics and the added incentive of leaderboards and achievements.The chainsaw can glitch around a bit but I got used to it.			"

			Trying out the zen approach in Limberjack. Who knew you had to be so precise? ... maybe not so Zen after all. FOR BUSINESS/SPONSORSHIP INQUIRIES: ✉ Email: info@vrme.tokyo -------------------- FOLLOW...		

I went in thinking it would be pretty cool. However I didn't like the mechanics of the chainsaw and found the gameplay to be thoroughly boring! Watch as I go from enthusiastic to disgruntled in 3 seconds!			"
