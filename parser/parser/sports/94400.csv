This game is truly amazing as a local vs. experience. Plus, the sound track on some of those stages is amazing. Great game, increadibly precise, but accessible. Tons of fun!			"

												You're at the last part of the level and one enemy stands in your way. It gives you this giddy feeling, those 5 seconds of a showdown, staring down your opponent, waiting to see who's going to make the first move. The adrenaline starts pumping after you charge in for the first swing and your opponent counters and knocks your sword out of your hand. You're swordless. You close your eyes and take a deep breath as your opponent charges at you with his sword. Seconds before impact you leap and flip over his head, grab your sword, turn around and throw it right through his head. As he falls to the ground you spit on his body and sprint through the gate to the cheering of thousands of spectators.Then a giant worm eats you. Victory.This game rocks. I'll start off with that. You got these tiny little guys with swords fencing for their lives back and forth as the bodies pile up. This is the kind of game that you can actually be skillful at, by watching the o0ther person's sword you can try to figure out how to counter what he's doing. It has a mortal combat type ladder single player where you play through a bunch of levels against harder and harder characters and I've managed to get about halway up. Not sure if there are lives but if you lose you continue from the same character you don't have to start over.I'm most excited for the multiplayer though, I can't wait to invite some friends over to play this because this is one of those games which will cause a lot of screaming and yelling. I just played a random person through the matchmaking a bunch of times and it worked flawlessly, I'm excited to play more.Also in the multiplayer section where there's offline and other options for multiplayer there are a whole sleuth of ""variants"": Slow mo, Fast mo, boomerang swords, divekicks, throwing and other stuff.Really not a bad learning curve. Yeah, the first couple of rounds you can't figure out what the hell is going on, but after 15 minutes of trial and error I was leaping, stabbing, and doing a lot of other weird ♥♥♥♥. Music's not shabby, you got the shwing shwing of the swords in there so I'm happy.The game makes you feel like that guy from Princess Bride with those wiggly swords.The bad: No windowed mode, and the how to play menu is broken to all hell. Just check the controls and go with it.It's just a fun game, it's got a lot of replay value and it would always be cool to see more levels or maybe... hats?			"

												Probably few people have heard about Nidhogg. At first glance it's a simple 2D fighting with 8-bit graphics. But is it really?　I CHALLENGE YOU TO A PIXEL DUEL　　There is no plot in Nidhogg. Instead, only fights with a computer opponent or with other people in online. The meaning of each battle is not killing the enemy, but in achieving the opposite end of the map. Four keys for movement, one key for punch and one key for jump. Sounds easier than it actually is. In fact, fightings are very funny and full of madness, but not without subtleties of the combat system. I advise you to play only in the company of friends. Singleplayer and online battles with strangers doesn't bring much fun.　NOT ENOUGH PIXELS　　Nidhogg has enough of advantages to buy it. But there are some unpleasant drawbacks. Too few maps, quickly bored gameplay, inconvenient system for playing online with friends (A friend is not always able to connect to your game). These shortcomings, in fact, are not much spoiling the gaming experience. If it were not for one thing. Too high price. Seriously. It should cost twice less, judging on how many content in it.　Multiplayer:　　Online: ☺☺☺☺☺OOOOO　　Co-op: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　Storyline: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　Graphics: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OOO　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺OO　Complexity of the achievements: Some achievements will make you play this game for a long time. And not all of them can be easily performed.　　　Nidhogg is a game with a so much　　fun and madness, but with so few　　levels and other content. If you're don't　　mind to spending so much money on it,　　then you'll are sure to spend a few fun　　evenings.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To buy or not to buy, that is the question [6.5/10]. "

												Way too expensive for what it is. Although it's a very fun local game or just to play online with a friend that's close, there's barely any content here. I believe there's just 4 maps in this, only 1 type of weapon, and no netplay with random people. Once in awhile it's fun to pick up and play, but definitely not worth the price.			"

												Nidhogg is a fast paced, local multiplayer focused fencing game developed by Messhof. In Nidhogg you take up fencing and fight one on one matches against AI or other players through local or online multiplayer. The aim of the game is to make it past your opponent and run to the other side of the map.+Awesome pixel graphics+Simple gameplay, all you have to do is stab your opponent and run to the other side of the map, it might sound boring but it's actually really entertaining, especially when playing with friends+The different maps are very different to each other which provides some nice variation for the game+Nidhogg can be enjoyed in Singleplayer, Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer/Matchmaking+The fast-paced side-scrolling nature of Nidhogg makes it perfect for playing in Local Multiplayer and things get pretty intense, making Local Multiplayer pretty exhilirating and the best way to enjoy the game+Nidhogg features a tournament mode which allows 3-8 players to play Local Multiplayer+The soundtrack is great and fits with the game well+The fighters in the game are all brightly coloured and blood basically acts like paint for the maps so you end up with some pretty cool designs on the floor if one area of the map gets particularly bloody+Both the KB&M controls and the 360 Gamepad controls are very good and very responsive-Nidhogg has a severe lack of content due to only having four maps, for £10.99 that kind of content really isn't good enough-Singleplayer gets repetitive (thanks to the lack of content) very quickly-Until recently Online Multiplayer wasn't very good (due to lag mainly) but it has been fixed, sadly it would seem not many people who own Nidhogg know that it was fixed since the game's Online Multiplayer remains pretty much deadVerdict:Highly Recommended, but Only When Discounted (6.5/10)Nidhogg is a great, fast paced fighting game with awesome graphics and simple gameplay, sadly the game is very much let down by its lack of content and high asking price. If you're looking for what is one of the best Local Multiplayer games on Steam and you don't mind paying the high price then give Nidhogg a go, if not, wait for a sale.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.

												This game is somewhat of a double-edged sword. If you have a friend (or enemy) who is in the room with you, this game is great. Otherwise, you probably shouldn't get it.The game plays like an elaborate dance; two players fighting for the honour of being consumed by the titular serpent- the Nidhogg. The controls are simple: one button jabs your sword, one button makes you jump. The real beauty is how the mechanics blend together. Swords can be moved up and down to reach a jumping or ducking enemy. Swords at the same height will clash, and can block the opposing player's attacks. Swords can also be knocked out of a players hand by some particularly crafty swordplay. Jousting with your sword fully raised throws your sword through the air, which is hard to dodge, but leaves you without your best weapon. Thrusting in midair results in a divekick, a techniquie used to relieve the enemy of their weapon (that is, if you don't impale yourself on their weapon first). The result is an EXTREMELY intense sword battle. Matches can last for seconds, others can last for half of an hour or more. The ducking and dodging and jumping and running blends brilliantly with the game's glitch-art style and kickass music. You can play this before the start of a lecture. You can play this at a party, with a tournament of eight players. You can use it as a substitute for rock-paper-scissors in decision-making situations. It's become one of my go-to games when friends are over (see also: touhou 9).However, this only applies if you have real-life friends. Sure, the game has online play, but it's horribly laggy and bugged, with no sign of a fix. The lag ruins the crucial fast-paced action of the game and usually results in the host player winning. Because of this, you'll be very lucky to actually find anyone through the matchmaking service. The single-player mode is basically multiplayer but against a series of bots, which each have distinct playstyles and weaknesses. It's very much like playing against real players, but nowhere near as fun as having friends to play with in the same room. Additionally, the price is VERY steep for what the contents of the game are: only four (admittedly BEAUTIFUL) levels. Overall: One of the best local multiplayer games that exist. If you have real friends that can come over and play: get this game ...but get it during a sale. If you have no friends: sorry, this game isn't for you. Go out and make some friends instead!			"

												This is my first review on steam.This game is awesome to play against friends, it is intense and purely skill based. The biggest problem with this is the multiplayer system only works when it wants to so you can't even play online with your buddies unless the ""Server"" is feeling okay. When the server is working which is probably isn't right now, you are unable to customize the online multiplayer match which is a huge part of the multiplayer experience in nidhogg. In conclusion this is not a $15 game. I am glad I bought it for $3 and it is worth that when it is working. Offline mode locally I am sure is the only use for this game. Do not pay $15, beyond waste.			"

												Don't always go for the top reviews like I did with this one. This game looked fantastic in the videos. It actually is if you go by the single player mode which doesn't last long and (more importantly) local multiplayer. Local multiplayer is where this shines. If you engage in this frequently, get it. I only have occasional local multiplayer games and this is why it was a bad purchase for me and might be for you.There hasn't been one update since this game's release. The guy ignored EVERY support request and then had the cheek to release it on the PS4. Why is this a problem? The netcode is HORRIBLE, and latency is the most important factor with a game where reaction time can be very important. If you play online and enjoy it consistently, get back to me, because that would be the first I've heard about it. Players will teleport more than in Counter-Strike in the '90s and is more buggy than the Master Chief Collection.			"

												I have been looking forward to this game for a long time, and figured that after 3 years of ""development"" (or what ever they were doing with it before releasing) this would be a really well polished game, and it is to a great extent. 	The offline 2 player duel gameplay is simply amazing, hectically fast and fun twitch game. Playing with a friend could grant you countless hours of fun. The graphics are beautiful. If this was a freeware game it would be great, if it was $2 it would be great, however it is priced at 15$ which is too much to pay for the amount of content (which is 4 arenas and a tacked on single player mode) 	Now the bad things are, as some people have mentioned; The ONLINE multilayer is currently  unplayable, a big bummer for me. Another really big bummer is that in fact, it does NOT have ""full"" controller support; It does support fancy Xbox controllers, but it would not recognize my lovely SNES style USB controllers which other games recognize just fine. So ya, this coupled with a 15$ price tag and lack of content leads me to a thumb down :( sorry. 	Once again it IS a great 2 player offline game, and I will be playing it a lot when I have friends over, but its not worth 15$. Wait till this game is cheaper and patched for proper controller support and online play, then it will be worth it.EDIT: GOOD: I have had a few good online games with minimal lag, but it is rare with random matches. BAD:  Game variant options do not seem work in online matches.			"

												Nidhogg provides some of the fastest and most enjoyable monochromatic bloodletting one could hope to experience.   The premise is simple.  You are a pixelated swordsman in a territorial conflict with your opponent, most often your best friend sitting right beside you.  Each standoff is lightning fast, and invariably ends in a gratuitous splattering of blood.   Kill your opponent with a well-timed and well-placed lunge, hurl your épée at his head, or just knock him down and rip his heart out.  Savagery is encouraged, and provides a hilarious counterpoint to the civilized image of fencing.  Once you have managed to kill your opponent, you can progress to your goal until just seconds later, he respawns and you must again defeat him to progress. Lose, and he gains ground on you. This ebb and flow continues until one of you reaches the final screen where the winner is given a true hero’s sendup: He is eaten by a flying worm.Nidhogg is not just a circus of inanity and violence, but is some of the best fun you can have with your friends.  Controls are responsive, animations are fast and smooth, and landing consecutive killing blows provides a jolt of dopamine that keeps you coming back for more.  There are multiple arenas to choose from, each one visually unique and designed to make you rethink your strategy.  Some corridors are too tight for jumping or sword throwing, so both your opponent and the landscape will make you think on your toes.Visually, Nidhogg exhibits a unique combination of minimalism through pixilation and solid colors.  It highlights the expression of characters through animation rather than textures.  It is aesthetically arresting and securely has its own style.  These visuals are elevated even further when coupled with an exceptional soundtrack by Daedelus.Nidhogg could have provided only the core one-on-one experience, but if you look deeper there are a lot of extras.  There is a tournament mode supporting up to 8 players. There is a multitude of variants in gameplay to explore. There is a single player experience pitting you against an increasingly difficult array of AI personalities.  Additionally, there is an online multiplayer component, but at the time of this review, I experienced some unfortunate glitches.  In several matches I experienced moments where I killed my opponent, but immediately the game changed states, and my character unexplainably died.  It wasn’t often, but it was often enough to sour the experience.  I’m told that the online component is still a work in progress, so if you don’t have a friend handy to play local multiplayer check the forums for progress.Nidhogg was first shown in 2010, and since then Messhoff, comprised of Mark Essen and Kristy Norindr, have worked to shine the core game into a full-fledged release.  Nidhogg is available today on Steam for $11.99, and if you have friends, it is well worth your dollars.			"

												Nidhogg is not bad at all in terms of gameplay. I won’t go into much detail because the trailers and such pretty much show what it's about, but its damn fun to play. The combat has a lot of options and things going for it and nicely juggles both complexity and ease of learning. The music and visuals match and mesh with the feel of the combat excellently. I can easily see how co-op can be a blast with friends, or the tourney potential. So why is this not recommended? Because the devs cared more about the game’s style, raw gameplay, and media hype then its long-term substance or support. You’re playing this game and having a lot of fun, and then before you even hit the one hour mark you find yourself thinking “that’s it?” and then it’s all downhill from there. Singleplayer consists of you fighting a dozen or two progressively harder AI opponents, however the stages start looping after opponent four. Yep, only four stages. There’s no story to speak of or even an attempt at one, and once you’re done with it you’re left with nearly nothing else to do with the game. Multiplayer is dead, D-E-A-D. Its features are minimal and in terms of functionality the MP barely worked when the game came out, and then because they never fixed it people gave up on it entirely so there’s no one playing. This game deserved more support and more features and updates from a solid company. But because it didn’t get that and most likely won’t ever, I am sorry to say that charging $15 for this is broad daylight robbery and I cannot recommend it. Only buy this if it’s on sale, and with the understanding that outside of being a weekend distraction or occasional hour of fun with a friend this game has no value.			"

												Nidhogg embodies the aggressive, intoxicating thrill of competition. Through hazily defined personas and their ethereal exacting movements, a simple duel is transformed into a bustling frenzy of close saves, impossible luck, and overlapping cries of victory and defeat. It only took one match for me to fall in love with Nidhogg – to be hooked by the overwhelming energy that erupts both inside and outside the game – and hours later each round continues to bring with it that same feeling that I’m discovering something incredible for the first time and desperately need someone to share it with.In the most concise and direct of terms, Nidhogg is a two-player fencing game which calls back to the simpler times of 80’s arcade classics like Joust and Pong, but bridges the generational gap with a precision and adrenaline that would have melted the insides of the quarter devouring machines which have grown extinct over the last 30 years. Nidhogg’s indirect heritage doesn’t define it so much as provides a sense of place for Nidhogg where so many other games are quickly lost and forgotten. Already it feels like a classic I’ve loved for years and a staple game that is kept installed eternally as part of an evergreen collection of multiplayer games.Nidhogg works so immensely well because it’s the sort of game you stop thinking about almost immediately. Controlling your swordsman in Nidhogg is impeccably intuitive as they move and react contextually and clearly, causing you to forget about how your controlling them as you focus all your attention on what you’re actually doing. Nidhogg feels much like a spontaneous dance between two people attempting to kill each other. It’s not about executing a particular move or performing a perfect counter block, but allowing yourself to be taken by the moment as you and your opponent flow together in a blur of kicks and stabs as you fight against each other in a deadly tug of war.The organic interplay which develops over the course of a match helps keep Nidhogg from ever feeling one-sided the way many multiplayer games do. Everything which takes place during a match is the dual result of two players colliding and reacting with one another, which forms a dynamic that feels cordial and joyful. Even during my worst matches I often found myself erupting in laugher over my own mistakes and haphazard attempts to regain ground, because even when I’m losing Nidhogg’s ridiculous pace and explosions of pixels are still ludicrously fun to be a part of.To me the lifespan of a multiplayer game is almost entirely based on whether or not it’s enjoyable to the person losing, and I’ve never played a competitive game where me and my supposed competitor have fallen into such fits of laughter precisely because we’re losing. Nidhogg is a brilliantly tactical and engaging beast of a fighting game, but that it can also allow for a much friendlier mood and feel satisfying even when you’re outmatched is a remarkable achievement very few other games can boast.I suppose it has to be mentioned though that there is one rather enormous qualifier to recommending Nidhogg, that being the requirement of another local player. Though there is a single player mode it feels like a lifeless shell of its multiplayer counterpart, only potentially worth venturing into as a means of practicing advanced strategies against increasingly tough AI opponents. The online mode as well, despite being fairly functional, can’t compete with the feeling of having another person in the room with you (even more so if you are playing against random players). It will suffice if you have absolutely no other options, but I found myself growing tired of it fairly quickly and wishing the person I was playing with was sitting next to me instead of on the other end of the internet.I desperately hope that whoever is reading this won’t be hamstrung by a lack of local competition though, as with another person in the room Nidhogg is a phenomenal experience that takes only moments to sell itself but has had me repeatedly stuck in place for hours at a time, always shocked when I finally look at the clock and realize how long we’ve been playing. It’s a finely tuned machine you won’t notice and a catalyst for the delightful multiplayer mayhem that few other games have come anywhere close to matching for me.Developer Messhof understands that multiplayer means more than putting two players on the screen; that making sure multiple people are having fun isn’t as simple as letting them play together, and that creating a friendly competition in a space where there can be only one winner is perhaps the easiest thing to screw up and the most imperative to get right. Nidhogg doesn’t assume what it’s doing is easy the way a lot of similar games seem to, but knows if it can get it right that the end result is an atmosphere and enthusiasm that can’t be matched. Wow, did they ever follow through on that one.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

Then this is the game for you!Pros: The game is fun, fast paced, keeps you on your toes, music is perfect for the game and comedic moments are never far behind.Cons:It's very limited, you fight your way to the other side of the map then rinse and repeat.Matchmaking is terrible it takes too long to find an opponent unless you are playing against friends, this is primarily due to the fact that having very little to do in the game results in short play times and once you've done it there's really no need to go back.Overall:It's not really worth the money for what it is. It's very fun but the fun will soon run out. I would only recommend it if you have the money to spend on it for only a couple hours of fun. "

												Nidhogg is a simplistic fencing game, the winner being the one who comes out on top in a contest of deadly tug-of-war, with a welcoming art style, dynamic soundtrack, a polite attention to detail and incredibly pleasing vistas, this game warms you inside, as you physically and mentally try to out-do your opponent and advance screens. The price isn't totally agreeable, £10.99 ($15) is a tad steep in my opinion as there isn't too much to do alone. However, this game shines in its co-op fun factor. Attemping to line up your friend(s) on your sword like a pixelated shish kebab is very amusing and you'll find yourselves having a blast whenever you're together and Nidhogg's involved. If you've got a buddy to have a 'stab' at this game with then do. Other than that, it's most probably worth getting for yourself in a sale, and only in a sale.			"

												Gameplay always comes first, beyond story or visuals. Gameplay is what makes a game tick. And gameplay is where Nidhogg shines.It's tense tactical game where your skills as a player matter as much as your ability to lure and trick your opponent. It's a subtle give and take, of establishing patterns only to break them, of intimate moments of stillness and caution as the two of you step back and forth anticipating the first strike.It's a game where all are equally matched, where true skill decides the victor rather than the perks, upgrades, boosters of so many other gamesThe simplicity of the controls hide a surprisingly tense and strategic game. One hit kills and there's a wide range of moves and maneuvers at your disposal. While I love Samurai Gunn's lightning fast speed and more varied maps, Nidhogg's slower paced, more cerebral challenge is absolutely addicting. And while you may be able to leap through the air with ease in Samurai Gunn, your moveset is far more versatile in Nidhogg. The smooth animations give each fight a fluid dynamic feel.Not that the visuals are bad either. The surreal graphics and chunky pixels give the game a style all its own. And while the number of maps may seem small, it's definitely a case of quality over quanity. Each map is unique, with its own eccentricities to be mastered from the concealing high grass of the Wilds to the collapsing bridges in Clouds. Not only that, each map consists of several areas as you and your opponent push back and forth to victory. Epic 20 minute duels are not uncommonI rarely play online games, but Nidhogg has me hooked. This is a must play			"

												Nidhogg is a side scrolling fighting game which was released in early 2014. You duel against another sword wielding foe.  You have to get to the other side of the map before your opponent. In order to do so, you must run, jump, throw your sword and slide past the other enemies. The actual gameplay is very simple, just kill the other guy really. This can be done in a number of ways, the most common is just to kill the enemy in a sparing match. You can also disarm your opponent by knocking their weapon out of their hands leaving them very vulnerable with just their fists to fight back with. You can get quite technical if you want though, by wall jumping, dive kicks and knocking down enemies by sliding their feet out. Nidhogg has a single player mode, which is quite enjoyable, but can be completed in about two hours if you have any sort of skill at the game. The single player is essentially the four different levels repeated over and over increasing in difficulty. While I did have fun playing this mode, the real fun from Nidhogg comes out of the local multiplayer mode. This will pit you against your friends in a duel with the same mechanics as previously mentioned, things get competitive very fast, so watch out!  We also have an online multiplayer options available, however there were no players online every time I checked so I would class this as a no go zone.The graphics are a very simplistic style, which actually have a nice look to them; this is the type of game that doesn't need fancy textures and shadows to make it more appealing, as you hardly pay any attention to the graphics due to how fast paced the gameplay is. The single player mode of Nidhogg is about two hours long, so if you are purely looking for a single player experience, this may not be for you since there is not much replay-ability for single player. If you have friends who you can hook up a second controller with, Nidhogg really shines there. The majority of my time on Nidhogg was spent in a local multiplayer mode and it's an absolute blast.Whilst I think the price of £10,99 is quite steep for this game given the lack of single player and online multiplayer content available, the amount of fun you can have in local multiplayer redeems it slightly. So I am going to recommend Nidhogg, but only when it is on sale for anything under £5.  This is certainly a game I will be keeping installed for when friends come round. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away 2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play

												It's funny and competitive. No other game lets you that much control over your sword. The fighters are nimble, and the controls are smooth. As much as it's amazing when playing with someone, it's boring alone, and the online is dead. Buy it only if you have IRL friends. Also, to play only in short game sessions.			"

												This game is so simple and silly, it reminds me of the 1v1 play sessions as a kid in my pajamas with my best friends fighting over the controller.Best way to enjoy the game:- Invite people over (blackmail them if they don't want to come)- Boot Nidhogg and shove a controller in their hands- Give them a minute to figure out the controls- Scream ""PREPARE TO DIE""- Win- Repeat until tournament is complete			"

												I love this game, I love it soo much. But I'm nearly very close to giving it a thumbs down due to the somewhat buggy gameplay and shallow content. I have played this game extremely competitively and have a current record of 9:11, and from that 27 hour experience I can say I've speculated about every mechanic in this game down the very brim and have noticed extremely miniscule mistakes in the programming. This game needs to be more polished. Thank you. 7 / 10			"

												This game is a work of art.  Definitely a masterpiece.  The swordplay is very interesting and different from many other games.The online multiplayer, however, is severely broken.  There is currently no indication that the developer intends to fix the problem, yet they are offering a 2-pack purchase option.Even if online multiplayer was working properly, even with the unique gameplay, the price seems far too high for the tiny amount of content this game provides.  You can ""beat"" this game and see everything it has to offer in less than 30 minutes.  For the same amount of money you can find many, many other high quality games on Steam that will provide more fulfilling experiences.			"

												Fun bag of chips type game.  Okay at parties, not much else.  Even at parties it won't be the life of the party, but it might have a couple good bites.  If you get it free or super cheap it's reasonably fun.It is absurdly overpriced though.  Also the online netcode is/was awful, leading to less people online and thus worse ping and a worse experience and ability to troubleshoot in a vicious cycle.  Do not expect online to be fun other than to laugh at the jankiness.I am not recommending this game only because of the price point.  If you can get it for a buck or two, then fine.  Otherwise spend your money on something better.			"

												4 years in development, reviews scoring it 9/10, many ""indie"" awards won...Yet this is a game that barely works, and SOME bugs were fixed literally 22 months later after its release. It's a good local-multiplayer game for breaks don't get me wrong, but it is sadly full of issues.-Terribly overpriced: very basic gameplay in 4 maps for 15 euros. Steam Workshop would have been great...-Bad netcode: do you know the feeling of waking up from bed, only to realize it was just a dream and find yourself back in bed? Yeah, same feeling. I would not recommend this game if you plan on playing online, friends included.-(Keyboard) controls: everytime I launch the game my mapped controls go back to default. Also I have yet to know which button is used to select options in the pause screen. Controls during gameplay are fine, though.-It's supposed to be a competitive game, but it is overall so shallow, monotonous... It makes you close the game AND wish it could have more content at the same time.			"

												This is certainly one of my favourite local multiplayer games. Although it's 2 player, this actually works in its favour as it means you can have a great game with a smaller group than many local multiplayer titles, and it's so fun to watch that it works well with spectators.From a small series of moves, Nidhogg produces often hilarious fencing moments, either from daring displays of skill or comical misjudgements resulting in failure. I'd like to see more environments in this game, but it remains a great one to have in a collection to pull out when you've got guests over and there's a bit of a lull.			"

My friend and I could play it together but there were a lot of times where it made no sense (someone would die but the other player was too far away to kill them).

												You fight, yet you do not fight. This is a dance, one of death, and of desperation. It is a series of brief, brutal, yet exceptionally precise fights, which spin out into a tug of war woven over various arenas. You roll, you kick, you throw your sword, you panic, you grab the ledge and haul yourself up, you knock your foe down, you grab your sword. You kill him.He respawns ten feet away.This pattern repeats, music constantly shifting with the feet, and on occasion terrain of the landscape upon which you fight. In castles, upon clouds, in dungeons, with lava erupting behind you. A constant barrage of visual information, yet your duellist is kept simple, a monotone duellist with a white sword, and his movements are slick, precise and razor sharp. You move, he twitches, he adjusts his sword with a tap of the key, he lunges, he riposts, he rolls, he grabs his foe and kills him in a bloody manner. He runs forward.Then he gets eaten by a worm. WINNER.This is not a game you win. This is a game you play, and you perfect. The art is the fencing, everything else is just icing on the deliciously precise cake. Dark Souls pared down to it's most barest of essentials, fighting games without their glitz, a relentless focus on two things : You. Your sword.Are you quick enough? No. Be quicker. Be better. Respawn. Try it again. Die. Respawn. Again.Welcome to Nidhogg.			"

												Before yoy read my review for this game, I'd like you to look at my hours, yes, 2 hours. However, I played this game in offline mode, alot, and because of steam then, it never recorded my hours, I have tried co op with a friend of mine, so I at least have perspective on this.-You may now read the review! :DNow, to be fair, I DID have fun playing this game. Sure, at first glace it just looks like a simple game; but while the controls are very simple, the actual combat is extremly complex (stabbing, hand to hand, throwing, catching, etc). To put it simply, it's generally a good game, it's fair, it's fun, and it is very challenging to keep you interested if you're into this. Overall, I'd say for this genre of fighting games, it's perfect. But you look above and see the thumbs Doooown. Two main reasons.1. If you are not really into fighting game, but you do enjoy them, then it seems perfect to get this game; don't. Honestly, the game doesn't give that much content, there are only 4 levels in the game, which is understandable, since the actual level design is marvelous, but for most people who play fighting game, they want levels where you can perform combos and such; where in Nidhogg; it's not about combos, but about speed; so really, this game ISN'T under most fighting game genres. To put it short; it's just generally not a fighting game; it's just a game of tag, with swords.2. The price; even if you are into this game, and the game alone, honestly, for 15 bucks, I could buy the binding of isaac for 5 dollars, and get about 10 times the amount of content in this, I'm not even kidding. Isaac aside; there isn't much play value if you don't have a controller (Sure, you can play without the controller, but it's extremly awkward using the keyboard at once when you are in a really tense situation); and even if you do, you'd probably get about 15 hours worth, before you and your friend gets bored entirely. While the game is VERY well made with excellent work, I'd only get this game during a sale; to me, the game is worth about 6 dollars at the most.One thing I would like to note that, this is simply my opinion, because alot of people in the review section have good points about the game, if possible, give this game a go, it didn't satify my tastes, but it certinly did for alot of other people. So who knows, maybe you'll be that badass ninja guy who can throw his sword like a boomerang, and kill 2 guys in a single swing. Who knows!			"

			Fight! We've survived a duel to the death to bring you our review of Nidhogg. Narrated by: Josh Script by: Val and Josh Please like and subscribe for more reviews, gameplay, and discussions!		

While many wait for the next big title, smaller indie games fill the gaps within the major AAA releases. Among these titles is Nidhogg from developer Messhof. At first glance the portrait displayed isn't anything that would take a spot in a respectable museum but take another look and the fine details may surprise you. Nidhogg's image may not be of this generation or the last few for that matter but for all it's simplicity does its transcend to the height of AAA titles?	Focused on it's combat Nidhogg offers very little in content, the single player consists of dueling several enemies within the four available stages in side-scrolling fashion. The goal is the same throughout, make it across to the opposite end whist in numerous duels of death. The respawns are unlimited but once either makes it across 3 screens the game is over and the victor is eaten by the Nidhogg, the world tree chomping worm of Norse mythology.	If there is anything that Nidhogg does extremely well is its combat, the intricate system requires quick reflexes, perfect timing and finesse. Considering the simple premise, the multitude of stances and moves offer up a good amount of depth.  Duels expanding across the pixilated canvas aren't uncommon and it's a testament to how deep the combat is. Stage hazards do play their role but in the end the better fighter will come out on top. It's any easy game to get into and one that offers up some intense moments with duels reaching ridiculous heights. 	Without a doubt the visuals of Nidhogg are not the main attraction, it's sprite based aesthetics do enough to portray the environments and figures throughout the world. Though limited the end result gives Nidhogg some visual charm and identity. Seeing the floor and walls painted with the players matter is chuckle worthy and a nice touch displaying the chaos among adversaries. 	However, the small amount of stages leaves much to desire, considering how simple the levels are it's hard to imagine why any DLC has not been introduced. Stages present little in the imagination department with minimal inspiration. In light of how much was presented in the combat one would imagine a larger emphasis in the level design to promote replayability. 	Nidhogg's multiplayer is crippled by the absence of any online lobby system that could in fact strengthen the competitive mode drastically. The limited online mutliplayer consist of single encounters unless played locally via the bracket based tournament mode. The idea behind the mode is brilliant but why it isn't available online is a major misstep in the design. 	Nidhogg is a charming experience that could of been greater if not for it's lack in content and multiplayer options. The simple to execute yet deep combat system is offset by many other flaws in design. Nidhoggs first attempt has the most important aspect of any game of this style right, it may be completely lacking in narrative but definitely a game made for competitive multiplayer. Playing with some buds is fun and Nidhogg does a great job with contact kills allowing you to embellish every neck break or impalement of a friend.  It's simple, stupid, and addicting fun.  Pick it up on a sale, the asking price might be a bit steep for the short but humorous experience.+Great Combat+Unique Identity+The Nidhogg has no Mercy-Lack of online options and lobbies-Cloud stage is weak-Lag can be an issue-Flat soundtrack6.9 "

												My first online match had me cackling with glee. Fast paced fencing! You can change from low, mid, high stances plus you can hold up to throw your sword in a last ditch effort. It's the most fun I've had in an arcade style game in a very long time. Don't let the simple graphics fool you, there's a very well thought out combat system here. You win a round and then try to advance screens in your direction so if you want to try to avoid combat after you win a round you can be a coward and beeline for the finish. Ok, enough typing, I have fast paced fencing to get to.			"

Ahem:•	WINNER: Indiecade Game Design, 2013•	WINNER: IGF | GDC Nuovo Award, 2011•	WINNER: Eurogamer Expo, RPS Indie Game of the Show, 2010•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Excellence in Design, 2010•	WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Bloodsport of the Year: 2010•	FINALIST: IGF | GDG Excellence in Design, 2011•	FINALIST: IGF | GDC Grand Prize, 2011Those are the nominations and awards the newly released indie fighter, Nidhogg has listed on their home page. It was enough to make me pick it up without hesitation.I don't often define the quality of a video game by how many awards it's won, but when I start losing the ability to count them on my hands, apparently I do. A good thing, too. Nidhogg is all kinds of awesome.A DUEL TO THE DEATHThe concept is remarkably simple: 2 players go head-to-head in a half duel/half race to the death, both equipped with fencing swords and capable of more than a few tricks to give an edge in battle. You begin facing your opponent in the 'middle' of a map, with an opening battle. Battles are fast and furious beyond imagining, often ending within a few seconds, which ties into the gameplay mechanic wonderfully: upon killing your opponent they'll need to wait a moment to respawn, allowing you to press forward toward your 'goal'. Win a battle and you're given the 'goal light' allowing you to move forward further; lose, and your opponent gains it instead. So long as you maintain the previous kill you can pass-by your opponent without engaging and edge closer to your goal - should they fail to stop your approach.This 'tug-o-war' mechanic is the single most endearing indie game element I've felt in a while. It's relentless, and the feeling of achievement after finally managing to push an opponent back to the end, before summarily being eaten by Nidhogg, is one of much glory and admiration. Simple, sure. But so very, very rewarding. Easy to learn, too, and likely near-impossible to master.MATCH MADE IN HELLSingle-Player Mode consists of fighting steadily more challenging opponents, one after another, on one of 4 maps. So, naturally, if you want to be playing Nidhogg for more than a few hours, you're going to need to go multiplayer.Sadly, the online matchmaking within Steam isn't great. Assuming you can actually find a game, there's a good chance one of you will be lagging horribly — and when you're playing the type of game that you can't play with even the slightest amount of lag, matches can often lead to aggravating experiences. Assuming you have a few friends playing, and you're all within the same global region, this won't be a huge problem. And if you're lucky enough to have more than a few friends playing, then Tournament Mode will likely give you the greatest experience of all. I know, personally, playing live on Twitch, that this feature will make for 99% of all my time playing. WORTH A BUY?At $15~ I can only recommend a purchase here for players with friends planning to play with them - for now, at least. Which is largely a shame, as the gameplay offered in Nidhogg is truly exceptional.Possible improvements include visual upgrades to characters to simulate some form of character progression; as it stands, every game is the same and with 4 maps there's limited variety. You'll be relying on your opponents to entertain you; if they do, you're going to love Nidhogg, if not, you're likely going to get very bored, very quick.ABOUT THE AUTHORCody Hargreaves, better known as  Excessive Profanity[twitch.tv], has been writing reviews and articles in the gaming industry for 7 years, across various websites and publications.

												While by modern standards Nidhogg is minimalistic in both features and aesthetic, the joy and entertainment derived from gradually learning its frenetic, deliberate, and simple combat system is enough for me to consider this one of the best indie fighting games I've ever played. Though it is admittedly lacking in level or character selection, what's present is beautifully realized, from the abstract woodland creatures gambolling in the tall grass to the vortex of light pulsing behind cloud bridges. The soundtrack, while only comprised of four tracks, is perfectly suited to the technicolor slaughter.The game offers online play, but I would only recommend this if you're planning to joust in-person. Any amount of latency would kill the pinprick precision integral to the swordplay. Like any good fighting game, the best part is learning and adapting with each match, and there's little else sweeter than witnessing your opponent wince and hearing the spectators clamor after a meticulously-timed riposte (or a rude and random divekick, whatever works). It succeeds equally well as both a cuthroat, competitive tournament game and a night drinking's casual diversion.			"

												Short and Sweet Version:  This game is very basic.  You try to go one way, the other guy the other way.  The controls aren't nearly as tight as I would like them (or perhaps too tight?).  And the sound track to doing this back and forth non-sense is very repetitive and uninspiring.  The sounds are about what you'd expect, but perhaps a grade below that and the gameplay, although as responsive (sometimes, sometimes not) is about what you'd expect.I would price this title at $3.  If you spend any more than that, you'll feel as cheated as I currently do.Overall - very disappointed for what I paid for it.			"

												Great game to play with friends (or enemies). It's well worth the full price. If you're in the same room, you can play on the same keyboard or have someone on the keys and the other on a gamepad. The controls are easy to pick up, but the gameplay is just so addictive. Can't beat the feeling of disarming the other guy and watching the spray of pixels when you poke him. It's more than a simple fencing game. It's a back and forth struggle full of swordplay, chases, and satisfying comebacks.			"

												I have a about an hour or two in this game, but don't let that discourage you. GAMEPLAY: Niddhog has very good gameplay, easy to learn but difficult to master at its finest. You hold your rapier in three positions, low, mid, and high. You can strike from any of these positions, and if you hit your opponent who is at the same guard as your attack, it'll be parried. Moving your blade up/down onto your opponent's guard will also disarm them. You can throw your rapier, do a jump-kick, and do a sweep while crouched. You can also roll on the ground, which has the implication of rolling under a high-guard and getting behind your opponent. Overall, the combat is good. Also, each unique stage has special areas and can be used to your advantage. Such as the cloud level where you can fall down if you don't move. GRAPHICS: The graphics, although ""pixellated"", are aesthetically pleasing. However this is where the game starts to fall. The second ""cloud"" level, is very, very bright and flashes very fast. I'm not epileptic, but I was straining to see in this level and I have no idea how an epileptic would deal with it. But otherwise they're good. COMMUNITY: Now here's where the game falls apart further. It has a good, active community. However this is useless as the netcode for the game literally doesn't work. There is no online play, so you can only play locally/LAN. A game that'd otherwise have a very long life is made a gimmick because of this. There are no multiplayer tournaments, matches with friends, or community events. In this sense, the game's simplicity kills itself as it doesn't last when playing alone. The game is good, but I can't recommend it. Due to the non-existant support post-launch, the broken netcode, and lack of news about the game gives it a bleak future. 5/10, good game but it's average.			"

												In short, a game of tug-o-war with a variation. A neat side scroll-er with a simple game play idea and graphic. Nidhogg with wonderful controller support is a game that mirrors fencing and you must defeat your opponent and advance to the next stage. When you defeat an opponent, you only have so much time to run to the next stage before he reincarnates. The controllers are simple which include hitting an opponents body or head... and if you catch their swords on an up sweep you can disarm them. You also have the ability to throw your sword. It's a neat game, it's fun for what it is, but the fun doesn't last extremely long. Only reason I got it was it was listed as local co-op. I'll recommend it but with caution.RATING : 6.75/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign N/A Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

												This game is very well-made. I say this because it requires skill to play, is fast-paced, has wonderful backgrounds, and simply has an interesting and fun concept behind it. It's also very satisfying to fake out your opponent with a tricky sword maneuver and jam a rapier through his head. Additionally, the soundtrack is phenomenal! However, the replayability of the game is limited, as there are only four maps and the online multiplayer is a bit rough around the edges (it's much better and more responsive while playing local multiplayer or singleplayer), and once you beat the singleplayer campaign you need friends who enjoy playing it as much as you do. Overall, I would highly recommend this game, as it is entertaining, satisfying, and while it is easy to learn, it is difficult to master (but very rewarding when you get it down pat). I actually have more hours on record than Steam reports I do, because I've played it on a different computer and the transfer of playtime between computers was not very good; I have about 10 hours more than the amount shown above invested in this game, and I still play it and recommend it heartily. Well worth the money, and well worth the time you'll spend playing it.			"

												Right now, not worth the price, at all.  The game isn't even true 16x9 widescreen, game has unexplainable lagspikes on my brand new 700 series GPU Gaming Laptop.  And the combat itself feels more frantic and ""beat to the punch"" based than actual super fast paced methodical skill-based combat.  Has good ideas, and my opinions can change on the complexity and eventual mastery, but right now it's just ""feels"" too frenetic to be any real skill-based 3rd Strike (if you will) type gameplay.  So it's a good pick up and play game.  Soundtrack wise, it leaves a lot to be desired.  nothing really to say there, nothing is really good at all...Visually, it's a minimalist type paintery style, sort of, but I don't particularly think it excentuates the raw gameplay as much as another artstyle could.  But heh, it's unique, and it looks alright.  Multiplayer should be fun at least.  Anyway, just my first impressions.  But definitely not worth a $15 pricetag imo, much better games at cheaper or exactly that price.  And Volgarr The Viking remains the undisputed king of recent Indie games recently with Race The Sun at #2 imo.  So anyway, yeah, 7/10 if you want a score.			"

												I really WANTED to like this game. I'd heard such great things about it, and it seemed like it should be right up my alley. Unfortunately, it was just let down.First, the gameplay. Nidhogg has simple but slightly awkward controls that certainly can be mastered but aren't particularly fluid on their own. If you're expecting fighting-game style precision, you're going to be disappointed. Once you get past the tutorial, the movement options feel fuzzy and unreliable. The basic combat is... okay. Most actions happen so quickly that it's humanly impossible to react to them, so it's mostly about anticipation and taking risks, and be prepared for a number of frustrating deaths where it doesn't even look like you were touched by the opponent's sword.I realize that everything I just wrote is directly contrary to what most other critics are saying about the game, but I can only call it like I see it. I've played plenty of other games in this niche, and they all felt better than Nidhogg.The one place where the game is fun is local co-op, which is the entire point of the game I suppose, but it's fun for the ""wrong"" reasons. Playing with a group of friends makes all of the ""screw you, that was stupid"" moments fun, because you  all get to taunt each other the whole time. So basically, the game is fun with friends precisely *because* of the stupid and lopsided moments that in any other situation would just be frustrating.Claims that the game's graphics are ""beautiful"" are overstated. There are one or two impressive setpieces that will probably catch your eye, but the game as a whole isn't particularly nice-looking. The style is unique and expressive, but it's not objectively pleasing by any measure. Also, the game really needs a colorblind setting, because my character is practically invisible to me against the backdrop of the second stage.My final complaint, which others have echoed, is that there's not nearly enough content to justify the $15 price tag. I normally don't mind paying a little extra for a good game, but this is definitely more of a $5 title. If it's on sale for that much and you're looking for a new game to play at parties, maybe this is for you, but otherwise you're not missing much by passing it up.			"

												First things first:This is a party-game, meaning it´s supposed to be played with many people on a couch, screaming, laughing. Think Smash Bros, Towerfall, Samurai Gunn, etc. Don´t fret though because the game does have online multiplayer.The simple goal of Nidhogg is to get into the endzone, that´s it. Too bad your opponent has the exact same goal.What ensues is a glorious tug of war, because who ever got the last kill is the only one who can proceed. And killing there will be lots of, because besides being a race for the goal, Nidhogg also excells at being a Prince of Persia-style fencing game. Although appearing rather simple, the fighting system is pretty deep and complex with parries, blocks, feints, jumps, rolls, wallmoves, different attack stances, you can even throw your blade at your opponent. All of this lightning-fast action is presented in a very stylized fashion, reminescent of the good old days of the Commodore 64 and it fits the game perfectly. Animations are fluent (and very gory in a cartoony way), backgrounds are very retro and sometimes deliberately convoluted or hard to see your character in. Though featuring only 4 Stages on the date of this review, it´s more than enough to get going and further deepens the Retro-Arcady-Feel of this game (yes, leaving things out can actually give a product more character rather than taking it away)Sound and music are nothing to write home about but they get the job done with little screams and clangs here and there.Nidhogg is a game it would definetely reccomend if you grew up with titles like Barbarian, International Karate (Karateka) or even the wonderful Moonstone (which NEEDS a remake). It´s fast, deep, satisfying, a definite skill- AND mindgame when it comes to the fencing. People looking for a lot of content and fancy graphics will surely be turned off by this game but tournament-fighters and retro-fans should try it.One final word about the pricing, I can understand that 11 bucks (or how much that may be in $) is a steep price but devs gotta live too and I´m sure it will be in a sale sooner or later. So consider helping the guys (the guy?) from Messhoff out by getting it right now!			"

												 I just had a five minute one-on-one duel with a random person.  It can be ♥♥♥♥in’ INTENSE.  You can die and respawn as many times as you like.  The goal is to get to the end of the level in whatever direction you have to go, right for me, left for him.  Stab, jump, kick, punch your way through him.  Even if the game ends up with him almost winning, you can push your way back to your end of the level just because it becomes so nerve racking for the other person that a chance for you to push back opens up and you make a mad dash for the right side of the screen.  The battle wages on room through room, back and forth.  Orange and Yellow blood bathes the floor while sword upon sword exchange hands as they are thrown through the air.  A lucky stab in the face brings your opponent’s hands to your sword as you stand still for but a moment, the character grasping at the sword.  You thrust forward and the color orange floods the floor below.  You run forward.  He spawns in the doorway ahead of you.  You can’t throw your sword.  You have to charge him.  You see that he has put his sword just too high.  You charge.  You duck and roll all the way through the doorway and stand and stab him in the back.  You keep running.  He spawns again, this time getting a lucky sword throw to your face.  Lives are traded.  you finally make it to the next room.  You are beating him.  This is your territory.  The ground is clean of blood and swords.  you charge.  he spawns just before a pit and makes a nervous jump, falling to his doom.  You laugh!  You wait for him to respawn as he recollects himself.  You both realize that that pitfall was a mistake.  An honorable man lets your opponent have a fair fight.   You beat him.  As he dissolves in to orange goo behind you, you run for the final screen.  You make it.The screen flares up in brilliant red as the sky catches fire.  The music picks up.  Everything is waiting for you to make the first move.  You charge.  he spawns.  He knows you could win if you get past him.  You make a jump.  You dive kick in to him.  His sword goes left, his body crumples.  You charge to the right.  he runs to the left, hoping to respawn before you can make it across to the end of the map.  He respawns.He knows your tricks.  he knows you will jump above him as he spawns, sending your foot in to his face.  He is ready.  You know he knows your plans.  You prepare for the inevitable.  There is no time to change plans.  You must act.  You jump.He jumps.One of you will press the kick button at the right time.  If you press it at the wrong time, he will kick you to the ground and rip your proud head off your yellow neck.  You kick.  Your feet meet his feet.  He falls.  You charge.The croud is doing the wave in your favor.  You have done it.  You bow to your opponent.  Your hands are sweating.  You crawl to the finish line, barely able to stand.A giant worm flies towards you.  You are eaten whole.WINNER.			"

It's very well put together and can make some amazing situations.As always there are things to watch out for:Technical issues-  These are not too terrible, but be preprared in every 3rd or 4th game to lose or win a fight due to a network hiccup.  As always I assume they'll be fixed as I played this near release.No idea the future:There's no communication on what the future for this game is now. There's a great game here, but all games have room to grow. I have no idea if any improvements are incoming.Complaints I would not worry about from other people.Only 4 maps.  Consider it like a fighting game.  They may have 12 maps, but it's really a background swap.  Here each 4 maps represents a completely different battlefield.  If people clamour that much for more maps they could easily doa pallet swap and call it a day.			"

												If you have some local friends to play with, this game is excellent. The combat is surprisingly deep and even after a few days I still find it really fun to play in a local setting. Spectating people chanting and cheering when someone is disarmed and slain is one of the things that just can't be coded in to the game. Eight player tournaments are also spectacular, but this is an even less likely scenario for most prospective buyers. There is a single player game that is adequate for times where you'd like to play but have no one to play with for the moment, but this mode is not nearly as interesting as battling with other humans.Yes, there is an option to play online. However, online multiplayer still has a lot of issues that seem to vary between being ""fine"" and ""massive desync; abort everything"". It's a shame, but I can't recommend this game that doesn't treat this game as a local multiplayer game the time being. There may be a day where that's untrue, maybe even soon, where it'll be absolutely fine online. Until then, consider this game only if you have at least one other person to play with. If you are willing to slog through some horrible connection problems with some people, there may be some fun matches to have, but the cost-benefit of that could potentially be very low.In short: great game for local multiplayer. Very interesting and fun mechanics. Promising online multiplayer that is currently very unreliable.			"

												This game is fantastic. Super simple, but has a lot of strategic depth. Matches are a quick tug-of-war game of fencing, but can turn into epic bouts with mindful opponents. If you like PVP at all, and are looking for a game that can be a ton of fun without a big time commitment, you can't go wrong with this.

												Entertaining, but the game desperately needs additional features and some bug fixing before I could ever recommend it, or play for more than the odd rare match.  Online multiplayer is incredibly laggy, there is no option for local lan play which I see as a huge omission, there is no way of directly choosing to play with a friend so you can't arrange to play people, and the menus need better mouse support or a different UI entirely.But, the gameplay is there, and that's the biggest hurdle.  The aesthetic is solid, the gamemodes are varied and interesting, it's got most of what it needs to be a good multiplayer game between friends.  It could be lots of fun, if they could make it so you could actually play with those friends without dealing with 20 rounds of matchmaking roulette to get paired and a ruberbanding stuttery mess when you finally play.  It's just pretty hard to actually enjoy the game.  I hope for future updates, but I'm not holding my breath.			"

												Nidhogg is about competitive dueling. I first played EggNogg that was way more hilarious with the swords bouncing around, so I entered Nidhogg disappointed as it was more 'bland' and the different parts of each level are too short to allow longer play and more frequent comebacks. EggNogg had one single level with more variety inside, while Nidhogg has less variety inside a single level but more variety overall with the different levels and their unique twists (grass field to hide in the Wilds, narrow corridors and moving floor in the Mines, concealing clouds and bright colors in the Clouds, and a few pits plus a big central area in the Castle). I will give something important to Nidhogg over EggNogg though: the controls are more reactive and the game is more balanced. It feels good to play, and it leaves a lot of room for improving skill and reading the moves of the opponent. (Edit: However EggNogg+ now has reactive controls that even includes wall-jumps!)So what else does Nidhogg have? AI players for a single player mode, these opponents are actually quite good and each AI seems to have its own way to fight and unpredictable movements. Good point here. There are nice local multiplayer additions such as an 8 player tournament mode, and the possibility to change the game rules for local 1 on 1.Last but not least, there is an online multiplayer mode. Having friends to play with seems like the only reasonable way, as the matchmaking is literally empty and on the rare occasions that there is someone else playing, expect painful lag as they are likely at the other side of the world.So then, here comes the big question. Why am I not recommending this game? I enjoy playing it, I want it to have more success but.... It took so many years and does not seem polished enough. It is not possible to change the color of the players, my logitech controllers are not recognized by the game, the different areas in each level are too short to allow for more tense play (the central area in the castle is the best place for comebacks and tension building up), the online part of the game has the merit to exist but didn't get enough love, there are no arrows at the start of the game to show who is who, and, for all of that, I find that the game is too expensive for what it is. And apparently I'm not the only one thinking that way, seeing all the comments in the forum and the fact that the online multiplayer is quite empty.I can only recommend this game on sale or if you know you will often have friends over to enjoy the duels. I realize that I am too severe because I probably expected too much and the free game EggNogg biased my judgment a lot, but Nidhogg was around for a long time and the result still lacks polish. Although I guess that it is expensive to compensate for the small niche market. But a fundamental issue for me is the lack of players online, and the insane lag on the rare moments that a player is found (it can even happen often to see the same scene rewind with each time a different player dying, wtf?).

Great single player, and has good amount of moves to plan ahead. Very solid AI to keep the game intresting. Maps are fun and all set up a good diffrent form on each one. Now some downsides, the multiplayer is really bad, with connection problems a lot. It registers as you stabbing a guy, yet he is running away 2 secs later, and also, we need a couple more maps. But this game is fun and addicting, and I recomend it.7/10. Is rlly good			"

												Nidhogg is a small game developed by an indie developer Messhof. While the game isn’t the longest one I have ever played, it is definitely THE best local multiplayer game I have played in a long time. You can literally spend countless hours playing the local multiplayer against your friends. However, if you like to play with your friends, then this game is for you, but if you do not like the local multiplayer, I still recommend that the game is not very long, this needs improvement.In Nidhogg there is only one objective , kill your opponent by out-stabbing them by using only three sets of stances, high, middle and low. While it may sound simple at first, the game is really hard to master, and sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating when you get stabbed couple times in a row. After you kill your enemy you have to run to the right in order to advance to next level, the enemy can do the same thing, the first one being the easiest and the last one. I don’t know what’s the point of that but It’s kind of hilarious and random.As I have said before, the single-player consists of 17 AI opponents, which is great but the same can’t be said about the level variety, there is only 3 or 4 different levels which are re-used during the 17 battles in the single-player. I really wish that there was more variety in level design, maybe we’ll get them in later updates. The art style is what I love the most about this game, the player animations are also worth mentioning because of how smooth and realistic they are, and also it feels really satisfying when you stab someone. On the other hand, the game also has some flaws, one of them is the online multiplayer, it is seriously lacking in features and is very unstable, I kept being disconnected from matches, and I have experienced serious lag during several online matches.

												Let's start this review slightly differently. This is an amazing game and you should be ashamed you're not playing it right now. I think many of you will agree that there are very few genres that can compete with fighting games when it comes to a local multiplayer experience. While RPGs, FPSs and RTSs are usually played alone with headphones on, it's the fighting games that not brings the whole circle of friends together. And the neighbours as well, since they're jarateed off that you are still shouting for several hours straight. Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Skullgirls - these games are the first ones that come to mind whenever you think about playing together on the same couch with your buddies. Hell, even on the Wii, that's notorious for being the best console to play with your buddies in the same room, the best selling game that's not Sports or Mario is... Super Smash Bros. Brawl. A fighting game. The sheer competitiveness of fighting one-to-one or two versus two is already thrilling and excitement-filling, but the possible moves, combinations and strategies can leave an incredible impression to anyone. And Nidhogg, well, is a fighting game. Kind of.Truth to be told, it's a fighting game in the purest form. No different characters. No varied movesets. Perfect. Symmetry. Both players get to play as a diffent-colored fighter. Part stickman, part pixel-man(?), he wields a sword of sorts. It's probably a rapier. I mean, you stab the other part stickman, part pixel-man with it. The stages are perfectly symmetrical as well, meaning that the only advantage you can get is the one you build yourself.The gameplay isn't traditional in fighting game sense: two players try to stab/divekick/rip-spine-off one another. Such actions result in an instant-kill. Although this is not quite near the Divekick level, where one touch means someone is dead already, the fights rarely last more than a few seconds. Once the morbid deed has been done and your opponent is bleeding all over the place, a huge GO! arrow appears in the direction where your opponent should be. If he was alive, that is. You run towards the arrow, the screen moves slightly and now your opponent has respawned, standing a few meters away from you, weapon ready. Kill him, see the arrow, run towards the arrow, move screen even more. In a way, this might remind you of those classic beat-'em-ups, where you have to punch down all the guys in the screen, see the GO! arrow appear and then move the screen slightly, getting yourself an inch closer to victory. The process in Nidhogg is pretty similar, except that in the way of killing>running towards arrow>killing, you will most likely be pierced like a kebab and left pouring blood all over the carpet. If such an accident happens, and it will, a GO! arrow will still appear. This time, for your opponent. If you fail enough times and get killed more, the screen will move to the final stage. Dying here will usually mean that your opponent wins. As he runs towards victory, you block his initial lunge, jump to the air and land on his head. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ manages to roll back and pick up his rapier. However, this time, he is on the defensive, while you are free to run towards him, roll just under his blade and swipe his feet, knocking your foe down. It all culminates with a glorified spine-rip, with extra crunchy sound effects as a bonus. You run towards the arrow, the screen moves and you feel a little bit more relieved, knowing that you managed to push away your fate slightly farther away.Such is the beatiful fencing of Nidhogg, where you use the responsive and fluid control to out-skill and out-wit your opponent. Fights last mere seconds, but they are just as exciting as a whole round of Street Fighter. You'll never feel cheated if you die, since you were not out-gunned. I mean, who the hell picks Chun Li while playing with your friends, anyway!? Erm, sorry. The whole game can be controlled by 6 buttons - 4 for movement and 2 for attacking. It's incredibly simple and easy to pick up, but just like the aforementioned Divekick, this game is immensely complex. With a few button combinations, you can jump, divekick, roll, cartwheel (!), taunt, throw you goshdarned rapier into the unsuspecting victim's face and more.Not only the fencing is beautiful, however. The arenas you fight in are as well. There is some variety and creativity here and there, but not too much to distract you from the true goal. To appeal to the mighty Nidhogg. Oh, forgot to mention him! Reader, meet Nidhogg, the giant pink nordic dragon-snake-thingy that eats you once you win. All jokes aside, this game is filled with incredible design decisions, even if some of them are accidental. Even the mere fact that the whole point of the game is to get EATEN with a loud *CRUNCH* sound following makes this game perfect for parties. Sure, your opponent won after that hard match and he might have been using his cheap running technique, but he got eaten. The silly Nidhogg's eyes are enough to soften up even the sorest losers. And the awesome design doesn't stop there. The sound effects are great to cheer people up as well. Alongside the general rapier sounds, you also get a whole bunch of *slash*, *slush* and *GWEAAAARRRRGHHHhhhh...* as well. After your opponent misjudges his distance and divekicks right in front of your rapier, impaling himself, it's hard for both to contain laughter after the poor sod releases a complimentary *Erghhwgghhht...* This game also has flaws, as hard it might be to confess. Single-player is pretty much a glorified training mode (aren't most fighting games like that?) with an easily exploitable AI and online-multiplayers suffers from latency issues. However, playing anything but local multiplayer on this game is just a crime against it. Still, the number of stages is underwhelming and Steam Workshop support could help it. Another minor complaint would be that you can't pick your own color during offline multiplayer, only tournament mode.Nidhogg can create new friendships. Nidhogg can strenghthen existing ones. And most likely Nidhogg will. Dueling with a buddy, be it you two are playing for the first time or this is your fifth hundredth match, is just simply a blast, filled with laughter, joy, shouts and pixelated blood. But it's even more fun to play with even more friends. Up to 8 player tournament mode is incredible (and the winner gets something more awesome than being eaten by a worm) and while two are locked in an intense duel, the others can shoutcast, cheer or pick favorites. It's an incredible party game. Tim is strategic, trying to roll under your feet and disarm you. Mike is wrong in the head and he thinks that throwing your only weapon in vain hopes to kill is the best way to win. He's probably right. Johnny? He's an ♥♥♥♥, trying to run around the opposition, instead of fighting head-on. Steve is good at dive-kicking. He'll dive-kick when he has the upper hand and when he doesn't. He'll dive-kick anytime. Oh, there's also me, the sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, who rolls around the floor using the same move he calls ""Cartwheel assassin"" trying to sneakily stab you once you're distracted.All of these strategies work. All of them are viable. All of them can win games and they HAVE won games.There are no tier-lists in Nidhogg. There are no combo sheets either. Just pure fun. If you, dear reader, think that this isn't a fighting game, you're probably right as well. But all I care is that Nidhogg is the best local multiplayer game you could ever play.			"

												Really Really fun little 2d fencing sim. Its got a great combat system that I think successfully emulates what it is like to fence and an interesting and surreal artstyle and setting to boot. Be patient with the game though because the single player can be very frusterating. The AI DOES NOT ♥♥♥♥ around in this game and you will be defeated a lot. The multiplayer is excellent as well, all thanks to the great and complex combat system that I mentioned earlier.			"

												9/10Nidhogg is an amazing game, wether the pricetag turns you off or not. This game perfectly revives old arcade style fights with your friends. This game is one of the most intense you will play in a long time. Locally, this game is a wonder and something that everyone will have a blast with. The graphics are simplistic enough that they do not distract from the gameplay, which the game revolves around in the first place. The controls are quick and easy to hop into. Within the first five minutes of the game, you will learn every move the game has to offer, from divekicks to somersaults. The concept of Nidhogg sometimes makes it feel like a boardgame; having a strict set of rules and goals but hundreds of different ways to achieve them. Although the meat of the game purely revolves around playing with other people, the AI is actually very fun to play against in the singleplayer. Obviously, they goof sometimes, but they will often be fun to play with and be a slight challenge at least. This game is great with friends and even the matchmaking is pretty swell. What takes away from this game is purely how laggy the multiplayer can be in some cases. Few matchmaking games will be laggy, but private games that you are invited to can be atrocious. If you have the money, I highly recommend Nidhogg, especially if you have people to enjoy it with.			"

												Took me about 48 minutes to beat the singleplayer, and then I played some of the multiplayer. There aren't many people online (4 were matchmaking at the time) but I still found a match relativley quickly. The tutorial is broken at the momment, but just looking at the control configuration gives you an idea of things.The game is pretty straight forward, you kill the enemy player and advanced towards your goal before they respawn infront of you. Once you get to the end you sacrafice yourself to a giant worm to entertain a crowd and win. It's a tug of war game with swords and it's rather fun doing crazy moves like disarming your opponents or kicking them off cliffs.I heard the multiplayer was really laggy for some people, but it seems playable if you're playing with somebody on the same continent. I expereinced a bit of delay in my moves but did alright against a random player.If you're hurting for cash, I probably wouldn't recommend spending more than 10 dollars on this game unless you are planning on playing it with a friend, I'm assuming that's where most of the fun comes from.If this game every goes for sale at a cheap price, I'd defintiley recommend it. It's very entertaining.			"

												Granted I've only played one play session of this, but that single session alone with my friend was some of the most fun I've had in a multiplayer game in quite a long time. It's fast. It's silly. It's just a blast to play. It's been bizarre to see people review this as a single player game, because it's a primarily a multiplayer game, though. Based on the amount of fun I've had so far, it is without question worth picking up to play with your friends. (I suppose it's worth noting that I've only played the multiplayer online, but I imagine local multiplayer would be even crazier).			"

												With 25 hours into this game, I find it difficult to recommend in its current state.  The single player experience is barebones and really just a training ground for the Multiplayer experience.If you are playing this locally with a buddy, then GET THIS GAME.  Controls are tight as Sh*t, matches are fun, and enough settings to tweak to keep things lively.   If you are playing this online, DO NOT get this game.  Nidhogg has issues finding you anyone to play, and if you are lucky enough to get paired with someone after a 10 minute wait, theres a 50-50 chance the connection will be too laggy to play.Its sad that a game geared for multiplayer implemented such a poor online experience, killing its customer base.

												This game is ill and represents the poverty gaming label quite strongly. Should be a standard for all poverty and poverty-related (mystery game) tournaments.1) Gameplay is strong and simple. Easy to play, difficult to master. The fact it was brought out to major tournaments has developed a small cult following as a result.2) Art style is simple and effective. Concentrating on the meat of the game, which is gameplay.3) It brings the hype. Plain and simple.It brings some of the best mechanics from fighting games. Simplicty in mechanics. Parrying, low sweeps, divekicking, roll dodging, throwing. All optional to use, but when used effectively will lead to victory. Rewarding good reactions and good reads. Of course, one could totally avoid fights all together to victory as well. This leaves many options open towards fighting.I would bring this to local tournaments. Nuff said.			"

												My girlfriend practices fencing so I got this for us to play as a joke. What I failed to realize was how much fun it would be and how much I'd be laughing during our bouts. It's got that same quick gameplay and strategic timing of old school vs arcade games like Joust. The graphics even herald of the golden days of pixel based gaming. It is just you vs the computer or another player and you have to advance all the way to the enemies side of the battlefield across several screens. Your only weapon is a fencing foil that you can hold high, level or low and depending on the positioning you will have an advantage when swining at the enemy, a disadvantage, or a cancel/parry. Throw in a jump, a roll, a throw, and the ability to punch/kick when disarmed and you have a simple move set that is difficult to level against your enemy if they are every bit as conniving as you. It's a great game to play with friends, and though it doesn't have lasting appeal, it's always fun to throw in for a quick match as a palette cleanser betwee other multiplayer games. Pick it up on sale and you won't regret it.			"

Nidhogg is appealing in so many ways.In fact, it's a game full of so many good design choices, that it's a shame it is often overlooked. Gameplay is easy to grasp, but leaves the player with a lot of room to fine-tune how they approach combat. It's a tug-of-war that rewards strategy, and which lends itself to some really satisfying wins. Coupled with colourful, stylized pixel-art - and a soundtrack that's unconventional, but incredibly catchy - I have a hard time complaining about any of Nidhogg's design elements.However, it suffers from the same problem that a game like Gang Beasts does (in its current state): for a game that is so clearly meant to be played with friends or a community, multiplayer is just far too inaccessible. Matchmaking in Nidhogg is painfully vacant. But where a game like Gang Beasts is making strides towards things like community building and online play, Nidhogg has already moved passed them.So, while I recommend Nidhogg to anyone looking for something easy to pick up, challenging, visually striking, and relatively cheap; they'd better be prepared to play it alone.

												My girlfriend practices fencing so I got this for us to play as a joke. What I failed to realize was how much fun it would be and how much I'd be laughing during our bouts. It's got that same quick gameplay and strategic timing of old school vs arcade games like Joust. The graphics even herald of the golden days of pixel based gaming. It is just you vs the computer or another player and you have to advance all the way to the enemies side of the battlefield across several screens. Your only weapon is a fencing foil that you can hold high, level or low and depending on the positioning you will have an advantage when swining at the enemy, a disadvantage, or a cancel/parry. Throw in a jump, a roll, a throw, and the ability to punch/kick when disarmed and you have a simple move set that is difficult to level against your enemy if they are every bit as conniving as you. It's a great game to play with friends, and though it doesn't have lasting appeal, it's always fun to throw in for a quick match as a palette cleanser betwee other multiplayer games. Pick it up on sale and you won't regret it.			"

Nidhogg is appealing in so many ways.In fact, it's a game full of so many good design choices, that it's a shame it is often overlooked. Gameplay is easy to grasp, but leaves the player with a lot of room to fine-tune how they approach combat. It's a tug-of-war that rewards strategy, and which lends itself to some really satisfying wins. Coupled with colourful, stylized pixel-art - and a soundtrack that's unconventional, but incredibly catchy - I have a hard time complaining about any of Nidhogg's design elements.However, it suffers from the same problem that a game like Gang Beasts does (in its current state): for a game that is so clearly meant to be played with friends or a community, multiplayer is just far too inaccessible. Matchmaking in Nidhogg is painfully vacant. But where a game like Gang Beasts is making strides towards things like community building and online play, Nidhogg has already moved passed them.So, while I recommend Nidhogg to anyone looking for something easy to pick up, challenging, visually striking, and relatively cheap; they'd better be prepared to play it alone.

												Nidhogg is a fast pace fencing game with tug-of-war elements. However in this tug of war you don't just have to fight and kill the oposition. You can evade his blade to by pass the opponent compleatly, but watch out as one quick thrust or thrown sword can cause your body to erupt in colorful blood all over the stage. As you become a better nidhogg-er you can pull off some sick plays by reading your opponent's habits and punish them. The cost of the game may be high for an indie title but having a good friend either next to you or in a call is the best experience I have had in a long time. (laughed for 10+ min strait at one point) I highly recommend the game and just to note this game does have a single player mode and online mode but only has 4 stages. (castle, mine, cloud, and wild) In online mode you can do matchmaking and private matches. With okay net code you can decided on what type of experience you want from the game. Have fun and happy frog jumping (inside joke not a reccomended fighting style)			"

												It's like a low-fi, super simplifird smash brothers with some interesting independent elements that are born of the swordfighting theme. There's a lot that can be said about a simple engine that produces complex situations and gives such a wide flexibility to gameplay. It's one of those games that when you win or lose you never feel cheated and it's fun to end a match on either side of the divide.I would say however that the price seems a little insane for the small amount of content, however if that's the price you pay for such a fittingly simple and robust online facility and touch perfect controls then I can understand even if I don't agree. The game really needs some free updates to it, perhaps even workshop level-editing. This really does feel like a proof of concept, albeit a really, really good one.			"

												A brilliant, balanced, entertaining game. Manages to capture the utmost excitement most games can achieve in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds, time and time again. A balanced, simplistic game built upon skill and reflexes, there are only 7 attacks and each has a potential counter resulting in death. This game is easy to learn, hard to master, and playing with friends is epic. I have only played this game for an hour but I am already hooked, I would recommend this to anyone who has ever liked Smash Bros, Street Fighter or any game similar.

												This is a game for parties. I first was introduced to it at IndieCade, where it was projected on a large screen with two people duking it out via arcade sticks surrounded by a cheering crowd, and that is where this game thrives. You can play it by yourself, but that's not the point. You can also play it via online multiplayer, which is better, but it still thrives only when there's an audience, or at least when you can yell at the person you're fighting against. The game is brutal, fast paced, quick to pick up, and insanely fun. Just know that you'll need other people to play with (I mean, it comes with a built-in tournament mode).			"

												Nidhogg is a great little indie swordfighting game. The fighting mechanics feel a lot like divekick where they're simple to learn but very tough to master. The animations and visuals are absolutely stunning and the audio track just enhances the atmosphere. I have experience latency issues with multiplayer multiple times and it would be nice to have a few more levels (currently there is 4). But overall this is a very enjoyable game that is definitely worth the pricetag.I review indie games and I did a spotlight for Nidhogg so if you want to see some gameplay consider clicking the link below, thank you :)

												Grab a few friends for an online tournament and you can have fun for hours with Nidhogg, but not days. This game is sadly a one-trick pony and you'll feel the brand-new game buzz wear pretty damn thin much quicker than you'd like. If you look past the shear lack of longevity to this game, you can no doubt appreciate the nice visual take on a classic look and the quirky and fresh (in the modern gaming world anyway) style of gameplay. If you're looking for a fun indie game to play solo (for more than an hour or two at least), in my opinion, this isn't it.6/10Pros/Cons+ Gameplay is fluent, intense and varied enough for a well-balanced and fun showdown.+ Classical visuals matched with frantic visual effects and modern music make for an interesting mix.+ With friends this game creates rivalries and offers a few hours of fun gaming full of laughs.+ The crossover between Nordic mythology and fencing is so miss matched it adds to the games charm. - Has to be one of the most repetitive games I've played with no variation in gameplay whatsoever.- There is such little content even for the select game types with only 4 environments available.- For the price of this game, you'd expect much more from it and not just a glamorised minigame.- The single player mode is tiring to work through whilst multiplayer options are just as limiting due to content.

												Nidhogg is great, but I cannot recommend it because of it's price. What is there is very cool, but there is only 4 stages, 4 songs, and one cpu opponent that varies difficulty as you progress through the games dozen or so single player matches. The online multiplayer doesn't work well and there is very little beyond what you see in the trailer. None of it is really bad but for 14.99 USD, it certainly is not worth the price. Pick this up for less than 2.50, and you shouldn't regret it.			"

												I do fencing as an amateur and I have to say, technique and physical ability aside, Nidhogg captures brilliantly everything that represents the real spirit of fencing: the unnerving waits to lure your adversary into attacking you, the sudden resolutions, the continuous pushing back and forth, the quick clashes that make you go ""WTF JUST HAPPENED?"", the giant worm that eats the winner at the end.Main flaw, the game boasts ""full controller support"" but that's full only in a world where XBox controllers are the only controllers (hint: we're not in such a world). So to actually achieve that ""full controller support"" just download a software like JoyToKey. Other than that, it's kinda repetitive contentwise, I haven't seen matches in online multiplayer, and if you play too much local multiplayer you're going to lose friends fast. It's as ragequit inducing as they come when you lose many times in a row. Maybe not worth its full price, but while it's on sale, the genius minimalistic design and gameplay make it definitely a little gem.			"

												Fun game, but absolutely infuriating. The gameplay is innovative and complicated, but it basically goes to waste because of the glaring flaws in its mechanics. It is far too easy to simply run past your opponent and prevent them from attacking you. All you have to do is evade their attacks when the arrow is on you and you can skip right to the end. You can also cheap-shot them if their sword isn't in the right place, making it even harder for a defender to turn the tide. It's advertised as a fencing game but it's really about trolling. If you want to get good at this strategy and use it to ♥♥♥♥ off everyone you play against, absolutely, buy this game. Otherwise, skip, it's not worth the price tag, especially considering how short it is.			"

												Nidhogg is solid but extremely simple - it's a nice diversion but it can't hold your attention for very long. The mechanics are cute but they get old really fast. I played the game quite a few times on Xbox, mostly local multiplayer with friends, and it was good for a few laughs, but we'd turn to something else after twenty minutes, tops. This Steam version plays the same for better or worse, but it also adds on *extremely* poor netcode. I was really shocked by how poorly the game runs online...a friend and I labored through fifteen minutes of stuttering, jerky matches that made it practically impossible to land an accurate hit or jump over a chasm. I'm struggling to understand why such a seemingly simple game would have such bad networking. There's a single player mode where you fight against a series of AI opponents, but it gets boring pretty quickly. I think that this is really a game that is meant to be played against other people...however, you won't be able to do so online.On top of these issues, this is a simple little multiplayer game that can't really be played online, so you would think the price should reflect that. Nope...it's 15 dollars or 16.99 CAD. You can read up on the game and watch some clips to decide if it is worth that price to you, but I definitely don't think it is. I actually got the game in a Humble Bundle pack so I didn't pay too much for it, but for everyone else, I'd say that this game isn't anywhere near worth a 15 dollar investment. If you're really interested in it, you should wait for a sale...but even then, remember that online play is functionally broken and the game probably won't be enough to hold your long-term interest.

												Sack of stool Dev won't fix the awful multiplayer issues, makes the game completely unplayable online. If you want to play this game solo or have a friend to play it on the same screen, you might have fun for an hour, but after that its an unfinished game based around simple mechanics. Delinquent developer should take some notes on how to be a good human, instead of hoodwinking people time and again based on the hype train surrounding this game.			"

												If you're looking for a great local competitive game to jazz up any gaming party--this nice title will contend for everyone's time.

 A Nidhogg is a mythical creature in Norse mythology which is a giant, man-eating serpent. In this game two fencers battle it out for the glory of being eaten by the Nidhogg in the ultimate sacrifice to the gods, or something like that. GAMEPLAY I have to admit when i first started playing I had no idea what the heck was going on. Bashing random keys hoping something would happen, but the AI continued to outsmart me; Keyboard is not recommended. When I used my controller (steam controller works great! xbox too) the controls seemed much easier to get the hang of but it is still complex enough to keep me interested. You can choose a high, centered or lower stance to stab your opponent.Just aim above or below your opponent  right?  wrong.Besides stances there are a ton of strategies for you to employ: running, rolling, jumping, jump kicking, sword throwing.If you're feeling really daring there's even a way to disarm your opponent, but beware you can still get knocked out and strangled to death (seriously) and lose the arrow.The arrow is something that's been there in loads of games, but it works pretty well in this game. At the start there is no arrow until one of the fencers kills the other. Then the power of the arrow is all yours and you don't have to actually kill your opponent. Then run for your life! the Nidhogg awaits! SOUND Meh. The soundtrack is more or less what you'd expect, I like it :PThe sword swings and the death screams are what you're hearing most of the time, and they are fantastic. Not to the point where they are haunting, but they aren't silly either. And the sweet sound of the crowds after you have bested your opponent is one of the best feelings in this game. GRAPHICS Well lets be honest here, if you've already looked at the game its clear that graphics are not the main focus. You could probably redraw this game in MS Paint. But hey, its an art choice, right?The effect of the pixel art is kind of nice and makes the game feel a bit unique (to me at least, if you play a lot of pixel art games then maybe not) and as you spill your opponent's blood, or they yours, you notice the area becoming absolutely soaked in blood, which is also the same colour as its respective carrier before it was splattered everywhere making it easy to see who the real lamb to the slaughter is. CONCLUSION It's a complete package, no DLC adds a few points in my book, death screams and for added fun, you can always roleplay as the fencer (en garde!) with a friend if that's your thing. Challenging single player modes, and multiplayer is double the fun. 7/10. Very replayable and keeps me coming back too.Get this game if you like stabbing people, annoying your friends, or if you want to play it with me because I love this game for all the right reasons.

												I picked it up for a dollar thanks to humble bundle. Definitely not worth buying for full price.Far too short with only four levels that can be completed in a couple minutes each. The singleplayer mode just recycles the same old levels over and over.Mechanics are fun and original, but they are not enough to give much replay value.Multiplayer and singleplayer are essentially the same mode, as the only difference is that a player controls the enemy instead of AI.Later levels of singleplayer decide to make the game harder by having the enemy change colour rapidly so as to induce a seizure.Highly overrated game. You might as well go play a flash game for free in your browser.I'd recommend Abyss Odyssey for a better side scrolling action game. "

												If you are going to play this game by yourself, skip it. If you are looking for a great game to play with a group of friends, get this immediately. The controls are simple, the gameplay is fast and intense, the graphics style and the music fit the game perfectly, and it's just a whole lot of fun. I've read that the online doesn't work very well and that the controller support is somewhat limited, so just make sure you have a couple xbox controllers on hand.			"

												Nidhogg is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. It's complex and simple all at the same time. Once you've killed your opponent, they will respawn again in a couple seconds, and the goal is to proceed to the next screen until you reach the end of the level. After reaching the end of the level, you will defeat your opponent and move on to the next where you will fight a differently colored progressively more skilled opponent. I believe the price is a bit high simply because more people would get to enjoy the game if it were cheaper, but it is infact worth the full 15$ price tag.			"

												Nidhogg is a small game developed by an indie developer Messhof. While the game isn’t the longest one I have ever played, it is definitely THE best local multiplayer game I have played in a long time. You can literally spend countless hours playing the local multiplayer against your friends.In Nidhogg there is only one objective , kill your opponent by out-stabbing them by using only three sets of stances, high, middle and low. Maneuvers such as, rolling, dive-kicking, neck-snapping and sword-throwing are also at your disposal. While it may sound simple at first, the game is really hard to master, and sometimes it gets a little bit frustrating when you get stabbed couple times in a row.After you kill your enemy you have to run to the right in order to advance to next level, the enemy can do the same thing, if you get killed, he can run to the opposite direction, this will get you back to the previous screen, and this gets really annoying because sometimes the enemy instead of fighting you, will just run past you just to get you back to the previous screen. Each ‘level’ is divided into couple smaller ones. In single player, there is a total of 17 AI opponents, the first one being the easiest and the last one, the toughest(I don’t know if that’s true but when I’ve played it, the game got harder every time with each AI opponent). At the end of each level your character is eaten by a giant dragon-like creature, by the name of Nidhogg, you can’t avoid it though(trust me, I’ve tried), I don’t know what’s the point of that but It’s kind of hilarious and random.The art style is what I love the most about this game, it has that surreal look to it, kind of like Hotline Miami. The player animations are also worth mentioning because of how smooth and realistic they are, and also it feels really satisfying when you stab someone.On the other hand, the game also has some flaws, one of them is the online multiplayer, it is seriously lacking in features and is very unstable, I kept being disconnected from matches, and I have experienced serious lag during several online matches. You can’t even properly communicate with your opponent because the chat can’t handle longer messages.As I have said before, the single-player consists of 17 AI opponents, which is great but the same can’t be said about the level variety, there is only 3 or 4 different levels which are re-used during the 17 battles in the single-player. I really wish that there was more variety in level design, maybe we’ll get them in later updates.Nonetheless, If you enjoy playing games with your friends then this game is for you but If you don’t like the local multiplayer I would still recommend sure the game isn’t very long, but the multiplayer is still there, it might be a bit lackluster but who knows maybe the devs will add some new features to the online multiplayer.

												I'm definitely recommending that you play Nidhogg. The controls and mechanics are simple enough for you to learn them quickly, but they also have enough depth for complex, skill-based play. At first, fighting doesn't appear complicated, but there is a lot going on. Positioning is crucial; standing above your opponent or blocking a doorway can make all the diffence. You also have a few different ways to approach fighting. Fencing is an option, but you could also try tossing your sword and rushing ahead for some melee attacks. One of my favorite tricks is ""playing chicken""; I throw my sword and charge ahead, and right before my opponent attacks, I roll past them and just keep on going. Local versus is one of the most intense multiplayer experiences I've had in a long time. The visuals ooze retro style, and I absolutely adore the soundtrack.As much as I love the gameplay, I can't necessarily recommend that you buy Nidhogg, at least for $15. You don't get a ton of content for your money. Apart from multiplayer, all you get is a single-player mode that is just a series of AI matches. The AI makes it clear that Nidhogg is a multiplayer game at heart, as it lacks the complexity of a human player. Playing with friends is great because of the atmosphere, the intensity, and the psychology. Messing with your opponent's head is just as important as the onscreen action, and when playing against the AI, you lose that crucial component.If Nidhogg were around $7.50, I would have no reservations about recommending it. I'm still setting my review to ""recommended"" because the game itself is so fun, but you might want to wait for a sale.			"

												I think Nidhogg is an extremely fun game. It's combat is suprisingly deep for what it is and plays out gracefully against friends or against AI. The stages are also well designed and beautiful without a hypnotic soundtrack. However, despite being a pixel art game, Nidhogg is about as demanding as full HD 2D games such as Battleblock Theater. This wouldn't really be that big of issue, except for the fact that the game's logic is written in reference to frames instead of milliseconds meaning that if the framerate goes below 60 then the game will actually slow down which can be quite jarring. On the whole though, Nidhogg is a simple fighting game great for playing multiplayer or single player and I would reccomend it to anyone as soon as it goes on sale. That being said, if you have a lower-end PC be aware of the above issues.			"

												Nidhogg is a side-scrolling, “holy-♥♥♥♥-what-the-hell-is-going-on,” mixed with “I-don’t-know-why-I-can’t-stop-laughing.” It is played in a tug-of-war style fashion where the objective is to reach the end of the stage before your opponent reaches theirs by playing a friendly game of…fencing? The mechanics are simple to learn and run with, but definitely take at least moderate skill to master. From fencing, to CQC, you’ll find that there’s quite a few ways to maim your foes and book it to the end stage (have you stuck someone on your sword and moved it around yet? Brutal!). A game like this could be daunting had it been slow – the speed and fluid motions of the gameplay really shine in this high speed fencing brawl. A game like this reminds me of a single-player buy that you kill about an hour or two on and then never touch it again (unless you achievement hunt). The multiplayer adds so much more to the game, including at least several more hours you can kill in multiplayer. I’m not sure I’m 100% sold on a $15 dollar tag for the game. Granted it IS fun, and there IS a chance that I could play this for longer than I’m advertising, but I honestly can see this game sitting idly by once the novelty wears off. The part that sucks is close range strafing with your opponent. Too soft and you don’t do what you were hoping to do. Too hard and you just ran yourself right onto your opponents sword.Beautiful pixel graphics, interesting mechanics, and a unique game overall with brilliant music, I definitely recommend this game to those interested in taking a chance on something fresh and original. If you're worried about the price, catch it on sale. Between $4.99-7.99 is a must buy, $7.99-9.99 is what I would have expected.			"

												One of the most entertaining fighting games and IT'S NOT EVEN A FIGHTING GAME! It does however have everything you'd find in a typical 2D tournament fighter: mind games between players, footsies, yomi, cross-ups, ect. This game is best enjoyed between 2 people so spending the money for the double pace is well worth the extra coin. The icing on the cake is that it only takes about 7 seconds to download and 1 or 2 minutes to install minor updates! Seriously, this could have existed 30 years ago on the Atari 2600 (Okay, maybe not, but if you see the style of the graphics then you'll understand why). If your either casual player,  an indie fan, or fighting game veterian straight out of the arcades, than Nidhogg is the game for you.			"

Although, prepare yourself for terrible desync issues that ruin the fun from time to time ( online multiplayer ).I wish this game got updated, or actually fixed. As well as the price being lowered a tad bit. Because there's nothing else but 4 small levels to play through by yourself, or up against your friends.No story, nothing but an arcade-like ladder solo expereince and multiplayer. So, 15 bucks? A little too much-Otherwise, it's a really fun experience.			"

I bought it on deep sale. Not too much re-playability, just something to have some fun with sometimes. The singleplayer is good, but I'd recommend gettings some friends up with it. Local co-op is fine if that's an option. Only uses 6 buttons. Music is fantastic, and the tension is tactile. It's very well balanced and there's no leveling or any sort of nonsense.

												Compared to the usual  ""cover"" based run and gun games on steam, this is an unusual gem. Nidhogg is for people who are sick of all the usual games on steam nowadays. With a brutally excalating learning curve, luck is only half a factor in Nidhogg. ""I want it, but for 15 bucks! I'll pass."" STOP RIGHT THERE MISTER. This game makes such a good mix of brutallity and ""Oh my god, how did I do that?"" feeling. So, Cost: 15$ Worth: 20$. Sure, you'll fail horribly, but lucky for you, there are no lives or time limits. Which makes this my favorite indie game so far.			"

												Before now, games that duplicate the twitchy tactical joy of fencing have been nonexistant. They still stubbornly refuse to exist, but Nidhogg does a fantastic job of hinting at the complexity while totally failing to be a realistic fencing game. Lunging, disarming, punching, sweeping the leg, divekicking, and throwing the damn sword at your opponent are the only options you have but they make for a deep and textured fight. There is always a different technique to master and there are players out there that will take the fight in directions you never suspected in single player. The pace is fast but the response is so tight you never feel out of control. I love fighting protracted battles back and forth over a stage and then realizing the level is soaked in your and your opponent's blood. I love blitter feedback, the whole game looks like an Amiga demo.			"

												THE NIDHOGG MUST FEED. A SNACKRIFICE AWAITS.The question is, will it be you, or the other guy?Nidhogg is ostensibly a fencing game. But this appraisal is kind of misleading; it's definitely a game that features fencing, and the fencing is both simple and intense in the way many early-era 2 player games were (like Swashbuckler and Championship Karate). But there are a number of things going on here that you wouldn't see anybody getting away with in a proper fencing match, and that's where things start getting interesting. Throwing swords, sweeping the leg, and jump kicking the other dude in the chest are among the other tricks the Yellow Swoardsman and Orange Swordsman have at their disposal.But wait; the match isn't won when your enemy's body is at your feet. Victory is only achieved by reaching the end of the level, far past your nemesis' starting position. And you'll find several more of him waiting where the first one came from.So it's like fencing, even when it contains things other than fencing. Nidhogg is a must-play for anyone with a friend to play with, or hell, train your cat extremely well and play it with him.			"

Fast-paced, addictive gameplay that's great to play with friends, especially in the Offline Versus mode (I'm pretty sure this is the preferred mode for most players).My only gripe with this game is the cost. As great as this game is, it shouldn't be retailing for more than £5, considering the potential AAA titles you can pick up for the £12 price tag. It simply doesn't have the content depth to justify it. Also, if you're going to offer buy two copies and give one to a friend, it should at least be 50% off the second copy, not a £2 saving. My advice: Chip in with some friends and buy this for some pick up and play tournament action.			"

												One of the most entertaining fighting games and IT'S NOT EVEN A FIGHTING GAME! It does however have everything you'd find in a typical 2D tournament fighter: mind games between players, footsies, yomi, cross-ups, ect. This game is best enjoyed between 2 people so spending the money for the double pace is well worth the extra coin. The icing on the cake is that it only takes about 7 seconds to download and 1 or 2 minutes to install minor updates! Seriously, this could have existed 30 years ago on the Atari 2600 (Okay, maybe not, but if you see the style of the graphics then you'll understand why). If your either casual player,  an indie fan, or fighting game veterian straight out of the arcades, than Nidhogg is the game for you.			"

												8/10Thanks Gaben for making the summer sale and I managed to buy this game on discount at an EXTREMELY low price ($2.99). This game is generally fun and you can play with your friends in a party, or whatever. I would recommend you to use a controller and play it on bigscreen as it is generally more fun and easier to control.The goal of this game, is to reach the goal sides set on teh side of both sides. You can repeatedly kill each other, until one reaches the end. (And you get a dragon to eat you for winning)There is a range of levels where you can entertain yourself and your friends with and have a good laugh. If you don't have friends or if they are too busy doing something else, you can play against the bot (singleplayer). The bot was also decent to play against. It wasn't too hard and it wasn't too easy. The online mode is messed up.Each map was fun to play with unique features. For example the map Mine, had transportation belts which either brings the player forward to allow him to reach the goal side quicker or push him/her back and make the progress slower. And the map Wild, had tall grass for the players to hide in. The graphics is good for a game like this. I'd prefer it to be pixelated and it gives it an arcade feel. The truth is, it doesn't need detailed graphics. For player movement, it was great. You can stab your opponent, throw swords, roll underneath players, disarm players from their swords and if you got disarmed yourself, you can punch the other player to death. If you fell down a pit and managed to grab a wall, keep on wall-kicking and get yourself out.And lastly, it gives a player tutorial which helps you learn about the controls, how to stab, throw, disarm, etc. Overall, this game is great and if you want a good laugh and have an enjoyable time by yourself or with your frieds, I'd definitely get it as it is on discount. Get 1 copy for your friends too!			"

												Absolutly amazing game! It is super fun to play. The only problem I have with it is that I don't think it should be $15. Maybe like $7 or something. The multiplayer needs to be fixed, because when I play with a friend, my side lags. If I jump on a ledge, I cant get off. It sends me back every 2 seconds. If you are looking to buy it, go ahead. But this is just something they HAVE to fix.			"

												As a single player game Nidhogg is just a bit of casual fun, but nothing special really.  In multiplayer however (especially sat side by side with your friends using the same computer) this game is amazing.  The fast paced action means no two people will be playing for too long whilst everyone else has to wait their turn, and as such the game remains entertaining as a multiplayer spectacle.  I don't think the game is perhaps worth the full retail price as it's only truly worth playing in multipayer mode, however on sale (and if you're planning on having a computer games party with your friends) then this is a definate purchase.

												A tight, simple, multiplayer FENCING game. Only 2 buttons and your movement keys are needed, or joystick if you're using a controller. Definetely a game better with an X-Box or Logitech controller. A few gripes, there are this strange black bars along the sides of the screen, which you can never rid. Also, very little customization options, no windowed mode, pretty sure you can't change the controls as well, although they're so tight there's really no need. All in all, pretty good find, the price though is a little steep at $17, but if given an update, adding features would make it more bearable. 8.5/10			"

												8/10 in a very strict rating system. Replay value, somewhat lacking. If you look through the reviews, there's ONE person with 15 hours and his entire review of it was 'very good'. This is taking fencing to a whole new level with the inclusion of fisticuffs, parkour, and neck-snapping. It can be infuriating if you've got a very short temper. But I've got a slightly less than normal temper and I really enjoy this way more than hate it. You should definitely buy it. Especially if you're thinking about torrenting it. I've tried it, and every torrent I see is a virus. Just buy it :P			"

												I spent the entire weekend playing this at the 2014 Global Games Jam. A great game with a retro arcade feel yet all the fluidity of modern controls. Fast-paced, addictive gameplay that's great to play with friends, especially in the Offline Versus mode (I'm pretty sure this is the preferred mode for most players).My only gripe with this game is the cost. As great as this game is, it shouldn't be retailing for more than £5, considering the potential AAA titles you can pick up for the £12 price tag. It simply doesn't have the content depth to justify it. Also, if you're going to offer buy two copies and give one to a friend, it should at least be 50% off the second copy, not a £2 saving. My advice: Chip in with some friends and buy this for some pick up and play tournament action.			"

												Nidhogg is a very simple game that is hard to be extremely good at. There's a limited amount of things you can do and it's kind of beautiful how there are counters and weaknesses to everything you do. You can only do 4 actions, really. Attack, roll, throw sword or divekick. The most advanced move is you can press up and down to change the level of your fencing sword. And if you change the level of your sword into the level of your opponent's fencing sword, it disarms them. Maybe being the buttonmasher is an advantage? I haven't quite figured it out, but this is a game to play against any friend.This is a 1v1 combat game. If you kill your opponent, you are allowed to move forward to pan the screen in your direciton. You must run your designated direction for a few rooms to 'win the match' and choose another level. When you kill your opponent they'll repeatedly spawn in front of you. A stalward guardian of your path to your victory. Defeat them over and over the become the champion.			"

												Overall, it's a fantastic little Local-Mutliplayer game to play with some good friends. With low system requirements, you can bring it to a friend's house on older laptop for portable fun. However, $15USD is pretty steep for the amount of content in the game, but it's a steal at around $5USD on sale (what I paid for it). Pros: - Hours of fun with friends.- Low system requirements. The pixel art style gets the job done.- 10+ gameplay settings to mix-and-match to create interesting matches.Cons: - Price. - Only 4 maps, but would be more acceptible if the price was lower (around $5USD).- I needed to use JoyToKey for my older controllers, despite it claiming to support DirectInput.- The Pause key (Esc) can't be rebound in the game.

												Before now, games that duplicate the twitchy tactical joy of fencing have been nonexistant. They still stubbornly refuse to exist, but Nidhogg does a fantastic job of hinting at the complexity while totally failing to be a realistic fencing game. Lunging, disarming, punching, sweeping the leg, divekicking, and throwing the damn sword at your opponent are the only options you have but they make for a deep and textured fight. There is always a different technique to master and there are players out there that will take the fight in directions you never suspected in single player. The pace is fast but the response is so tight you never feel out of control. I love fighting protracted battles back and forth over a stage and then realizing the level is soaked in your and your opponent's blood. I love blitter feedback, the whole game looks like an Amiga demo.			"

												As of 1/26/14:I can't recommend this game, especially at 15 bucks at this moment for the following:-Limited maps: only 4 maps currently. Which one (Clouds) contains very strong strobing colors that sometimes make it hard to see if your enemy is armed or sometimes where you or your enemy is. This is not helped by sections of the map having a bridge that decays in less then 3 seconds when you stand on it, (which no other map currently has).-Busted online: some weird errors with inputs will occur where they don't read and net code will have you repeatedly teleport around, sometimes to your repeated death. Or it will TAKE BACK A KILL on your screen, for an example of a similar occurance look up ""GGPO rollback"".-Weird Frame bugs: currently people who can play some of the the highest ends games at a solid 60fps can barely get this to run at 30. I was able to play it at a smooth frame rate in the high 50s to a solid 60 yesterday and earlier today couldn't make it past 15 fps-Limited single player: a simple gaunlet mode that really only factors in time. Also a tutorial and that's it.-No visual customization options: in single and mutliplayer modes you see a range of colors if you have more then 2 players, but you can not select them! if you or another player are not assigned the color, you can't be that color.-No way to mod it at this moment: Can't make maps, modify existing maps, add weapons or anything. I'd think personally that a two person team of creative people would open it up to the public.There are some great variant options for multiplayer:- Boomerang sword, which is a fun way to tag the other player who might have rolled behind you- Spine sword: Kill a person with your barehands and you'll get a sword.- Low Gravity: If you like high jumps and/or more controls on your jumps.- Turbo mode: for those who think the game is a bit too slow, this cranks it up to what it would be like to have Quicksliver fight the Flash.-Ability to turn off throwing/swords: Make it harder for your enemy to fall back on old favorites. The latter is great if you mix it with spine swords.I felt like 15 bucks was too much simply because, I've gotten better games from steam or other online services from indie devs or smaller devs, then the activisions of the world, brand new for around the same price. Not only were they filled with more content for a person who wishes to play single player only. They had better online as well. I didn't expect that much from Nidhogg, but I expected more than I got especially with how busted the online is at points(I couldn't seem to do the basic function of throwing my sword, and before you say anything the other guys threw theirs). Which yes, while it's a 2 person team, it was a project that took them what? 4 years from concept to retail?Up to you if you want to spend the money, but I wouldnt recommend it.			"

												Too expensive, not enough levels, but addicting as frick! Nidhogg is a fast-paced tug-of-war style multiplayer that requires legit mlg pro fencing skills to win and I love it. I feel that the single player could have more variant modes, but I definitely recommend buying it for the local or online multiplayer when it comes on sale.			"

												A very fast paced, two player game (there is an AI, too, which comes in many and partly demanding difficulty, but you want to play this with another real player)The game is innovative, easy to understand, easy to learn and hard to master. It is very fun to play with friends, though it might destroy your friendship ;)One round lasts only a few minutes, except the players are on an very even level and no one is able to outplay his opponent. In that case, a game can last longer.There is also a multiplayer for random enemies, a tournament mode and some more, just discover it.I definetly recommend this game for a quick run in between.There is only one issue I need to critize:The game sometimes has to fight wich huge delays between clients, where you kill your opponent and suddenly fall down dead to ground and your opponent is alive again, because he killed you faster. But you can get over it, because the game is so quick, that the revenge is not far away.			"

Its singleplayer mode is practically impossible; the AI reacts to things and learns tactics far faster than normal humans. Essentially, great fun, but definitely overpriced.

												I spent the entire weekend playing this at the 2014 Global Games Jam. A great game with a retro arcade feel yet all the fluidity of modern controls. Fast-paced, addictive gameplay that's great to play with friends, especially in the Offline Versus mode (I'm pretty sure this is the preferred mode for most players).My only gripe with this game is the cost. As great as this game is, it shouldn't be retailing for more than £5, considering the potential AAA titles you can pick up for the £12 price tag. It simply doesn't have the content depth to justify it. Also, if you're going to offer buy two copies and give one to a friend, it should at least be 50% off the second copy, not a £2 saving. My advice: Chip in with some friends and buy this for some pick up and play tournament action.			"

												Amazing game.  It thrives on simple gameplay, and has some of the most crisp mechanics I've ever seen in an action-platformer.  This allows for a competitive experience purely based on skill; whether you win or lose, you feel as if you've earned the result.  The ""advancing-room-gameplay"" and evident verticality allows for on-your-heals strategizing, tense standoffs, and miraculous comebacks.  Keep in mind that this game is really meant for multiplayer.  Its mechanics are specific to the human element, and are best seen in player versus player combat.  This game is best played with a friend on local co-op, and should really only be bought for that purpose.  Online multiplayer is good, but does not contain the same enjoyment as facing down your oppenent eye-to-eye.  Online mode can lag as well, which can be frustrating in such a skill-based game.  Single player is nothing special, and should be seen as something to do when you don't have someone to play with.  It has a very arcadey feel and relatively challenging, but is not a time consumer, and furthermore, not is fun or rewarding when playing against another human.If you have a friend that is willing to play with you, you have to buy this game.  It is one of the greatest player versus player experiences on the PC.  If you are looking for a single player experience, you might want to stay away, as that is not what this game is meant for.  Although the base price of $15 ($12 now for sale) seems expensive for a low-budget indie game with only one game mode, it is suprisingly worth it.  You will have more fun playing this with a friend than in any other game I can think of.			"

												Nidhogg is a game that can bring u lots of fun as well as LAUGHS :PIt's a kind of relaxing game that u don't need to use ur brain too much to think abt it. Simple painting style and easy operation is the biggest characteristic of this game. It's a nice option for u if u wants to play this game on coach to relax urself and have some fun. There are four maps in this game and they are all excellent. The BGM in the cloud is awesome! But the color of the background in clouds always makes my eyes feel dizzy. Hope the producer will update more different scenes for the players to play. Unicorn worm is my favorite thing in this game, coz that means VICTORY.(Hit: It’s more fun with friends. If u don’t have friends play this game with u, do not buy it. Coz u will be so boring by your own!)So, if u has lots of friends, and u likes to spend ur time on the sofa, this game is totally worth for u. Btw: wait until a sale to buy it.

												Fast paced, ability based fighting game.Although at first glance it seems a bit limited, because of the small number of levels and simplicity of controls, the game is extremely flexible and allows for a wide range of playing styles and options. It also allows to modify gameplay options to make gameplay even more varied.It's best enjoyed by playing two players in the same screen, I have still to check the online mode.Personal Experience: I once played this with an entire group of actual fencers. Although it obviously lacks the depth of real fencing, we had a real good time and felt the combat was actually compelling and similar to fencing. Except the victory part, of course, they are still puzzled by it.			"

												I think Nidhogg is an extremely fun game. It's combat is suprisingly deep for what it is and plays out gracefully against friends or against AI. The stages are also well designed and beautiful without a hypnotic soundtrack. However, despite being a pixel art game, Nidhogg is about as demanding as full HD 2D games such as Battleblock Theater. This wouldn't really be that big of issue, except for the fact that the game's logic is written in reference to frames instead of milliseconds meaning that if the framerate goes below 60 then the game will actually slow down which can be quite jarring. On the whole though, Nidhogg is a simple fighting game great for playing multiplayer or single player and I would reccomend it to anyone as soon as it goes on sale. That being said, if you have a lower-end PC be aware of the above issues.			"

Do you like to get hit in the face with swords? Well you are going to get used to it. The other problem i have is the cloud level.

With a couple of friends on the couch, this turns into a hilarious game of wits and reflexes as you try to outmanuver and out-fence your opponents. Simple controls and gorgeous graphics combine with excellent music and sound design to present a simple, rewarding experience. While $15 is a bit steep considering how bare the content is (4 levels and a very barebones singleplayer), if you can pick this game up on sale it is well worth the money.

												The gameplay makes this game worth every penny. If you like fighting games and you have some friends who like fighting games, it's a great purchase. Better if they're local, until they fix the netcode. But it's great anyway! To be honest, there's not too much content. Single player is a simple series of fights across the 4 available stages. There's only one type of character. But if you like snappy, fluid gameplay with great tactical depth, you'll find that there's a lot to learn and love with Nidhogg.Also I love the soundtrack and how it reacts to the match. When there's a lull, it slows down and the drums fade away, only to start back up again at a player's untimely demise. Find me online (and hopefully the netcode gets fixed soon!).			"

												I first played Nidhogg after dinner at a friend's house. Things were looking boring so I whipped out my laptop that everyone could gather round to watch me play Freecell.Luckily, someone grabbed it from me and logged onto their Steam account to set up a tournament of this game.You each control a fencer and have to kill the other guy then run across their body to get to the next screen. Do this enough times and you win.You can throw your sword at your opponent's face, disarm them, and even roll like a ninja/bowling ball along the floor before sweeping out their legs and pulling the still-beating heart out of their body.It's great.And it has graphics like on an old-timey computer, but really slick animation, so the whole style is warm and milky all over your face. Haha! But seriously, the animation is great. I heard the guy spent four years on it. Or the game as a whole. I dunno. But it was four years well spent whatever.Oh, and what's the Nidhogg? You'll find out. Just whatever you do - and I can't stress this enough - don't get eaten by it!			"

												You may be looking at the game trailer for this game and wondering, ""15 dollars?""All you see in that trailer is swordfighting, fly kicking, neck breaking, gorgeous pixellated art style, great music.But does that really justify 15 dollars?!Short answer: No. They better drop that price someday.Long answer: It's worth 10 dollars at least though. Because this game is FUN AS HELL. Not since the arcade days of Joust, have I had such a good time playing a 1 vs 1 game like this.The BEST thing about this game is the accessibility of it. The controls are literally your W,A,S,D directionals, and two keys for jumping, then attacking. There's a tiny bit more technique to it as well, but I am able to fire this game up and play it with just about any family member in minutes. It's also neat because either two people can play on one keyboard, or if you smell bad and don't want to be that close to someone, they can use a 360 controller while you rock the keyboard.This game evokes laughter, screams of defeat and terror. It's seriously THAT fun. Nidhogg is an excellent game with a price tag that is a bit too steep to buy it at full price.What's worse is the fact that it's online multiplayer is still broken. I have owned this game for quite some time now and to this day, cannot start an online match.But that's really my only gripe with the game. So get it! If it's on sale.			"

												Nidhogg is a great game where two players engage in a fencing duel of throwing, kicking, and stabing. This game can easy for two players to play on one computer (for instance one player using w,a,s,d and another up, down, left, right). You can set up tournaments where players can battle in a series of battles determining the best player. Nidhogg includes has a single-player mode. In singleplayer you fight different computers in hope of getting the fastest time. One great feature is variants where you can customize the gameplay for a new experience. Variants include time limit, low gravity, turbo mode, slow mode, boomerang swords, and more. I would highly recomend this game for any group of two or more people.			"

												Nidhogg is a pretty fun 2D fencing fighting game the over the top fighting that goes into each match is a very fun concept, however I don't believe it's worth 15.00 considering even though there is online multiplayer, there's barely any stages, not enough gimmicks, once you're done with the single player and play a few matches online you'll probably end up playing something else. If they added more stages, more fighting techniques, and just a little more here or there it'd definitely be worth the price tag. I recommend getting this at a discount.			"

I would also forward you to RISK OF RAIN as it's CO OP and only two thirds of the price with a much greater amount of content (great soundtrack too).			"

												It took me a while to understand this game. It seemed clunky, weird, too based on random chance and the luck of finding an opening as I charged blindly forward. I didn't get what I was doing wrong. Then, on my third run through the wilds level, my opponent and I both disarmed one another simultaneously. I didn't have a weapon, and neither did he. So I did what seemed sane: I tried to stab him anyways. And we started boxing. Then he punched me backwards into the crop fields, where I had seen my weapon land. Frantically, I searched the stalks of wheat, looking for the familiar silver glint of my weapon. Behind me, he leapt into the air, ready to land upon me where I lay and smash my face into the dirt that would be my unceremonius grave. And at the last possible moment, my hand met the cold steel of my blade, and I spun, holding my weapon high —He landed squarely on the tip of sword, violently impaled by his own momentum. And in that moment, I understood. This game was exactly as frantic, exactly as crazy and snap-reflex-based as a real fencing match, between real swordsmen. The controls might not have the finesse of an actual human arm holding an epee, but the mechanics, the pacing; these are pitch-perfect, and evoke the same thrilling adrenaline rush that whipping an actual rapier around in a clumsy attempt at defense gave me in my teenage fencing lessons (my local community center offered some pretty rad summer programs). The key is to treat combat in Nidhogg with the same sort of gravity you would in real life. Take small, inching steps toward your enemy. Change stances freely, and attack opportunistically, when given a wide opening. And only throw your sword at the oppenent when it's the only move you've got left.It's possible to beat Nidhogg without really knowing how to play it. The game is pretty forgiving, and you have an unlimited number of attempts for each stage, meaning you can essentially grind your way towards victory if you're really determined. But it's immensely satisfying to clear a level without losing a life by trouncing the bevy of foes that stand in your way one-by-one. So practice up, and prove you've got what it takes to be a winner.			"

												Do not buy this game for online play. You will be disappointed.I love looking for new games to play with friends, and I was ecstatic to see this finally released. The gameplay is fantastically unique: You fight past your opponent to run to their 'endzone.' Killing them is not always necessary; you can just run past them, but it'll usually get you killed. After all, combat is what the game was made for.When fencing, there are three different stances you can take (low, mid, high), which can be used for parrying, or, if swift enough, disarming. But if you get disarmed, you can still roll under your opponent, kick them off their feet, snap their neck, and take their sword. But then they respawn at the other end again! So here's where you just chuck your sword into their head and pick it up again as you run past.This is one of very few games where I have wanted to practice different techniques, guards, and attacks. The depth of gameplay is great (Even if there are only four stages), and the idea is unique. The one downside is the online play, which, more often than not, gives players too much lag to even be playable.I wouldn't recommend this if you don't have friends to play with locally, but if you do, enjoy!

												This is a great way to lose friends. This game will have you screaming, possibly raging, and perhaps confused. That being said, it is a great game to play with friends. It is enjoyable, although frustrating as well. It is challenging, but that is a good aspect of competitve games. I bought the game when it was on sale and bought a few extra copies to share with friends. I am certain I would not pay full price for this game. Playing online runs pretty smoothly, sometimes there is a bit of lag, but nothing that changes the game's odds. I have played with another person using a single computer and it was very reponsive, and a great time. I personally think for your own sanity it may be better to have people at separate computers. TLDR: Good, challenging game that is fun with friends. Wait till it goes on sale, buy a few copies for friends to play too,			"

I must say i think they did hell of a good job on the game controls and how they made it llike a old school game. AKa  my first 2 games i played was the first doom and James Bond games. It sure made me feel great when i logged on this game. Don't let the looks of this game fool you....its a hard.....you need to out think you enemy in a sword fight.  What makes this game really cool if you play pirates of the caribbean theme song in the background...then its amazing....I will give it 10/10 and a Hell Yea Badge to it....I must say this game is awesome and I think this is a great buy.

												This is an amazingly addictive and fun platforming game. It mixes swordplay and smooth platforming to make an awesome game. The fact that it supports local and global multiplayer only adds to the ridiculousness you can have. The a.i is a bit derpy at first but their intelligence increases as you progress further through the storyline. The areas which you explore are all interesting and keep you on your toes with the natural hazards. Even the most boring one, The Castle, was very fun to run about in.			"

												This game is really fun. I haven't played with it locally with friends yet, but i laugh and yell at the screen when playing it by myself, so i'm sure it will be a fantastic game to play with a bunch of friends at your house. The tournament mode will add a lot of fun to the local experience too. The only downfall to this game i see so far is the lack of an online community. I know it just came out on steam but whenever i search for an online match it says only 3 or 4 people are online. I find this disturbing since this game is fun as hell. Hopefully it will pick up.

												Atari-tier murder fencing, I approve!  In addition, the focus on positioning as a means to fulfill your victory condition is an interesting choice for a game's standard mode of play.  While this is a game containing combat, it is moreso a game of competitive movement management.  While it has some problems, mostly collision properties on the win screen, none of them seem to interfere with the core gameplay.  I am of the opinion that Nidhogg is a simple but elegantly designed piece.			"

												First off, I do not recommend you buy this game, but the game itself is mostly not at fault. And really, it breaks my heart to have to tell people, ""No, you're better off not buying this game"" because it has some great features.The game follows the simplistic pixel-art that quite some indie games have. Nevertheless it works and makes everything easy to overlook. The mechanics are simple. Using up and down, jump, roll and attack you fight another person who is equipped similarly. The music is amazing and strangely befitting, too. So, what makes me not recommend this game?Limited content. There are only a few maps, and while that's not all that bad this is a game that ought to draw most of its entertainment from online play. Fighting friends and strangers worldwide in a dark cave or an overgrown meadow. But no. Several months after release the practically broken netplay has not been fixed, and the lack of the developer communicating shows us there will be no fix soon, if ever.It truly is a shame to see such a great, simple, addictive game go to waste by lack of action to fix something so trivial...

												Nidhogg will be some of the best fun you'll ever have in local multiplayer. Controls are easy enough that anyone can pick it up and play it well after a few minutes of either seeing someone else play, or doing so themselves.Nidhogg, much like Divekick, manages to deliver an extremely rich and gripping experience within a limited framework of mechanics and makes for an excellent spectator sport. If you can get the controllers and people to play with, Nidhogg is a must buy.Also bunnyhops. And worms. Those are fun too.			"

												I haven't had that much time to play it yet, but to be honest, it's not like you need to log 1200 hours into this game to know what you're getting. So, what are you getting with Nidhogg? You're getting a game that, at it's core, is simple, but provides copious amounts of fun. It's not an epic, open-world adventure. It's simply a side-scrolling game of tug-of-war with old-school inspiration and it delivers. I would recommend this game to anyone that considers it.			"

												Before you start playing this game, don't be confused, LOCAL multiplayer is really it's strong suit. Now I don't have many hours played on my account, but I've played this game plenty on a friend's, and it really is an excellent game. It's definitely a game of skill. No outside forces are going to impact whether or not you come out the victor, it's simply you against your opponent, and occasionally taking advantage of your surroundings. The swordplay is easy to get used to but hard to master, and when you snap the neck of an enemy that's on the ground, it's amazingly satisfying. The visuals are a retro style done right, and the music and sound effects make the game come alive. One of the best local multiplayer experiences I've ever had. However, connections with online multiplayer seem to be giving other people problems. (I don't have experience with this myself, as I've only played it locally) so if this is a turn-off for you, keep that in mind. If the local multiplayer experience is enough to warrant the $15 for you, go for it. If not, get the game on sale. One way or another, Don't pass up on this game.			"

												Between the parrying, disarming, dodging, rolling, wall-jumping, punching, sweep-kicking, throwing your sword in rage to kill a fleeing adversary, having the satisfaction of idly jiggling your sword into your impaled foe's innards, and ultimately coming down to fisticuffs until you tear out your opponent's heart (or, as so often happens, they tear YOUR heart out), this game allows the players and spectators alike to enjoy the chaos of swordfighting in a 2-D world in good ol' fashioned, nitty-gritty one-on-one PvP, done arcade style and done right. Highly recommended for a game to settle a beef, make wagers, record the inevitable rage of at least one of the combatants, or just to pass the time with a gruesome yet addicting game of pixelated tug-of-war (just replacing the ropes with rapiers). 9.5/10 (because there is just a tad bit of lag occasionally online, but that's partly my weak internet connection).

												There's something to be said about a game that feels as balanced as Nidhogg does. Every offense has its countering defensive stance, every defense has an offensive move to get around it, and none of them require any more or less effort than the other, making it a simple game of preparation, reflexes, and psychology; the true essence of a fighting game.The graphics could be described as 'minimal', or it could be described as 'clear'. I choose to view it the latter way. All necessary information is communicated in an understandable fashion without sacrificing artistic integrity. Daedelus' soundtrack provides an excellent support to the atmosphere of the game and its individual levels, from the intense and aggressive Wilds, to the tense and deliberate Mines, and the quick and nimble Clouds.Nidhogg's design is flawless in nearly every aspect, the only regrets being the lack of content. But why should you care about that, when you can throw a sword at someone to force them to block high, roll underneath them while grabbing a sword, then stab them in the back in a series of grand maneuvers that will make you feel like a god among men?

Daedelus' soundtrack provides an excellent support to the atmosphere of the game and its individual levels, from the intense and aggressive Wilds, to the tense and deliberate Mines, and the quick and nimble Clouds.Nidhogg's design is flawless in nearly every aspect, the only regrets being the lack of content. But why should you care about that, when you can throw a sword at someone to force them to block high, roll underneath them while grabbing a sword, then stab them in the back in a series of grand maneuvers that will make you feel like a god among men?

												This game is a blast to play!  The singleplayer is fine, but the meat and potatoes of this game is when you're facing a human opponent either online or locally.  The online can use a bit of work because some matches can be pretty laggy.  However, when you do get in to a match and everything works, it really works.  Still, the netcode needs improvement and I hope the fixes for that come sooner rather than later.There's a lot of hidden depth to the gameplay as well.  You have to decide when it's right to let yourself die in order to respawn in front of your opponent before they make it to the next screen.  When is it the right time to make a break for it to get to the next screen?  When you decide to let yourself die in order to respawn as a barrier for your opponent, is there is even enough time for you to respawn in front of them?  Should I hold on to my sword, or should throw it and make a run for it hoping it distracts the opponent? These are some of the thoughts that will constantly be running through your head while playing this game and it's made all the more intense when facing off against a human opponent.I also really dig the old-school Atari 2600-esque look of the game.  The use of colours makes the levels look really nice and I just like the simplicity of it.  The super colourful neon blood is also prety great!The soundtrack to the game is also fantastic!  Each of the 4 levels in the game has a unique song that plays in the background and it makes the one on one battle so much more enjoyable.  I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a lot of local and online (when it's properly working 100% of the time) MP fun!			"

												Extremely Reminiscent of Prince of Persia (1989), this fast-paced sword-murder-themed side-scroller is exhilarating to play. It really comes into its own in local (“offline”) multiplayer; You will probably need a second keyboard or gamepad to facilitate this. Also note the only controllers supported fully are XBOX controllers.			"

												I strongly recommend this game. Even with the people complaining about lag in the forums, I played it with my friend and had no problems at all. And being a huge fencing fan, I think this game is perfect in the format it was made. You really need to approach the fight strategically or you'll get your derrière sistematically handed to you. The game is one hit kill when armed with sword and when disarmed if your opponent strikes you on the ground he'll snap your neck and kill you, but this is just a mean to an end, since your main goal ain't to kill your opponent but to get to the last screen you need to push to be devoured by the mythical serpent Nidhogg, hence the name of the game, and to do that you need to kill you enemy and  move forward through each screen, being lead to a fence-fueled tug of war. And the graphics, soundtrack and sound effects match the game perfectly and until now I didn't experienced any major flaws on the gameplay of the game which is fluid and easy to get the hang. The single-player can be fun enough, but the game really shines in the multiplayer, the local versus can make for a really neat party game. So scrap some cash and buy this gem.			"

												Wow, well that was short...I was under the impression this game would be a fun and frantic sword-em-up where I run through level upon level fighting similar sword wielding stick-men.Fun? Admittedly yes, and the combat system requires precision and timing. If you fail, it was your fault, but when you succeed, you know you earned it.Swords? Yea, there's a f*ck-ton. I gave it an extra point in the score just for this reasonLevel upon level? Here's where we nosedive... There are four... And they're not long. The 12 or 16 stages that make up the singleplayer shamelessly reuse the levels, making progress repetitive.I'd go on but I'm being given *the stare* for not ironing my shirt. So we'll leave it at this:With completion in just under 2hrs of total play time, and a default cost of £10.99! A worthwhile purchase this game is not. [4.0]			"

												A truly fun game with very smooth gameplay. There's not much singleplayer content other than fighting a line of swordmen with the difficulty increase per time you defeat the next in the row. The multiplayer seems to have a bit delay for now, other than that it's great fun killing your enemy. Your goal is to get to the right of the level and enter the next screen, while your enemy have to get to the left side of the screen. You are only able to move to the next scene when  you have the GO sign in the opposite corner of yourself, It's a tough process and can take a good amount of time if you're playing against a mighty fencer. There are various ways to kill and disarm your enemy or yourself :3You have 5 different ways to hold your sword, with different range depending on you're trying to target the enemies feet or head. The higher you aim, the longer range. The lower you aim, the shorter range. When holding the sword in the upper position, you'll be able to throw it (also when jumping in midair), hopefully killing your enemy or die trying... When you jump, you're able to strike downward, this is a great ability if you've lost your sword and still want to go offensive on your enemy. You can also roll and kick when approaching the player if his sword is in a high position, else you'll just die horribly by getting stacked in the chest or face. The sound effects makes it quite enjoyable to stick your sword through the chest of someone else and keeping it inside, making it ""bleed""  more and enemy scream even longer is just very satisfying.The different set of levels gives the player a good amount of space to use his different moves and feature lots of movement to make the scenes more alive, the game does have music but it's quite ambient and might not get noticed because of the  screams coming from either you or your enemy..:CONCLUSION:.It's really good fun and plays great, the price point might be a bit high but there's online multiplayer which makes the price acceptable in my opinion. There's not much content for the single-player type and the online multi-player can be slighty laggy at times but based on being very unique, play very smooth and the gameplay have great combat, I would very much recommend this game.

												This game is pure fun! It can't really be described, other than fast paced fencing-martial arts-divekicking-combat - oh yea, and you get eaten by a huge wyrm at the end of every level to top it all off. The combat system is unique, in that there is surprising depth for such a seemly short (and by short, I mean a ton of deaths every level. This game isn't exactly easy) single player game. Developing your own style really feels like you own it, and every time you die, you don't feel cheated. Multiplayer is where this game really shines, and it's really meant to be played against a human opponent, whether someone online or someone sitting beside you. The CPU opponents put up a great fight though, and it's perfect for developing your own style of play before you face off with a friend. The price is slightly high, for what this game is, but if you feel like it's something you might enjoy, I would say possibly wait for a sale if you are strapped for cash. That being said, I do not regret my purchase. To me personally, this game is worth it.			"

												Nidhogg is nice for the first few hours within which you'll probably repeatedly fight the singleplayer AI until you release it's occasionally either far too stupid or far too difficult (it can do things that you simply cannot), at which point you'll probably feel experienced enough to try the multiplayer.It's at this point that the game completely falls apart. The multiplayer is consistently laggy and it always seems to take at least a few minutes to get into a match - if finding a game wasn't arduous enough, attempting to transfer your SP tactics to MP is nigh impossible since you'll find the controls simply aren't responsive enough. Nidhogg absolutely requires you to have quick reactions and MP makes this impossible.The Tournament mode is useless without at least two other experienced players able to use your computer (since it's local MP) and if you were looking to practice against the AI then enjoy having to play through the entire game just to get to a point you feel is difficult enough because you can't skip levels.Oh, and the super bright cloud level is absolutely horrible to look at, I personally can barely see anything. I wonder how exactly the development time on this game was spent when there are such obvious flaws (why would you choose a bright background when the player is bright yellow and the sword is white?)I do honestly like the gameplay but I can't in all good conscience recommend this game to anyone looking for a competitive multiplayer experience. Some cool stuff can happen but on average, Nidhogg will leave you simultaneously annoyed but wanting to play more since it could get better.			"

												First impressions: Easy to get into, good tunes, fun to play with friends (local VS play). Played the waifu and also some dudes at work. There were some good laughs.Online play: There are some really good players out there. Good times. Played several people online who were complaining about experiencing a lot of lag. Seemed okay to me most of the time. Hopefully this gets fixed soon. EDIT: booted me out mid-game with some find of CTD error. Maybe that's what's been happening with some people I've been playing (they'll unexpectedly quit the game)I'd like to see more maps - 4 is kinda spare. They're decent, though.I think $12 is asking a lot for this game, but hey, stop eating at McD's a few times and pack a freaking salad and a sandwich and you just earned that $12 back. Oh, and make your own coffee for a week so you can buy another game.EDIT 2: It's $5 on the Steam summer sale. $5 is about right, but look at how many hours I've played - 4h or so. Maybe I'll get back into it if the online play was ever fixed or if there is a more open version where people can make their own maps. Lots of games out there that have compelling 1v1 action, and this one is okay.			"

												I highly reccommend Nidhogg. The single player modes is very short, but the combat is fun when you are challenged. I would suggest buying the two pack so you could play with someone who is similarly skilled. The game itself is about fencing, and the controles are fairly simple, so the game comes down to skill more often than memorization. 10/10			"

												It's a fighting game, but not really: there are no ""super"" moves, power bars, or frame timings; just run, jump, and stab. It's easy to pick up and play, and within a few minutes you'll feel like you're accomplishing the most amazing series of maneuvers. There's no need to log 300 hrs of practice to get ""good"" here.I love the simplicity of it: movement, 5 ""stances"" (overhead, high, mid, low, crouch), a jump button, and an action button. That's it. Using combinations of those controls, you have access to a surprising variety of moves that help you push past a constantly respawning opponent, only to celebrate your victory by jumping into Níðhöggr's waiting maw.The one downside, though, is the price. $15 is crazy. $10 would've been MUCH better. I hope they continue to develop levels/content for this to help justify the price.There's a damn good reason this won so many IGF awards, and I'm glad it finally made it to a full release version. Thanks to the option to hold tournaments of up to 8 players, I can see this being an awesome party game, but hopefully they can flesh out the online multiplayer, as well as add more content, to keep people playing even after the party's over.

												While it is an enjoyable game with an original playstyle and tight as ♥♥♥♥ controls, I cannot recommend it. The single player is boring with only 4 maps and little variation between opponents, with only a single gamemode. Multiplayer was good fun but the developers managed to ♥♥♥♥ it up somehow in the new update so playing with friends is virtually impossible.Asking £10.99 for this small game is an insult as it only provided some brief entertainment before I became bored and tired of the concept. I understand that this was a kickstarter project so I would rate this game 9/11, because it is suspicous and requires futher investigation.It looks like the devs pocketed all the money and then released small uninspired updates which add no actual content but instead break a fun little game. It's horrendously overpriced and has broken multiplayer.			"

												Oooh, this is a clever little game we have here that essentially covers a 9 stage long map focusing on fencing and running for your life. Nidhogg is a tug-of-war game that relies on basic movement and attack mechanics (literally, there are 6 controls) to simulate fast-paced fencing and brawling combat in a race to be devoured by the beast called, ""Nidhogg"". While the end result of winning is less than appealing the gameplay itself is very clever, as players are constantly able to change their way of playing to adapt to their opponent's play style, and the cute graphical style while sometimes can be an eyesore (prime example being the pre-game chat, it's basically impossible to tell the letters apart.), it usually has this sort of retro charm that makes you want to wash the floors with your opponents blood once more. So, do I reccomend this game? Yes. Will I continue to play it for years to come? Yes.-WolfEpiphany			"

												     The adrenaline will fly as you try to overtake your opponent in Nidhogg! The object of the game is to reach the other side of the map, to which there are seven sections; the only thing stopping you is your little set of legs and your adversary. There is a surprising amount of depth to this one on one side scroller, despite the only controls being jump, attack and the directions. You can hold your sword in three positions: high, medium, or low. Where you hold the sword dictates what attacks you will block.      All throughout you will have to make split-second decisions, and those decisions are what make the game so addicting. At times, you will be convinced that you have felled the enemy, only to be rolled into and killed. These are the defining moments of Nidhogg; while your jaw is on the floor from the surprise, your stinker of a roommate hoofs it to the goal.			"

												Nidhogg solely focus on a combat system, combining fencing and tug-of-war together to create a simple yet fun gameplay. There are a lot of options there to create a strategy. You can fight your opponent with rapier or goes unarmed, you can thrust, punch, parry, disarm opponent, throwing weapon, do a sweep attack, and even do a dive kick. Running away also a one good strategy here in Nidhogg for you to consider as the objective is to reach the goal not to defeat the opponent until he/she run out of life.Nidhogg's concept is good and the video that show is even help make it look very interesting.Anyway, one big flaw of Nighogg is a lacks of contents, especially in a lacks of solid single player content. The only thing you will find in a single player mode is a series of 16 AI opponents that not really different in terms of difficulty, pretty much the same. There are only 4 stages in the game as you can see in the video. No unloackable contents pretty much make this game suffer a scarceness of solid contents and no replay value.It is true that the core design of the game is quite interesting. I am able to enjoy a single player mode to some extent but that's that. Once I beat the single player mode I went to try multiplayer mode with someone, unfortunately online matchmaking show that no one playing Nidhogg online and none of my fried owned this game as well.I guess the game could deliver a better experience if you has a friend to play together offline or online but for a gamer who focus on single player experience I recommend you to avoid Nidhogg. Even with a 66% discount for this game is seem a little pricy to me after I bought it.			"

												Half a year on, and the developer doesn't seem to give a damn about supporting this lackluster game.The foundation of Nidhogg is solid. It's a fun little game, with a surprising amount of depth. But with only four levels, AI opponents that are easily circumvented, and an online multiplayer that is tricky to get to work... asking €13,99 for this is absolutely ludicrous. It's the kind of game that's A LOT of fun to play, for an hour. And then you're done with it. You leave it be, hoping that the developer will release some more content for it later on - free or paid. But no, nothing. Not even a tiny little patch with minor fixes.The game IS good, but the fun is extremely shortlived. ONLY BUY THIS GAME if you see it on sale, and only if it is heavily discounted. I'm talking a couple of Euros/Dollars here. THEN, it will be worth it. And only if you buy it with a friend, so you can play together.			"

												Nidhogg is nice for the first few hours within which you'll probably repeatedly fight the singleplayer AI until you release it's occasionally either far too stupid or far too difficult (it can do things that you simply cannot), at which point you'll probably feel experienced enough to try the multiplayer.It's at this point that the game completely falls apart. The multiplayer is consistently laggy and it always seems to take at least a few minutes to get into a match - if finding a game wasn't arduous enough, attempting to transfer your SP tactics to MP is nigh impossible since you'll find the controls simply aren't responsive enough. Nidhogg absolutely requires you to have quick reactions and MP makes this impossible.The Tournament mode is useless without at least two other experienced players able to use your computer (since it's local MP) and if you were looking to practice against the AI then enjoy having to play through the entire game just to get to a point you feel is difficult enough because you can't skip levels.Oh, and the super bright cloud level is absolutely horrible to look at, I personally can barely see anything. I wonder how exactly the development time on this game was spent when there are such obvious flaws (why would you choose a bright background when the player is bright yellow and the sword is white?)I do honestly like the gameplay but I can't in all good conscience recommend this game to anyone looking for a competitive multiplayer experience. Some cool stuff can happen but on average, Nidhogg will leave you simultaneously annoyed but wanting to play more since it could get better.			"

												A game where you stab your friends repeatedly. Cool mechanics, a lot of fun if you play with friends and really challenging if you play enough of it. From what I have experienced, the net code was a bit unstable and wasnt always the best, and the game feels a bit repetitive. Good game, but get quickly a bit boring if you dont play with friends or make it fun. Is it worth the prize? Depends on what your taste is, but I recomend getting it on a sale!7,2/10			"

												I learned about Nidhogg after I played a game based off of Nidhogg, back when Nidhogg wasn't even released yet. The game was called Eggnogg, and it was said to be the closest thing to what Nidhogg was probably going to be. At the time, people couldn't get enough of what they saw of Nidhogg, and they really couldn't wait for it to finally come out, so much so that they would start making games based of it.When Nidhogg was finally released, I had already forgotten about it, having had my fill of copies and games based off of the copies.I did remember this game again, eventually. I won it in a giveaway, and now here I am. The game fulfills a lot of promises, for me. And I jump and stab my way through the stages, listening to engaging music, shouting at my opponent in anger and glee. It's all around fun that I'm sure I'll get every time I load the game.Get Nidhogg, play it with your friends, stab someone in the face, and sacrifice yourself to the great dragon while having lots of fun. I know I am.10/10			"

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.			"

tl;dr -> If you ever wanted to stab your friends in the face while avoiding jail time, get this game and invite them over. 11/10 awesome fencing simulator.I got this game when it was a Steam Daily Sale, and was very happy with my purchase. A fantastic party game to play with friends, both online and locally.If you like 1 versus 1 gameplay, fencing, and fast-paced action, then you will really enjoy this game.The aesthetics are very simple, but still good - the blood leakage effect whenever someone dies can result in the battlefield being painted in a variety of colors. The music and sounds are decent, but I prefer to play my own to add to the intensity of the combat. Controls are very simple, but mastering the combat system may take some practice. There is a quick tutorial that will help you learn everything you need to know. The learning curve is minimal - the most difficult thing being training yourself and your reflexes/reaction time. I've tried using both a controller and the keyboard, and either works perfectly - I personally prefer a controller.The gameplay is fast and relentless - your goal is to reach the opposite end of the map, while also preventing your opponent from doing the same. There are a series of areas to pass (the map is mirrored) before the ""final area,"" and if you pass this area you will continue on to the winners section. You can lunge with your sword or punch/divekick if you are unarmed. Throwing your sword is risky, but may be fruitful in the right situation. You can pick up any dropped sword, and an area may have plenty of swords (and blood) on the ground if you and your opponent are rapidly killing each other. You can do tricks like disarming your opponent by hovering up or down on their sword, and you can also sweep their legs to drop them to the ground. The ""right of way"" arrow shows who can continue down the map, and this is provided to whoever has achieved the latest kill. There are situations where both players can die - mostly falling to your death - and the right of way will be reset to no one. An interesting concept - and advantage - of having the right of way is that you don't necessarily have to kill your opponent each time. Instead, you can also try to dodge them and just keep running down the map. To counter this, you need to run in the opposite direction in order to spawn in front of the person with the right of way. There is a singleplayer mode that is fairly challenging, as well as a tournament mode (or just straight up versus, both online and local). Overall, the game is a fantastic party game that is very easy to learn and begin playing. Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Part Super Smash Bros, part Divekick, part ""I'm-totally-gonna-cleave-your-♥♥♥"" Simulator 2016. Nidhogg was one of those unfortunate indie games, that went under the radar in my case until my good old friend RTRIX insisted he'd buy me this game as a gift. Reluctantly, I accepted his gift, and quickly got surprised of the game's competetive feel, smooth fighting mechanics and the sheer fun. However, do be mindful of the lag, stuttering and the input lag when joining an online game with your friend. That said, this game also has offline multiplayer, much to some people's chagrin of playing local multiplayer - on a PC/Mac. With a price tag of 3€ on sale - not 13€, seeing the small amount of content present in the game - Nidhogg is worth a try. Oh, and do play this game on a soundproof room: you'll be cussing a lot, especially when playing with your friends ;)			"

												While the hype is real, the replay value is not.  I want to enjoy this game so bad, but the iffy netcode and lack of content is causing me not to.  I feel the number of arenas and options given for 15$ is a little bit steeper than its worth.  The gameplay is actually phenomenal and incredible though (especially with other people), so if those other things don't bother you that much, go ahead and buy this game, just make sure to catch it on sale or something.

												The game is great fun, Especially with a friend, However, On my first time playing, I completed the whole single player campaign with only losing once, The game is WAY too easy. Also, Only 4 levels??? I payed 12 bloody pounds for this game, This is the sort of game you download for free off of GameJolt or some ♥♥♥♥. Its fun, But there are too many downers to this game that holds me back from reccomending it. Also, i was expecting an epic final boss of some kind. Because on images of the game, they are fighting on top of a huge shaking platform. That never happens in the whole game. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.			"

												Nidhogg is a very simplistic representation of fencing where the goal is to reach the opponent's start point and get eaten by some giant creature presumably called the Nidhogg. The gameplay has a bit of a tug-of-war feel to it as dead players respawn a bit further back from where they were slain meaning you have to continuously battle all the way to the end without failing to win. Combat consists of moving your blade up/down, thrusting, rolling, throwing the blade, and jump kicks, combinations of which can be used to confuse and disable your opponent, setting them up for the kill. Once you kill an opponent, you gain the right of way and place him on the defensive, meaning that if you were to jump over him and continue towards his start, he would have to pursue you or allow himself to be scrolled off and respawn in front of you.Due to the overall simplicity of the game and small number of levels, it seems to suit itself more towards multiplayer than single player which is unfortunate because the multiplayer can get downright unplayable due to latency causing your inputs to get ignored or delayed. Additionally the controls can be awkward when shifting between stances not to mention you risk throwing your sword when shifting to stab high from a mid-stance. I originally had a bit more positive of a review for this game but after re-playing it I decided to drop my recommendation since the content is really lacking and not worth the base price (or really even the sale price).

												Incredibly fun, fast-paced, fencing duels galore. The visuals and music are great and the gameplay, although simple to learn, is challenging to master. Not to mention hilarious with a group of friends. Nothing makes you feel more badass than timing a sword throw to the face or stabbing your foe in the chest and twisting it back and forth as you revel in victory.Now that I have said that, probably the biggest problem with this game would have to be the incredibly steep price tag. I bought it when it was about $11 and I regret it for even that price. There are TONS of games that are much cheaper and have waaaay more replayability. There is absolutely nothing justifying its ridiculous price. There are only 3 stages (or 4 I can't quite remember at the moment), a laughable tacked-on single player mode, and barely working multiplayer. Don't get me wrong, the game is fun, it's just not worth 15 freaking bucks. There isn't nearly enough content to warrant a 15 dollar price tag (or even $11 for that matter). Whoever decided that must have been on drugs. The game as it is should be priced at around 5-6 bucks. If it was around that price I would recommend everyone to get it. For the time being I honestly feel pretty cheated out of my money. If it was cheaper the devs would make more money for it in the end, I am almost positive everyone on my friends list would have bought it. Not to mention the multiplayer would have more value since there would be more people to fight. Also it only supports 360 controllers which sucks.			"

												It might look like hot garbage, or art, depending on where you fall in terms of visual preference. It might be stupidly simple, or elegantly uncomplex, depending on how you feel about the gameplay. It might be the greatest fighting game ever made, or an overpriced hipster art project, depending on if you like the damn thing or not. In development since 2011, this side-scrolling two-player fighting game where you duel with swords, kicks, runs, jumps and fistfights has been turning heads. Either towards it, attracted to the bright Atari-style low-fi graphics and immediately comprehensible combat, or away from it in disgust because… reasons. It’s an incredible fast paced game when both players (or the player vs A.I.) are reckless. Pixel blood flows down the walls as each fighter tries to get past the other. If you make it, you move to the next screen and your opponent is placed in front of you once more. It’s a tug of war, in a sense. The victor not decided by who kills who the most, but by whichever side reaches their goal first: a giant flying worm on either end of the level. If you can get eaten by the Nidhogg, you have proven your prowess in combat.But it can also be a slow, methodical and beautiful game of lethal Chess.			"

The graphics are nice, the swordplay feels smooth and satisfying and it's really nice when you or your opponent die a lot and color the entire stage with your blood. It's really fun.			"

												I had fun playing this game for like an hour or so, but after beating the single player there's not much to do after. I never see any other players online, so unless you have a friend who has the game as well the online is pointless. There are few bugs with the game too. One that I see a lot is when you and your opponent die at the same time the screen starts lagging. I regret getting this game. I don't think it was worth the $15. If I had to give this a game a more reasonable price I'd say it's worth $5.			"
