												BBT reminds me of the time when indie games weren't cool yet and still had that shareware feel. This one's a bit rough in the UI department (the menus are bad and difficult to explore with a gamepad) but it's gameplay is rock solid. And by ""rock"" I mean that the game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥repeatadely before you get good at it. It brilliantly conveys the feeling of a ring fight without taking itself seriously. Fighting system is simple but not simplistic - if you mash the same attack for a longer time each fighter will notice this and change his (its?) tatic accordingly. It all comes down to timing and proper strategy. As it should.The writing is good (even though most won't even bother to read the text), graphics are okay. The music fits the theme perfectly. What's more important is that it's really fluid and it controls well during actual gameplay. I recommend using a 360 pad - it's easier to hammer both triggers than to mash the keyboard.Well worth its price. I got it on Indie Royale as soon as it appeared. Played it on Desura before, really happy to see it on Steam.			"

												Fun game, reminds me abit of Super Punch Out. You play a boxer and you can control side to side movement, left/right punches, types of punch, and blocking. It can be challenging at times, but with good timing, a bit of strategy, and carefully chosen upgrades, you can really tear through this game quickly. As of this review with 2.8 hours played, I've 100%'d the achievements already (including the 4 secret ones) so I'd imagine you'd get a similar amount of time out of it give or take a few hours. I don't have any other games like it, so I may go back and play it somemore just for fun.Lots of fun though, recommended if you can get it for very cheap or in a bundle. I was lucky enough to be given mine!			"

												The immediate comparison that comes to mind when viewing this game is the NES/SNES classic ""Punchout"", and I'd say that's pretty accurate. There are a few places in which it falls short, though it does shine in a few spots as well.The art style is a probably a personal preference, but I liked it. The beasts are just wacky enough without falling into the realm of ridiculous. Animation is a little stiff, but it works. Keep in mind that this is a $4.99 game and it is not trying to be AAA. But, hey, Punchout was no ""looker"" either, right? Now, where BBT falls just short of ""Punchout"", in my opinion, is in the gameplay. I played it with a wired 360 pad and it felt great using the two triggers in combination with the thumb stick for movement and punches. I'd have to level my criticism mainly at the lack of complexity in the enemy fighters. While each has a signature attack, it's not hard to win each fight with the same jabs and crosses. Once you defeat the game, a game+ mode unlocks and it does get a little tougher from there, but the action remains pretty straightforward.One thing BBT does well is that it presents you with many training options that allow you to boost your stats with money earned from fights. Watch out though, because it's fairly easy to overlevel and fights become even easier. You may also purchase new gear that changes the look of your fighter (in-menu... all fighting is done first-person) and gives you even more stat boosts. All in all, I enjoyed the game. There aren't many games in this genre, so fans will probably want to check it out.			"

												Beast Boxing Turbo is the PunchOut or Wii Sports Boxing for the PC. It controls pretty much the same way as those games and it has the same looks as PunchOut and actually manages to look a bit cooler thanks to the variety in opponents, even if there are only 12 of them. The game really is beautifully rendered, but the fact that the backdrops and the crowds are in 2D is a bit disappointing.You can use the mouse or controller to land your punches and there's an extensive tutorial to help you ease into the game. Except that, by the game you reach the 10th opponent - and at the same time the last tutorial - the game is almost over. Yes, there's a New Game+, but it's still a shame if you're not into stuff like that, or simply do not have the patience to go through it again.Defeating opponents rewards you with money. Money that can be used to upgrade your character by training at the gym or by buying equipment. By the time you reach the last opponent you're probably already strong enough to take him down the first time. My advice; don't spend your money on equipment, just use the money at the gym to make your character stronger.I praise the developer for not letting me grind in order to defeat the last opponent. But at the same time I wish it was made more difficult. Because Beast Boxing Turbo is a fun game, but a short one. Two hours and you're done with it. I really, really, really hope there'll be a sequel, with more opponents, a better tutorial system (or more opponents after the tutorial) and more incentive to keep fighting (or to do rematches). Even with its 2 hours of playtime BBT has become one of my favorite games.[Rating: 84/100]			"

												Super Punch Out!! always seems to be forgotten by people when listing off the SNES's best titles. To be fair it's up against some stiff competition, but to this day SPO is still an incredibly fun and polished gem that has sadly faded from most people's memories. The developers of Beat Boxing Turbo clearly remember it though, with their game being clearly and highly inspired by Nintendo's boxing puzzle game, with a bit of Fight Night mixed in for a colorful arcade feel that reminded me why I miss SPO so much. It's in no way a perfect replacement, but it's an admirable effort and a surprisingly fun time!So you want to box? Well tough luck, human, there's no place for your kind in the ring! Under a disguise though no one would stop you, and thus you enter the world of beat boxing in an attempt to make a name for yourself and prove humans have a place in the sport.As the name suggests, this isn't straight boxing, but somewhere between the over the top feel of the before mentioned Punch Out and a simple arcade recreation of the sport. Your collection of moves is small and the way to utilize them equally limited, but you're given just enough variation to be able to plan out various moves, and counter the attacks of your beastly enemies (which true to form all have their own special attacks and fighting styles). It's easy to learn and honestly pretty easy to master as well, which actually becomes an issue after a point as fights become cake walks and the CPU's way to counteract this is to rely on cheap hits and forcing you into corners that never feel particularly fair. It's disappointing the difficulty fluctuates from such extremes, but when it's not beating you in the face without remorse the ease of conquering your opponents never became hugely unsatisfying.As a budget priced game there have been some obvious cuts and as a whole the amount of content here is slim. Perhaps most disappointing is the absence of any multiplayer mode, which seems an obvious addition that could have extended the hour or so story mode a lot further. Other issues arise in the clunky combat, that isn't a problem generally but on higher difficulty levels leads to a lot of cheap KO's. Some recycled character models/frames are a bit tacky as well, but the cartoon artstyle mostly makes up for the corners that have been cut off the presentation.Irregardless, Beast Boxing Turbo is worth recommending if only for how unique it is to the platform, and for how fun it is while it lasts. It's far from the classic that is Super Punch Out!!, but as that is a sequel itself perhaps it's only a matter of waiting for Beast Boxing 2 for it to reach that point. In the meantime I'll be over here punching pigs in the face.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Really fun game! Definitely recommending it for when it's on sale.This game is a love letter to Super Punch out, and it nails it pretty damn well. Character design's awesome, the punching feels good and there's a decent block/dodge system. There's also upgradable gear and skills which are a very nice touch.There's also a decently told story that the devs could've easily cast aside, but they didn't, and I appreciate that a lot. The dialogue's pretty funny. I only wish the game was longer, since it's legitimately fun.And your boxer girl's pretty cute, so there's a plus. :3			"

												A game very similar in looks and gameplay to Punch-Out!!! with interesting characters, really good core gameplay, and a decent progression system. The price is right, the game is fun, and although it's not very long, I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended at the current price and on sale it's a complete no-brainer. A little bit more variety in the people you fought would be nice - there's not a lot of difference between characters the way there is in Punch-Out, but that doesn't detract much from an awesome game.9/10			"

												If you remember 'Mike Tyson's Punch-Out' (or just 'Punch-out' depending if you bought the game after Tyson went to prison) from the NES era than this will feel pretty familiar right from the start.  I won't bore you with details but I will say that though this is a fun game, it's far too easy to complete.  Even the NewGame+ was a cakewalk.  And, the lack of any real punch variety makes the fights feel like deja-vu over and over again.  No special moves/punches, no southpaw, and no real sense of accomplishing anything through training accept for making a number larger are all dissapointments as well.  And there is absolutely no multi-player (local or online).  So much potential here but unfortunately it's lost somewhere.			"

												For a lower budget title, this is a fun Punch-Out style game. The combos don't feel as tight and timing isn't as strict, but it is the closest thing you can get to punch out without having to fire up an emulator. The beast design is good, and while the story doesn't win any awards, it never gets in the way. Having to grind  for equipment and stats to beat the final boss is a nice touch to extend the game, but with only 12 monsters you will probably just play until you get strong enough to finish him off. The new game mode increases the difficulty, but appears to only increase the stats of the monsters, not really their moves or attack styles. Equiping items is a pain too, you have to scroll through items one by one, in no order sorting out all your items in your head. Slots for each equipment piece would be better, but you can visibly see your equipment change in the menu as well as in the ring, which was a nice touch.			"

Think punch-out with out the rampant cheating (kicks and 1 guy used a cane) though in this game your the one cheating simply by being human.Fight your way past racism and a string of 12 faces only a mother could love.Your many skills involve punches, hooks, and uppercuts (no body blows) wile you block and dodge to the sides.Each bout gives cash you can spend on training skills or buying new mutant gear.

												The other day I had the inclination to hit something. Bouncing around the house with a lot of energy makes me want to expel it in different ways. I'm not a boxer myself but thinking about it made me remember this game and I'm glad I did.Beast Boxing Turbo is a fun little fighting game. There aren't many boxing games out there but this is one of the good ones. Your character's story is that she wants to participate in the Beast Boxing fight circuit but since humans aren't allowed you're fighting incognito. Your goal at first is just to prove you're as good as any beast as you just want to be accepted but of course you turn out to have mad boxing skills then get the idea that you can actually be the best. A rags to Rocky story if you will.Controls are tight and even though you can get by with pretty much just jabs you face an good variety of fighters that have their own unique moves and fighting styles. You fight in a first person view reminiscent of Super Punchout, if you're old enough to remember that. You can also buy equipment and train to increase your skills. I play this with a gamepad and the controls feel natural and responsive.If there was one area I feel that this game falls a bit shot in is that I would have enjoyed if the training exercises included a short mini-game of some sort so it adds a bit of play time and variation to just straight boxing matches. Another thing I feel that could have been a bit of an improvement was if there was some need to use other punches besides the jab. You can do uppercuts and hooks. Even though those punches are more effective when they do hit they tend to be slower and easily dodged by the majority of the opponents you face.Other than that this game is fun to play albeit is pretty short. One playthrough will take you about 90 minutes. There's no grinding involved. The story is peppered with humor and the characters you face have a surprising bit of personality as well. Overall it's a really good boxing game.			"

												There are four types of indie games - bad indie game, ""meh, just another indie game"", good indie game and ASTONISHING indie game. And surprisingly - Beast Boxing Turbo is representing the last type. First of all - gameplay is gorgeous. From the very beginning. Control is simple and intuitive (you need to pass through tutorial, but it's painless). Every match is very engaging and entertaining - some of them can be considered as too easy though, due to limits of AI (you can find some gaps in behaviour of your opponent), but don't worry - overall, it's still challenging experience.It's incredible, that with relatively small amount of mediocre graphic  you can have so much remarkable and well animated characters. It's for sure not the most beautiful game in Steam library, but believe me - it's not bothering at all.I really like music in this game - some themes are so memorable, that I like to listen them even long after beating the game.As you probably guessed, this game is not too long. And that's unfortunately true. It has some replayability value, but still - I really would like to see more in-game opponents and multiplayer mode, but unfortunately, it seems that we can't count on any of those things in future.Nevertheless - just for satisfactory and juicy gameplay I can recommend this game without hesitation. For everyone - due to its quite simple control and entertaining gameplay.			"

												TL;DR: A fun action boxing game with a short career mode.Set in an alternative universe with slums, aliens and monsters, you become the slum girl who wants to participate in the beast boxing tournament: boxing for monsters and only monsters, because humans are viewed weak and not up to the challenge. Thus a human wouldn't be able or even allowed to try their brawn in the ring. How's the girl going to fight the discrimination? Dressing up as a monster, of course!The fight for equality aside, the story is very basic with the unlikely protagonist rising and training hard to become a champion. Albeit basic and familiar in a sense, the story is still very nicely presented and interesting to see through. Music and sound effects fit the setting well. The game itself is really fun action boxing! One important thing keeping you hooked until the end is the career mode, which is also the main mode of the game. You start fighting in rings against lowest of the lowest opponents and even in higher difficulty levels the opponents will easily fall in front of you. Not going to how this is fairly unrealistic (the protagonist being a teenager against bigger monsters), but the fights sure are a lot of fun. It's surely not a simulation but it's not trying to be one anyway: for realism you might want to look elsewhere. The opponents are talking pigs, aliens, turkeys, all kinds of vaguely bipedal fantasy monster races. There are even some ridiculous ones like a skeleton and a treeherd. They are hilarious and fit the theme well. All opponents have different attributes, like strength, health and speed and their own special attacks. Other than that, they are a bit too similar. There are basically just two archetypes: the speedy one and the heavy hitter, who might or might not require a different tactic to beat them depending on your difficulty setting.Fighting is straightforward and easy to understand and works like fluid playing with a keyboard. You (and your opponents) may attack with any of the more or less familiar boxing strikes, like jabs or hooks. It's important to keep track of your stamina, which drains when punching or taking hits but also replenishes fast when not attacking. You win a round by emptying the opponent's health bar by landing punches and not letting the opponent do the same to you by blocking and dodging.The AI can be nasty: it fights you giving fast punches when you're preparing for a strong strike and doing heavier hits when you are down. It even learns to anticipate your strikes if you don't change your strategy often enough. It was still fairly easy to shoot a hook at them when they're approaching and they would almost never see that coming, even when repeating the action.One thing about the AI bugs me though: when the opponent is low on health they'll retreat to a corner. They will stay there so you have to follow them. When you do, they will always give you a punch or two and then retreat to the opposite corner. This exploitative tactic was really annoying when trying to finally down the opponent and call it a round.In the story you get a couch who teaches you some important techniques (i.e. game mechanics) in the practice (tutorials). As the story goes on, your previous opponents decide to join your dojo and teach you more things. This is a nice and convenient way of handling the tutorials.As you progress you win money, which you can use to train and buy equipment. The monster boxing rules don't seem to mind the fighters having some extra equipment while in the ring, though they are otherwise honourable to the basic rules of boxing. The equipment makes you e.g. stronger or faster but can also penalize you while giving higher bonuses to other things. Likewise, training naturally also makes you stronger and helps you especially when facing the highest tier foes.If you really get into the game there is the endless mode, in which you just fight opponent after opponent without healing or upgrades until you inevitably drop, trying to last as long as possible. You can then track your score on global leaderboards and compete for the highest place.Having only 12 opponents, the game is unfortunately quite short: myself, I finished it (all achievements) in 4 hours and having played through New Game++: the career mode can be start anew with the previous upgrades but stronger opponents. Still, this can only last so far.For longevity it would need more opponents, a longer career mode and more distinct difficulties (frankly I saw little difference between normal and hard). Perhaps playing different characters or having multiplayer would be cool as well. Here's for hoping there will be a sequel that addresses at least some of these issues.For the glorious full price of 5 bucks though the price is still good, and on sale it's even better! For the short time it lasted for me it was a blast, an excellent choice for killing a few hours for fun.			"

												If I had one complaint about this game, it would only be that it's too short. However I'll also say that the Continue+ mode, Endless mode and several difficulty levels mitigates this as well as it can.I usually judge a game based on 5 criteria, listed in order of important: Gameplay, Controls, Replayability, Sound & Graphics.Gameplay: As many people before me have said this is definitely an homage to Punch Out from the slew of eccentric and quirky characters to the first person boxing mode. The gameplay though is very tight. The AI doesn't feel like it cheats, there's no psuedo difficulty or anything of that nature. The AI learns from your patterns and which attacks you're using most and will guard against it in the current and next round, forcing players to avoid a specific pattern or style of play.Controls: You can rock the keyboard or you can rock a gamepad, fully customizable and absolutely no complaints here. Controls are such an important part of a game, they can make a game or break it and while you might think it's standard practice to allow customizable controls, it's the few games that don't that stand out like a sore thumb. Thankfully this game isn't one of them.Replayability: As long as you're in the mood for the game, there's content there to play. From exhibition missions to completing/replaying the story, or trying your hand at endless mode. The only thing I can foresee ruining this is becoming bored with the game itself which will happen, as with most games, eventually.Sound: The sound effects are definitely on point and the music is about what you'd expect: standard background music that you actually hear for a few minutes and then start tuning out after that.Graphics: The graphics for this game are great. They're not super polished high end but for what they are they look awesome and I had a ball seeing new characters and the blending of art for story and 3d in the ring.Overall on a scale of 0-10, I'd give this game an 8.

												Not played many boxing games but this one does the mechanics fairly well with its attacks but sadly the fights in the game become mostly strafing away from your opponent and spamming your attacks at the right time. With more limited movement the fighting could have been a fair bit more interesting and challenging.  The games story mode contains about 12 fights in increasing difficulty and adding new abilities step by step, but due to needing to upgrade your skills and equipment the game becomes a bit grindy and repetitive. The story itself along with the games graphics are sound are mostly passable and don't really add much to the game.Contains the usual progression achievements along with some stuff for doing fights in a certain way. It also has three difficulty achievements that thankfully all unlock if you beat the game on the hardest difficulty.Time to 100%: 3-4 hours			"

												This is a super fun little game with a very reasonable price tag!  That said, it's also very short.  I beat it on easy, normal and hard in 2 hrs.  There are 12 matches, each one is 2 out of 3 rounds (although you won't go to 3 rounds very often).  The graphics are fun, the story is lighthearted, and the controls are tight.  One thing that I particularly liked is permanant character upgrades you can purchase with your winnings.  The only real downside for me was that the game never got very difficult.  I'm not a particularly hardcore gamer, but in all my playthroughs I only lost 1 round, and it was on the last guy on hardcore.  The game doesn't have that ""memorize his moves and get your timing perfect"" element that Punch Out has, which could be considered a pro or a con.  Overall, I loved my 2 hrs with this game.			"

												""In the Beast Boxing Leagues of Beasthalla, the strongest monsters fight for fame and fortune.""You are Char, a great fan of Beast Boxing. You dream abotu one day becomming a beast boxer yourself. But there is one problem: you are a human from the slums and humans are not allowed to compete. So you buy a monster costume and trick your way to a qualifying match for the Bush League, the lowest league there is.And that is where the game starts and you start to jab, cross, hook and uppercut yourself to fame and fortune. And eventually realize that youa re fighting for more than just your dream, but human rights and the place of humanity in a beasty world.The controls are fairly simple, be it controller or keyboard, requiring only either an analogue stick and two buttons, or the arrow keys and two punching keys. As you progress through the game, you are tought to block, dodge, counter and preserve your stamina through a series of optional tutorial fights.There are 12 opponents in total to unlock and you can do exhibition matches against any opponent you have defeated. Every fight nets you cash. This you can use to buy better equipment and to train your skills. Sometimes you may need to take a step back and practice with weaker opponents, earn some cash and upgrade your equipment before being able to proceed through harder leagues.On normal difficulty, the story mode took me just under 3 hours. There is a New Game Plus though where opponents are tougher, faster and hit harder.And there is an Endless mode, where you can test your boxing skills and see how long you can last.There can be a bit of frustration when opponents seemingly hover just outside your reach and none of your punches connect. But perseverance will see every beast that gets in your way K.O. on the ground.Overall a very fun little game that keeps entertaining far beyond a single playthrough.			"

												As a person not interested in boxing I was very plesently supprised by this game. The art style is very plesent and best of all the mechanics are very solid. I'm quite suprised this game wasn't skinned as humans (or even licenced) and targeted towards real boxing fans. £4 is a very fair price to. Perhaps a multiplayer mode might have been good (but i'm sure very hard to implement). Also I should note I played this with a controller and it all worked very well.			"

												优点：易上手，难度适中，即使是hard模式也不会很难。爽快的打击感。缺点：虽然支持手柄，但是没有震动效果。不能联机，流程很短。可玩的内容少。Pros：This is a very easy, simple boxing game (you don't have long move list like King of Fighters). It has a strong sense of reality when you punch your opponents.Cons：Although this game support controller, the vibration feedback won't work. No Multi-player and the story is short.			"

												This is a fun game. It's basically a Punch Out clone but monster themed. You can upgrade your skills and buy gear with the money you collect from winning matches. You can also move around the ring--at least from side to side which lets you dodge attacks instead of just blocking. The tutorial is spread out across matches and it's quick and to the point. Boxers have different attack styles. The graphics are obviously nothing spectacular, but that's not really the selling point of the game. I enjoyed the silly/cartoonish visual style. I used a wired XBOX 360 controller for Windows. Works great. Sometimes it feels a little sluggish, but it's negligible. It's a simple, straightforward game. You get exactly what you'd expect. Definitely worth the low price tag.			"

												The most fun I had in an arcade-style boxing game since Mike Tyson's Punch Out! The game has a pretty gentle learning curve. The arcade qualities come here in the ""easy to learn difficult to master"" sort of way. You can dive right into the game, the tutorials are really helpful and not overly complicated. Just like in Punch Out - you'll start with easy opponents and they'll get tougher as the game progresses (like a good game should be!).The replay value while won't keep you glued to the screen - is still there, when you want to quickly punch someone in the face for a few rounds. This game is worth every penny!			"

												The game is fun, but only for several hours. The AI is mediocre and does not surprize you each time. I am about to beat the game in hardcore mode in 2 hours and I am not a pro gamer or anything. But the game is one of a kind, since there aren't many boxing games around, so that's a pro. But the dialogues are dull and the story is cheap. ""Monsterella"", really?I would give the game 3,5 / 5 though, since I still have fun playing it. Could be a nice catch if you get it during sale time.			"

It's pretty short as I managed to beat it within 3 hours including the newgame+ which are the same opponents only tougher and faster and you get to keep your upgrades. The newgame+ offers some additional challenge, but overall it's not that more difficult. The thing I love about this game that it doesn't require a lot of grinding and the visuals were very appealing to me. The buying item menu could be more organized as you can easily overlook some gears.Overall, its a fun, action packed short game well worth it's price.			"

												This game is perfect for in between. A tasty little snack that will leave you feeling satisified each time. Fights are short and of varied difficulty, providing just the right balance of frustration and success. I highly recommend starting in hard mode, as that is where the game truly shines. A sequence of tutorials will guide you through some of the more advanced combat mechanics as you progress.Opponent design is the biggest strength of this game, given it's much more interesting fighting a treeman than some professional (human) boxer you probably haven't heard of before anyway. Each enemy comes with his own personal finishing move and tasteful flavor text.Last but not least a reasonably diverse upgrade system serves to tie the short fights together, giving you long term equipment goals to fight for, as well as allowing you to cheaply boost your power in the gym, should you be struggling with an opponent in the short run.The games main weakness is ultimately it's length, provided there are only twelve adversaries to fight in total. This shortcoming is unfortunate, but very much acceptable given the game's budget price. Same goes for the music. I quite like it, but there's not a lot of it.			"

												Well, its a nicely designed game. If you are fan of punch out, you should play this, at least once (and i probably think that playing it twice is about right to stop).Few good things and only 2-3 bad, which hurt this game a lot.GoodPretty models, nice animation, decent soundtrack, responsive controls.Bad.Remember that in punch out you were static in the middle of the ring and you had to dodge all the punches/combos?Well, this is the bad thing here in BBT, you can move freely, which is kinda nice, but the AI is so dumb that will do a special move when you are on the other part of the ring, although you can dodge/counter, why bother if you could just run away?This game is so easy (and boring after 3rd-4th fight ) because the AI cant land a punch, or combos since you just run away.There is supposed to be a special punch button, but i couldnt use it for some reason (unless wasnt any to start with).Unfortunately you can beat the entire game with just jabs.Way too short. Little to no replay value.I dont want to be harsh to this game since is well designed, except for the ""free move"" mechanic, it ruins the game. Had they anchored the heroe to the center of the ring, the replay value would have gone trough the roof.Buy it only if you really want to play it, because you will abandon it in 1 hour "

												Beast Boxing Turbo is afforadable, fun, has enjoyable graphics, and is humorous. The game mechanics work well, the character design is great, and the minimal storyline is fun. Would I reccommend a playthrough? Certainly. For $5, a game of monster boxing is certainly worthwhile. That being said, however, there is the frequently mentioned flaw of the game being too short. In one sitting, I managed to purchase every item, max out all my stats and plow through all of the ""campaign"". It didn't take long to use up the entire game's playability, and the ""endless"" mode gets boring really fast. I played through it twice and quickly lost interest after that. My biggest complaint, however, is that the game is painfully easy. I finally stopped playing when the game asked me if I wanted to play through ""NewGame Plus 11"". The big problem here is that this game can be destroyed using a strategy a five year old could master. In NG+7, which is supposedly the maximum level of difficulty available, I, being someone who is not at all a major gamer, managed to beat the first five characters in a row without them being able to so much as pull off a single punch by doing little more than button-mash jabbing right as the fight started. If a character can't be simply annihilated in five seconds that way and they start blocking, you move off to the side, take advantage of reach with a single hook, and then begin mashing again. Repeat this until you get the fire-glove power, which eventually makes it so you virtually can't lose, and then pummel jab until the fight ends. If you can time this without getting caught in some combo or running out of steam, you honestly can't lose. I was running the entire story mode in under fifteen minutes. It is mindlessly easy to master, and after the NG+1, which was the only time playing the game I felt even mildly challenged, the fun bled out. It was mechanical and I knew what was coming.Despite this major issue in playability, I would still highly suggest giving the game a run. Perhaps, like all other games on Steam, it would be best to wait until it goes on sale. Even if not, what fun is there is worth five dollars. Start on easy mode just so you can suck all the enjoyment out of it, enjoy the humor and the conversations between the characters when you play it for the first time, try to get the highest accuracy rating you can rather than just trying to win....there is some worthwhile enjoyment here, as long as you understand ahead of time what it is you are getting into with this title.

												Even though I don't recommend this game (particularly at it's $5 price point) I actually think there's a lot to like here.+There's a great, vibrant world!+Fun, imaginative characters!+Instantly engaging art style!+Stats that you build up with money earned from fights!+Great music/sound effects!+Responsive controls!Unfortunately, in the end, this is a video game. And even though most of the game is contained in the above plus column, the simple fact remains that...-It's an incredibly solvable, mindless game.I get why this is billed as ""Punch Out with Monsters"", and if it actually had been it would have been a better game. Unfortunately, there is this poorly thought out strafing mechanic that dominates the AI entirely. Strafe to recover stamina, jab when they get in range, strafe again. Repeat until gloves are on fire. You can literately beat the entire game doing this- ignoring all of the other mechanics in the game, all stat building, etc. etc.I would play the hell out of an actual punch out clone with these assets- one that actually was a game.

												This game appears to be fun at first, but then it's just a boring mess.The game is too easy and you're doing the same thing over and over again. It's not challenging, except the mode which is a challenge.It's not like your typical boxing game, not even close.It's more like, mortal Kombat on who you fight, except, it's a fixed person each time and that, your character is a little skinny girl.The game is very short. After you beat it, you get to the new game + mode to do it again. It's not even hard either. Yes, it is harder than before, but still, it's just lame to redo the same content.I'm tired of developers making it where you cannot play the hard mode until you beat it on the normal mode. I don't want to play the game again, I want to play it once and try and enjoy it, playing it again isn't that enjoyable.Anyways, I played it again and beat it again.Done and finished, haven't played the game since.I am not sure of what my hours were, but it is not accurate. I generally load a game and alt tab and type things or watch movies or wait for cards. So my playtime isn't how long the game is.Oh, this game doesn't have cards, but they should.

No human has ever entered the infamous 'Beast Boxing' tournament but in this case we may have found the exception.  Dance across the ring dodging your opponents while throwing an array of punches of your own to take them down.'Beast Boxing' will quickly remind players of classic boxing games.  There are some very rough edges when it comes to the movement mechanics that make it to easy to constantly avoid opponents.  While the regenerating health bar makes sense in concept when it comes to implementation it often just makes the bar feel twice as long.			"

												I was very pleased to see this game after playing Punch-out! (Mike Tyson's Punch-out!, for the NES), as it's not the type of game you often see.Don't buy it thinking it's Punch-out. It's actually a significantly different game, with different mechanics, that stands on its own! If you enjoyed it, you'll probably like this one as well, but they're fundamentally different game.With that out of the way, I'll now say what I like and what I don't like.The most obvious think here are the graphics. The game has quite a lot of character to it, and the visual style of the game suits it surprisingly well. Although the models are questionable (you can see the polygons clearly in some characters and animations), the textures manage to hide that pretty well, and make the game look awesome! Personally, I think the game looks great, but it might not be your thing... I guess you can decide that from the screenshots.As a segway... the music. It's very good! And it's varied enough, each stage giving a different vibe, matching the opponent as well. One complaint I have it that the music doesn't loop very well, most of the time. In combat I didn't really notice it much (maybe because there wasn't enough time to notice), but on the menus it's pretty apparent... and feels awkward. I think there could've been more polish into the ending and starting of the tracks. Other than that, it's awesome, good job!SoundEffects weren't really something I enjoyed a lot. I found them a little annoying at times, with some high-pitched sounds, but they're bearable.Now, a problem I've had with this game was the Interface. The style of the menus were a bit out of place, but that's not the main problem. Navigating through them is slow and unintuitive with a controller. I guess a mouse helps it greatly (since this is a PC), but for a game like this, I prefer using the controller. Also, key bindings were very awkward with the shared functionalities. When you change a certain key, it might have 2 functions at once, which you can't change separately... that makes it weird with a couple of keys. I think the game would have benefited quite a lot from having all the keys able to be rebound, and a reworked interface. Ah well...Options menu was a bit lackluster as well, but at least it had separate audio sliders... That's a plus and some games fail royaly.So, all in all, presentation was pretty good, despite having a clunky interface.Now about the gameplay. In this, you have essentially 3 modes: Carreer, which is separated in Tournament and an Exhibition Modes. Then you have Endless.In the carreer mode, you can upgrade your character by buying attributes, and equipment. Each piece of equipment has its benefits and its downgrades, letting you create your own sets for different situations. I didn't really like this, for the simple reason that it makes for a not as balanced game. If there were no upgrades, you would have to play like in the old days, memorizing patterns, and actually train to beat a game. In this, if you lose a couple of matches, you can just buy your way to victory, in a way. But... this is a different type of game, so I guess I shouldn't be complaining about that. It works for this game, letting the player create his own pacing in a way, and giving the game some customization, so I think it's good... even if I don't like the notion of it.In Tournament Mode, you have 4 leagues, each with 3 opponents. Each opponent has his own fighting style and backstory (which I enjoyed greatly, not swarming you with text, but letting their personalities go through small but to the point catch-phrases and fighting style, well done!). These get progressively harder, as one would imagine. You gain currency at the end of each fight, receiving a smaller amount when you lose.In Exhibition Mode, you can fight whoever you've fought before, for a smaller amount of currency. This was there in case the player was having difficulty defeating an opponent, then grinding a bit and upgrading his equipment/stats. I didn't really need that, but we'll get on to that further.Finally, in Endless Mode, you find in Rounds of just 1, trying to go through as many opponents as you can. As you fight, coins drop on the floor, which you can use in Carreer Mode, or to buy Health during the Endless Mode, as you don't gain health after each round.I actually enjoyed the game's structure quite a lot! Although, it was pretty short for me. Either way, for 5€, it was enough... and a lot of fun.Now, the most important part of the game: the combat.I have several issues with it. But, it was fun as hell while it lasted! And it's deeper than it seems when you start playing.You can do Jabs (left-handed fast, but weak punches), Crosses (slightly slower but stronger right-handed punches), Uppercuts, and Hooks as attacks. Your objective is to figure out which ones work the best against the different opponents, and then doing combos with these. The great thing is that opponents start defending against your combos if you use always the same, so it pushes the player to experiment with different tactics.And defense, you can Block, and you can walk Sideways (this walking sideways is my biggest complain, instead of a dodge ability). When you Block, you still lose HP, but a smaller amount, and you can lower that by upgrading a certain attribute.Each fighter has HP and Power (which is essentially a Stamina Bar). Whenever you attack, or Block, you lose Power. If you use it all, you'll get very, very slow, and won't be able to attack nor block appropriately. This makes the player be a bit more careful when to attack and block, creating a good pacing to the fights. However, the slowing part of running out of energy, is often not being able to escape attacks fast enough, even by walking sideways. That sometimes got awkward and frustrating during a couple of fights, but it's a question of being careful when managing attack and defense.In regards to HP, you have a general bar, you have one that depletes faster, but also regenerates. This creates an awesome dynamic in combos: the bigger the combo, the more impact it may have. You can finish the fights really quickly if you combo your attacks wisely, but they can also end fast for you if not careful. When you're hit, this alternative bar lowers faster, but it regenerates up to a point when you're not being attacked. This was unexpected, but great design, well done!One big complaint I have with the combat, it the lack of connection. Due to the sideways walk and the animation, punches sometimes don't connect when they feel like they should. If you slightly to the left/right, you can still see the punches hit the opponent, but it doesn't register. This leads to some awkward moves and makes it almost feel unfair, but it's not so bad once you get the hang of it. Still, I don't like it and I think it should be reworked if the developers make a sequel.Achievements were mainly straightforward, but some were pretty creative, which I appreciate.Lack of multiplayer is a fault, in my opinion, since you can complete the game within 5-6hours without too much of an issue... but hey, it's 5€! And it's pretty good either way! Maybe more in a future game!Another thing was the difficulty... I started the game on Hard, and it actually was hard when I started. But once I got used to the controls and developped a tactic, the difficulty has fallen quite a bit. Then there was NewGame+ which was surprisingly easier, with no difficulty options this time. Only 3 fights gave me a fairly hard time (due to very strong punches), but other than that, it was very easy in the NG+.But, it was challenging at times.So, if you're curious about the game, I'd definitely recommend it. It has its flaws, but it was a very enjoyable, and at times challenging game. And it's not very expensive, so you wouldn't lose all that much for trying it! "

												Its a fine game, not great, not bad. Gameplay is fine, the characters are really cliché and the sound is ok. Graphics are fine, too, for what the game is. Overall, its a fun little game, but I just thought that normal was too easy and I dont know if Im up to play it again on hard mode or endless mode. Should've played in hard from the begining (is that even possible?). I won every round on every fight without getting below 50% health on any fight.Still, I think its worth the price for the fun it delivers.ps. I played this game with a 360 controller. Maybe the difficult is in using the keyboard?			"

												An artfully designed first-person boxing game with freestyle arcade action in which you punch a turkey in the face. Beast Boxing Turbo is a challenging first-person boxing game with fast-paced freestyle boxing action. You play a secret human boxer in a beastly world. She's outmuscled, undersized, and in way over her head. Can she master the skills needed to get to the top of the legendary boxing leagues of Beasthalla?  Develop a fighting rhythm between attack and defense, and don't give up hope if you can't beat these monsters on your first try. There's a host of skills to train, and new gear to acquire that can give you an edge in the ring. Build up your boxing skills to match your personal style, and beat the grand champion of the Ultra League to unlock NewGame Plus mode and reach a new level of challenge.			"

												I was given this game by a friend who hadn't played it. He also gave me a bunch of hilariously bad games, so I figured this would be one of those.Nope. Not at all. I haven't gotten too far in, but the mechanics are fluid and the game runs great. Love the music and art style. The graphics aren't mind-blowing or anything but the fighting is a lot of fun, and the upgrading and equipment keeps things fresh. The writing, where there is writing, is well done.I anticipate putting a lot of free time into this game. :) Definitely would recommend if you're interested in a boxing game that can be played casually or with a lot of intense strategy, depending on difficulty.

What I didn't expect was a great game that I'm definately going to be playing again very soon. The story is that you are a human disguised as a monster working your way through the ranks. The game is very good, the sound effects, visuals and music is very modern and nice. The story consists of 12 Matches, which isn't that long as you can finish the matches in about one or two minutes. Endless mode is fairly good but it feels like a bit of a grind at times. Story/Campaign is the cheesiest thing ever and needs a bit of work, however I definately reccomend this game, especially at a nice, comftorable price of £4			"

Fighting with each monster is enjoyable, and once you will learn all of ""tricks"" it will be easy ride. Getting new stuff and leveling your stats is also easy. Too bad there weren't more fights, or something that could make you play this endless mode longer than few times.

												 Well, this was a surprise. In this game, you play as an undercover human on an all-monster boxing tournament. Think Punch-Out against D&D monsters, with a hefty dose of character advancement (you earn money in fights, which goes to buy equipment and stat enhancements). The game's pretty fun, well written, and looks and sounds great. It's also got buttloads of charm. It's a bit on the short side, but there are a few modes to play through once you're done with the story. If the premise sounds like something you might enjoy, well, go for it. Really enjoyed this one.			"

												A little gem steam has to offer. Never even knew this game existed to be honest but in the end it was a great game. Did not take me long to complete the game on the hardest difficulty but the style and music are great and actually made me want to play it. Great game			"

												I really liked the game. Reminded me a bit of Punch-Out! The story is simple, but kinda cool, and the main character is a woman. :)			"

												I picked up a copy of this game through one of the indie bundle sale, I grew up around boxing and I'm also a big fan, hence I did not hesistate to try this game out. So fellas this is one of your casual fun games which can pass the time specially if your into boxing and can appreciate it's form. The characters are a laugh and the story line is also fitting, It's more on the comical side which makes this game fun/funny. If you can get this game for cheap then I don't suppose why not.			"

												One of my personal favorite games is Punch Out! for the Wii. I like the style and the humor, the visceral gameplay that manages to be simple, engaging, challenging and immensely rewarding while demanding very little time. This is basically the same game, with character building mechanics, more complicated skills, a greater sense of humor for the characters, more imagination for the world, and a funny, fun story. The difficulty is up a notch right from the begining, and the game got me ducking and weaving in the first round. If you've played Punch Out, you'll know the basic mechanics, but there are enough new things here to make this the better game. Now if I only could get it to take the Wii-mote support, I'd have an awesome little workout!			"

												Swords, guns, sword-guns; these are the weapons that countless fantasy-world protagonists have wielded, but do you know what a truly brave hero wields? Nothing but their own two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fists (beneath padded gloves as per beast boxing regulations).This is the world of Beast Boxing, where newcomer and secret human Char must train herself to win against a dozen other fearsome monsters, including: a ""Fitness Skeleton"", a pig in a Santa costume, and a turkey. The game is short, lasting about 2 to 4 hours worth of gameplay, depending on how much you grind or repeat levels. Likewise, the game only has a dozen stages/opponents, which are reused for the game's endless mode. However, this is reasonable considering the game's base price of CDN$5.49Plus, if you consider the gameplay, then this game is well worth the price! Every match in this game is a punchy haha fast-paced slugfest where quick reflexes and thoughtful movements are necessary for an assured victory. The sensation of jabbing and strafing, seeking the right moment to unleash a flurry of fists, keeps every fight exciting. And as an additional bonus, the wacky art designs and quirky animations makes every fight visually amusing.This game is an appreciative nod to Nintendo's Punch-Out, and if you need quick sessions of boxing action to fill in the smaller gaps in your schedule, this game is an ideal contender. I give this two boxing gloves up, and eagerly await the starting bell for this game's sequel!			"

												In Beast Boxing Turbo, You play as Char, A human boxer dressed as a beast to enter the beast boxing league. You fight through 5 leagues. Each league has 3 fighters. Which mean the total enemy you're gonna encounter in this game is only 15. This game isn't that hard. You can upgrade your stats, buy stuff to make your character stronger.I wish the game is harder and longer because this game is really fun. I'll give it 6/10.			"

												Story: BEASTGameplay: BOXINGGraphics: TURBOThis is a game where you play as a human girl from the slums who wants to break racial prejudice in monster-only boxing league. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW GREAT THIS PREMISE IS.Boxing. Monsters. You click buttons, and then your fists go punch punch, and then you hit the monsters and they make silly sounds. I could not possibly be any happier about this arrangement.While this game is not ambitious, the execution is awesome. Funny dialog, great monster modeling, bad♥♥♥♥♥skull armor upgrades, and enjoyable, if not very deep, arcade boxing combat. This is a great example of a successful game vignette -- it's brief, but everything provided is well polished and serves to explore the game's premise.I love this game. The three hours of game play reflects two complete story playthrough, mostly not by me. The first game was a hotseat game where I swapped out with a number of friends on each fight. The second playthrough was mostly one friend that decided to play everything again on hard mode. I am content with this experience as it stands, and probably won't ever play this game again, unless there's people to show it to.Atriplemonsterplus, am completely satisfied with this purchase.			"

												Fun, little game. While playing for the first time, you can reach the end very fast. But that doesn't matter, all of fun starts on higher difficult levels. Fighting with each monster is enjoyable, and once you will learn all of ""tricks"" it will be easy ride. Getting new stuff and leveling your stats is also easy. Too bad there weren't more fights, or something that could make you play this endless mode longer than few times. I doubt I will ever want to play this game again but for the time I spend with it, and with this low price (I recommend getting this game on sale) it was a good deal.			"

												This was a pretty good game. I bought it as part of a bundle way back and I figured I should give it a shot. I was pleased with what I got even if the main story is short. There is an endurance mode and game+ if you are intthat, but my lay time reflects a very leisurely playthrough on normmal difficulty.the game is basically a more barebones punchout. There is not much of a story but there does't have to be, so if you are looking for that classic boxig videogame experience, you can ddo no wrong here.			"
