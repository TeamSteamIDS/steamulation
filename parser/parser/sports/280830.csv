												Terrible terrible game, abandoned by the devs it seems and the game is a buggy mess. the game tries to emulate games like Sega Soccer Slam or Mario Strikers but fails horribly even for the cheap price.- full of bugs, many of them requires restarting the game.- unresponsive controls, terrible A.I. and horrible input lag.- sometimes goals won't count, sometimes goal kicks count as goals..etc.stay away from this game at all costs and do yourself a favor by playing your old Sega Soccer slam or Mario Strikers games (or at least use an emulator to play them).

												This recommendation comes with quite a few caveats. This game is basically a poor man's Super Mario Strikers. It's 5-on-5 (counting the goalies) soccer with environmental hazards and various special moves. It's fun in a very goofy way. The English seems odd, there are bugs (including a few frustrating ones that stop the match and force the user to quit or retry), and the AI could use a little tweaking. The developer is aware of some of the issues, but they haven't updated the game for months, so I don't think we're going to see any fixes. Overall, it's fun, cheap, and goofy, so it might be worth your time and money.			"

												The world could use a few more good arcade sports games that don't take themselves too seriously.This game, with its hard-coded ""PUSH THE [A] BUTTON ON YOUR GAMEPAD"" pop-ups, non-rebindable keyboard controls, thirty seconds of unskippable developer credits at the start of each launch, GUIs that don't recognize mouse input, tedious and thoroughly uninteresting ""story mode"" (literally nothing more than matches against progressively-harder teams), wretched music, and a bland lack of personality wherever you look (from the Extremely Generic Font™ right down to the sudden, jarring way the games just... end... when time expires) - is not it.It's competent in places, but really not worth actual money.

												This is a okay game. The art style fits what it's advertizing and it's just a soccer game. The nice thing about it is the really low minimum requirements. The gameplay is simple, however it's STRONGLY reccomended to use a gamepad since most (if not all) of the menu is all xbox 360 buttons. One gameplay mechanic is the use of two round in one match. Each round is essentially a new game with about 3 minutes to score on each others. There are some bugs, when I shot the ball and it went in the net... it counted as a ""penalty shot"" not a goal. Other then that it's simple but not really worth the full retail price it's asking, get it on sale.			"

												I'm not a huge fan of soccer games because controls are often too tedious. This seems to be sub-par even to that. Maybe character control seems a bit random, AI too. The game looks nice but gameplay was mostly frustrating for me.Subjective: 3/5Objective: 4/5 — Graphics: A — Content: B — Handling: Bhttp://played.today/foosball.html

												Concept is nice but realization is not good.

												This is a highly entertaining little soccer game, and a fantastic 4-player couch co-option for a group of friends. The controls can feel a tad wonky and delayed at times, but it's not a significant detractor from what is, overall, supposed to be very light hearted and a bit ridiculous. You can usually pick this up in a bundle or heavily discounted from its already low price of $5, and I strongly suggest you do.			"

												This is almost a broken game...It is barely playable and feels like a early access game. After an hour, it stops being fun and all the bugs seem to appear twice as annoying. There is something wrong with about every aspect of the game, which is a shame because the game would have be really fun, and is if it's not buggy.A few problems it has:- The controls are clunky. Movement is not very responsive and sometimes buttons don't do anything or are significantly delayed. This is very fustrating and one thing that has lead to the game being bad.-The AI is terrible. Every now and then there is a match where it doesn't totally mess up but on average the AI is bad. For instance, one of the opposing players missed a goal, feet from my goal line, with the special move. In fact, the ball shot off at a 90 degree angle... This then lead to a goal kick?! Which makes no sense and leads on to another annoying bug. Sometimes you can score a goal and it be a corner, other times the opponent could kick it out (miss the goal) and it be a corner to them. The opponents are also the only people that seem to be able to cross it...-The interface is full of english mistakes. I'm assuming this was done by someone whose first language is not english, and there is nothing wrong with that, however if you are going to release a game in english at least make sure it's actually english. A lot of the terms are wrong, such as throw ins are called 'touch'?, goal kicks are 'penalty kicks', shots are 'shoots', dribbling is a button for special abilities and has nothing to do with dribbling and the list goes on. It makes the game feel very amatuer and like a really lazy translation.-The story mode is stupid. The story itself I have no problem with and the variation between opponents and teams is good, one of the only good things about the game however the way you have to progress is stupid. You have to collect a few stars (which are linked to the achievements) throughout the story mode, challenges that you can complete during the match i.e. score a total of 10 goals. Again that's great and another reason why this would be fun HOWEVER if you do not get all the stars you can not simply replay the match. You have to complete the entire story mode and then restart it from the beginning and play the entire story mode up until that point... The majority of the stars you can get in one go however one match requires you to win a match without any fouls as well as winning a match with 5 or more fouls, which means to complete that level you'd have to complete the whole story twice (assuming you can get them in one go, which is really hard due to the whole tackling mechanics being just as bad as the rest of the controls).There is barely anything that makes me want to continue playing and if I wasn't such an achievement hunter I'd have given up but I have to play through the story a few more times for the stars... Even at £4 this isn't a great game, I'd go as far as saying you shouldn't even really pick it up in a sale unless it's really cheap and you don't get fustrated easily. If this is in a bundle, I'd say get it but only if this isn't the best game in the  bundle...			"

												First of... do NOT buy this game.I've excepted a nice arcade soccer game like ""Super Mario Smash Football"". I've got a buggy game that has absolutly nothing to do with that kinda game. It's more like the dev's thought: A come on, lets make a copy of that Mario Soccer game from Gamecube. But let us forget that unimportant stuff like graphics, sound, gameplay, AI and that other useless crap.Pro- the idea, I like arcade soccer games- the Xbox360 controller worksContra- the graphics suck like hell, the game starts stuttering after 10 minutes of playing (I7, 8gb Ram, Radeon R290! oO)- the sound is terrible- the AI really really terrible, I don't think I have seen worse... and I'm a gamer since 22 years now.- there is no online multiplayer, why? with this one of the biggest fails would be pointless (the AI)- Story Mode? Pacman had a better Story Mode....I like indie games. But this is not one of the good one...			"

												There is potential in this game, but the controls are often buggy. I bought this to play local coop.

												Foosball Street Edition  .Foosball Street Edition is a game that I did not like it at all.It is a game with a foolish concept more than reused. In my opinion , there is a very low amount of football games that change the nature of the game and are still successfull. Foosball Street Edition  was not suceesfull. Gameplay : 30/100 - Very confuse. I do not understand what was going on and it just simply did not looked natural . I know it is supposed not to be natural , but still.. It is not satisfatory.Sounds :  45/100 - Very basic stuff. Not very appealing. Graphics :   45/100  - Still very basic stuff. I played similar games in my phone. In fact, they had better graphics and a more demanding engine.Overall I give this game a evaluation of 40/100 I do not recomend.			"

												Apparently this is based off a film, the game doesn't make it that clear but to be fair the occasional bouts of bad English in this game may've made that slip under the radar. Regardless since I don't know much about the characters as the game really just assumed I did with their quick and abrupt introductions, I couldn't really enjoy the story, the core gameplay is alright but with a few control issues for keyboard users. Can not speak for the controllers, overall the game is okay but not worth over a quid I'd say.			"

The AI is horrible. almost any shot from mid field goes in and you can dodge the AI as long as you want to setup your shot. Story mode is super short only about 90 min long and the mini games you unlock suck. I wont down thumb this game because I didnt hate it but it could have been so much better. get this in a bundle.
