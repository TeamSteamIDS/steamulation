												Out of the Park Baseball (OOTP for short) 17 is a text based baseball simulation.  It contains features for historical gameplay, single player gameplay, custom universe/leagues gameplay and online multiplayer gameplay.  The game allows you to take an active role in developing rosters and teams, or managing them.  This is done through being a General manager, a manager and even play as the commissioner(you are able to play all three at once, or any combination of the two).OOTP 17 offers new features over previous editions.  They now have full support from MLB and MLBPA(obtained through licensing), so you will have accurate rosters, faces(done through facegen models) and with no worries that they will disappear.  Simulation speed has been increased as the new code is allowing the use of multicore processors, which is a huge benefit.  The AI also has been enhanced to be smarter in how they draft players, manage players, and develop teams.  They will also make decisions depending on your goals and strategy.  These are just some of the major changes that OOTP has offered over previous editions.OOTP has one of the strongest modding communities around for sport simulation games.  The community greatly enhances the vanilla gameplay.  For instance, historical gameplay has accurate rosters, player attributes, statistics and settings for the era you choose to play(you can play from the grass roots of baseball, negro leagues, or any specific season).  You can choose to play it as a single season campaign or start a franchise and build your league from the 1880’s to whenever you choose to end(the starting point is up to you!).  The community also offers tools to develop uniforms and baseball caps, and there’s literally thousands already pre-made for you to use if you want to choose from them.The gaming modes available(and some of this is a repeat of above, I apologize), are single player, and multiplayer.  Single player modes allow you to play out single exhibition games with modern and historical teams.  You can play as MLB teams, which will have player accurate rosters and attributes.  You are also able to create your own fictional leagues, which is a massively popular feature for many players in the OOTP community.  You can start from any time frame, and you can customize the league to fit your needs or gameplay style(there are many sliders to adjust to your likings, and needs).  Regardless of the league, the game will track and keep a massive history of your statistics as your world/league develops.The game also features multiplayer gameplay where you can compete in leagues against others, which will put you against the most difficult of opponents(or easy, if they don’t know what they’re doing ;) ).  The league will track statistics as if you were in a single player franchise.  Many leagues out there have dedicated websites where you can follow the action of the league as it unfolds.  It is really a neat feature.The development team is very active and proactive in fixing bugs and glitches within their games.  You don’t have to worry about issues going unnoticed or fixed, and they are very open minded to additional features they may have fixed(as long as they are deemed reasonable of course).  The best way to suggest and fill out bug notifications is to use the main forums on their websites, which is ootpdevelopments.com .  The community is also very helpful in helping new players learn and teach players about the game(I myself have helped a few players learn the game of baseball and the workings of OOTP).In conclusion, after 2000+ hours of OOTP 16 gameplay, and 1200+ hours of OOTP15 gameplay, I can honestly say this is the best addition to the series to date.  I have never had a game give back so much in value then what OOTP has.  It is simply the best baseball simulation on the market(possibly the best sports simulation as well).  The game is very polished, and if you are a baseball fan, or a sports fan, I highly recommend that you take a chance on OOTP17.  You will NOT be disappointed.This game is a 10/10 for me.  I hope to see you on the field! Feel free to add me if you need any help with this game, or series!  I am always willing to help out new players get established in this great sports simulation!			"

												Do you like baseball?I didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.But then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. More importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.So - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)For those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.

												I bought OOTP 15 because it was £2 on offer because I like sport management simulators and played it for 50 hours without a clue about the rules of baseball, strategy or the league.  I deciced to buy OOTP17 because i was enjoying 15 so much and I now have over 200 hours spent on it as well as MLB online subscription to watch games.  Do not be put off if you have never watched baseball (for the non-US players), if you like sport simulators, building a team, analysing stats, managing wages and transfers and finding the next superstar then give it a go.  Beginners tip however, you need more than one starting pitcher......... "

												This is the first review I have written here on steam.I admit, I was a bit skeptical about this game at first.Part of me seemed like it might be boring and another part thought that it may be too complicated to get into. Though it did seem like it was unique and potentiall fun to play.I played baseball for 16 years up through high school and into college and coached for two years following that. I have to say the level of detail from every single aspect of the game is present in this title. I was astonished how the attitudes of the players could effect the teams just like they do in real life. That is just one example. THERE ARE SO MANY TINY DETAILS. It must have been painstaking to research and input all this information into the game.To top it off, I figured that the actual game simulations would be boring but nope, I was very wrong there. It brought back my old days of coaching calling the shots from the dugout or sending signals, trying to direct your team to a big win. I simply cannot say enough. I have been gaming ever since I can remember and I have never gotten into a simulator. If you enjoy baseball, you will love this game. If you kind of like baseball, you will love this game. Chances are even if you do not like baseball, you will love this game.			"

												The classic just keeps getting better year after year.For those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. If you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying ""but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?""  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  A must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)			"

												This is my first year playing OOTP and I must say I am very impressed with the game. Altho the mass amount of menu screens makes it look daunting, A few games in and it just gets easier to use and navigate. Currently it is spring training and after playing the first 5 games of the season on the game it really feels like baseball is back in real life. The detail and numbers that goes into this game is incredible! I will definietly be buying OOTP every year now. Great game and I strongly recommend it			"

												Former Microleague player, yea back in the mid 80's I started getting into that game. I had all the floppy disk and finally the editor so I could edit and add all the major league players individually, which I did.  Played a whole season with each individual team then.  I can tell you that was a lot of games I had to play and I loved every minute.  This is just to tell you how dedicated I was to simming a entire one season of baseball.  Then came Tony Larussa Baseball, and then OOTP, where I can sim entire season in one day instead of one year of my life.  Last OOTP I played was OOTP 11 which was  few years ago.  Enjoyed the game but it had a few faults in it, especially the not so friendly interface.   I haven't bought baseball sim game since, thinking my joy for the game had faded.  So you ask why I bought this game?  Well it peeked my interest from the high reviews I have read about it.  So I said to myself why not, lets see if we can spark that old flame again.  It not only sparked the flame, it has caused a three alarm fire.  This game is going to be a classic.   It has surprassed any of my expectectations I had for it.The Quick Sim is now extremely fast because of the 4 processor support.  No more simming and waiting for few minutes, just a quick click and a few seconds delay and the day is done.   I love how technology has made it this easy, instead of the days of me individually going to play each game for each team. One thing I truely love and pretty much look forward to is the unique things that pop in a season.  Things can put your player out, not just basic injuries either.  You might have caused one of your players to be overworked one game, for example a pitcher.  That said pitcher you push him to his limits trying to get him a complete game and his arm figuratively falls off with a tired arm syndrome. So you loss him for few starts.   Stuff like that and players being suspended for fighting is all in this game. Also players age as years go by and you can see how this effects them on thier portrait.  Aging also has effect on how well and bad they play.  Like a upcoming player  starting to reach thier potential or a aging star fading away during his twighlight of his career.  There is soo much content in this game,  I am only skimming the surface of what this game has.If you want to be just a coach for minor league team, you can.  If you want to control every aspect of your franchise you can too.  The choice is yours,  if you want to relive your childhood and see your favorite heros from the past play, you can.  Having every authentic player from both minor leagues and majors makes this game so realistic.I am probably just babbling now.  But for me this game has been enlightening and has taken me back to when I was a kid and when I was playing Microleague,  I had wished a computer game just like this.  I mean some of the extra stuff they did to this game is stuff I never thought off back then, but boy I am enjoying each and every new surprise each day.Buy it if you love Baseball, buy it if you like micromanaging, buy it if your a strategy fan, buy it if you like history, and  buy it if you like gaming.  This is just a game, but its more then game.  If you get my meaning.  This is the Best and I mean ""The Best Sim Game"" out there bar none.			"

												  I've now put quite a few hours into OOTP 17 now since buying it in July so I can now fairly give a review and also compare to last years OOTP 16.  First thing I noticed different from last year was the design and colors of the screens. Much better imo and easier to read. Something else that is much improved over last years game is the trading. You can actually now make a list of needs you are wanting so the computer makes more offers to you making the game more realistic in that area. Now I'm not saying the trades are easier to make, I still always get the they want two five star players for their 4 star and 3 star thing happening but overall this new function really adds to the game.    Now to just go over the game in general and not comparing to last years game. If you like baseball and sims you will absolutley LOVE this game. The options to starting leagues are never ending. There is almost nothing you can't make your league into with all the options given. You can base a league on current MLB seasons, historical MLB seasons. You can dump all the MLB players into a pool and draft them into new teams. You can start fictional leagues. You can decide on whether its an offensive league, pitching league or neutral league. You can start foreign leagues. It's endless.   The interface can be a bit tricky to learn to start but after a bit it starts to fall into place for you as things are designed well for the most part. My biggest complaint about the game is when setting individual player game strategies you can't always see all the players stats needed to adjust you strategies. Otherwise they have done a great job on making sure you can almost always find what you are looking for easily after a bit of practice.    I highly recommend this game to baseball fans and sim fans, you can't do any better than this game. If you are wanting to learn more about basebal I also recommend this game as well, so much can be learned while playing the game, it won't take long before you know you've improved your baseball IQ.

												Last week, I didn't know the difference between a bunt and a line drive. Being British, we aren't supposed to. But this game is phenomenal. I've been studying baseball all week because of it. Amazing work by the developers, so many choices, so much depth and so much addiction. Thank you. 10/10. I got it on the humble bundle and now feel a bit guilty I didn't pay full price. However, I will make that up to them on all their following releases!			"

												I've always been a fan of sports games. Not in being the rising star player in career mode, not in dominating my opponents online (because, being honest, that doesn't really happen) or in the now everpresent card collecting mode found in almost every sports game. I am, through and through, a franchise mode player. I love to build up my team, scout, draft and trade my way to being the next dynasty. It's doable in the console based sports games out there. Some do it better than others. OOTP Baseball gives a deeper dive into the shoes of being a GM and provides the most satisfying sports management experience I've found.I'll get this out of the way first. If you're looking to actually play a game of baseball, you should move on. The game is completely text based with outcomes generated by formulas. You are able to manage a game from ""10,000 feet"" if you will, but there is no playing a baseball game. This is not MLB the Show for the computer. This is about handling the front office functions of the team more than the actual playing of the game of baseball. I'll also say that if you're looking for a hardcore baseaball management sim, you probably know a fair amount about baseball. If you're not very familiar with baseball, you will probably get overwhelmed and should learn a bit about the management side of baseball beforehand. There's just so much to it that if you're coming in without a base of knowledge you'll probably be turned off. Losing a prized prospect to the rule 5 draft or not understanding service time and suddenly have a player hit arbitration and become expensive could easily ruin the experience when you're just getting your feet wet.If what you're looking for is a deep dive into being a GM of a baseball organization OOTP 17 is great follow up to OOTP 16. You can play in the real MLB as GM of a team, as the GM of a team in another real world league, or create your own baseball universe. You can run more than one organization, but you would have the same controls over each. If you play in the real MLB the game has full rosters with minor league teams containing the real life players and even top prospects for the upcoming drafts. Upon creation, the game world you want is customizable. From things like the size of the active roster and how many rounds the draft go to modifiers for how rapidly players decline as they age and swing and miss rates. There are pages and pages of options you can modify to make the game to your liking. Most of the settings are also modifiable in game if you find you don't like a particular setting, though it's best to modify them in the offseason otherwise you can run into issues. You can also play as just a manager, or running a minor league team, or work your way up, but everything short of GM + Manager is just a restriction on what you can do.Once you're actually in game it functions like a browser, with various tabs and subsections you can navigate to manage your team or see what's going on around the league or even in other international leagues. You manage your major league roster and minor league farm teams. You set your scouting budget and priority as well as review international free agents as they are discovered by your scouts. Set ticket prices, work to make your team's owner happy and balance your budget while fielding a competitive team. The list would go on for quite some time. It's baseball. You're in charge of a baseball team. Rule 5 drafts, arbitration, player postings, PED usage suspensions, it's all there unless you turn it off in the customization tab at the league creation.There is a very in depth system for managing your roster with scouting reports not only on a player's ability and future potential, but also on things like their personality, leadership ability and work ethic. This system is in place for all players: majors, minors, amateur draft and international. Going through the amateur draft you'll look at a player who looks like he has off the charts athletic ability, but poor work ethic and would be a bad teammate versus a player that looks like a solid, above average player who is a hard worker that could become a leader in your clubhouse. Those decisions have an impact down the road. Team chemistry or a leaderless clubhouse can have an impact on your team's ability to perform and desire to play for your team like losing do. It's like the real world. When you're winning, things look better. Losing, worse. Good teammates make things better. Bad ones, worse. You need to figure out how to field a team that works, not only on the field but off.Along with team performance you have to manage your finances. Each team has a market size, fan base loyalty and stadium capacity that are bases modified by fan interest and attendance which go hand in hand. Each team has a floor of a national media contract along with local media contracts, but the major differentiator from team to team is game attendance. If you field a bad team with no big name players, people won't show up and you won't have the resources to improve your team. Winning and player popularity play a major part in your team's finances through boosting ticket sales. As players are in the majors longer and do better they become more popular, and people want to show up to watch them. You will most likely develop most of your big name players in house, but signing big name free agents or trading away big names on your team will change fan interest. Losing minor leaguers can have an oddly large impact on fan interest. I remember one season in particular where I let five minor league players who were late round draft picks that never made it above rookie ball walk and my fan interest dropped 12 percentage points. It made no sense.There are also random events factored into the game like would happen in real life. I have yet to see anything exciting happen, like a league expansion. What I've seen have been things like lengthening the time of DL stints. The mundane, every day stuff that actually happens. Maybe someday I'll see that league expansion I'd be so excited for, but so far nothing.While the game is an amazing sports management sim, there are a few issues in the game. As a note all of this is with the default settings. I wanted the real deal of managing a baseball team so everything is with the default settings. International trades are a bit arcane. Some leagues are willing to trade players or post players, but others are not. There isn't any explanation or guide in the game as to why.The game, like every other sports sim, can be gamed. It's not hard to trade up to get both the first, second, third and sometimes fourth overall draft picks, though the rest of the draft will be pretty thin to nonexistent for you. Minor league players, or even players almost to arbitration will sign ridiculous long term contracts. In the end, it's not such a terrible thing. You want to be able to be amazing. It is, after all, your world so figuring out the tricks and being a perennial world series contender is fun. It is a little unrealistic, but you play and you build an amazing team, one that you built and one you take to the world series.There are a number of improvements over OOTP 16. AI controlled teams are no longer willing to give up prized prospects for a pile of mediocre. The AI is also better at managing its finances. No longer are all AI controlled teams chronically running in the red. The rate of decline in players is also more varied and feels more realistic. No longer is it someone's arm falling off at 32. Young promising players will fizzle out after a season or 2 sometimes and some players will have a slow decline over years allowing them to go from perennial all-star at 30 to riding off into the sunset at 40. The game also touted adding dual core functionality for processing. It does better and worse in certain ways. There will be quite a few hang ups when scouting players and going into the various tabs			"

												This game has been on my radar for years. I've played a few sports sims (Football Manager series, Eastside Hockey, Front Office Football), all very good (with Football Manager being the king of sport sims).I hadn't followed baseball religiously since the 94-95 playoff lock-out. Not sure why, but just lost the love for baseball at that point. I've followed with a mild interest since then. Enter OOTP 17. Because I don't have a good grasp of the current MLB rosters, I decided to start a league in 1982. A year when I really started to love baseball, read every stat line in the newspaper, and collected baseball cards. A year that produced some of the era's best baseball players and brought back a ton of memories for me. Commissioner mode allowed me to put together a ball club of personal favorites. This game is deep and lots of fun. The immersion in this game is fantastic. The flavor text, the mounds of stats, the interactive playcalling, roster management....this game has everything I could have dreamed of in a baseball sim.Yes, the graphics could be better. I'd love to have the option to add additional sounds to the game...BUT, those are minor gripes.At the end of the day, this rivals Football Manager in many ways. The only area it doesn't, is the 3D presentation. But again, this is such a small thing for me, because the flavor text is so dynamic and well written. Thanks, OOTP team, for bringing back some great baseball memories and renewing my interest in baseball.			"

												I have only played OOTP baseball since OOTP 15, but this year, just like last year's, is even better. Pros: Great community. Rarely do you see a 'do a search dumb azze' response. Even if the question is asked a million times. You can choose how much immersion you want. You can control almost every detail of the game. Yes, this can have drawbacks, and from my personal experience, I wish I would have let the AI control more when I first began playing. But now, I like having almost full control and then letting the stats and RNGesus determine everything else Constant bug fixes throughout the year. Obviously this game just came out, but Markus and the gang are always adding features and fixing bugs. Really, too many pros to nameCons The game will let me cheat and pick Pedro whenever he is available for the draft. To be fair, he is the only player I will do this for. And to be fair, we would all cheat to have Pedro.  I have learned a lot about confirmation bias. Which has led me to realize I may have other flaws as well. Hey OOTP, I don't need to be psychoanalyzing myself. I just want to live out a dream of being a GM. But, this game is only 34.99. My shrink charges more, so I guess it cancels out. My shrink gives me benzos also. Any chance of that next year????In all seriousness, no real cons I can think of. I'm not saying they aren't there, but I don't want to say ""X"" is a con when I don't even have a solution.Also, to avoid the should I get ""OOTP or the Show"" types of questions I have seen the past couple of years, I will preemptively say they aren't the same types of games. Its not fair to compare them. I personally love them both. But, one thing OOTP does that the Show doesn't is truly upgrade from year to year. I'm not saying there aren't improvements with The Show each year, but that they just seem more minor. I highly recommend. This is a game that could easily cost more and still be worth it. And they don't have any competition (Yeah, I know what some are thinking, and no that isn't competition).  "

Out of the Park Baseball 17 is a sports strategy game where you can bring your very own baseball team to success. You can play both against bots or real people.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are a manager of a baseball team. You have to ensure that your team wins as much as possible by choosing the best prepared players and making the best moves in the game. If you know any other team management games or previous OOTP games, this one very similar to them, just with many improvements and added features.Pros: Clean Interface | I'm not a big baseball fan, but it was very clear what I had to do in the game. The menus look really nice and colourful, everything seems to be in order and the placement of all the options are really intuitive. Ease of Use | As soon as I opened the game, it offered to help me with everything I might need to know in the game. Most things in the games are well explained, just in case you don't know everything about baseball. You can open one of the official tutorials at any time if something is not clear enough in the game. I got a lot of useful information in this game since I'm not living in a country where baseball is very popular. Bug-Free Gameplay | I have not experienced a single bug in this game. I always encounter at least something, a typo, something a bit misplaced ... something. But not in this game. It's stunning since there is so much content included in this game. Performance | This year's edition of Out of the Park Baseball finally has support for multi-core processors, which obviously means better performance on most computers. On my computer, the game was running without any performance drops at all times. Loading times were very short (sometimes, I wasn't able to read the text on the loading screens, which made me a bit sad, I confess) and there weren't many loading screens at all, so pretty much all the time dedicated to this game went to playing it, not waiting for it to load. Multiplayer Support | I find it really impressive that you can also play this game with other players. I always thought that such games were meant to be more single player, but it seems like multiplayer support actually fits the genre perfectly. I mean, sports is about competing with others, isn't it? If someone doesn't believe that the game is not cheating and rigging the game, playing against real people is most certainly fair. Supports Linux and MacOS | You can also play OOTP 17 on Linux and MacOS. I heard there are some issues with the Linux port, but it only occurs for some people. Frequent Updates | Developers of this game often release updates that bring new content and fix bugs and glitches. It's good to see a developer paying attention to their game, even though they release a new major version every year anyway.Cons: Pricing | I know some people are willing to pay a lot for such games, but I still think that $40 is a bit too much for a game like this. I know that a lot of work went into it, but I just don't think that this price is justified. It's fun, it has a lot of content, but just not enough for the price. GTA V is often discounted to a price below $40 and it's well worth its money, which is something that I can't say for this game. Sadly. Replayability | I'm going to say something that a lot of people won't agree with, but I'm going to say it anyway: the game is fun for some hours, but then it kind of lost its charm for me. I am not going to blame it on the game, it's probably just because I'm not so used to baseball. So if you are into this kind of games and you know for yourself that you like The final verdict:The game is good, but the high price can be an obstacle when considering purchasing. If you have played any OOTP games before, you should know that this game is just like the old ones, but improved in many ways. If that is something you are willing to pay for, go for it. If you haven't played any previous games, you should consider purchasing it when it gets discounted. It offers solid gameplay and it can be quite fun and challenging at moments. I know people who spent hundreds of hours into such game so if you're one of such people, this might be a game for you.Although the price is an issue, I'm going to recommend this game as every game gets discounted if you wait for a little. Also, OOTP is a well-made game and deserves to be supported.With love,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												Ignore most of the review bombing on sites like metacritic, as most people probably haven't even played the game. OOTP 17 is probably the best and most in-depth GM sim I've played. Almost everything that'd you'd want in a sim is here: official MLB license, hundreds of years of historical data, fictional leagues that can be customized to perfection, option to either play your games or sim them, the ability to play in any other baseball league in the world, and more. It's a niche kind of game, but if you have any interest in baseball or even sports management sims in general: BUY THIS GAME.			"

												OOTP17 is a great baseball sim, but if you like using add ons, DO NOT GET THE STEAM VERSION. It's not crippled, but just doesn't allow you access to add ons which can enhance your gaming experience.The steam version forces you to use workshop central for adding add ons, but it only has a couple of add ons while the version bought directly from OOTP uses add on central which has a few dozen add ons. It's a shame that the developers created a different version of OOTP17 for steam users. Both OOTP16 versions used add on central. Next year I will no longer buy OOTP from steam because of this.The steam version of OOTP17 still plays fine, but you can't do as much with it if you had the version sold directly from OOTP development and that's a shame. I hope that they change this next year.			"

												Best sports simulation game out there. But I cannot play the game. After weeks playing my Chicago Cubs to its first title since 1908 (we were almost there!), the game started to crash at load screen. for no aparent reason. ""Error 41"". Zero support from the developers. Be carefull in buying this - it does not matter if this is the best game if it could not be played.Edit: I am altering my recommedation to positive. After a few days (four or five days), the OOTP support team contacted me and solved the problem. They are a not so big team and I understood the time lapse between my ""support ticket"" and the solution. The problem was not solved by Valve, but by the OOTP team.It continues to be the best sports simulation in the market - but now I can play it again!			"

												I never thought a text-based simulation could be this fun. This game has unlimited replayability. You can start at any point in the history of baseball. Whether you'd want to start in todays league, go back in time and pick Pedro Martinez and Barry Bonds in the amateur draft, or start from the very beginning in 1871, you can do that. To make each game more unpredictable, storylines are added so players can miss games for anything under the sun. I have 50 hours raked in the last week, and you'll take time out of your schedule to play this game. I rarely buy games for full price, and I'd buy this even if it was twice as much as the $40 list price. Even if you don't like baseball, this game is a must have.			"

												This simulator is awesome. I'm hugely obsessed with both baseball and statistics, and this game has tons of both. It's extremely costumizable and has a huge and accurate database of players from this season and over a nearly a hundred previous seasons. That's just incredible. If you like statistics and being able to act as a GM/Manager, this is he eprfect game for you. The game gives you cotnrol of so much stuff, so it keeps you busy and entertained.			"

Don't let the depth and complexity of the game put you off, watch the tutorial videos to get an idea of what to do and if it all still seems too much for you the game setting can be modified to allow alot of the managerial tasks to be handled by AI.Go Jays!

OOTP 17 is most likely the best sports sim/manager available on steam, and well anywhere really.Its the best sim ever I think. I  logged soooo many ours in to ootp 16, and I believe that trend will continue ;).Out of the Park Developments is an amazing company.

												I do not know jack sh*t about baseball. That being said I love spreadsheets and micromanaging. I also love simulator games.So I thought why not, I will give this a try, and I picked it up in a Humble Bundle. Also if you do not know what Humble Bundle is, stop reading this review and check it out. Seriously. So all of that back story aside. I would give this game a 4.5/5. It is damn near perfect. I think the only way they could make it better would be by having more in game tutorials or explantions of what the hell all of these stats meant. So be prepared to watch some really boring and drawn out youtube videos. That is acutally a big problem for me they don't even have the videos in game, you have to have a second computer or phone ready to go if you need to watch a explation. Mind you the explations on their Youtube video are good, but still come on, it is 2017 lets get it in game.That being said, if you also like editing your team to be like Gods, you can also do that. This is not particularly hard or difficult. You have no real control in the actual individual games themselves.			"

												I've been playing these types of games since Tony Larussa Babeball 2, and this is the best I've found.  It still contains many of the same glitches as previous versions (JIM UNKOWN anyone?), but I have noticed a few subtle improvements.  It takes a bit more finese to rake the AI over the coals in a trade.  Contracts, especially for rookies, more closely resemble real life.  My biggest pet peeve, figuring out how many staters to use in a rotation as my historical team progresses through the eras, isn't an issue anymore.  Let the hours I have spent playing OOTP 2016, stand as a testament to this product.  2017 is more of the same, updated and refined.			"

												Way back in the Commodore 64 era, I remember spending hours creating custom rosters for Microleague baseball, mostly comprised of me and my friends with comically high ratings.   We'd gather around the screen, taking on the legends of the game, arguing about who got to hit the button next and making fun of the one member of our group who was 'only' hitting .560.    I bought this game in a fit of nostalgia, hoping to recreate a little of that magic.   I've been pleasantly surprised so far; this game brings the magic like David Copperfield after a Barry Bonds smoothie.  You may initially be overwhelmed by the numbers of screens and info thrown at you, but the user-friendly interface makes it very easy to control.   You can do as much, or as little, as you'd like.  If you wish to rule the world, make yourself Commissioner and have a hand in everything.  If you'd like to earn your way to the top, start as a manager for the Brevard County Manatees or some other minor-league team.  Go back in time and GM the Yankees in the 70's and 80's for the sheer fun of hiring and firing Billy Martin.  OOTP is clearly not a graphics-driven, but anyone who played Microleague back in the day will appreciate the 3D presentation of the individual games.  I refuse to sim because I'm having so much fun playing each game.  But if you're more into the long-term, sim entire seasons in minutes.  This game is whatever you decide to make it.It's not perfect; the trade AI is a hot mess which seems almost impossible to reasonably deal with, until they make you an offer out of nowhere that is so good that you never would have thought to make it yourself.   And I can't seem to get my manager to pull pitchers when I'd like, no matter how I fiddle with their settings.   Overall, this game is just plain fun, provided you're into baseball, simulations, or reliving childhood fantasies.  While I'm no longer putting myself on rosters with inflated stats, I'm now undertaking something just as unrealistic; making winners out of the 1980 Mets.  9/10  "

												I went to a game recently and wanted to cheer on an opposing player simply because I had him on my team in OOTPBaseball 17. I second guess every move any front office makes and question why I'm not acting GM and manager for almost every team in baseball. I have an addiction and it's definitely this game. I played an outrageous amount of time with OOTPBaseball 16 and 17 only improves on it in every way, especially how my players can grow mustaches/beards and their team pictures shows them steadily get angrier when they're on the bench because Felix Pie somehow made a miraculous return to baseball and finished 4th in MVP voting. 10/10 and always look forward to playing it.

												When I play a baseball game I NEED it to do certain things. I need strikeouts and walks to be in line with real life - I need ugly fielding errors that cost games. I need everything that makes baseball - well baseball. All of that requires a certain level of patience and commitment. And that's why besides when I didn't know any better when I was a wee lad - Ive only played statistical simulators like OOTP. Console baseball games for the most part are catering to segment of populaton who only wants to play glorified homerun derby. More power to them - I'm not here to deny them the fun they seek.But if you desire the same which is ultimately realism - check OOTP out. Its hard for me to imagine you will be disappointed.			"

												The most dependable product/developer in the business.  I have played since OOTP10 or so and they never fail to improve the game without taking away from the core experience with every release.  Whatever your baseball fantasy is, be it as a Manager or General Manager/Manager playing current seasons, replaying past years, rewriting history, or creating a whole fictional baseball universe... you can do it here, and they are all addictively fun ways to play.  The addition of the MLB license is a well deserved honor for the franchise and will likely allow the already prolific modding community to get even more creative.  My personal favorite addition this year though is the inclusion of historical minor leagues.  Remember that soon to be nobody you idolized when you went to watch the local minor league team, that guy who never even got a cup of coffee in the bigs?  Well he's included.  Not just recommended, highly recommended.			"

												Wow, I'm new to this game. I love no other sport like I do baseball. I find every detail interesting and have friends that I could talk to about baseball for hours. I downloaded this game because it was on sale, there seems to be a learning curve to it but i can say that it would be a fantasy job working with baseball managers, much less as a manager. I have logged less 24 hours so far, but it was intersting. I didn't do so well on the one season I played as the Red Sox manager for last year. While the Red Sox in real life did much better without me managing for them, I can say at least I beat the Yankees. Maybe I dedicated more time to those games. Where other teams, I just let them run until I got to a game that I wanted to control every at bat.If you like baseball, and like text based type games, then you might be interested in this. I would recommend it as I had more fun playing it than many other videogames.			"

												On the outside looking in, someone who's never played OOTP and is used to simulating Franchises in MLB The Show might be disappointed by how it looks. And they're correct - most text-based games rarely give off an esthetic appeal. This game is one giant exception.While you can easily simulate in The Show, OOTP offers something beyond that. An intense and intricate look at the life of a GM or Manager. Every small detail is present and history actually matters in this game. Everything goes at turtle speed. Playing as a GM and only looking at surface stats, it'll take you anywhere from 8 to 10 hours to simulate a full season. You're obsessed with the finer statistics and you're really combing every team to get you that reliever that will give you the impact you want in the playoffs? Or you're trying by all means to liquidate assets in order to retrieve money to offer an extension to one of your players? Say goodbye to your social life. This game will suck you in and totally make you feel like every insignificant decision is a franchise altering decision. Out-freaking-standing.10/10 with extra gravy.			"

												If you're like me, and you've always played Franchise Mode in sports games but preferred the trading/drafting/etc to playing the actual games, then OOTP is perfect for you. There is an insane amount of depth, which could be overwhelming...except you can autmomate whatever tasks you dont want to deal with or assign them to your coaches, basically allowing you to make the game as deep, complex, and involved as you would like. If you do prefer to be hands on, however, you have an absurd amount of content at your fingertips. Games can be automated batter by batter, inning by inning, or just skipped/automated entirely. A crazy amount of players to draft and develop, including International League players. Very detailed and realistic in ways that most sports games are not (for instance, it is not uncommon for a high draft pick to refuse to sign with the team that drafted him, allowing him to re-enter the draft pool next season).Insane amount of customization.Great attention to detail, enjoy the flavor text and play-by-play.Realistic player development. A seemingly can't-miss prospect can end up being a bust without the proper coaching, playing time, if they're rushed through the minors too quickly, etc etc.. On the other hand, a seemingly average prospect can end up being a stud under the right conditions.Absolutely recommended for anybody who prefers the GM and coaching aspects of sports games.			"

												Like a good hitter, OOTP  doesn't do anything revoluionary different but refines its approach every year to stay at the absolute top of the baseball simulation game genre,  This year they've added, among other things completle and accurate minor league systems from 1919 onward. Bringing alive baseball's rich history is something this game corners the market on. Of course it's also great to play along with your favorite team in modern times  or find an online league and test your GMing skills against real people. If you're a fan of the cerebral side of the most cerebral sport you simply owe it to yourself to try this game. "

												I got this in a Humble bundle and was like:WOW!This game is soooo tecnical and detailed it hurts.Its the equivalent of a pure strategy game, like iron hearts 4 but in sports. It reminds me a lot of the football manager series. Although I could happily play iron hearts, I was never able to get any fun from football manager and this one falls under the same predicament.Is it a good game in its genre?

												OOTP17, Markus and his team made another baseball world wonder.  The first version of animated 3D players are so sweet to watch, you will get attached to them. Over 150,000 players included, start any year you want now it will include all the affiliated minor teams of all MLB teams.  Just awesome, can this game get any better? Well it those every year and #17 doesn't disappoint .  My usual words of warning: THIS GAME IS EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE.Nice 3D parks included.  Loads of improvements with of course a long list of new features.  Don't miss out on the fun, get this gem of a game now!10/10  Best supported game on the planet!PS.  I have over 1100 hrs logged with OOTP 16.  Enjoyed every minute.			"

												If you are a fan of intricacies of baseball, a fan of managing players, teams and organizations then this is the game for you.  If you want to play out the current season to see if you can do better than your team's management, you can do that.  If you want to experience the likes of Ty Cobb, Lou Gehrig and Ducky Medwick, you can do that. Play out the 1919 world series and see if the Reds can pull off the win without the Black Sox selling out.  You can even see how JR Richard, Steve Carlton, Roy Halladay, and Bob Gibson would fair against Ruth, Gehrig and Williams.  If you just like the idea of managing your own dynasty and writing your own history you can create your own fictional baseball universe where only you get to know the players.  You can do all this in a solo game but you can take it to the next level by either starting your own or joining one of the many online leagues where you can compete against other baseball geeks.  It's your game and you play it however you wish.  Besides the intricacies and nuances of the game you get every player that has played in the MLB along with over 150,000 real minor league players and they all come with the game, no season's to buy.  Best sports simulation that I have ever played from a small company dedicated to making it the best that it can be.  I can't recommend it highly enough.			"

												I've been playing this game since OOTP Baseball 9 came out.  It's not just a realistic and fun game.  It has actually taught me a ton about the game of baseball - minor leagues, Rule 5, the draft, the CBA agreement - things I never knew about or cared about.  Glad that Markus and gang continue to improve the product every year.  The game can be played in so many ways - with a real MLB roster, an historical roster, a fiction league that you can customize to your hearts content.  You can play solo, or online.  It's really up to you.			"

If you've ever though you could do better than yor team's real life GM, then this is the game for you.

												Where do you even start when talking about Out of the Park Baseball? This is now the second edition of the game I have played, and this game easily tops what was given in OOTP16. A note to those who are new to the series, the game is a baseball management simulator with insane amounts of depth and detail. It allows for customization of just about any rule you can think of, and allows to you Manage or GM your favorite MLB team or a team in a fictional league you make yourself. And a note for those who have played an OOTP Baseball game before, this game is definatly worth the upgrade. The new features, ranging from the greatly improved 3D Ballparks to the MLBPA License, give the game an entire new feel and level of depth.Game is an easy 10/10 and I forsee myself easily playing 200+ hours of this game in the coming year.

												Disclaimer -- I buy OOTP directly from OOTP Developments. Although I get a Steam key, I don't install or play through Steam, hence my 0 hours logged. I assure you, starting with OOTP 14, I have logged countless hours playing OOTP: the greatest sports simulation known to man. If you love baseball but don't own OOTP, all I can say is, man, you are missing out. I knew of OOTP for years before I finally decided to give it a try with version 14. Once I got the hang of things, I could not believe I had put off playing this game for so long. This is literally the sports game of my dreams, and of any baseball fan's dreams. It is absolutely on my Top 5 Games I'd Take to A Desert Island list (...everyone should have one of those lists...)How anyone could give OOTP a Negative review is utterly beyond me. This is the deepest, most flexible and immersive sports simulation on the market, hands down. Deeper than Football Manager. The only thing I can think of is, perhaps the negative reviews think all sports games need to look like MLB The Show or NBA 2K. Those are great games in their own right, but OOTP is every inch a baseball game as ""The Show"" and then some. Since version 16, OOTP has been officially licensed by MLB, so anyone who avoided OOTP because it couldn't give you the ""official MLB"" experience offered by The Show, well, that problem has been put to rest. There is almost nothing you can't do in OOTP. Feel like GMing the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in the Nippon Professional Baseball League? Be my guest. Want to manage the Red Sox' AAA Pawsox affiliate? Go to it. Feel like skippering the 1925 New York Yankees and the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Bob Meusel? Have at. Feel like setting up a completely fictional league tailored exactly to your specifications? Why not. The depth and flexibility of OOTP are simply breathtaking. You won't believe it until you experience it for yourself.All that said -- yes, get ready for a learning curve. The game is DEEP. I've heard it described as the 'Dwarf Fortress' of sports games. (I've also heard Dwarf Fortress described as the OOTP of roguelike/simulations...)  The complexity and depth can be intimidating. But what amazes me is, OOTP is not just played by die-hard baseball fans. Plenty of players with little interest in baseball have given OOTP a try and gotten hooked. (The fact that OOTP is developed by a team of Germans tells you all you need to know about its broad international appeal!)  And there is no question you may have that you cannot get an answer to in the OOTP Developments forums -- there is an extremely knowledgable and dedicated fanbase there who are very happy to answer even the most basic questions about baseball and OOTP -- they are more than happy to welcome new players!TL:DR --  If you (A) love baseball, (B) love sports, and / or (C) love in depth immersive management games, don't overthink it:  BUY OOTP 17 NOW  !!!  Easiest no-regrets decision you will ever make.			"

												I want to preface this by saying I have played OOTP16 for over 200 hours, and gave it a glowingly positive review. Great improvement over OOTP16. The only issue I had with '16 was the slow sim times and overall lagginess of the game. It takes a matter of minutes to sim an entire season in '17, and I find myself spending 99% of my play time making decisions and playing the game rather than waiting for the game to load. The other major improvement I see is the ""needs"" you can set. It prevents all of those, ""I'll give you my 76 year old $30mil/yr first baseman for Chris Sale"" type trade offers you would get in previous versions. Now you get offers that are only in the area you want them to be in. I find myself accepting far more trades offered to me by the AI teams than last year.I suspect that the game has messed with many ""under the hood"" details as the progression of young players, AI evaluations of players (it seems like prospects are valued wildly different by teams), overall player rating changes seem to be much different in this version. However, take that with a grain of salt as I cannot confirm this is the case. If these changes did occur I like them quite a lot, and you can consider this another positive change.The only negative thing I can say about this game is the price. For me, the $40 is well spent for the faster load times alone. If you don't mind waiting, I would advise you to not purchase this version, as the changes outside of the performance boost don't warrant a full-price purchase. Overall, this version of the game had little tweaks, and a huge performance boost, along with updated 2017 MLB rosters. If you liked the previous version, you'll like the new faster version even better.			"

												With little time spent so far (but additional time spent in the pre-release Gold Master Beta) I can already see the significant improvements made in OOTP17 from last year's version. Having spent about 200 hours on a game that I wasn't sure was for me, I became an instant believer. With the 3D visualization added this year, plus the full MLBPA license and tons of historically accurate minor league rosters added this game has a ridiculous amount of depth for the serious baseball fan. There are so many ways to play it's hard to imagine tiring of it well after this year's World Series has concluded. If you have been afraid of statistical management simulators, please dip your toes in the water with OOTP17. I'm sure you'll soon take the plunge like I have.			"

												I decided to play historically, choosing the 1972 Texas Rangers.  1972 was their first year in Arlington after their move from Washington.  It was easy, with a game like OOTP 17, to get caught up in the nostalgia of the day.  OOTP is immersive, I felt like I could really make an impact and improve on what was a pretty dismal year 1 for the franchise.  OOTP feels like baseball.  The detail exists in every aspect of the game.  Every pitch, every decision, every trade, every move could be decided by me or by a fairly competent AI coach.  You can truly define your own space in which to play and your own way to contribute to your team's sucess.I would recommmend OOTP 17 for any sports enthusiast, anyone who loves a thinking game, and anyone that enjoys building baseball dynasties.  I has been a pleasure to play and far exceeded my expectations.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The only drawback is that the interface is not exactly user-friendly but it gets the job done and OOTP does provide tutorial videos/online manual links just before you immerse yourself into the game. If you're expecting ground-breaking graphics like the Show, you're in tough luck, but the amount of control and depth this game supplies users with is extraordinary. Perfect for the ultimate baseball junkie.Would recommend this to anyone. And yes, including non-baseball fans.

												It is as good if not better than its reputation. However, still room for improvement there is.Probably not very fair comparing it to Football Manager, but having played both games (FM for years), I have to say the user interface is sub par. Also, when playing FM, a simple tapping of the spacebar moves forward. But ootp doesn't have any keyboard shortcuts(apart from F1 which is HELP) and neither does it allow users to set them.(In case if it is only me who doesn't know where the feature is, I apologise.)Still, I'd recommend this game to anybody who loves baseball and longs to play a baseball management game.

												I do and do not recommend this game.  Hands down, this is the best organized baseball sim in the market with so much depth.  You can get lost in it for hours.  That said, they desperately need to improve online play.  Beating AI doesn't mean much to me.  I've played online baseball sims close to 10 years.  I really hope the developers see the value in online play and make it more stable and user friendly.  My friend and I run a league and we get so many technical headaches.  He's a web developer and I'm in the tech world too.  It shouldn't be such a challenge.A web based application would be ideal and would bring in a new customer group to OOTP.  So many of my old buddies from the sim world wouldn't even try OOTP because they couldn't be bothered using a program or they simply don't even have a computer anymore.  Tablets and phones rule the world today as evidenced by Intel's latest layoffs.Our league is running on OOTP 15.  I didn't see the need to make my members upgrade since zero has been done for online play.  I guess the file sizes are smaller now, so that's great for my limited bandwidth.  I did buy OOTP 17 and love it solo, but will not buy another OOTP product until I can easily and enjoyably play with my friends.			"

												I've always been a fan of ""Dynasty Modes"" in sports games. I love the feeling of seeing your team win the championship because of the moves you made. That is why I love this game. The amount of detail that was put into this game blows all other game's dynasty modes out of the water. There are multiple leagues of baseball for you to choose from. If you don't want to manage an MLB team then you can manage a Japanese team or a Korean team. That is just to name a few. If you want to just manage what your team does on the field then you can decide to be a manager. This lets the AI do all the team management, but you get to choose who plays. This game is addicting. I have had this game for about a week and already have 35 hours in it. Time goes by so quickly while playing.

												There's no deeper baseball simulation out there today unless you manage to get a job in a MLB front office. I've been mildly addicted to the franchise for years and this is another great outing but where it really excels is how the customization options allow for the creation of fantastic stories.  The forum on the OOTP website is awash with stories of baseball leagues incorporating the fiction of Fallout(complete with occasional deaths from radiation, drug addiction, and deathclaws), Tolkien(orcs make surprisingly good catchers), Star Wars(Wookie umpires, don't argue with them), or spurring users to create totally new(though probably derivative) fictional universes.If that appeals to you check it out, I can almost guarantee it'll be money well spent for a baseball fan.What follows is a brief story from my first OOTP 17 game. Relatively brief anyway.The universe is mostly ours but the major pro baseball league is the United Nations Baseball League featuring 32 teams, 16 in the Americas(North American Pro League-DH), 16 in the Pacific Rim(Pan-Asian Super League-No DH) each league features four divisions of four teams each, division winners make the playoffs. No interleague play because well the travel would be sort of ridiculous. I started with an opening draft where I'll be guiding my Perth Koalas as GM so I'm relying on the AI to handle the gameday management under manager Shugo Endo. Notable players include local boy Adrian Wall(1B), power hitting Jordan Najera(C), the 22 million dollar man Jesus Suarez(CF), the all-around excellent Alex Ozeguera(RF), and team leader Andy Varner(OF). Despite all those position players the real power is on the mound, where I spent our first three picks on starters Rickey O'Dowd, Mike Davis, and the great Canadian hope Willard Hayward, we also have one of the best closers in the league in Jose Reyes a 21 year old fireballer out of Cuba and a top notch setup guy in Ryan Nance. So that team sounds pretty good, what's the problem? Glad you asked. For starters this GM does not like his manager and most of these players have their own fatal flaws, such as defense Wall, Suarez and Najera would all be better suited to DH work, the guys I have to play defense to shore up these niggling issues like Varner cannot hit period. One of the great things about OOTP(sorry this probably belonged up top) is that you'll see two sets of players ratings, one regarding the view of the league at large and one for your scout's opinion, those two will start to converge, but with that opening draft I'll find myself wondering how much to trust my scout and how much his opinion differs from that of the league in general and I'll be repeating the process in amateur drafts. This is a problem for my Perth Koalas because Varner, our shortstop Davon Jones, and outfield prospect Freddie Kozak are among many players where my scout thinks they are way better than the league does. Luckily pitching cures a lot of ills and with 4 of our top 6 draft picks in the rotation O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward, and Darren Fyfe are cleaning up while fifth starter Frank Rosales is performing above expectations, it helps that Reyes is mostly unhittable and Suarez is playing like the best outfielder on our side of the Pacific. There are injuries to deal with but the first two months of the season sees us pulling away from our division rivals the Melbourne Emus, Brisbane Dragoons, and Taipei Liberty, competing with the Beijing Reds(amusingly because of the name the Reds initially were setup to play in the Great American Ballpark) for the best record in the PASL. Injuries popped up from time to time, but mostly involved our mediocre left field situation(starter Nick Bailey has a .302 OBP and his backup Kenichi Takeuchi hits .217) until the chaos started.A few relievers started to get hurt, annoying but something I can work around as long as the rest of the staff is healthy. The biggest issue was losing talented middle reliever Soetsu Tanaka for the season, but hey at least he isn't Nance or Reyes. Then Reyes blows out his arm, he'll need Tommy John surgery and the man had a 0.99 ERA at the time.Okay, going into June without 2 of our top 3 relievers, As long as Nance is still around and the rotation's intact. We keep on plowing through the PASL, seven all-stars O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward Suarez, Najera, Wall and our third baseman Johnathan Lugo. Our lead in the division is from 15-20 games for months, we are dominant. How dominant, well aside from the massive divisional lead for almost a month Najera and Suarez were in the top five in the league in homers. What I'm saying is that things are good Nance is filling in admirably for Reyes, my biggest problem is that my potential free agents want to be paid and for some reason they want to be paid in American dollars not Australian ones.Najera, leading the league in homers- 20 mil(currently making 10)Aaron Biles(2B) leading the team in average and OBP- 10 mil(currently making 1.4)Suarez(CF) best all around player and fastest man around- not interested doesn't like manager Shugo EndoThen actual problems started. In late July we lose O'Dowd, down for the O'Season. Which means I need more starters and Frank Rosales the initial 5 starter has been traded away because his personality description is literally 'Clubhouse cancer. The kind that gets managers fired' I'm not a fan of Endo, but with Suarez wanting out of Australia I need this clubhouse functional, this may very well be our best shot for a championship for years. The only counter to Rosales' disruptive influence is Varner and he's hovering around or below .200, so I shipped out Rosales for reliever Hideki Sato in early June. Now O'Dowd's gone and I could really have used Rosales right about now instead of an expendable middle reliever. Luckily the lead we've built up is so massive that it won't matter in the division, but in the postseason I wanted to be able to line up O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward, and Fyfe, now it's Davis, Hayward, Fyfe, and some random dude. That's an issue and it's late July so I have five days to look into a replacement. Nobody's available for a reasonable price, so I figure you can win with two and a half dominant pitchers, especially as long as Nance's healthy.In mid-September(after we clinched) Nance goes down for the season. Sato, that guy I got for Rosales in early June is our new closer and he has about a week to settle into it before the playoffs.We win the division with 93 wins, ending the season on a 7 game losing streak and in the process lose Nick Bailey the good left fielder and Ozeguera(RF hitting .298) picks up a nagging back injury that'll last a couple of weeks. Ozeguera can play but he'll be hampered. So we start the playoffs against the 92 win Yokohama Anglers without our best left fielder, best starter, 3 of our top 4 relievers, and with our right fielder constantly complaining about tightness in his back. This isn't ideal. To digress a little this is one of the things that makes OOTP great, in a game like XCOM if you lost that many major soldiers going into the endgame you might reload an earlier save or just start a new game, in OOTP you keep going because there's always another season and maybe just maybe our leadership crew of Varner(hitting .188), Sato(new to closing), and Endo(despised by our star CF) can hold it together and pull off a Grand Championship Series win.Davis starts game one and we immediately hand him a three-run lead, then the offense stops. Yokohama scores one in the seventh, eighth and ninth to tie. Sato's first save chance is also his first blown save. Unfortunately Endo has pulled Suarez, Wall, Ozeguera, and Najera so we don't have any offense left. In the eleventh both teams score two. It goes to the fifteenth before we win on a walkoff slam from Lugo(3B). Only 11 wins to go.If you read through all of this, sorry it's longer than I thought it would be, but I think you get what I'm saying.			"

												If you're looking for a baseball simulator, there's not many, but yet they've almost perfected it. They seem to choose their own terms at times for names of pitches and such, but they're easily googlable. Historic seasons to modern, the simulation runs deep. Very good game with to me a good interface. And for those annoyed that sometimes you pitch and 3 balls happen at once, there's a one-pitch mode and a pitch-by-pitch mode that change that :)			"

												I am a huge baseball fan, so I thouroughly enjoy this game.  The more casual fan would not be able to have the same fun as I did because of how much you actually need to do to run a baseball team.  It can also be EXTREMELY time consuming which is a blessing and a curse.  There is every feature you can imagine when creating leagues.  You can go from something as small as changing the day rules take effect in game, to something as broad as creating new teams.There are also enough new features added.  The interface is much cleaner and runs smoother.  There are also in game pictures (generated by the game) that add a little bit more to that realism.Overall, I love this game and plan to buy the next installment.			"

												The first one I had was OOTP 11... and this is not a whole lot different externally, but I have a feeling they've tightened up the trade logic and things like that internally. With 17 it's VERY hard to deal with the computer when trading and come out feeling like you really fleeced the other guy. Which honestly I'm OK with because that's a lot more realistic. So trade-wise it makes you work a lot harder than previous versions I think. The amateur draft also seems a little deeper to me - seems like the draft pool has more guys with higher ratings now - where as before you would look through maybe the first 2 rounds and then there'd be nothing left but 3-stars at the best. Now you have a lot of 4, 4.5 and even some 5-star's still left after like 10 rounds, mostly because their signing demands are ridiculous. Doesn't mean you can't sign them, but you really have to make sure you can handle what they're going to cost you.They've added a 3D game view when playing the actual games where the ball moves a little more realistically... but it's not designed to show the play with complete accuracy... for example, with a runner on 2nd, the ball might get hit to shallow Lt field and the outfielder will field it and quickly throw it to the cutoff but then the cutoff guy will hold it instead of sending it home even though by the timing of it it appears as if it would be an easy out at home if the ball were thrown in. Or when a runner steals second, the pitch will come in and the catcher will hold the ball for 1/2 a second before throwing - so the computer sort of determines the result of a play and the 3D view just accomodates that result irregardless of what the timing of the play really looks like with the ball moving. I still like it better than the 2D view though - especially for home runs - there's almost never a doubt that it's gone when the ball comes off the bat and you can see the shadow of the ball tracking on the ground. All in all, same good old OOTP - lots of hour-killing baseball management fun! And oh yeah one more thing - you can get FIRED if you don't meet the owners demands and/or are just sucking at putting together a winning team! So yeah, hasn't happened to me yet but honestly I think I might be close if my current team doesn't get it done this year hehe... we'll see!So if you've owned previous OOTP versions and liked them or if you're just looking for an ultra-deep baseball management sim, I highly recommend OOTP 17. Pretty much everything you could ask for IMO.			"

												OOTP 17 is a great baseball sim. You get to play with your favorite team while acting as a GM, Manager or both. I like that both the authentic emblems and the authentic major and minor league system rosters are intact. The simulation between days or games is a quick process. What I would like for the game is the upgrade in ball placement around the field. The statistics for defense should be more of an accurate read on the game. And, the 3d view should show more of an detailed improvement. Overall I think this game is a good buy both for those baseball fans who love moding their teams from top to bottom and casual fans who like to have fun as a GM, Manager or both.			"

												This review falls into the ""great game, but ... "" category.I played a ton of OOTP about 10 years ago. Created a custom league, played a dozen or more seasons, and LOVED IT. Spent a lot of time on their forum, and enjoyed the community. Sure, there were some minor problems with the game, but they were just that -- minor.I've kept an eye on the title since then, knowing that sooner or later I'd be back for more. The recent mid-summer sale was the final bit of incentive I needed. I took the plunge and bought OOTP 17.All the new stuff that's been thrown in during the last decade looks damn cool. Problem is, the entire thing seems to be a house of cards. I played 7-8 historical games, and had some problems that took away a lot of the fun. For instance, when starting a new game, and trying to decide on lineups/batting order, the damn game won't show me statistics for one of the teams. (And yes, I've set it to ""human"" control for both teams.) All I get are a bunch of zeros in the stat categories, no matter how I toggle the display.Then there's the play-by-play itself. Very frequently (several times a game), the animation will show a ball hit to one side, while the text pbp tells you someone on the other side of the field made the play. Talk about losing that feeling of immersion.And now the last straw. The third time I tried to open the game, it refused. Turns out this is a fairly common problem, but none of the fixes I found online worked for me. I could keep trying, or wait until the developers work it out (because I'm sure they will, eventually). But there are just too many glitches in the product at this point for me to invest more time in it. Even if I could get it running again, I'm not going to take the chance of getting halfway through a season (or through several seasons) before some other fatal flaw rears its head.Love the game and what the developer is doing. Not willing to pay for a product with these kind of problems.			"

												Picked this up with the current Humble Bundle - figured it was worth trying out the sports management sim genre. I know nothing about baseball, but this is the most insanely complex simulation I have ever encountered. Baseball is a game with a lot of stats, and this has every historical league from 1871 to the present day, with the performance stats of 100,000+ actual players. The detail level is crazy. You can almostfeel the rumbling of gigantic gears beneath your feet as the simulation factory churns all this data as you play. It really is quite impressive. Pick it up if you've ever considered this kind of thing, and be prepared to stare at it somewhat dumbfounded for a while.			"

												I played the hell out of this game, then took a break.  when ootp18 came out, i decided to pick it up again.  i dont know if there was an update but this game is hella flakey now....1st, its a good thing you can edit your players or you would never get any hits.2nd, my complaint originally was that they turn an inordinate amout of double plays...that is still a thing.3rd, and maybe the most frustrating...they get way too many in-field hits.  whether its due to errors caused by my players or just a slow, lobbing throw, they get too many where as my players dont get any.  in a recent game, they got an in-field hit when the ball was hit to first base....yet somehow, still safe.4th, the errors are off balance.  ive played 1/4 of a new season and average an error a game.  i think my opponents have one all together.5th, pitcher stamina makes no sense.  on 5 player rotation my guys are always tired.6th, in-fielder decision making is off...if the ss gets it, why would he throw the man out at first when he clearly has a chance for a double play.  this happens a lot..individually, these issues may not seem like a lot but, overall it makes for a frustrating gaming experience when your guys are doing things that dont make sense...or when you need just one more out and the opponent gets yet another in-field hit...or your team gets an error....i know this is a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥ing but something has changed in this game.  overall it is still deep and fun, but issues like the above almost make it intolerable.  at this rate, i think id take your chances with ootp18 and hope they got the bugs fixed.

												I just recently got interested in Baseball and was looking for a good video game. A friend of mine recommended that I check this out because the level of detail would help me learn about the game and boy was he right. I've played other baseball games and this blows them out of the water. It's not your usual game where you try to use the controller to hit or pitch to the point it's all about your ability to mash buttons. This game really embraces the thinking aspect of baseball that often gets overlooked. I could not recommend this game enough. I will warn you that the learning curve is kind of steep, but thankfully the OOTP Development website is stocked full of useful information.One interesting example of how this game models baseball so well is that I decided to start a game as Commissioner and GM and picked one of the lowest ranking teams in MLB. I thought it would be fun to stack the team with all the best players from around the league and enjoy the fun of offering low level prospects for superstars and then force the trade. There was just something fun about fleecing some of the best teams of their star players. Once that was done I expected to just run away with the season. Boy was I surprised. Even when simming a game I found myself barely above .500. I had to go back and retool my team because while I may have had bats made of fire that launched balls into the parking lot, my defense was a open as a the US border and let just about everything through. This game taught me that there is more to baseball than just star players, there are subtle tactics that only true disciples of baseball ever really see. With what I've learned from this game I started looking around the real league and suddenly Managers choices started making a whole  lot of sense.			"

												I've played OOTP since 2015 and I would've played it a lot sooner had I heard of it. For such an amazing series, arguably my favorite sports game and favorite sim ever, it needs more recognition than what it has right now. It's everything you could ask for in a sports simulator, and if you've always wanted to just manage a team and not have to worry about playing than it's perfect for you. The most realistic experience you can get with a sports game and the best simulator I've played by far. I'd recommend it to any baseball fan.			"

												I played the hell out of this game, then took a break.  when ootp18 came out, i decided to pick it up again.  i dont know if there was an update but this game is hella flakey now....1st, its a good thing you can edit your players or you would never get any hits.2nd, my complaint originally was that they turn an inordinate amout of double plays...that is still a thing.3rd, and maybe the most frustrating...they get way too many in-field hits.  whether its due to errors caused by my players or just a slow, lobbing throw, they get too many where as my players dont get any.  in a recent game, they got an in-field hit when the ball was hit to first base....yet somehow, still safe.4th, the errors are off balance.  ive played 1/4 of a new season and average an error a game.  i think my opponents have one all together.5th, pitcher stamina makes no sense.  on 5 player rotation my guys are always tired.6th, in-fielder decision making is off...if the ss gets it, why would he throw the man out at first when he clearly has a chance for a double play.  this happens a lot..individually, these issues may not seem like a lot but, overall it makes for a frustrating gaming experience when your guys are doing things that dont make sense...or when you need just one more out and the opponent gets yet another in-field hit...or your team gets an error....i know this is a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥ing but something has changed in this game.  overall it is still deep and fun, but issues like the above almost make it intolerable.  at this rate, i think id take your chances with ootp18 and hope they got the bugs fixed.

												my pc can't handle this game with a i7 5820k 6core @ 4.2ghz, gtx 980sli, 16gb ddr4, 500gb ssd, 1tb hhd, windows 10 64. way too demanding :0( hahhahaha JK!!! i prolly get 99999999fps. any pc can most likely run this. though processing the info counld be slower on other cpu's. best ran on a ssd. i gotta say, this management game is great. you can start from the begining of baseball history, and manage your league through the years. with active players starting at the time they would have. (example) 1952 mickey mantel will come into the league, or 1980 rickey henderson rookie year. has many options for management like force trade (i use this alot XD) fast  auto play seasons, or you can play and manage each game and each play. every aspect of the game is in your hands. this is great for those that really get into baseball. PROS:1: the customization2: the data base3: accuracy4: non-demanding5: fantasy teamCONS:1: trading players (wish they would still show up in your roster right after trading) kind of a con2: lots of options (this is a good and bad thing, great for cutomization, but has a big learning curve)3: could be a little more graphical.  but still great for what it is.9/10			"

												I have already logged more time playing two games, on OOTP 17 than I did the entire time I have owned 16.Currently playing an ""Exihibition Series""  between the 34 Cardinals and the 78 Yankees, me managing the Cardinals.I'm down 0-2.  Using the 1934 style of play.    First game was a classic Pitchers Duel, between Dizzy Dean, and that Cajum fella, Ron Guidrey,  That went 14 innings, before I lost is 4-2.  The second game was Tex Carelton vs their Jim Beatte, that was a total blowout,  9-0.   Carelton a lunchbox pitcher, gave up 4 runs to a Chris Chambliss Grandslam.  The late great Thurman Munson batting in the 2nd Spot of the order went 5-5.Be advised, I am a Cardfinal Fan,  and I totally despise, the NY Yankee Organization. Seriously, the only gripe I have.  Is the face gens are not right.  For these two clubs.  I can understand, the 34 cards having nothing but white faces.  But the 78 Yankees had  Rivers, Jackson, Randolph and Chambliss, are all Americans, of dark pigmentation, in their starting lineup.It wierds me out, seing these guys, at bat, and on the field and they are as lilly white looking as me.  It is not historically correct.			"

												So, I donwloaded this game and had a really hard time getting it to work. I opened a ticekt and it read as such:At start up I get the error ""OOTP found the crashed_on_startup flag has been set. Obviously the game crashed when you started it last time........etc"". It then launches the application and throws an error that the OOTP.exe has stopped working and closes out. I just purchased this and it has never launched properly. Please advise.I received a response and it gave me instructions to uninstal/reinstall and then set up the trace. I did as instructed and added to the ticket.  Same result. That was on August first.  No response.  Have sent a follow up on the ticket, still no response.  I was really looking forward to this game....I am really unhappy with the result and support.  Be careful....it has good reviews but I have yet to see the product work.			"

												I really can't recommend this game at all unless you already know how to play this game or have no problem researching on forums how to properly play the game.  The first thing I noticed when I first started the game was that there is no tutorial on how to begin playing the game.  It literally gives you a message saying visit the forums for more information on how to play....really?  Very poor and lazy on the developers part.  There needs to be some sort of introduction into the game instead of just tossing you into it with no real directions oncesoever.  Also, if you have ever used Windows 3.1 then these boxes will look very familiar.  It looks a bit sharper in the screenshots provided but when you start playing, you will notice the ugly edges on all the charts/messages/etc and it feels incredibly cheap.  I expected quite a bit more polish out of an officially licensed game.  I saw the screenshots but it looks much poorer once you actually start it up and feels like it was meant to be played on an old box monitor instead of on crisp hd monitors.  Some chart boxes looked so poor they almost seemed like they overlapped.  It's like if you took nearly a dozen Windows 3.1 boxes and put them all together and added in some pictures/icons/colored font/etc.The two things I liked about the game was how in depth it is and the player portraits.  The portraits were all in some kind of weird but somewhat realistic looking shots.  David Ortiz looked almost like a claymation version of himself which I thought was neat and looked closed enough.  This is great for a simulation game since once you progress to a point where you need fake players created as rookies then they can just use any random faces and it won't look weird next to the other real players since there are no real player photos in the game to begin with.All in all, I honestly can't recommend this game.  I'm a huge fan of sports, sports simulations and tycoon games but this feels much more appropriate for gaming in the early 1990's than an officially licensed game in 2016.  I do like the direction they are going in and I may revisit this series if they release a game in the future that adds a proper introduction to the game, better looking boxes/charts and possibly some larger bolder font.

												Ugh.  I just can't recommend this.  Look, if you're seeking great major league simulator with all the default options, etc., this is a great game.  Truly, it is.  So if that's all you're looking for and don't have a somewhat recent version of it already, go for it.  You'll love it and it'll be worth your money.  If you're looking for for some non standard action that's going to delve deep into the games various options.  Just don't.  It's buggy.  And worse, several options just flat out exist but don't work.  I set up non standard leagues, really trying to stretch the imagination and utilize many of the games highly detailed options and it's painful to see them flat out not work.  Aaron Harang being drafted in a High School league where you have set the age from 14-17?  Yeah, totally makes sense.  Why even have the option of setting age requirements if you have nothing within the system that actually prevents teams from acquiring them?  Mind boggling.  But hey, if you're not worried about that level of detail, little things like that won't bother you.  And you'll enjoy it.  BUT, if you've bought a previous version in the last few years (I moved from 15), you'll be sorely disappointed.  For $35-$40, not only is it a technical downgrade in some ways (bug related), but there's just not that significant an update.  Madden provides more updates in two years than this.			"

												After playing the game for a bit, I have noticed major flaws with it. I love playing baseball games but this is not the one. For being a simulation based game, the simulation is rough. For example, runners dont tag up on deep fly balls or infielders wont turn what looks like an easy double play instead only goes to first. Also the game has bugs like multiple times a batter has bunted and the ball goes to the outfield before the catcher runs out and throws out the runner at first. And since this game claims to have accurate rosters, it was strange to see Mickey Moniak (2016 1st overall pick to the Phillies) on Cleveland's roster and Riley Pint (4th overall pick to the Rockies) on Oakland's. I was highly disappointed with the game but I believe it has the potential to be the best baseball game on the market, over MLB The Show. I hope the developers can fix some major issues with game in the near future, but for right now, OOTP 17 is not worth $40.			"

												Anyone who is a true Baseball sim fan has bought this already.  But if you are playing it any way other than strict historical, it still doesn't hold up.  Every time I generate a full league of random people and do an inaugural draft, I win 95+ games a season and win the Series in 2-4 years.  Every time.  The AI still can't draft.  (I started on '15.)  For historical players, there must be some sort of extra hidden info that players have to help the AI work.  So if you are playing with real people, of course it is the best baseball sim ever made.  But if you want a baseball sim instead of a Baseball Sim it will just fall flat.Still love it, but wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Game is text oriented with sparce game play animation and a poor but optional text audio engine. Tthe mechanics of play overtake the enjoyment factor by making you focus on the how     to because of the multi page presentation.  The state of  the computer  graphics is a decade or more  behind current game examples. All those news report sections can be removed from the menu of pages and  turned into a radio program which can be set to the level desired.  This would help simplify the menu page display system.The accuracy of the simulattion  is good  and could be the best available,.but when watching in  the 3D mode the AI seems to  makes fielding errors for the losing team  to achieve predetermined results. This takes away from the fantasy of watching a real game being played out. The most desired improvement would be to remove setup of leagues and teams from the active side menus and put it up top where the file menus are and call it options. Second is to make minor league player promotion and demotion as close to a one click operation as possible like clicking on the graphic arrow that displays the move suggestion.Thirdly;   When assigning management of an aspect of the game to an AI manager , like finance, then take away the option from the active side selections.   Illuminate the side bar selection when it is the active screen so player can see where in the process of management they are.			"

												Heavy recommend from a baseball fan that's not usually a big fan of highly complex, paradox style simulations. If you're someone who always checks the box scores religiously, you'll enjoy this game.  Fair warning: the first couple of hours will consist mainly of you stumbling around trying to figure out how everything works.  Pick your favorite team when you start -- it's more fun when you recognize all of the players and the prospects -- but recognize that the first months are going to be rocky given the length of time it's going to take you to figure out how to release that veteran starter that isn't working out, or promote that prospect tearing it up in triple a.  I personally played through half of a season -- one of the great mid 90s Cleveland lineups -- and then started over again once I was confident I was capable of being a competent general manager.Bottom line, if you like baseball and have the patience to spend a couple of hours  mastering the underlying systems, you'll get many hours of enjoyment out of this game.

Looking forward to poring over the new feature that now has every minor league player dating back to 1919. Will a world exist out there that has Michael Jordan making the major leagues? Possibly.

												Like all great Strategy games, OOTP creates a believeable world you can immerse yourself in, always leaving you one more thing to do before you go to bed.Amazingly it does it with what are in effect just spreadsheets, and a highly technical subject (dont know what Rule 5 drafts are - you will).  This will be quite a barrier for a lot of people to get over.  But it is worth it.The game is a winner because of the stories it creates that linger in the mind.I am in the 20th year of my fictional league.   It is bottom of the ninth in the 7th game of the 2036 world series and my team is down by three runs.First up to the plate is my catcher Okuma.  This guy has been a big disappointment.  He was a great player who I signed to a big $ long term deal.  But he has had a bad year - so bad I brought up a minor leaguer at the end of the year to catch.  But I put him into my playoff roster as cover and my manager has decided to use him.  He gets a hit.Next we have Rodriguez.  He is my 'moneyball' guy.  Just great at getting onto base and on minimum wage.  My scouts hate him as does my manager.  But I have forced him to be used as a starter and he has put up great numbers.  He walks.Herrara now comes to the plate.  I picked him up as a throw-in on a big trade many years ago and he has been pretty good (although the guy I traded has been better).  However my owner has set me a goal to get a better centre fielder, so keeping him on is risky.  He gets a walk.Bases loaded and Koot comes up.  This guy is Mr Mediocre. He is only on my playoff roster because I had one space left and could not think of a good reason not to use him.  I have never really paid him much attention - he is one of those guys you have to rest your real players.  Why my manager has put him into the game in the bottom of the 9th is a mystery.  And then he hits a walk off Grand Slam home run to win the World Series.No doubt Mr Koot will soon be playing elsewhere, I will still be annoyed at the money I am wasting on Okuma, I will still be battling my manager to use Rodriguez as a starter, and Herrara will have gone to make my owner happy. But I will remember those guys...It is stories like this that makes this a great game.			"

 So good As a baseball fanatic, this game is fantastic. It allows players to do essentially anything they want with a real or fake baseball world. OOTP doesn't allow for playing actual games as players, and I wouldn't want that anyway. The depth and detail that this game has is unrivaled, and I plan on purchasing every single future installment of this game. The devs improve on things that sucked with previous versions. I love this damn game. It's easy to lose track of time when drafting or trying to make trades work.			"

												A superb baseball simulator with virtually unlimited options.  Manage your favorite team with their current rosters, manage historical teams with accurate rosters, make a fictional league with totally fictional players and teams, expand the league or change the rules.  The simulation is very accurate and much quicker than in OOTP 16.  The 3D game play is a huge addition and adds a lot of enjoyment for me, even as bare bones as it is.Overall, I give the game an 10/10, would definitely reccomend.			"

												I've been playing for years and every year seems to get better. I tend to play historical games starting in 1977.. I'd go through at the end of the offseasons and change the minors to line up with the upcoming season. Now, I don't need to since they added the minor league database to the game! There's a lot to enjoy. You can create completely fictional universes and play from there. You can go back in time and take over your favourite team. You can start in the current day and take over your team and lead them to the World Series.			"

I was lucky to get it the 4 days earlier than available on steam, and am very much so pleased. The core game is the same, but the engine behind it improved, which is the perfect situation for a sim game. On top of that, the speed of the simulations is much faster than the previous version. Definitely worth the upgrade from '16 to '17.			"

												Still the best baseball sim out there.  It can be a bit intimidating at first, but there is nothing that even comes close in terms of realism.  If you love baseball and text sims, this is by far the best on the market.  If you already have OOTP 16, you probably don't *need* to upgrade, but having current rosters is nice, and there are a handful of new features.  The most notable are game recaps and win probability graphs being shown in box scores (this adds very nicely to the immersion) and the 3D view.  I've found 3D to be more of a novelty than a necessity, but your mileage may vary.  On the whole, upgrading to 17 isn't strictly necessary, but you won't regret it if you do.			"

AI demands are just insane and I end rarely to complete a fair trade. You can just fool the AI by including 5 stars prospects that you know they will never be a major league player in the trade.Pick it up during this sale and you will probably be sastisfied for hundreds hour of gaming.

												Truly a baseball sandbox - you can have pretty much any kind of league, in any era that you can imagine. You can of course play a real-life modern league with all the minors included. You can also play a historical league starting in any season going back to the start of the professional game in 1871 - and can have full minors for a big chunk of that time too. Then there's fictional - you can do a promotion/relegation setup, you can put teams anywhere in the world (or create a fantasy world). Has an MLB license so all the real life logos are in there, there's Facegen so your players have faces - there's uniforms too, so when you trade a player, he'll show up on his new team wearing their cap and jersey.All in all, this is the absolute pinnacle for baseball simulation and probably sports simulation in general.

												About as detailed a baseball management simulation as you could ever want. Works perfectly well taking over on Opening Day of this season as your team of choice without any modifications, and given the level of detail and the tremendous set of options to tweak that's an excellent place to start. But playing OotP 17 and only running forward from this season is putting a nuclear reactor to work powering a desk fan. Among other features offered by the simulation not only is there nearly the entire history of the MLB as potential starting points at a formidible level of detail (and if that isn't enough detail, the community around this game has added more), but also the ability to invent an entire fictional history of baseball, again with extensive tools already in-game and even more provided by modders.

												OOTP 17 is my first foray into the Out of the Park series. Coming from an experienced Football Manager user I had certain expectations, some of which were met, others exceeded, and a few not quite to the standard I expected. Still, in simplistic terms OOTP 17 is a very thorough and extensive game that, for people who enjoy sports management sims, gets the job done.The sheer depth of the simulation is at times overwhelming, even for someone with hundreds of hours in sports simulators, and this can reasonably be attributed to the hefty amount of real-world representation that baseball requires. Being a general manager is by far the most exhaustive role one can take on. For those who are just interested in the day-to-day playing of baseball as a bench coach, the option to be a regular manager is helpful. Even as someone who has been watching baseball their entire life, I still found some of the rules and regulations regarding minor league contracts, active rosters, and drafts to be confusing. Thankfully the manual provides reasonable enough information and goes as far as to point out the differences between how things work in the real-world and how they work in OOTP.Even still, some aspects of the game warrant polishing and others can be too abstract as to cause frustration. An example of the latter would be the simulation aspect of the game. Teams make strange trades, random players go on un-charactaristic streaks, whether for better or worse, and general performance overall seems to be skewed away from reality. Teams you would expect to do well sometimes just don't, for no apparant reason. This brings into question how the real world performance of such a complex sport is translated to a virtual simulation.There is plenty of work that can be done to make the game more user friendly, whether that be interactive tutorials and situation explanations, or better reasoning behind the simulation and representation of real-world teams and players. As a baseball manager simulation, OOTP is pretty much the only option. It certainly gets the job done and is absolutely worth checking out for diehard baseball fans and stats nerds, just don't be too disappointed or surprised if things turn a bit toward the fantastical after too long.

												I've been playing for years and every year seems to get better. I tend to play historical games starting in 1977.. I'd go through at the end of the offseasons and change the minors to line up with the upcoming season. Now, I don't need to since they added the minor league database to the game! There's a lot to enjoy. You can create completely fictional universes and play from there. You can go back in time and take over your favourite team. You can start in the current day and take over your team and lead them to the World Series.			"

												I love this game! I've got over 800 hours logged on the OOTP franchise and this year they made some changes that really improve the gameplay, especially in regards to trading. They've stepped up the graphics once again and finally added mutli-core processor support. That alone makes it worth the cost compared to previous versions of the game. They brought the game to a whole new level.			"

												A must have for baseball fans. I've played OOTP '15 and '16 and loved both of them. I was initially looking for a live action baseball game and couldn't find one, so I settled on this sim. It is very in-depth and detailed, and almost overwhelming. I learned a lot about baseball from playing this game. As a casual fan I could understand OOTP, but it gives players a deeper understanding and appreciation for baseball. With time, you start to figure out the interface and menus. It is very rewarding to steer your team to victory, sign prospects and watch them flourish, negotiate with free agents/personnel, achieve goals, etc. I WOULD NOT recommend OOTP '17 for people who like to play as GM only. I only play as GM and don't mangae individual games. I really only play to make roster moves. As a result, I don't see this as much of an upgrade from OOTP '16. AI is perhaps marginally improved. If you only want to play as GM, save yourself $20 bucks and get last year's version (unless if updated rosters are that important to you). Other than that, great franchise and worth the money.			"

												Still the best baseball sim out there.  It can be a bit intimidating at first, but there is nothing that even comes close in terms of realism.  If you love baseball and text sims, this is by far the best on the market.  If you already have OOTP 16, you probably don't *need* to upgrade, but having current rosters is nice, and there are a handful of new features.  The most notable are game recaps and win probability graphs being shown in box scores (this adds very nicely to the immersion) and the 3D view.  I've found 3D to be more of a novelty than a necessity, but your mileage may vary.  On the whole, upgrading to 17 isn't strictly necessary, but you won't regret it if you do.			"

												I just found out about OOTP last year, and was able to chug out about 500 hours into OOTP in 3 months. Loved it so much I preordered OOTP 17 and am amazed again. I was lucky to get it the 4 days earlier than available on steam, and am very much so pleased. The core game is the same, but the engine behind it improved, which is the perfect situation for a sim game. On top of that, the speed of the simulations is much faster than the previous version. Definitely worth the upgrade from '16 to '17.			"

It was until 2 or 3 years back when i finally stumbled upon the OOTP-series. While playing it, i really became enthusiastic about baseball as a whole and followed every MLB-season since then.

Select a current MLB team with up to date (2016) rosters and not to mention complete minor league affiliates or relive history by playing as any historical MLB team since 1871 also with complete rosters and minor league affiliates.

												Still, simply the best baseball simulation game around.From the last year, I see many medium and small improvements:- the game is really more fast to load and simulate (I mean... about 100-200 times better? Previously, this was the main problem with this series)- the overall game have a better engine- the difficulty is still intriguing and have been improvedThere are, however, still some problems:- the AI works really well in some ways, terrible in others. In particular, seems to manage the trade system not really well and doesn't recognize so well the ability of the players- the main interface is still difficult to navigate, I still miss some sections after 20 hours of play! It have to be improved.Ways for improvement, excepting what was already said:- more leagues, at the same speed simulation... difficult, but this can be great- and a particular request: earnings calculated also for minor league players :)			"

But now that I own 17, I must say it's the best yet. The new game recaps are really nice for adding more detail and interest to each game, on top of the new additions to the minor league depth and adding minor leagues to the historical side.Of course my main style of play is still the fictional mode, which is still just as good as it's been.

												Let me preface this by saying I have played every baseball game created in the last decade, and Out of the Park Baseball 17 is the greatest one ever made.I am a lifelong Mariners, (the pain) and baseball fan. I have a passion in the sport and can rattle off statistics and random info better than I can the Pledge of Allegiance. And I'm not even sorry.This game has everything the inner baseball fanatic in me wants. Complete control of roster, to player sliders, to creating ballparks, expanding the league, accurate minor league systems, actually accurate simulations, and realistic decision making. Yes, ""all you do is stare at a screen"". But it hearkens back to a day of text based Sims that gets me nostalgic just like the great American pastime does.The only downside I have for this game is that I wish I could actually play the games instead of siming them, as in being the player, not the manager, but it's a small sacrifice.Some other cons: the game tends to crash semi often. I am talking about once every few hours for me. But I also play the crap out of it, so I may just be too hard.The salary players demand becomes unrealistic if you max their stats. For example: I traded Mike Trout to my team, and maxed his stats because I wanted to see him crush a bunch of records. He did. But, after his contract was up, he wanted $55 million a year for 10 years. Uhm. My team salary is $200 million lol. That said, you can lower their stats and sign them for cheaper, then raise them again, but I don't like doing that because I want to keep it slightly realistic. The other solution is editing your finances to have a bigger pay roll.All in all, this is an incredible game that any stat minded player will love. Their are endless statistics to pour through, which I love. If you are a fan of baseball, and like number based Sim games, this is what you have been missing your whole life.			"

												I had been playing a competitor's  baseball sim for a couple of years and was unhappy with their program as the out come of the game could be predicted.  Then came across OOTP in 2010 and found that the outcome was not very predictable, and have been playing OOTP ever since.OOTP is a statistical based game; it can be played historically, historically with fictional players, or make your own league. Regardless of what type of league you want to play, the game puts you in the manager or GM seat.  Build your own team anyway you want, in any era, in any type of league.   Be careful, as your reputation is everything, especially if you want to get a GM position with a more prestigious team.  Be aware of the owner's goals, you could be fired if the team does not produce.  Or, if you don't want to deal with ownership, just play in ""can't be fired mode"".Bottomline, if you want just want to play a mindless ""homerun derby"" sim, thisis not for you.  If you want to play an indepth game that is based on stats that is always being made more realistic, you can't go wrong with OOTP baseball. "

												It's a great baseball sim game, but only recommendable to business and strategy players. One of my favorite features is the historical section keeping records of your team. I would like to see the game have former players and coaches die when they get older. It's odd that a 150 year old man can return and play or coach through commissioner mode (unless anyone has seen it happen other ways).  I would like to see an improved trading dynamic where you could shop a player (say an All Star) and be offered very good prospects or players in return. I have only received one offer of multiple players for one of my own. In addition, the option to pay a certain amount of a player's remaining salary should be available during a trade (think Ricky Nolasco for the Twins). I'm not sure if anyone else has had any trouble with this but I have never been able to develop that guy that hits .300/30HR/100RBI. I've had several guys that could have done it and should do it easily but always fail. My biggest issue with the game is that some star players experience a MASSIVE decline at around 30-32. I made a huge trade for Sonny Gray and got 4 great years out of him but when he hit 31 he was a completely worthless $22m man. The same is happening for Max Kepler now; won 2 consecutive batting titles, MVP and now he struggles to hit .260. I really want that to be fixed.			"

												Truly a baseball sandbox - you can have pretty much any kind of league, in any era that you can imagine. You can of course play a real-life modern league with all the minors included. You can also play a historical league starting in any season going back to the start of the professional game in 1871 - and can have full minors for a big chunk of that time too. Then there's fictional - you can do a promotion/relegation setup, you can put teams anywhere in the world (or create a fantasy world). Has an MLB license so all the real life logos are in there, there's Facegen so your players have faces - there's uniforms too, so when you trade a player, he'll show up on his new team wearing their cap and jersey.All in all, this is the absolute pinnacle for baseball simulation and probably sports simulation in general.

												For a baseball fan, this is an absolute must-try. I bought the game on a whim this year, and while I only intended to spend a handful of hours trying it out, I've already spent a few hundred. I hadn't played an OOTP game since 2008, and was very impressed with the overall progress made. For a non-baseball fan, I'd say that this game has a bit steeper learning curve than games like Football Manager, mostly due to the complexity of MLB roster rules.			"

												Great game, but very difficult to get into -- requires you to seek out information online, as there isn't a lot of tutorial/help info built into the game. Took me a few tries to really get into it. I'd reccommend starting with either manager or general manager mode (not both) to make things simpler.			"

												This is a remarkable game. I took over the 2016 Mets and loved playing an alternate reality season where Harvey, Wright, Duda (etc.) stayed healthy. I traded for Billy Hamilton and Andrelton Simmons and got as far as the NLCS, which I lost to the Giants in 7. Now I'm halfway through 2017, playing obsessively. The game has such depth, so many details, that you believe you are steering a MLB team for better and worse. Victories are glorious; defeats sting bitterly. I think I'll play these Mets for a decade, until my draft picks are starting players. Dynasty!			"

												This years edition of OOTP doesn't disappoint, as usual. This game has never failed to build off the previous year, and 17 is certainly no exception. The first thing you notice when you open the game is the official MLBPA and MLB licenceing (yes!). Personally, I have been awaiting this feature since I began playing with OOTP 15. The new design is sleek and original. And finally you don't need mods to get the player faces which is definetly a plus. I do wish that generated players had faces as well, but that's obviously a minor thing and definetly doesn't impact gameplay.I've never been one to really watch games often, but the options you have in game are just fine. Sure, I wish there was an option to choose your plan for every pitch and be able to play the game (like most people) but that's not really the point of the game. Playing the games does however give you plenty of control and gives you the feel of being the manager.Where this game really shines as always is the deep variety of options to truly make each league your own. I messed around with a lot of the settings in previous years and have found the formula that works for me. This games mechanics are nearly flawless, the only slight issues being the AI trade proposals (which, as usual, are as dumb as ever that it's impossible to keep them on), and that the game seems to run a tad slower with other programs running on the computer, as opposed to prior years. In addition, injuries seem to occur MUCH more often, which isn't necessarily a terrible thing, especially because you can change those options. A lot more players seem to become ""wrecked"" in comparison to previous games, which can become annoying. However, these problems do not come close to bringing this game down.As usual, the OOTP developers have not tried to reinvent the wheel, which they don't need to. This series has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The official licencing by MLB is no doubt the biggest change and upgrade over last year. For the casual OOTP player who doesn't care too much about updated rosters and the forementioned changes can stick with last year. This game, however, is worth the price, for $10 or $40, as there is endless fun and no micro transactions (please please please don't). My Yankees franchise is 18 years in, and have 4 championships. I know, not great but hopefully many more to come. "

												I have to agree with Curt Schilling on this - it's the most addicting game I've ever played.  An 11 on a scale of 1-10.  Lots of detail, realistic outcomes - you get an excellent feel for running a franchise, managing or just playing a game.  I'd rate it a 12 if they'd up the graphics engine for gameplay just a bit.

												If building franchises is your thing, OOTP will not disappoint. Countless enjoyable hours can be spent building the team to your specifications.The combination of graphics,strategy and presentation, IMHO, make Football Manager the best sports sim of this genre. There is some debate on the OOTP forums if graphical content is an issue or important at all. Again, IMHO, graphics are important and improved game graphics would make this sim so much more entertaining. Perhaps an investor or two from Shark Tank or the MLB could help speed development.Keep going OOTP, love your sim, it is great, grahpical content would only increase the pleasure.			"

												I had been playing a competitor's  baseball sim for a couple of years and was unhappy with their program as the out come of the game could be predicted.  Then came across OOTP in 2010 and found that the outcome was not very predictable, and have been playing OOTP ever since.OOTP is a statistical based game; it can be played historically, historically with fictional players, or make your own league. Regardless of what type of league you want to play, the game puts you in the manager or GM seat.  Build your own team anyway you want, in any era, in any type of league.   Be careful, as your reputation is everything, especially if you want to get a GM position with a more prestigious team.  Be aware of the owner's goals, you could be fired if the team does not produce.  Or, if you don't want to deal with ownership, just play in ""can't be fired mode"".Bottomline, if you want just want to play a mindless ""homerun derby"" sim, thisis not for you.  If you want to play an indepth game that is based on stats that is always being made more realistic, you can't go wrong with OOTP baseball. "

												Honestly, I didn't think there was any way that OOTP 17' would be that much of a bigger upgrade than OOTP 16', but it really truly is if you've yet to upgrade to the newer version.I was previously running this on a pretty crappy laptop that I've had since 2010 and OOTP16 slogged through the days while 17 breezed past them. I'm now back onto an actual gaming desktop and instead of playing a lot of the AAA games that I own, I'm still sticking with this game.No greater feeling in this game than watching a prospect your draft/sign turn into an abosulte beast and becoming the franshice player for your team for the next decade+.This game is easily money well spent be it on sale or full price.

												I've logged more hours on the OOTP series than I ever would care to admit.  As someone who is a huge baseball and sports sim fan, the game's pretty much got it all.  At this point it's really just a matter of tweaking and improving existing features each year.  Maybe implement something wherein your salary as a GM or Manager actually means or gets you something.  But I've built dynasties in NPB, MLB, and even PECOS when I was looking for that next challenge.  While the learning curve is a bit steep at first with the sheer amount of options available and things to manage, it becomes considerably easier to manage and the simming day-by-day throughout an entire year seems less tedious as you recognize the sheer amount of moving parts you have to tend to as GM of a baseball team.  For the ambitious sports sim fan, or the Baseball Mogul player looking for more, I'd highly reccomend.			"

While concurrent real life events unfold entirely differently. I find this a bit annoying. But if you tinker with the editor you can compesate this for the most part.

												Truly a baseball sandbox - you can have pretty much any kind of league, in any era that you can imagine. You can of course play a real-life modern league with all the minors included. You can also play a historical league starting in any season going back to the start of the professional game in 1871 - and can have full minors for a big chunk of that time too. Then there's fictional - you can do a promotion/relegation setup, you can put teams anywhere in the world (or create a fantasy world). Has an MLB license so all the real life logos are in there, there's Facegen so your players have faces - there's uniforms too, so when you trade a player, he'll show up on his new team wearing their cap and jersey.All in all, this is the absolute pinnacle for baseball simulation and probably sports simulation in general.

												For a baseball geek like me, this game is absolutely fantastic. I've spent so many hours running a fictional baseball universe and keeping up with its stars that I'd have to say this is one of the best games I've ever played. However, there are three suggestions I'd like to make for the next version of the game.1) There should be a better way to find players' statistics, in this version there's no way to get a leaderboard where one can easily toggle between sorting players based on specific statistics without having to return to the career leaderboards screen, which takes some time to load. A nice example of what this could look like can be found on the mlb.com statistics page. This is my biggest issue with the game.2) I think it'd be really cool if the game automatically selected certain pivotal or particulalry impressive moments from games when they were simulated and kept these moments in their own page. For example, walk-off home runs in the postseason or especially amazing catches would be really cool to see when they happened in simulation.3) I also think it'd be cool if there was a page that kept track of players' use of performance-enhancing drugs. I believe that the simulation already hands out suspensions to certain players if they are caught with PEDs but it'd be nice to see all of these infractions in one place, maybe along with the statistics of those who are caught, to determine the effect of their use on certain records. You know, like real life.I think those are all of my issues, but besides these things I really love this game and am 100% glad that I purchased it.			"

												OOTP is the gold standard of Sports SIms for a reason, infinitely configurable, customizable - you can be as realistic or as fantasy oriented as you want. Play with strict spending guidelines and current players or go full sandbox with unlimited cash and the ability to draft any player who played the game since 1904. You want Ken Griffey Jr., Honus Wagner, and Mickey Mantle on the same roster? No problem.Playing historically accurate clubs (with historically accurate farm systems) is awesome for an aggrieved Expos fan like myself. It gives me the chance to go back and get the 1994 season Expos fans deserved.If you love baseball, you'll love this game. If you love sports sims, you'll love this game. I picked up the game after the season ended and got it on sale. Glad I did.UPDATE: I nominated this game for the test of time award.

												Im a big a fan of OOTP games and own the last four in the series. While 17 didnt come with a lot of big and flashy features there were some significant improvements built on top of a great game. Most notably the performance improvement for simming, loading etc... is huge especially in a large game world with a lot of history. I have never actually played a game in the MLB myself through OOTP which says a lot of how strong the fictional league creation features are. This game is definitely worth it for and sports manangement game fans.			"

												I've loved baseball for my whole life, and it seems hard to explain to many in my generation why.  A lot of people think baseball is boring, but more than any other it's the thinking man's sport.  This game focuses on the strategy of it all, the sheer amount of numbers and math is probably more massive than most other sports combined.  I've always felt there's a lot for strategy gamers to like in baseball, and this game scratches that itch better than any other management simulation I can think of.  There are a few interface niggles (some more tooltips on icons, and a few menus are placed in unexpected locations) but overall it's a monumental achievement.			"

												I've been looking for ages for a baseball game to play on the computer, ever since I've discovered my love for the sport.I was fairly disappointed when I saw there were very few options available. Luckily, Out of the Park Baseball is the best of them, particularly OOTP 17.Licensed by the MLB, it has all of the players and teams you know (or don't know, if you're a new fan), including international leagues, even independent ones! Just today I heard Manny Ramirez got signed to a japanese team I only know exists thanks to this game. As for the gameplay, I find it a bit difficult because I'm just so new to the series. It's fairly intuitive, but I've struggled getting it right. I got squashed on my first match. Luckily there's an option to let the AI play for you while you just manage the team, acquiring free agents, picking lineups, that sort of thing. The menus are a bit hard to navigate and if you're allergic to spreadsheets maybe avoid this game, because it's most of what you'll be looking at most of the time, but it still manages to be a fun management simulation game.So if you're the kind of crazy nut that actually enjoys this sort of game and the sport of baseball, wait not one more second, it's worth every penny.

												I was attempting to bet back into watching/following baseball. What better way to do this than with a video game. However I am in WAY over my head with this one.This software is insane. The amount of players, stats, depth charts, etc. is absoultely amazing. Street credit to those developers involved with the database schema for this monster. Makes Oracle products look like excel workbooks. I am having a great time learning names of players, trends, etc. Also, great mod community so far. A solid purchase.			"

												Excellent. I've been playing OOTP for quite some time now and absolutely love this version. My favorite part is the animated plays now, reminds me of the old Microleague baseball games from back in the day. These seem very random too from what I can tell as opposed to a predefined animation for certain plays. Definitely adds a lot for me to the day by day games keeping it all the more interesting.			"

												Seems like a fantastic management game...its comprative advantage to fm is huge possibilities for customization. On downside you have to know baseball which i dont. Only basic stat categories and how its played. But for you to truly appreciate achievements of players or teams knowledge is a must. Iz may not be for europeans :)But from management pwrspective its 10/10. Even back stories and news aroud the league are great.Would recommend it.			"

												I've never been a huge baseball fan, always more of a soccer fan. But after playing a lot of Football Manager, this game was recommended to me. I cannot stress how well-developed this game is. Even not being a huge baseball fan, the development of the game really drew me in and I am truly addicted. The historical basis of the game, being able to start anywhere at anytime, is so massive. You can start your league in the 1960's and simulate all the way to the present day and see how different MLB would be. It awesome.			"

												I've loved baseball for my whole life, and it seems hard to explain to many in my generation why.  A lot of people think baseball is boring, but more than any other it's the thinking man's sport.  This game focuses on the strategy of it all, the sheer amount of numbers and math is probably more massive than most other sports combined.  I've always felt there's a lot for strategy gamers to like in baseball, and this game scratches that itch better than any other management simulation I can think of.  There are a few interface niggles (some more tooltips on icons, and a few menus are placed in unexpected locations) but overall it's a monumental achievement.			"

												OOTP 17 could become your thing if you have the slightest interest in baseball. So many possible playstyles. I can't believe I stuck with Baseball Mogul for a couple years after everything stopped working properly, the last few have been OOTP and it's been great.			"

												I know nothing about baseball so for me this game is super complicated. It is fun, I let the AI take care of everything except pitching substitutions. The play by play with pause between each play is great. The manual is online only and there is no PDF manual which is a killer for me. I like printing out manuals and studying them to learn the game. I just hate reading manuals online. If you like real baseball then this is a must buy for you!!!			"

												Really nice interface, although it can be overwhelming at times. Great game for those looking for a more in depth simulation of the management side of baseball. You manage the financial side, the farm system, the drafts, everything. Tons of reports, stats, and everything else available on demand. You can even configure the league to do things like decrease the accuracy of scouting so the game can be more unpredictable. Nice game.			"

												Very well made game. I am a baseball nerd and can easily get lost in the fictional worlds I create. It can be as in depth or simple as you want it to be. The customization is incredible. It's less of a game and more of a tool, with infinite possibilities for you to make. Definitely a game to buy.			"

												I love this game and have bought every version since 14. I started playing sports sims in the mid-90s with Hockey League Sim by Bethesda and all the Frontpage sports titles. This game is beyond deep, I've played as a team for decdes and the league is still very balanced. To me this is the mark of a truely balanced sport sim.Hands down the king of all sport sims IMO.One negative; bi-yearly releases is blatant cash grab by ootp!!!			"

												I've just been playing OOTP baseball for the past two weeks, but I am really enjoying it.  The amount of options are simply incredible. You can play the game on the surface, playing individual games, or quickly replaying World Series, or you can go as in-depth as you want, recreating entire seasons, developing your minor league system, play international leagues, etc.  I've also discovered that there is  a big mod community, that offers even more diversity to an already immense baseball simulation. The only downside is the technical aspects of game itself.  Because the game is so large, you are almost forced to customize it to your liking, and this is not a simple task.  The manual is not what I would call user-friendly, as it had my head spinning a few times with its assumption that I knew what it was talking about.  Now this is all ok if you have some computer expertise, but I am a simple fan of gaming, and have never been even remotely been a computer wizard.  So I am rather baffled much of what the game could offer. The answer to this problem is simple.  The Developers could have done this work for the user, and had every coded to allow for more options via hotkey buttons.  Instead, you have to find such-and-such a directory, and start typing in lines of code.  Hate that, as that is not what I expect to see when I buy a game. So right now ... after two weeks ... it is very much a love it/hate it, kind of thing.  I love the power of the game, and its ability to use every player who ever played major league baseball.  But hate that it makes me feel ignorant and stupid with regards to computers.   Conclusion:  I will keep playing it, and I would recommend it to someone who enjoys baseball, but with a warning that it is very complex and not for the faint of heart. Likely not the answer for the very casual gamer.			"

												I've been playing OOTP since version 8.  It keeps getting better and better every year.  It is a very deep baseball simulation that completely immerses you in the game.  You can play any team from any year in major league league history, or create your own teams and leagues.  I prefer to play it like it's Baseball Executive Simulator, but you can also play as the manager on the field.  I can't recommend this game enough if you're a baseball fan and looking for a very detailed, customizable, and fun baseball simulator.			"

												What an absolute MASTERPIECE.I am absoultely in love with this game. From the ridicoulously well created historic teams, to the perfectly constructed current rosters; this game has it all. The pure amount of customization available for your league is mind-numbing. You can tinker, and explore any and every kind of setting that you can think of for your league (obviously within reason.)But with all that in mind, my most favourite mode has to be Fictional League. Creating your own baseball world that lays down it's roots as teams grow and expand, along with enriching your history... has to be one of the most satisfying and interesting gaming experiences I've ever had. Sometimes, it will take me 30mins - 1hr to even play a game when I boot it up, because I'm looking back on history from my league (CBL - Canadian Baseball League)As you may have guessed - I am a baseball fanatic. As a baseball fanatic (As I'm sure many of you are), there is so much that can go wrong with a sim like this. Some how, OOTP Developments swerves it's way through the obstacles, and created this classic sim, that I will continue to play for a long, long time.EDIT: Even my best friend, who is not a baseball fan WHATSOEVER, tried the game out when he came over to my house. Even he - who has no interest in simulation games, let along baseball - had a blast created a fictional baseball world and drafting his team from scratch.			"

												This has to be the greatest game I have played in years. That being said, After spending all week learning the in's and out's about 30 hours, the game starts crashing to black screen, corupting my saves and the game in general. Can't find a way to ""clean the install, they want extra software downloaded to diagnose there software, and last but not least if you want help you must make account just to get there game to play. I would freely give them anyting they ask for. While I wanted to be a fan boy, after multible installs and reconfigures I am growing to hate this.  I can not get to work without crashing. Not just a CTD no A hard lockup. Maybe someday they will bring this game to the 21st century. I'm sure it runs great on a Old XP machine			"
