												Sometimes, you need a game that's frenetic, fast paced and full of chaos.  You need some escapism so you get away from the humdrum of your day job by pretending to be some beefcake named Slab Rockhard blast some bugs to bits with your AK - 22.  Other times though, you need to come home, kick back, crack a brewski and chill out.  Take it easy, shoot some pool like a pro and relax.  That's what you have Pool Nation for.  It's zero pressure, it's zero chaos. It's 100% cool, daddy-o.  It's got some great physics too, so you can shoot pool and feel like a king. Because some times, you need to come home and pretend that you're a slick mo-fo pool shark.  Because if you tried to play pool in the real world, people would realize you're a 40 year old dork in dad jeans try his damnedest to look cool. I uh...that may have gotten too personal. "

												Pool Nation isn't a perfect pool game, but it's a huge step up from what's come before. If you're not already a billiards fan, Pool Nation won't make you one. Conversely, for those dying to scratch the billiards itch, Pool Nation is sure to satisfy. An entertaining, highly varied and technically excellent pool game, even if lacking in innovation or new elements for its genre.With Pool Nation you'll get a pooling experience that you've never had before. The simulator delivers several game modes and a lot of options to choose from. Every kind of shot that you can imagine is possible to make in the game and because of that you can truly speak of a great simulator. Another big plus are the graphics, which are truly stunning for a low budget title. Overall, Cherry Pop Games's first endeavour has left us with a fantastic billiards game featuring stunning visuals, great audio and even better physics. The lengthy, albeit difficult career mode, will give you plenty of play time but perhaps for the wrong reasons. If you're looking for a realistic, stylish, and fun billiards game, Pool Nation is the cream of the crop.			"

												Pool Nation is one of my favorite games on Steam. The solid gameplay and controls were not enough for Cherry Pop Games, they went ahead and added some beautiful locations each offered during day, sunset, and neon lit night time. The amazing soundtrack gets you in the mood whether you want to relax or get pumped. The game modes for single player include 3ball, 8ball, 9ball, endurance, golf, killer, rotation, speed, and straight. In addition, you can play online versus friends in a friendly match or choose to be competitive in tournament mode. The most recent update includes ""box of tricks"" free of charge, allowing you to create a custom trick shot that you can share with the world. This game is the complete package.			"

												Pool Nation is a great pool simulator that will make you feel like a hustler once you master all the different trick shots. Lots of different game modes like 9-ball, 8-ball, endurance, and tournaments. Plus you can play online versus friends. The game offers good graphics, although they can be a little bit on the shiny side. The cue control system is mostly user friendly even though sometimes it can feel like a chore to set up a trick shot just right. Straight shots are extremely intuitive and the angle assistance makes it really easy to sink shots. Although bank shots and combos aren't so straightforward.This is the first real pool game that I have played on the PC and quite frankly I wouldn't be surprised if it was the last. I just don't know how it can get any better. The game trailers and screenshots really sold me before my purchase and the game certainly has not disappointed--really well done. The only blemish is that it occassionally crashes.			"

												One of the best pool sim to come along since the Virtual pool series.  The developers are a small group working out of Manchester, England and they do a whale of a job listening to their players.  They frequent all of the forum and community hub sites and update when needed.  They really do care about their product and want to make it the best sim on the market and to my opinion they have succeeded.  This game is a really ""must have"" for the serious and not so serious pool gamer.  Cheap and twice the price but well worth looking into...buy this game!			"

 “8-Ball - Corner Pocket” ‘Pool Nation’ is a fun, polished Billiards simulator and a bargain at its $1 pricetag (Steam Fall Sale 2014). Released as the maiden offering from Cherry Pop Games, it’s gorgeous visuals, multiple game modes, lengthy campaign and lots of unlockables will keep Pool fans coming back for more.   Campaign | Gameplay: Gamers have the choice of playing standard 8-ball or variations like 9-ball, Rotation, Endurance, Sudden Death etc across a variety of visually stunning locations / pool halls. A lengthy campaign mode (against AI opponents) allows you to perfect your game and strive toward numerous unlockables including new locations, pool table decals, new ball styles and cue styles. Additionally, the online mode allows you to match up with friends or other online players in single matches, Tournaments or King of the Hill events. Multiple difficulty levels (from Novice to Pro), a spot on physics engine, responsive controls, and a great soundtrack make this the best Pool game to date.Flaws: In considering its biggest issues – 1. Game Stability is poor (Tabbing to windows results in an insta-crash) and 2. Online Gaming is largely dead (Bring your own friends). Additionally, the developers have pushed the previously promised ‘Trick Shot’ mode to the next release, and the lack of Co-op play is disappointing as well.Overall, ‘Pool Nation’ is the best conception of a Billiards game to date and fans of the real game will find this a fun, polished distraction. But, even ardent fans soon realize that Pool without the smoky basement rooms, uneven cues, pitchers of beer, chatty girls, side-bets and bar-room trash talk, is a somewhat hollow experience.

												I remember a few months ago when it was on sale and i thought it would be one of those games that i buy and dont even play, And even when it was only a few euros, i didnt buy it!I was wrong....My boyfriend remembered that moment too and he recently gifted me the game.We've been playing it A LOT ever since.The game looks absolutely stunning! There is so much detail in this game.The controlles are easy to use, Its easy for beginners but you can make it more challenging for yourself if you want too, when your getting better. There are so many options in this game which makes it an awesome pool game for everybody. Yes, Also when you dont know anything about pooling lol. In single mode you can unlock different Rooms, Balls, Tables and so much more.Which is cool because you can make it totally as you want it to look, also online against your friends.That brings me too the  biggest plus of this game... The multi player option!Playing against others works great, but the sad part is that not many people play this game which makes it not so easy to find people to play a match with.So if you want to play it online i recommend that you find a friend on your friendlist to play it with.This game which i thought would get boring quickly turned out to be really addictive and extremely fun.Its even THAT good that i write a review for it and thats something that i rarely do.Its a must have, And since its on sale again at this moment i would say its worth to give it a try. You'll be amazed, I promise ;]			"

												A fantastic pool simulator. Frustratingly accurate! Turn off the assists for a proper experience but I warn you... It is frustratingly addictive. The A.I opponents will make quick work of you for making small errors in the later tournaments but it certainly isn't unfair. Just like real pool sometimes you will let your shot go & know you have messed up as soon as the cue touches the whiteball.			"

This game is really awesome cause it even has workshop for special tracks you can make for balls as you unlock more stuff winning games in singleplayer. Truly an amazing game. And if you like taking screenshots, this might be the game for you aswell. You can take some really nice screenshots during through the campaign in singleplayer. The graphics are truly amazing.And even multiplayer? Woah! This is too cool to be thruth! All this needs now is local co-op versus mode.-={You can buy this game for 1$ on♥♥♥♥♥ Its safe, I bought it there.}=-Pros: +Much custumization +Awesome graphics +No lag +Multiplayer +Trading cards +Full and good controller support +Workshop +Tricks/Stunts +Much to do. +No time limit while you choose which ball to hit and the angle.Cons: -Sometimes it bugs out.

												This is one of the best pool games i have seen. Graphics look nice, the physics are good and it's pretty fun. A strange thing is the uncomfortable mouse controls, but i played with a xbox controller, what works very well.But now: Devs abandonned this game. They promised a snooker mode. There is none. They took ages to get the update for the trickshot mode which is basically a lure into buying dlc. This mode is also unpolished, as there was never an update again. And it should have been in the game for release. Well that's ok, i rather wait, than having an unfinished mode. Still no update or the promised snooker mode. Yeah bla bla small dev team...but:There is no reaction of the devs anymore in the forums. So they are planning on bringing a new game (which already is out on xbox) to pc, that is (at least in my opinion) what this game should have been and what we all paid for. But wait, it will cost you extra as it is a standalone game. The fact, that they promised the owners of this game an ""upgrade"" discount does not make it any better. So i say:Do NOT buy this!Such a dev team is not worth your hard earned money. And as there might be the ""real"" version of this game out, this is worth waiting for if you really want it. Might just take another year or so...			"

												An excellent pool simulator with great physics and excellent controls (both M+WASD and gamepad work very well). It has an extensive career mode, free mode, fun challenges with unusual game types, tournaments, and online multi-player mode. Pool Nation is gorgeous - right down the the details in the fabric. The only negative in presentation is that your opponents are disembodied as are you; no physical presentation of the players in the game. There are also no spectators. You play in these gorgeous modern venues with seating for dozens or even hundreds, but they are entirely empty.As someone who has had a slate pool table in my home for most of my life, I find this a compelling simulation and well worth the few dollars of the asking price.

AUDIOElectronicaVISUALDazzlingDIFFICULTYSharp Learning CurveVIBEChillCRAVINGBilliardsON SALEDiscountedPROS: Solid pool simulator with reasonably-dependable multiplayer. Fun single-player tournament mode. Game has a fair amount of complexity not offered in other similar games allowing players to pull off cool shots. CONS: Game has the tendency to occasionally glitch out. Planned features appear to be on an indefinite hiatus, and much-needed updates haven't happened. A bit tough to get a more advanced grasp on the controls. A lot of balls will fly off the table before you get a good feel for what will happen.WORTH: With how badly Pool Nation is beginning to fall apart and how sparingly things get addressed, I'd say wait for a sale. The developer has switched focus to other projects, so I wouldn't hold my breath for this version to come to full fruition.OVERALL: A fun game to share with friends, and it goes on sale for 1.00-2.00USD rather often. The game seems to have an active community, though it has been hard for me personally to get in touch with players I've reached out to. Hoping to see more updates.SCORE:7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Right off the bat, one thing that will catch your attention is the variety of game types.  Most billiards games like to focus only on either 8- or 9-ball.  Those games are here, but they do not stop at that.  Along the game, other games like Rotation and Golf are in the mix.  With nine different ways currently available with Snooker and Trick coming soon, there are plenty of ways to play.Another strong point about the game is the controls.  Like in any other pool game, being able to control the cue ball is important.  Most games simply allow you to aim the ball and adjust the power.  Even though most games stop at this, there are more options to offer.  By being able to adjust the angle of the cue stick as well as where on the cue ball to aim, it gives the option of doing jump and swerve shots, something most billiard games leave out.  Additionally, with a full tutorial teaching how to do all of these moves, it does not take long before they become second nature.Beyond all the gameplay details, a nice touch about the game is the amount of customization available.  Even games that try to simulate pro billiards tend to stick to a single, sometimes sponsored look throughout the game.  This one goes beyond the basics.  As soon as you start a game, the highly detailed and moving locals make it feel like you are in what could be a real location.  As you keep progressing, at least a dozen locals, cue sticks, ball sets, and even table decals make it that regardless your taste, there is plenty to see even from a visual standpoint.Once the single-player game is over, there is still more to play.  Through online multiplayer, it is possible to keep playing with others.  It is even possible to create tournaments to learn who the best player is.  However, the one drawback is that there is no local multiplayer mode available.  This means that in order to play with another person in the same room, the two of you must play through a network.  This feels like a major oversight.  A simple hot seat patch would have made that the game could be a great party game.  Even without local multiplayer, this is still a great package that any billiards fan can easily enjoy.			"

I never thought I would buy a pool game but for £1.04 it was so worth it. It is definetely worth even £7. I recommend giving this game a go. Although it may not be a game you spend hours upon hours playing it is for sure a game worth getting.

												The difficulties I have with Pool Nation start in the fact that I already know ho to play pool. I will explain: The english in Pool Nation does not accurately represent the way in which a ball would travel with said spin. Top and bottom english when making a cut shot can cause the cue ball to travel more left or right on the deflection, and this is not represented at all.Left/right english isn't actually as useful on a pool table as an amateur might think. I rarely use left/right english in real pool, as top/bottom english can account for most necessary ball control.As I can best explain it: Top and bottom english account most for how the cue ball deflects off the object ball, and left/right english effects the way the cue ball deflects off rails. There is a small amount of effect with left/right on ball deflection, and top/bottom on rail deflection, but it is very slight.This has to do with the fact that the rail is a solid unmovable force, and ball deflection is sympathetic to mass/friction.My previous pool experience makes this game very unintuitive!

												Hands down the best Pool game out there. Beautiful textures, great physics and enough variation in games to keep you busy for a while. Best of all it runs great on my old-as-dirt PC.Multiplayer is a blast, especially if you can get a group together for a tournament. The free roaming camera allows for amazingly framed shots when you are brodcasting the game. Your spectators won't get bored!Multiple levels of difficulty are present, and should gbe used if you are looking for a challenge. The novice mode is only good for the first few rounds, as it reveals quite a bit of the ball paths. My only complaint here is that champion mode perhaps reveals too much as well (Cue ball only).Tricks shots are a blast to pull of and never get old. Experimenting with angles and english prove to be highly satisfying. Especially when you pot the winning shot with a knifes edge. Looking forward to the new mode: Box of Tricks, and maybe Trading cards? (wink wink).			"

												I don't really try to take this game too seriously. I mostly play it when I need to think or if I'm planning a grocery list.But in all seriousness, it has decent ball physics and there's a true to life satisfaction when sinking the balls in order and never sinking the cue ball. Love every second of it.My only complaint is there's only one background, I'd love to play in a smoky cafe or bar with moody light and a lit cigar on the counter.			"

												The physics are spot on and the graphics are stunning. the developers Cherry Pop Games deserve an award for everything they have done.The developers are keen to listen to our feedback and have addressed everything there customers report as well as adding new things based on our requests. Without aiming aids it will even improve your real game. Hands down the best pool game to date and hats off to Cherry pop games for providing a game and level of service a lot of other game companies could learn from.Game : 9.0/10Graphic : 9.0/10			"

												I play pool in real life and I must say, the physics are just as awesome as the visuals. However, the developers seem to only care about money. Just read the reviews on Pool Nation FX and you'll understand. Promised tons of great things with this game, only to drop it and make the same game with a new title. You had something great on your hands, CP, and you b**** slapped us all with it, then threw away the glove. If you have friends to play this with then it's totally worth it but that's about it, since no one plays this online anymore.			"

												Pool Nation is one of the most polished indie games of 2013- the animations are shiny and smooth, the gameplay is responsive and the physics are realistic. You won't find yourself screaming at this game for bouncing your balls in the wrong direction, or glitching out and dropping your cue ball through the table. With eleven game modes including tournaments, online play, and single-player endurance mode; as well as a slew of collectables to unlock, Pool Nation has no shortage of goodies to keep gameplay fresh.The single player component revolves primarily around tournaments where you take on AI challengers of ever increasing difficulty. Each match has an associated list of challenges, and completing them unlocks a variety of cosmetic changes like cues and balls. Standard games like 9 ball are present along with more interesting options like Golf, which challenges you to put specific balls into specific pockets. There’s also a time attack style mode, where balls spawn on the table and you have to sink as many as possible in the time limit. There are Free Play, Versus, and Online modes present too, but I had a hard time finding anyone to challenge online.Pool Nation is a great looking game that features bright and shiny graphics that makes each game, literally, feel new and different. There are some good themes on the game's soundtrack, and though the game's controls look difficult to use, they aren't difficult to learn. There are also options that can be easily turned on or off to give players assists in a game including arrows that point at the next balls that need to be hit or arrows that show where a ball will travel when hit. All of these features combine to make an excellent presentation for Pool Nation. But is it fun? In short stints I definitely enjoyed playing the game, but it isn’t the type of thing I’d want to play for hours at a time. Having said that, I think Pool Nation is the kind of experience that would be a hit at a house party. If you’ve been searching far and wide for a Billiards simulator, and don’t have room for an actual table, Pool Nation is probably the solution. The physics are solid, the controls allow for extreme fine tuning of shots, and everything looks super shiny. A few more game types would be welcome, but for $10 Pool Nation is the gold standard in the category.

												- All Racked Up -I quite enjoy Pool Nation.I find something soothing about it.Of course, I'm an avowed novice (I just loves my crutches), who would rather chat and play, in a more languid sorta way, than be champ. (Though, if by some miracle, I were to become champ, it would be sooo cool.)I mean, there's something very gratifying about being on a 6 ball streak, while carrying on a casual conversation, with friends, about the stupid decisions the characters on Walking Dead make.But, play on any other setting and I'd have to put on my ugly old game face and actually concentrate on each shot, and...well, I don't wanna.Oh yeah, I've also recently discovered that it's a wonderful little comedown after a long hard evening of pulling ""overkill"" jobs in Pay Day 2, as well.However...On the other hand, the game can be a bit glitchy.Like, it won't let me exit.  It asks me if I would like to exit, I say yes, and then it just sits there blankly looking at me.I almost always have to close it via task manager.Even worse, there was a point, early on, where it would just shut down and chuck me onto my desktop.  Once, it actually crashed as I was hitting the 8 ball in for a win.Thank goodness, that seems to have stopped, though the exit problem still persists. It's a minor glitch, which alone, will certainly not stop me from playing.I mean, it would be nice if they'd fix it... but, honestly, in my mind, task manager has pretty much become the default mode of exit now, anyway.Note: I bought this during a Steam sale for less than half the regular price.  A fact that  has, of course, influenced this rating. "

												Pick up and play pool fun with beautiful detail throughout! I have been looking for a good pool game for years, being a long time fan of the very early ""Yahoo Pool"" (was the only thing I did with Yahoo) I have been hunting ever since. This game retails for $9.99 but I got it for the week long sale for $1.49, I feel it's easily worth the retail price. If you are a fan of pool, and are looking for a legit game to play with friends, make sure you all buy this one, then let me know so we can play together!UPDATE: 7-29-14 I had some questions and suggestions for this game so I popped into the community hub to ask them. I wanted a lobby system where people could link up and pick rooms, and servers to play in with friends. I wanted it more social (like old yahoo pool) where you could have many people watching, chatting in the chat box and getting ready to play winner. Well, after asking the question I heard back from the developers. They in fact are working on a new pool game where these features will be featured. They are re creating a pool game engine from the ground up to allow these features. I am excited for THAT game!			"

												Hey guys, thanks for reading my reviews. Let me make this as plain as possible. If you like pool and can find this cheap, check it out. It's not bad at all. I think the controls are better here in many ways than I've seen in previous PC pool games, but what's the game really like? You get nine ball, eight ball, and a few mini-games. There is a trick mode that hasn't been put into the game yet apparently. The humor is painful mostly, but not always bad. Just never very clever or subtle.As for the negative stuff: I think it gets repetitious. It's also buggy. I don't like the AI at all, as it sometimes seems too transparent what's happening in the game. Some of the rounds a really good AI player will goof several times in a row to give me a chance to beat it. Other times it feels like it's cheating to win.  Sometimes the match challenges don't appear to count properly or are too literally applied, and it seems inconsistant with its application of what meets the requirements of a given challenge. For example, I played a match that wanted me to get a 3 ball streak with a jump shot. I got a 4 ball streak with a jump at the end and it didn't count it. The next time I played, it seemed to count it. So I just don't trust the AI at all. Also, some of the designer ball sets that you can unlock confuse me visually because the stripes and solids look too similar to me from a distance. The settings are very colorful, which isn't necessarily bad, but can be VERY loud. Anyway, even though this seems a negative review, it's not meant to be. The devs say they are working to improve it, and if they do I think it has a lot of potential. As it is, if you can get it for a very low price and you like pool, try it. I've enjoyed playing it, but it can be frustrating at times.			"

												If you like pool, this is your best (and only) option on steam. It looks great and sounds great technically and stylistically. There are nearly no loading times after you start the game, making beginning and playing games as fast as you want it to be. For playing pool itself, there are lots of easy to use but hard to master options for doing more tricky shots. Curve balls, jump balls, bank balls. It's all there and can be executed with serious precision. Even when you knock a ball clean off the table, the satisfying crunch on the floor makes a failed shot sound so sweet.There's really not much that can be done to improve this game. The only trouble I've had with this game is using the replay function and the online multiplayer isn't very active, but the core game is as solid as an 8-ball. If you have any interest in video game pool, this is as good as it gets.			"

												Pool Nation delivers a solid billiards simulation experience.  It makes the grade in the areas critical to this type of game:  the physics are sound,the shot-making is clean, and there's enough variety in the game types to keep things fresh for a while.  On top of that, the game is downright beautiful.There are some flaws, but nothing game-breaking.  The most glaring (for me, anyway) was that the game feels literally empty.  When shooting, you're shooting in a seemingly deserted hall.  There's no crowd, no opponent squirming in the chair as you knock the balls down.  Speaking of your opponents, while their descriptions are modestly humorous, there's little to differentiate them from one to the next.  At times it feels a bit sterile.  Again, this isn't really game-breaking.  But part of the allure of playing at the bar or hall is the atmosphere, and the game is lacking in that regard.All in all, though, the plusses outweigh the minuses.  If you're a billiards enthusiast, this game is just about value for money at full price and a bargain if you can pick it up on sale.			"

TL;DRA solid arcadey pool game with a variety of modes. Despite the small playerbase and no previously promised snooker mode, I recommend it to any fool pan pool fan, especially on sale.+ User-friendly mechanics+ Gorgeous graphics and flashy gameplay (jump shots, swerve shots, etc.)+ A variety of gamemodes (honourable mention: endurance mode)+ Witty descriptions+ Fitting soundtrack+ Fair AI+ Lots of cues, decals, and ball sets- Small playerbase- No promised snooker mode- Minor bugsREVIEWPool Nation is an arcadey pool simulation game. This one takes the player to the world of fancy lounges, chillout music, and jump shots.The game is very accessible: tutorials are short but cover important basics to get one started. One can also adjust the aiming aid level (novice -> veteran -> pro -> champion -> off) which is a huge plus. Players can test their skills against the AI opponents in VS and Career modes, as well as against other people, and solo in the Endurance mode. The last mode is a time trial and requires quick thinking and precise shots, as the balls spawn faster as the time goes by and when the ball count on the table reaches 24, the game is over.The career mode is divided into two tournaments (9-ball and 8-ball), each with four cups. There are 12 matches in each cup plus a couple of bonus matches in lesser known modes, such as killer, 3-ball, speed pool, and the like. Each of the matches has two optional challenges to complete, for instance finishing a match with a skill shot, a ball streak, etc. Completing certain matches unlocks cosmetics. There are loads of decals, cues, and ball sets to be earned and the only problem is that they seem to reset to default ones every time the game is started. It is a minor issue but worth mentioning nonetheless.This game looks and sounds great. The sounds of cue action combined with jazzy muzaks in the background create a laid-back atmosphere. Sit back, take the weight off your shoulders, and pot the balls like a boss – this game lets one do just that. Furthermore, the AI is fair for the most part and the difficulty curve is not very steep, making the experience very pleasant and virtually rage-free.Overall, I recommend getting this game on sale to any fan of billiards games. While it may not be a realistic simulation and its playerbase may be really small, this game can provide hours of entertainment and satisfy the itch for some pool action. It indeed is a shame that the snooker mode was not delivered, given how much fun this game is.P.S. Sit back, grab a beverage of choice, and read more reviews here: http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/recommended/My curation page: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/FVABot/curation "

												I was reluctant to get this game despite many positive reviews because it is a billiards game and I play pool IRL too. Luckily, I got the discount item from one of my badge sets and was able to buy this game for $1.00. It is the best dollar I have ever spent in my life. The physics is amazing and gameplay is very smooth. I tried out ""endurance"" first and before I realized it, a few hours went by >_>As much as I enjoy this game so, I cannot recommend getting this game at full price because that would be hypocritical.. I do not buy games unless they are on sale :DThis game has online matches/tournaments, but I have not tried it yet.. Too busy jump, curve, kick shooting from across the table.tl;dI got this game for $1.00Best billards game I have ever played (I don't know if that is saying much from what I've had experience with).If you have any interest in pool table I would highly recommend this game.Has online matches and tournaments.Incredible trick shots.Rating 9.5/10 (+2 Price, +3 Great Game, +2 Replayability, +1 Simple controls, +0.5 Smooth game (crashes if you try to change windows while fullscreen. don't know if its just me. Other than that I have had no problems with this game), +1 Great visuals and music)			"

												This game is really well made. Very realistic physics (despite the tricks I can do here, I could never do in real life). I have had no issues or problems playing the game. Single player - at time has been tough to get all the stars as I slowly make my way through it. Toughest is the time limit for me to pot all balls and 8 ball last - but fun just the same.Multiplayer - a bunch of us had a tournament (double elimination) for the game. It was a lot of fun. We even twitched games for each other to see and our subscribers/groups to view. It was a lot of fun. It because though noticeable with flow kb/m v controller.I think this is probably the best pool PC game I have played. It is well done and I highly recommend. I plan on continuing to work my way through single player and play against friends when I can.I recommend this game. "

												This game is not bad but AGAIN it got abandonned by Cherry Pop. Abandoning their games not long after launch is a trademark from this joke of a dev team. Stealing money is also their trademark and they are now recognised just for this. Avoid this game at all cost unless you plan to play alone or against the stupid AI.			"

												The TL;DR: Amazing Pool game for both veterans and beginners. With many game modes(rule sets) and Free Play, local and online multiplayer, and several things to aid beginners, such as aim assist, an interactive tutorial to teach trick shots, and to always have the controls listed on the side of the screen. This, of course, can all be turned off.Great pool game! The main game modes in single player seem to be 8 and 9 Ball Tour Modes, where you play that ruleset against increasingly difficult AI opponents, who have humorous Bios. However they have other game modes/rule sets as Bonus Matches in the tour. Each opponent has 3 Stars you can collect as an added challenge, which can be completed for extra replayability. You get the first star simply by beating the opponent, which will also unlock the next opponent. The other 2 stars are gained by completing the objectives which are different for each opponent, then winning, since even if you complete the objectives, they won't count unless you win the match too. These Challenges range from doing specific trick shots, reaching a certain score, using no flashbacks(feature where you can redo a shot twice per match), etc. There is only one use for stars. Each of the Bonuses Matches are 'linked' to an opponent. When you beat that opponent, therefore getting 1 star, the next opponent is unlocked. However, to unlock the Bonuses Match linked to that opponent, you must have at least 2 stars, which includes the one you get for beating him.There are 2 Tour modes, each containing the same 4 competitions, each divided into 3 Rounds. Each competition is increasingly more difficult. In order of easiest to hardest: Sky Lounge Cup, Exchange Square Cup, West Coast Trophy, and Valley Lodge Masters. Initially you only have access to the Sky Lounge and Exchange Square Cup, but you can unlock them in order, starting from the Exchange Square Cup if you wish.Each Competition features a new area, and each Round features a version of that area at a different time of day. So Round 1 for the Sky Lounge During the Day, Round 2 for Evening, and Round 3 for night. Each time of day alters the look of the area to varying degrees, all of which look great. Beating a round will unlock that location/time to choose when creating a Versus or Online game.Now for the Bonus Matches I mentioned. In each Tour mode, there are various 'Bonus Matches' which deviate from the 8/9 Ball ruleset, which are Straight, Rotation, Killer, 3 Ball, etc. Completing the bonus match will award you a star, and also unlock a new graphic for either your Cue Stick, Table Decal, or Pool Ball skin. Bonus Matches are not necessary for advancing in the Tour.There is also a Versus game mode, which can be against a human player or against the AI. You start with one AI opponent on the easiest difficulty, and you unlock more by defeating them in the 8 and/or 9 Ball Tour. For a Human vs Human Versus game, it's a local multiplayer game, where you either share the keyboard and mouse, or 1 person uses the keyboard/mouse and the other uses a Controller. Theres many ways you can set up a Versus game: You can change the look of the Cue Stick, Pool Balls, and the Table Decal with skins/textures you've unlocked during the Tours Bonus Matches. You can change the ruleset, ranging from the classic 8 Ball and 9 Ball, to Straight Ball, Speed, Killer, Golf, 3 Ball, and Rotation rulesets. Online mode is basically the same, but with added ranked/unranked/custom options.In the main menu there's also ""Free Play"" mode. This give you the 9 Ball set up, but you can do anything you like. There's no human opponent, and you can consider it a practice mode, especially for practicing your trick shots. You can pick up the cue ball whenever you like and place it wherever you like. Once you pocket all the balls, it simply resets the table. I like to use this mode when I want to relax, practice trick shots, or just goof around and see how many balls I can send flying off the table in one shot. Pity you can't send it through a window. :pAlso in the main menu is Endurance mode. In this mode you need to make shots(also called 'potting' or 'pot') as fast as you can. New balls will constantly spawn, and when the active ball count on the table reaches 24, you lose, so you need to keep potting. After potting enough shots, you'll earn a brief period will the spawn rate will completely stop, giving you some breathing room.One thing that should definitely be mentioned, is the Aim System. There's various aim modes which will project not only where the Cue Ball will go, but the direction of the ball you're hitting. This is great for making not only regular shots, but making trick shots easy too. There's multiple levels of Aim projection, which will gradually decrease how far it will project the shot, then only show the cue ball's path, and finally no aim mode, where it won't even show the Cue Ball's path. This, combined Free Play, will help you become better and better.While we're on the subject of practicing, there's a Tutorial mode in the Single Player menu. This will teach you how to do various shots. From simple straight shots, to Jumping, Curving, Knife, Kick, Bank, etc shots. It's great for learning the various moves. There is an odd graphic bug/oversight. While the tutorial plays, it will always show the keyboard/mouse bindings at the top, but when it's your turn to try the shot, it'll show whatever control method you're using. It's not a big deal, since the controls are simple and there's even an option in the settings that will let you push the Help button, which is 'X' for controllers and 'K' for Keyboard, and will show all the controls at anytime and any game mode, so this game does great for helping beginners, but has the option of turning them off. You can save replays of your matches too, so you can view them again. Also works in Free Play mode. The replay feature isn't as fleshed out as it could have been, but it's okay.People have complained about controls, so I'll throw in my opinion: After playing it for a few hours with both the Xbox Controller and Keyboard, it does feel like it was intended to be played with the controller. HOWEVER, the keyboard and mouse controls are still great and nowhere near as bad as some have complained, and feel almost completely natural. I say 'almost' because I'm the type to keep my hand in a single position and dislike moving it too far. However, it's very easy to remap the keys closer, and honestly, only 2 or 3 keys I needed to move closer, and they weren't even necessary really. And in the Straight ruleset, the shot calling function was very awkward and overly sensitive for the keyboard/mouse. The replay modes keyboard/mouse controls are also awkward to use no matter how you map it.Anyway, to summarize: Great pool game, many game modes, online multiplayer, and great controls for BOTH the keyboard+mouse and controller. Most of the complaints on the keyboard controls are over exaggerated.Master Edit: Apparently there's a character limit to reviews, though I'm guessing it's rare for someone to waffle on enough to reach it. So yeah, I've edited this review over 6 times adding more info and correcting mistakes. Had to delete the other edits to make room for more waffle.			"

												Recommended.Depending on what you're looking for the single player campaigns are lacking.  There are a lot of opponents but they felt very identical to play against.  However, I wasn't working towards the challenges against each opponent and going for those could be fun, although they're usually pretty same-y (x match score, x-ball streak).  Additionally, there are actual stand-alone challenges but of the few I played they were pretty boring.  While they did break up gameplay when I found it necessary, the AI is so unpredictable  that modes like speed challenge or 3 ball just aren't that much fun.As a 8-Ball and 9-ball simulator, though, this game is pretty excellent.  The physics work, there's a guiding shot marker to help  you learn how to shoot better (this can also be turned off, or reduced) and the game is pretty.  Pool Nations ia  large step up from those crappy flash games.Online play seems functional.  At the very least I didn't have any issues with it.  For online play there are a lot of interesting game modes past 8 and 9 ball including 3 ball, straight, rotation, speed, and killer.  Of those I only tried killer (possibly speed in the campaign) and it was fun, though it felt more like a quick distraction between a few rounds of 8 ball.So yes, I recommend this game.  It's much, much better for me than driving down to the Pool Hall, especially when I can't guarantee I'll have anyone to play.  This is something I needed in my life and it's nice to have, but I also recognize that it's probably not for everyone.  I've only played a handful of times and only for a few hours total.  It's definitely a pick up and play for a few rounds and then put it down for a few weeks kind of game, though that is exactly what I wanted.Oh, and I guess there are features that haven't been implemented yet but are on their way like the box of tricks.  That mode seems fairly interesting.			"

												Being a gentlemanly fan of both snooker and pool myself, I felt I should give this game a go, and I was most certainly not dissapointed! It is most certainly a woppingly spiffing game, and I must say, it does rather feel as if you are really playing this fine game in real life! You are able to do tournaments, do some rather excellent trick shots and although the challenges make me want to throw my tea across the room sometimes (which would be a scandal!) it only makes you want to play it more and take those challenges head on. By golly! I give this riveting game 4 Cups of Tea out of 5! Tally-Ho!			"

												Extremely fun game!Pool Nation has a very realistic physics engine, with very nice graphics. There is a ton of achievements to be unlocked and replayability is great.There are, however, a few problems with this game: a) If you simply want a quick game, it isn't so quick, because there are lots of menus to go through, and the cutscenes before the game starts are painfully long. b) the graphics are great, beautiful, but some of them very unrealistic when it comes to pool tables. The developers did a great job exploring the rendering engine they had in hand, but I believe there was no need for so many fancy and colored pool tables and balls. IMHO, a pool table has to be green. Forget about everything else, because it just gets in the way of the game.Neverthless, Pool Nation is a great game, worth every penny. I am not afraid to say it is possibly the best pool game ever made, and the closest thing to a pool/billiard/snooker simulator.If the developers ever read this, I have a suggestion: make it possible to create custom game rules, like we do in real life.

												This game is just brilliant. If you're looking for a highly realistic pool simulator, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a reasonably realistic pool sim with awesome trick shot potential, you've found it and believe me, jumping the cue ball in slow motion, over your opponents blockade and potting your own ball in the process is completely badass.I love it.

												First off, this is the best looking pool game I have ever played.  Period.Beautiful pool tables, balls, and environments that are fully fleshed out and animated to give you a real sense of immersion.The game is full of details that kept surprising me.  Some of them are so subtle that you can't even notice it unless you are watching the replay.  Here are a few things you will find:* 3rd dimension: this isn't a simple pool game where balls stick to the table.  All pool balls can be knocked off, up in the air, and over other balls (given enough force).* When hit certain ways, chalk will fall off stick and sprinkle on the table.* Tiny woven texture on table material when you zoom in close* Sides of table (bumpers) actually give and bend in when a ball hits them with force (very hard to notice without replay!)For single player there is enough to keep you busy for awhile with tournaments in various game types against different AI.  One thing I found keeping my interest is bonuses you can try for on each game in a tournament.  For instance one might have a bonus for pulling off a jump shot during the match.  You can still win the game, but there will be a bonus for doing the jump shot.  Earning these stars while winning makes for a fun challenge.There are also many ball styles, cue sticks, and locations to unlock through single player.  So far every ball set I have unlocked has been great looking and is a good incentive to keep playing and unlock more.For multiplayer, it is fully functional in both same computer and online play.  Unsurprisingly you have to wait awhile for a game to show up, but that's less the fault of the game and more of the popularity of online pool :).Last I should go over the physics.  This is a tough point to argue because so many factors go into pool physics and without a doubt there is no game out there that is 100% accurate.  If you have ever seen a ball hit another ball at high speed in close up slow motion you'll see what I mean.  Not to mention there are many different ball sizes/weight, table materials and cue sticks used in different areas that add to the difficulty in comparing this to the real world.All I can say for sure is the physics seem real and have been really fun.  Added to the ability to hit the ball just where I want at power levels I never could in RL the game makes you feel like a pool master.Game is on sale for $1.99 currently.  Sell a couple summer trading cards and pick it up!			"

												This is an awesome pool simulator. I think it is even the only pool table game on Steam! That is great because I love pool table. The graphics are fantastic, and the style is very modern. You are usually playing in a tall apartment building. The AI's are very smart, I wish they could use the AI's as a feature. They could make two AI's play against each other, creating a randomly generated game of pool table. I think it would be fun to watch! Anyways, I read some reviews about the .exe crashing, and unfortunately, as good as this game is, the glitch is true. The game does crash, almost every play through. I got one in my first minute opening the game. Then I tried again, and then it happened after 30 minutes of playing. It is really hard to sit down and enjoy the game when it randomly crashes. You never know when either, sometimes it's during the splash screen, and sometimes during gameplay. It is hard to sit down, relax, and enjoy the game, when it crashes spontaneously. The developers have a gem, and they are letting a stupid glitch put it to waste. Please fix the game. And also do the AI thing! I'd love to see 2 AI's play against each other. It would create a randomly generated game of pool table.			"

												A very addicting pool game that also has visual appeal added in. Online matches are few and far between to find, but hosting your own is usually the best way to get into action quick. An added bonus is that you can practice while you wait for an online partner to join. The single player mode is very addicting and it's my most played because the computer gets harder to play and you also have the added pressure of getting all three stars while still winning the game. There are trick shots galore which makes playing even more fun and makes the table open to basically any shot. One added huge bonus is that the developers are constantly reading the discussion forums and tailoring the game to what we discuss. Thank you for making such a wonderful game.Highly recommended.			"

												If you want a pool game, go for this. It's really great, teaches you all you need, gives you fair difficulty as you progress, unlocks skins for your balls :D About the soundtrack, 2 songs, nice and long, but if you play for more than 10 minutes, they get kinda old. Also, the game stops working anytime you alt+tab. That's all, if you like pool, get this. I get nicely relaxed playing this, I love all pub-like games. 8/10 "

However the multiplayer appears to be a broken mess that failed to connect to any of my friends or find anyone in the game lobbies.  My friends who bought the game also have the same issues.  Since we purchased for the soul reason of playing against each other, I've unfortunately had to request a refund of the game.			"

												Excellent Pool simulation with superb physics and awesome visuals. The game plays well but the locations lack a little variety. Its certainly worth the purchase and will provide hours of fun and is certainly the best pool game to hit the PC in a long time.There is a choice of 8 ball and 9 ball play plus various other novel play modes inc speed pool, golf and killer mode.The control of the game is intuitive and the developers continue to improve the game.To sum things up I think there was a gap in the market for a good pool game on the PC and this one fills it nicely!

												Nice little Billiardsim, at least the only available on steam wich is worth to be played. Full HD, good physics, nice gfx & sfx, local and also online mp wich is easy to access and uses steam functions like invite friend from friendlist. The difficulty in the standart setting for a experienced pool player is way to easy - you will feel like a billiardproof when having all the helping lines turn on. IF you turn off the helping lines or just set them to one of the 4 other presets like champion the game will become more like the real feeling because not every shot will be a putting. Different type of Billiard games makes it interesting to play again. And there is also a snooker mode announced wich i look forward too. Play this with a friend online or local is the most fun, but also the single player option serve some fun. For experienced and for newcomers this game is worth every penny. You can even train your real skills this way without killing some poolshops tables ^^. As some kind of bonus you can customize your tables , cues and also all the billiard balls.			"

												Great pool game from the graphics to the ball physics. Controls feel great, especially using the mouse as a virtual cue system. Graphics are crisp and colourful with great reflections on balls. Sound is good, music isn't too annoying buy can be turned off if you prefer (which I do). Its challaneging with every game in its tournaments having 3 stars you can unlock for doing specific things like skill shots or winning without losing a frame etc. This means even if you win the tournaments you can go back to specific matches in the tournaments to try and unlock the stars. Lots of unlockable cues, ball sets, locations and decals for the tables.My only downside would be that I hoped more people would be playing this game online. I have found and played people online but there doesn't appear to be many. Hopefully this side of things will improve but even without online gameplay the game is great and well worth the asking price. Best pool game on the PC by far.			"

												This is an excellent, laid-back game that you can play to kill time or relax -- either solo or with a friend. It brings back good memories of playing billiards on miniclip.com wayyy back in the day. The soundtrack compliments the game very well, and I find myself wishing I could download its music.As others have said, the keyboard+mouse controls are somewhat clunky. Luckily I was first introduced to this game on Xbox where I learned how to play with a controller, so when I picked it up on Steam I stuck with that control scheme. I recommend you use a controller if you're able to.I'm not sure if I would recommend this as a $10 game though, since I picked it up heavily discounted in one of the seasonal sales. If you're interested in getting it then wait for a sale -- it'll probably be like $1 or $2.			"

												It's all so shiny and bloom...  bloomy?You'll either take to the presentation or you won't, but the game itself will scratch any pool itch you're currently afflicted with.  Nice and solid, although clearly designed with touchscreens in mind, but if you're playing with a mouse you'll get used to the format in minutes. There's a limit to what can be done with a pool game, but this does its best to keep things interesting - you'll progress through rounds in several tournaments, but each will have little optional challenges to complete; get a streak of 6 balls, pot a ball with a jump shot, that kind of business.

This is a game where you aim and shoot and no-body gets hurt.  I can even try outrageous trick shoots without worrying about ruining the felt or breaking a window.

The tutorials do a great job at teaching you the basics and even more advanced moves. You also get various levels of assists, which you can turn off completely for a more realistic experience. The music isn't great but everything else the game has to offer is full of character. Once you get into it you'll be hooked.			"

This is great, relaxing and fun pool game, many gaming modes and lots of fun. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact it doesn't gave PUB location. All locations are a bit way too shiny for me. So, we do need PUB location, not so shiny balls and an option to insert our own music to game via jukebox in the corner, because to be honest, music in the game is as far away from the pool as I can imagine it.If you want to play a nice game of pool, look no further, Pool Nation is great.

												This game really caught my eye on steam, and how could it not, it’s so very very shiny. Released originally on PSN Cherry Pop ported their billiards game over to the PC and is available for $10 via steam.What we have here is really a modern pool game. A sparkling beautiful graphics engine combined with an impressive realistic physics engine all to send shiny balls flying around a table. It’s smooth, it’s pretty, it’s gorgeous. (click on some of my high-res screenshots and see for yourself!) Really what else do you need to know? If you like pool games then it’s for you, if you don’t, all the shiny graphics in the world probably won’t change your mind. What you might expect from a pool game is all here, an 8-ball and 9-ball tour to play through with slowly increasing difficulty as well as some other game modes to throw in some variety.There are also arbitrary points systems that award you points based upon added difficulty of shots (kinda like the way skater games give you points for harder tricks) and as you progress through each tour there are challenges to meet in each match to unlock extra goodies. It’s all your typical completionist fluff we’ve grown to expect from games these days but they do add some extra challenge and drives you to try to be more creative as you play. I also found I enjoyed most of the challenge modes that are unlocked during the tour play although a couple get a little tedious and boring.Everything in the game is well crafted, the table is high textured, the balls well polished and reflective, and even the backgrounds are rich with detail and eye candy. The art style is beautiful and there’s even interesting little blurbs written about each opponent you play against. But all of this eye candy is just background noise to distract you from pocketing those balls! The game really shines though when it comes to trick-shots. Jump shots, draw backs, kick shots, even riding the rail is all possible with the engine. With full control to put on as much english and angle on your shot as you’d like you can put together some pretty sweet shots. Thanks to the shot guides they are not very difficult to learn and once you start pulling them off with regularity your options with each shot open wide. Best of all, the AI knows and uses them just as well which creates quite a challenge as you progress through the game.The trick-shots are definitely best seen in video as screenshots cannot do them proper justice. You’ll be hopping over balls and making crazy draw backs in no time making you feel quite the awesome player. The game is, however, not without it’s flaws. A common complaint I have of many games, the music started to get annoying to me but this is not the first game I’ve had to mute the music and play my own. It is also clear that it is a port rather than designed specifically for the PC.The menus sometimes feel a bit awkward navigating with a mouse and I feel some of the controls are awkward. For example rotating my cue around the cue ball to line up a shot only involves moving mouse left or right, yet my natural inclination is to try to circle the mouse around the cue ball. It made for some very frustrating moments until I realized this. Also I found the video replay system to be- clunky at best. Still even with these small complaints I’d definitely recommend the game if you ever find yourself wanting to shoot some pool.Nailed it!Nailed it!Final Score:Graphics: 10/10Game Play: 8/10Music / Ambiance: 8/10Story: -/10Value: 8/10Overall: 8.5/10Read more indy game reviews on my blog!http://markofithian.com "

												Very nice pool game, even fun to play alone vs AISingleplayer has: Tutorial, box of trickshots (or something) 4x 9-ball tours, 4x 8-ball toursTours include certain ammount of AI matches.Each match can give you 1-3 stars.Usually you get 1 star by winning match which also unlocks next match and then other stars you get when doing certain task during the match (you still need to win the match also)Tasks like: Perform comboshot during match or kickshot or get streak of 7 balls in match + much of other stuff like that.Also getting 2 stars in certain matches will unlock bonus match in that tour.Each tour contain few bonus match to unlock.I have completed first 9-ball tour by 71% and it took me 6 hours, so if other tours take as much time it means total 48h of gameplay and still you havent compeleted everything by 100%, so this game has plenty of nice singleplayer content for your money.Totally recommend this game but be warned: Multiplayer is dead, so dont buy it for online multiplayer			"

												There really is no negative reviews this game should get.  People buying it know exactly what the game is: billiards.  It's not like there is at all any surprise.  You don't get surprised that Taco Bell serves tacos so why would you be surprised a game called Pool Nation is anything but pool? Overall I found it to be addictive fun.  When I bought it, the game was at I'd say a dollar and it was the best thing I've ever bought with only one dollar (NOT EVEN TAX!) I could have bought gum or soda with that $1 but that won't last me and is not as enjoyable as something you can share in an online session with.  If you like or would want to learn about playing pool, this game is honestly the best (and only) pool game I know of.  The only con is that because it is for the computer, the gameplay takes some time to get used to (whether you use the keyboard or a controller).  However, the amount of time it takes you to learn how to play with buttons (versus using an actual pool stick) is time that you also gain experience and tips; so realistically you are not losing anything but gaining more than you pay for!  Being taught how to play a sport (that can be used for real life) is so worth paying only a dollar for.  McDonald's doesn't even have a dollar menu anymore; it's like $1.50.  Though I was fortunate at the time and the game is back to its' original price, the pirce is $9.99 (NOT EVEN $10!!) so it's not too bad a price.  I SAY GET IT!!! But who am I to say?  See for yourself.  You won't be displeased.+Physics: Way too realistic! :)+Price: Cheap!!! :)+Customizable: To some degree.+ Music: Relaxing (If you are immature like me, I thought of porno background music). "

												Oh, this is addicting as heck. I can't put the cue stick down. What's great about this game is you can choose the aim style, from full out novice aim to completely off (which is really hard for me since I suck at billards in real life lol). This kind of reminds me of yahoo pool but more controls over everything! It's a great buy, glad I picked it up for $1.50 and I recommend everyone grab it while you can for this price!Edit: If you Alt-Tab out your game will probably crash. If you Tab-Shift to check your other monitor or change music etc, your game will probably crash lol. Hopefully they will fix this.			"

												Very well done Pool game. I'm a long time Virtual Pool player (15+ years). Physics could be a teeny bit better, like the english (ball spin) physics. In real life, pockets on a pool table have angled cushions around the pocket to help your ball in, should you hit them correctly...In this game however, if you don't hit the ball straight into the pocket, it's not going in. If you hit the angled portion around the pocket, it will just reject your ball much of the time, really unforgiving but challenging. Hard to explain...think of a basketball hoop where if you didn't swish the ball, the ball would never go in. I don't use that aim assist or flashback bullcrap either. That's for sissies!Easy on the eyes and shiny as hell, though. I think the lighting on the balls (ha, balls) could be a lot better. Also, like the virtual pool series, it's a great game to play and mute all the in-game sound if you're in the mood to rock out to some of your mp3s, you can fully enjoy your music and the game at the same time.The game is still in development so I think it will improve over time. There are few odd glitches here and there. Buy this game the next time it's on sale and come play with me!			"

												Pool Nation is how I imagine my life would be if I was a lottery winner, a pimp, or Jordan Belfort. The game deserves a solid 9/10, losing out on full marks quite simply because the only thing it’s missing is pornstars wandering around in 6inch stilettos and lines of coke and rolled up 20 dollar bills laying haphazardly about the place.  What this game does extremely well, is that it makes you feel important. It draws you into a world where you can be the person you’ve always wanted to be in real life, a world where paying $15 for a drink wouldn’t make you penniless by end of the evening, a world where every woman wants to blow you and every dude……. Well who gives a f*#k if every chick wants to blow you right?? Pool Nation offers something different than any other pool game I’ve seen before. You can’t quite tell what it is but it’s shinier, sexier, it’s got more curves and it leaves you wanting more every time. In the words of Jon Martello, this is a game where ‘I just ♥♥♥♥in’ lose myself’.			"

												As an avid pool player, this game is perfect, 9ball and 8ball are the two main games (no 10ball, perhaps an idea for an update) with extras including killer, golf, endurance and straight (amongst others). As of this review this game is still the only pool game on steam and quite frankly you don't need to pay for any other once you have bought this, hours of fun await if pool is your thing.One slight negative, and this is me being a little petty is once all the stars have been earned, they stay earned, there is no reset button that i am aware of.

Good Pool Game, Good Product=========This is a very polished game. Great graphics, several game types, tutorials to teach you basic shots through trick shots which you can go back to between games. Good controls for both keyboard/mouse and controller: placement cue on ball(for spins), angle of cue(for jumps), power lock-in and short path prediction. Good physics simulation that has felt natural on every shot.  You can do free-play, tournaments, two-player local or online play, with plenty of customizations.  Music is well done and catchy, too.I am very surprised by the level of polish, the attention to detail, menu controls, load times, re-load times, game options et cetera.  This is a pretty good pool game, but also a fine product in general. The developers did a good job all around.I haven't played long enough to speak to the AI which is a fairly big deal for a game like this, but I have been impressed with everything else so far. There are about 42 different ""characters"" with various degrees of difficulty(novice, veteran, pro). And of course you can play against other people with aim-assist on or off.			"

												It's a pool game. That should be enough to get you to buy it. However, this game is fantastic. You can see the venue in the reflection on the balls. The controls are great and allow you to do swerve shots, jump shots, and knife-edges by setting power, cue angle, and spin. There are a lot of different matches in multiple single player modes (9-ball, 8-ball, etc.) and there are challenges in each one. Some matches unlock a bonus stage in which you can unlock new ball designs or new cues by beating your opponent in things like 3 ball, straight pool, and killer. The only thing it's missing is player models, but that doesn't take away from the game at all. Seriously, it's worth the 10 bucks, but if it's ever on sale, you really should buy it!			"

												Looks gorgeous, lots of characters to play against and great challenges.  It's one of those games that makes you feel good about how good you've got.  Personally, I find lots of beer helps too.  Back in the 00's (yes, I'm that old), I used to love Virtual Pool 3 (which I can't get to run on any platform now), and, after a drought of many years, this has filled the void.  I'd change a couple of things, mainly that you could lock your X-axis when your shooting (but this is mitigated by the ""fine-tune"" key) and I change the power meter thing to a mouse-mapped power (a-la VP3) but apart from that, it's a great pool game.  I'd have to put a shout out for the artwork two, the stylised characters and their back stories is awesome (and it does it all without slam zooms and star wipes)e.  If you've got a hint of imagination, you don't feel like you're playing against some artifically levelled AI (even though you are).  Well done Cherry Pop (now fix the X-axis lock *claps hands* make it so!)Oh, one other thing, the menu system is horrible, could really do with an overhaul.  Thank God you don't have to use it that much!			"

Has decent spin and ball control, Which is highly commendable for a game! AI leaves something to be desired, But the other people seem decent.

												I think Pool Nation is one of those games that knows exactly what it is, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Pool Nation is a billiards game, that's it. It's a slick-looking multiplayer/singleplayer campain billiards game.And it's fun as hell.Weirdly enough, I'm comparing this to Sniper Elite V2. While the two games' topics are in no way similar, both play out in coincidentaly similar ways. For example, both Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2 hav slick, shiny graphics that look AMAZING. The graphics on both games look professionally made and I just love it. Graphics haven't been a huge thing for me, but wow, Pool Nation's graphics are actually better that Call of Duty Ghosts, and to top it off, my computer can run it.Another weird similarity is the ""killcams"". In Sniper Elite V2, if you hit the enemy in a certain place, the camera pans out to the bullet or the enemy, and you get to watch the enemy get shot up close. In Pool Nation, if you make a Skill Shot or just a nice looking shot, the camera sets up on the hole, and you watch the ball fly in. The only difference is, Pool Nation does this less. For me, almost every shot in Sniper Elite was a killcam, and it got annoying as hell (except the ball shots). But the killcams only happen periodically in Pool Nation, and THANK YOU SO MUCH for doing so.And the last thing, if you think about it just a tad, playing pool is almost like sniping. You have to aim carefully at a specifis target (and in some cases many targets) and shoot. Not only to you target all if the solid or striped balls in pool, but you also aim at a certain hole and shoot! How weird is that?So now you know why I compared Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2. Pretty good comparision if you ask me, but overall I think Pool Nation is worth your money. It's an amazing pool game, but its not Steam's only pool game.Buy it and hit me up.			"

												It's a pool game and it's really good!  Physics seem spot-on, controls are functional and graphics are nice and shiny. I've been looking for a decent pool game for years, and this is definitely it. Campaigns were not particularly difficult to finish or long, but I would imagine online is where this game will truly come to life.So yeah, if you want a pool game, this is it. I don't think there really is anything else on the market of comparable quality at the moment.

You certainly get value for money with this game.  While it's not perfect (yet), judging by the forums the devs are very active in listening to what the community has to say, and have already got a Trickshot and Snooker addon in the works.

												As an avid pool player, this game is perfect, 9ball and 8ball are the two main games (no 10ball, perhaps an idea for an update) with extras including killer, golf, endurance and straight (amongst others). As of this review this game is still the only pool game on steam and quite frankly you don't need to pay for any other once you have bought this, hours of fun await if pool is your thing.One slight negative, and this is me being a little petty is once all the stars have been earned, they stay earned, there is no reset button that i am aware of.

												Great game if you love pool / snooker / billiards (those 2 game types will hopefully come soon). The polish is top notch, visuals crisp and stylish, controls nice (pad native too), camera views solid (has top down too), solid AI, unlocks / challenges, save / view replays, trick shots (all the standard spins / tricks and some), current ball and next ball are shown and easy to identify and nice visual aids (and options to increase / decrease this as you please).Aside from the omission of a Snooker game type the only thing missing that would add to the visuals and atmosphere (no doubt the option to turn this off would be needed for lower end systems) is the lack of character models for you and your AI opponents as well as the lack of a crowd in the wonderfully lit / modelled playing environments especially considering the concept character art which gives a good idea of how great this addition would be.Great stuff!

												It's a pool game and it's really good!  Physics seem spot-on, controls are functional and graphics are nice and shiny. I've been looking for a decent pool game for years, and this is definitely it. Campaigns were not particularly difficult to finish or long, but I would imagine online is where this game will truly come to life.So yeah, if you want a pool game, this is it.

												Anyone who likes Pool will like this. The single player and all its unlocks are fairly entertaining but the real joy is found in playing with friends. Unless you turn off the aim assist then you will soon find that you can breeze through the AI players without too much difficulty but, even with it on, it's not so easy to make all the unlocks as it is to win matches. This game is often found on sale (I picked it up from HumbleBundle for around £1.50) and represents astounding value for money. The graphics are clean and sharp and the ball physics are adequately realistic with the exception of some inexplicable ball-off-the-table incidents if you use too much power. 98% - There is simply no better computer simulation of Pool.

												Hands down the best pool game I've played. Graphically, it borders on being a tech demo for high end lighting and reflection effects. It's ridiculously shiny. The felt looks like felt. (I would not be surprised to see this game come bundled with every graphics card released in the next five years. It makes your GPU look like a hero.) The physics are just as good: crisp and consistent. Lots of game modes. Lots of cue sticks, balls, table decals, and pool halls to unlock. (I've played for 9 hours, I'm reasonably good at pool, and I've only opened up the easiest fourth of the unlockables.) Thanks to the quirky descriptions of your opponents before the matches, the game ends up having a ton of personality, considering it doesn't render the players at all, only their ghostly, floating sticks. It's got solid multiplayer, at least for two people. By people I mean friends. You can play big tournaments, in theory, with larger groups of strangers.Perhaps most importantly in the context of 2014 gaming, Pool Nation is getting continued love and support from its devs. Snooker and ""Box of Tricks"" are both coming soon as free updates, and the devs are active in the forums.As I write this, the game is on sale for $1.50. It's correctly priced at $10, so $1.50 is a steal.			"

												Good Stuff: Pool Nation is pretty. Well, okay, you can quite plainly see that, but it's fairly pretty gameplay wise, too. Once you get the hang of the controls... Which is easy enough, because the tutorials are quite helpful, and the aiming sight, even on default settings, is actually useful for everything except hardcore kick shots... The game gives you that little bit of extra motivation to up your game by asking you to do challenges while you beat the AI's♥♥♥♥♥ ...Okay, the AI is also quite fair in this game, and so sometimes (especially on 3-ball, an event you'll love to hate) it'll kick your♥♥♥♥♥ Beat a certain number of challenges, you'll get bonus levels. Beat bonus levels, or certain characters, and you'll get customisation for your table decals, cue decals, and ball style.Problems: There *is* online multiplayer for this game, but sadly, it's very, very dead, presumably because pool afficianados prefer a local fix (I sure do!) Also... The high reflection on the balls can sometimes make it difficult to tell what's what, even in Overhead view. Finally, the soundtrack, while chill, gets a little repetitive at times, and doesn't really cover that ""Playin' Pool/Billiards in a pub/club"" feel.Conclusion: Even for the non-sale price, this game is worth the cash (5 hours in, and while I could *theoretically* beat the AI players in that time, 100%ing each players' challenges is a slightly different story), and for something to relax to, then wonder ""Wait a minute, wasn't it 6PM a minute ago?"", there's few better things than a game of 'puter Pool.

												I think Pool Nation is one of those games that knows exactly what it is, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Pool Nation is a billiards game, that's it. It's a slick-looking multiplayer/singleplayer campain billiards game.And it's fun as hell.Weirdly enough, I'm comparing this to Sniper Elite V2. While the two games' topics are in no way similar, both play out in coincidentaly similar ways. For example, both Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2 hav slick, shiny graphics that look AMAZING. The graphics on both games look professionally made and I just love it. Graphics haven't been a huge thing for me, but wow, Pool Nation's graphics are actually better that Call of Duty Ghosts, and to top it off, my computer can run it.Another weird similarity is the ""killcams"". In Sniper Elite V2, if you hit the enemy in a certain place, the camera pans out to the bullet or the enemy, and you get to watch the enemy get shot up close. In Pool Nation, if you make a Skill Shot or just a nice looking shot, the camera sets up on the hole, and you watch the ball fly in. The only difference is, Pool Nation does this less. For me, almost every shot in Sniper Elite was a killcam, and it got annoying as hell (except the ball shots). But the killcams only happen periodically in Pool Nation, and THANK YOU SO MUCH for doing so.And the last thing, if you think about it just a tad, playing pool is almost like sniping. You have to aim carefully at a specifis target (and in some cases many targets) and shoot. Not only to you target all if the solid or striped balls in pool, but you also aim at a certain hole and shoot! How weird is that?So now you know why I compared Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2. Pretty good comparision if you ask me, but overall I think Pool Nation is worth your money. It's an amazing pool game, but its not Steam's only pool game.Buy it and hit me up.			"

I've never been a huge pool fan but im very addicted to this, at first glance it seems like no ones online but host up a game and wait 2 to 10 minutes and you will find an oponent while you wait you can practice as well so its not just sitting there doing nothing. as far as pool games go there is nothing better that i have seen than this. the environments look really detailed even though most if not all your attention will be on the table. my ONLY two complaint about the game is you cannot alt tab without it crashing in fullscreen mode and the in game chat is pretty buggy.

												Looks gorgeous, lots of characters to play against and great challenges.  It's one of those games that makes you feel good about how good you've got.  Personally, I find lots of beer helps too.  Back in the 00's (yes, I'm that old), I used to love Virtual Pool 3 (which I can't get to run on any platform now), and, after a drought of many years, this has filled the void.  I'd change a couple of things, mainly that you could lock your X-axis when your shooting (but this is mitigated by the ""fine-tune"" key) and I change the power meter thing to a mouse-mapped power (a-la VP3) but apart from that, it's a great pool game.  I'd have to put a shout out for the artwork two, the stylised characters and their back stories is awesome (and it does it all without slam zooms and star wipes)e.  If you've got a hint of imagination, you don't feel like you're playing against some artifically levelled AI (even though you are).  Well done Cherry Pop (now fix the X-axis lock *claps hands* make it so!)Oh, one other thing, the menu system is horrible, could really do with an overhaul.

												It's a pool game. That should be enough to get you to buy it. However, this game is fantastic. You can see the venue in the reflection on the balls. The controls are great and allow you to do swerve shots, jump shots, and knife-edges by setting power, cue angle, and spin. There are a lot of different matches in multiple single player modes (9-ball, 8-ball, etc.) and there are challenges in each one. Some matches unlock a bonus stage in which you can unlock new ball designs or new cues by beating your opponent in things like 3 ball, straight pool, and killer. The only thing it's missing is player models, but that doesn't take away from the game at all. Seriously, it's worth the 10 bucks, but if it's ever on sale, you really should buy it!			"

Good Pool Game, Good Product=========This is a very polished game. Great graphics, several game types, tutorials to teach you basic shots through trick shots which you can go back to between games. Good controls for both keyboard/mouse and controller: placement cue on ball(for spins), angle of cue(for jumps), power lock-in and short path prediction. Good physics simulation that has felt natural on every shot.  You can do free-play, tournaments, two-player local or online play, with plenty of customizations.  Music is well done and catchy, too.I am very surprised by the level of polish, the attention to detail, menu controls, load times, re-load times, game options et cetera.  This is a pretty good pool game, but also a fine product in general. The developers did a good job all around.I haven't played long enough to speak to the AI which is a fairly big deal for a game like this, but I have been impressed with everything else so far. There are about 42 different ""characters"" with various degrees of difficulty(novice, veteran, pro). And of course you can play against other people with aim-assist on or off.			"

												Do you like playing Pool, but can't afford a real Pool table or can't find the space to fit one in your house? If so, then Pool Nation is a game you might enjoy.Modes include free play (which lets you do whatever you want, recognizing no rules whatsoever), Eight Ball, and Nine Ball. The latter two are done in tournaments, where you face progressively more difficult opponents. Each opponent has bonus criteria, which when met, net you more points but also some opponents have extra modes. These extra modes include bonus games (with varying rules) to earn new Pool cues, felt table skins, and ball designs. None of these really matter as far as the game itself is concerned, but it's nice to get something extra when you do better than average. Sound and music are basic, although the music I found a little annoying. Take that with a grain of salt, as I often find music in games to be irritating. The sounds fit the game nicely, although they were nohing to write home about.Graphics are amazing. I grew up in a house with a real Pool table and except for a few angles here and there, the table and balls all look incredibly realistic. You can also view the game from your character's POV or use a top-down view. I'd strongly recommend the latter.The controls include mouse and keyboard or a controller. I used a wired Xbox 360 controller, as I found the analogue sticks to work better than relying on the digital input of the mouse or keyboard. Every once in a while it seemed like the game interpreted my stick movement as much weaker than I intended, but for the most part, it worked very well.One thing that makes this game much, much easier than real Pool is the inclusion of guides. These guides show you where the ball will go when you hit it and adjust on the fly when you change anything about your shot. Some people might see this as cheating, so on higher difficutly levels the guides are reduced or removed entirely. Multiplayer is available, although I have no idea how well it works. I've stuck entirely to single player against the AI. Considering the overall age of Pool Nation as well, there may not be many players left actively searching for games either.I will warn potential buyers that Pool Nation's developer seems to have abandoned the game. If I'm wrong about that, I apologize. To be fair, Pool Nation is 100% done, so there really isn't much more to do other than fix a bug or two if/when they pop up. Pool Nation is on sale a lot on Steam and through third-party stores, like Humble Bundle or Bundle Stars. so I'd suggest waiting for a sale to purchase it. That wait shouldn't be too long.All in all, I'd recommend this game. It's entertaining, relaxing (for the most part), and doesn't require in-depth knowlege of sports or quick reaction times.			"

												Hands down the best pool game I've played. Graphically, it borders on being a tech demo for high end lighting and reflection effects. It's ridiculously shiny. The felt looks like felt. (I would not be surprised to see this game come bundled with every graphics card released in the next five years. It makes your GPU look like a hero.) The physics are just as good: crisp and consistent. Lots of game modes. Lots of cue sticks, balls, table decals, and pool halls to unlock. (I've played for 9 hours, I'm reasonably good at pool, and I've only opened up the easiest fourth of the unlockables.) Thanks to the quirky descriptions of your opponents before the matches, the game ends up having a ton of personality, considering it doesn't render the players at all, only their ghostly, floating sticks. It's got solid multiplayer, at least for two people. By people I mean friends. You can play big tournaments, in theory, with larger groups of strangers.Perhaps most importantly in the context of 2014 gaming, Pool Nation is getting continued love and support from its devs. Snooker and ""Box of Tricks"" are both coming soon as free updates, and the devs are active in the forums.As I write this, the game is on sale for $1.50. It's correctly priced at $10, so $1.50 is a steal.			"

												Anyone who likes Pool will like this. The single player and all its unlocks are fairly entertaining but the real joy is found in playing with friends. Unless you turn off the aim assist then you will soon find that you can breeze through the AI players without too much difficulty but, even with it on, it's not so easy to make all the unlocks as it is to win matches. This game is often found on sale (I picked it up from HumbleBundle for around £1.50) and represents astounding value for money. The graphics are clean and sharp and the ball physics are adequately realistic with the exception of some inexplicable ball-off-the-table incidents if you use too much power. 98% - There is simply no better computer simulation of Pool.

												These guys nailed it. I didn't think anyone could duplicate so perfectly the feel of a real game of pool on a PC, while making it easy to get into. They put a lot of thought into this game, polished it, loved it. The sound and feel is so realistic, I'm quite astonished. This is the kind of pool game that will stay in your library and will turn to for the indefinite future. It's an excellent party game if you have a bunch of friends over but no pool table in your home or cave. The graphics are beautiful and stylish, but yet not overdone; they're just right while being simulatenously eye candy. I've never played a PC pool game as nice as this. I will always cherish this game!			"

												Great game if you love pool / snooker / billiards (those 2 game types will hopefully come soon). The polish is top notch, visuals crisp and stylish, controls nice (pad native too), camera views solid (has top down too), solid AI, unlocks / challenges, save / view replays, trick shots (all the standard spins / tricks and some), current ball and next ball are shown and easy to identify and nice visual aids (and options to increase / decrease this as you please).Aside from the omission of a Snooker game type the only thing missing that would add to the visuals and atmosphere (no doubt the option to turn this off would be needed for lower end systems) is the lack of character models for you and your AI opponents as well as the lack of a crowd in the wonderfully lit / modelled playing environments especially considering the concept character art which gives a good idea of how great this addition would be.Great stuff!

												It's a pool game. That should be enough to get you to buy it. However, this game is fantastic. You can see the venue in the reflection on the balls. The controls are great and allow you to do swerve shots, jump shots, and knife-edges by setting power, cue angle, and spin. There are a lot of different matches in multiple single player modes (9-ball, 8-ball, etc.) and there are challenges in each one. Some matches unlock a bonus stage in which you can unlock new ball designs or new cues by beating your opponent in things like 3 ball, straight pool, and killer. The only thing it's missing is player models, but that doesn't take away from the game at all. Seriously, it's worth the 10 bucks, but if it's ever on sale, you really should buy it!			"

												Looks gorgeous, lots of characters to play against and great challenges.  It's one of those games that makes you feel good about how good you've got.  Personally, I find lots of beer helps too.  Back in the 00's (yes, I'm that old), I used to love Virtual Pool 3 (which I can't get to run on any platform now), and, after a drought of many years, this has filled the void.  I'd change a couple of things, mainly that you could lock your X-axis when your shooting (but this is mitigated by the ""fine-tune"" key) and I change the power meter thing to a mouse-mapped power (a-la VP3) but apart from that, it's a great pool game.  I'd have to put a shout out for the artwork two, the stylised characters and their back stories is awesome (and it does it all without slam zooms and star wipes)e.  If you've got a hint of imagination, you don't feel like you're playing against some artifically levelled AI (even though you are).  Well done Cherry Pop (now fix the X-axis lock *claps hands* make it so!)Oh, one other thing, the menu system is horrible, could really do with an overhaul.  Thank God you don't have to use it that much!			"

												I've been a eight ball player for a good 12 years now, Seen many ""attempts"" of games trying to make a decent computerized version of the real thing, Normally they are as tedious as an eight on the break (Best sit down because youre not going to play that game) But this game has the phyisics of an actual table, I can take what i've learned from the table, implement it is this game and visa versaFinally a game i can hone my advanced tactics, Even the wacky stuff which would get your thrown out of any respectable establishment.Be a great learning tool for beginners to get your ""sight in"" without throwing away $2 each time you want to practice. Has decent spin and ball control, Which is highly commendable for a game! AI leaves something to be desired, But the other people seem decent.

												I was apprehensive before getting this game because I've had a few billiards video games over the years and to be frank they all seem to be lacking.  The control of the cue, the physics of the balls, and the plausibility of the shots either make me feel like I'm being guided through the game or is so uncomfortable playing that it's just not enjoyable.  Video billiards has always reminded my of video pinball in that there just isn't a video game that can capture the feel of playing.  While this game ""Pool Nation"" won't replace the actual feel of playing actual billiards... it's miles ahead of many billiards video game I've played that are out there.  The only comparable game is ""Virtual Pool 4"", which is a good simulation but ""Pool Nation"" graphics are a bit better and this game seems a little more reactive to your intent for playing.  In other words, this game ""Pool Nation""seems to be a bit more user friendly when trying to do what you want on the table than VP4 is.The game gives you excellent control of the cue that includes spin, english, angle, and power.  The controls are easy to learn but I highly recommend the tutorial in game to learn it.  It's short enough not to get boring and you need to learn the skills to play the game and the tutorial treats each lesson as a segment to complete and check off.  The ball physics are a good feel.  I can see myself lining up the shots and predicting the shots as I would on a regular billiard table.  Nothing's perfect of course but the devs did a good job here in my opinion.There are billiard circuits to play for single player and multiplayer.  There's leaderboards, achievements, and trading cards.  Steam Workshop seems like a natural for this type of game where you should be able to customize locations, cues, tables, rooms, or even players etc.. A good pool game for a nice price... on sale of course.			"

												Pool Nation is how I imagine my life would be if I was a lottery winner, a pimp, or Jordan Belfort. The game deserves a solid 9/10, losing out on full marks quite simply because the only thing it’s missing is pornstars wandering around in 6inch stilettos and lines of coke and rolled up 20 dollar bills laying haphazardly about the place.  What this game does extremely well, is that it makes you feel important. It draws you into a world where you can be the person you’ve always wanted to be in real life, a world where paying $15 for a drink wouldn’t make you penniless by end of the evening, a world where every woman wants to blow you and every dude……. Well who gives a f*#k if every chick wants to blow you right?? Pool Nation offers something different than any other pool game I’ve seen before. You can’t quite tell what it is but it’s shinier, sexier, it’s got more curves and it leaves you wanting more every time. In the words of Jon Martello, this is a game where ‘I just ♥♥♥♥in’ lose myself’.			"

												This game looks gorgeous and plays really well. I wish there were a couple more viewing options, but overall, I was very impressed about the quality with this game. With various challenges and bonus rounds, it keep things interesting and feeling new. Would definitely recommend to any pool lovers or anyone who wants to learn more about billiards.			"

												I can rarely say i've spent 8+ Hours enjoying something i only paid £1.04 for. I'm not usually a player of simulation games, but this game is very enjoyable. Potting is so satisfying and once you start completing skillshots, it's enough to make a grown man make girlish squeals of pleasure. Pros  - Very easy to ""pick up & play"" the tutorials are well done, but are OPTIONAL, so you can do them whenever you feel like, if at all and repeatable, so you can brush up on certain types of shots if you are having difficulty.  - All of the things that make this more game than simulation can be turned off or not used. Those who want a challenge don't have to have aiming lines or use flashbacks.  - Loads of unlockable customisation options, unlike certain simulators where to get a new table or cues (or trains or pinballs) you have to get your wallet out, 95+% of the customisation options are unlockable by beating different challenges or tours.  - Each match in a tour comes with 2 challenges that require you to win the match in certain ways, such as using a particular shot or getting a high score, etc, giving completionists more to achieve.  - Scrolling the mouse back & forth to control the cue is enjoyable - The graphics are amazing. Bearing in mind i'm playing this on a laptop, it looks beautiful. I would go as far as saying this is the best looking game i've run on this, with no framerate drops. Cons - The menu can occasionally get fiddly.  - Sometimes, when trying to aim the cue with the middle-mouse-button, the camera pans up instead.  - Extremely rare crashes. Had 2 so far, but i'm unsure if that's something to do with my hardware to be honest. Seriously, just look through the rest of the reviews. There are HUNDREDS of reviews, all positive, some are casual players, some are hardcore simulation players, all of them love it. Even when this game isn't on sale, it is totally worth the full asking price. If you're even slightly interested in this game, pick it up, you won't be disappointed.			"

												To say that Pool Nation is a great billiards game is an understatement. I dare say that it can take someone with little to no interest in pool and turn them in to a fan after just a few minutes of play. The controls feel very natural and with the help of tutorials, you will be pulling off jump, combos, and bank shots like the pros. This game is the yard stick that all other pool games should measure themselves by. The graphics are gorgeous and the music is very Zen. Mix in the clacking of pool balls and you'll find yourself a serene yet challenging experience. I highly recommend for anyone who wants a game you can play for a few minutes or hours on end. My only wish would be for more than two player support. Perhaps to watch an online game in a ""odd man out plays winner"" scenario.			"

												UPDATED TO INCLUDE BOX OF TRICKSMy review will cover the following:1. What is good about the game2. What is not so goodTHE GOODFirst off, the game is absolutely beautiful in every way; beautifully optimized, beautiful physics, beautiful graphics, etc.I've always enjoyed playing pool ever since I was young, whether it be at the arcade, bowling alley, or pool hall, I always enjoyed it; and up until this game, I considered the ONLY GOOD pool video game in existence is Pool Paradise[en.wikipedia.org], which I had owned for the Nintendo Gamecube and still have for pc. Pool Nation is a more modern version of Pool Paradise, doesn't have as many features as Pool Paradise (like Darts, Crazy Tables, Skee Ball, that canon and coconuts game, among things)I feel Pool Nation doesn't really live up to Pool Paradise, but is a good pool game, nonetheless; less than five minutes into my first playthrough of Pool Nation, I was immediately addicted to it.But enough rambling, let's get down to what's good in Pool Nation.Quality:Without a doubt, for an indie game, the quality is amazing. The optimization, which is usually lacking in indie games, is perfect.Physics:The physics engine is awesome, right up there with Pool Paradise. When I'd look at other pool games, other than Pool Paradise, the physics would be a disaster, either too stiff or too loose; Pool Nation's physics are as true to the real game as you can get. With precise cue control, you can curve, give spin, jump, etc, to your heart's content!Textures:The textures are beautiful; from the detailed wood grain of the cues, to the fine threads of the pool table mat, everything's in stunning detail. With realtime ball reflections to stunning environments, Pool Nation is in a league all its own!Music:An awesome soundtrack is there to set the mood and keep you company while you play. From light piano music, to downright funky, it's got you set. With each location having its own custom music pieces, the variety is right up there.Unlocks:As you progress and beat certain challenges, you can unlock new cues, ball sets, and mat decals; a vast array to accompany anyone's tastes and wants!Sound:As a sound designer, this is my bread and butter. Pool Nation's sounds are top notch; everything from the cue hitting the cue ball, the balls hitting each other, hitting the cushions, going into the pockets, and to bouncing off the table and hitting the floor are superb. I was actually surprised when I heard the ball bouncing on the floor after it left the table, nice and lively with reverb!Endurance:Not my most favorite gamemode ever, but it certainly is one that'll keep you on the edge of your seat, your palms will sweat, your heart will race, and will truly test how good and quick you are.Slow mo:The slow mo feature is a nice touch. Your last ball is going for the pocket, you're not sure if it'll make it, the slow mo kicks in showing the pocket, as the ball eases in in stunning, glossy, detail, it slowly reaches the end of the mat, you're on the edge of your seat...BOOM it tips off the edge and goes in, you win! It's also great for those action shots with the ball cruising into the pocket.Replay:The replay is awesome. Just pulled off the most amazing shot ever and want to see it again in slow mo? No problem, the replay feature's got your back! Everything from chalk dust to cushion distension can be seen in replay, and features allow you to slow down and move the camera to get a nice look on all the action that took place! (UPDATE, read below)THE BADIt pains me to say it but, not everything's perfect in this game.BUGS:Occasionally, the music will cut out and all you can hear is the ambience and regular sounds. Sometimes the music will come back, but sometimes it doesn't.Random crashes. The game's full of them. Crashed on startup, crashed multiple times after beating and opponent. I think it's due to the saving. Trying to return to the game after Alt+Tabbing also causes the game to crash sometimes, other times you CAN'T get back in.Chat. When typing in chat, sometimes a key will appear as though it was pressed more than once and sometimes not at all, causing ""Sttuf  likkeths.  You knw wha   I mn?""Your cue, balls, and mat decal will sometimes reset to default. It always resets after restarting the game.Certain moves will not register, especially banks and kicks at certain times.EVERYTHING ELSE:The chat can sometimes interfere with a shot.Some hud/menu things can also interfere with gameplay.Spin from the cue ball does not transfer to the object ball. A feature that takes away the realism. It's common physics, ""for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."" The cue ball is spinning right, and when it hits the object ball, the object ball should spin left, therefore adding more control; even Pool Paradise had this feature.Bag of Tricks REQUIRES purchasing dlc packs, without said dlc, you get a very small number of ""Starter"" objects, which don't help you create anything worth while.The replay mechanic has been changed. You can no longer slow replays, it's either start off slow or build up to faster, or, reverse slow or build up. You can't start off normal speed and then do a dramatic slow down. The controls were changed, too and are, in my opinion, pretty condescending.A new dlc has been put in the store that will unlock ALL unlockables (other than dlc unlocks) without the need of having to progress which is, in my opinion, the lazy man's dlc.Other than that, this game is a must have for anybody who loves pool!

												The best pool game i ever played.It has multiple settings of aim-guide, including the option to disable it at all (for hardcore players).With the aim-guide, you'll be surprised how quickly you'll be doing absolutely amazing tricks! The challenge then becomes doing the same stuff with less and less help from the aim-guide. It has a multiplayer mode, but the singleplayer is quite good too, it's challenging and the AI usually don't do stupid things.It gets also very cheap on sales. Unless you hate pool, there's no reason to not get this game.			"

												Being an avid pool player IRL I have downloaded a few billiard games both on PC and Android. I truly can say that this is one of the best poll games I have played. If you have never picked up a pool stick before this game is created to help you learn all you need to know on how to play. In no time, you will be preforming curve and jump shots. This game has everything an avid pool player would look for. I can see myself playing this game for years to come without the need to find a better game. I love 8 ball, 9 ball and straight pool. I am not into the other billiards games like Snooker, Carrom or Crokinole so this game is ideal for me. I like the fact that you have bonus achievements to try and accomplish during each match to obtain a 3-star winning. It’s not just point and shoot over and over. The graphics are sweet eye candy and the music must be from some relaxing waterfall video because it can almost put you to sleep. This game is a must have for my library.  RATE: 9 1/2 OUT OF 10  "

Back in my day there was only 1 pool game on Steam and you had to take what you could get because Steam didn't give 2 ♥♥♥♥s if you wanted another pool game, they were too busy putting crappy mobile ports on Steam for $10. But this game is good and you should buy it if you like pool, which I guess you do since you are here looking at this game.			"

												As close as possible to get to the real thing.  The ability to take trick shots is well balanced with practical physics, making for an enthralling sim.  ...this game makes me laugh & smile.  If you're new Pool Nation is accomodating, featuring a few different ways to practice & easy to learn (if a bit slippery at first) controls.  A pro can appreciate the tournament structures, the spot on rulesets, the tricks, & the challenges, which are a bit like wagers in a bar.  Quite realistic, that.  Pool Nation is rendered beautifully & has all the charm & atmosphere of Poker Night 2's outlandish settings.  The music is well mixed, adding to the full effect.  Everyone should own this game.  If you can't find some pleasure in this sim, you should probably see a shrink.			"

												Not bad! Got it on sale and I'm enjoying the 8/9 ball modes. I often play when I'm tired of playing the mainstream games in my Library, that and for rainy days. You can play pool online for free, but Pool Nation has more better features and a variety of game modes--all for cheap. Multiplayer, however, seems to be empty of players.			"

												When I first got this game, I was hoping so much, that it would be pretty much just like Virtual Pool 3, but with better graphics. Essentially, that's pretty much what I got! At first, I wasn't sure if I liked the ""feel"" of it as much, but once I'd played a good few games, I find I do like it a lot! The only bad things I have to say about it (and it's not even that bad) is that there is a slight difference in the movement of the cue stick between single player, and multiplayer. I'm not sure if it's just my pc or not, but for me, single player feels very 1:1 in terms of how much I expect the cue stick to move in relation to how much (and quickly) I move the mouse. In multiplayer for me, it feels like there is a very very slight delay between me moving the mouse, and it moving the cue. When I say very very slight, I really mean it. It's easily the kind of thing you can get used to, and after playing several games, I barely even notice it myself, unless I actually jump from playing single player, straight in to an online game. The only other disappointing thing, is that it doesn't have Snooker. If it did, this would be the penultimate pool game! Certainly not a deal breaker though! If you like pool games, or are a fan of the Virtual Pool series, you won't regret purchasing this at all. I've played many many games online with a friend of mine (usually several matches a day!) and we both get great enjoyment from doing so! As you can see from my playtime, I've already spent a significant amount of time playing this, and it's only going to grow further! Trick shots are hard to master, but once you get your head around how to do jump shots and curve shots, whole new ways of playing become apparent, and you truly start to feel like a master!The single player is challenging and fun, and having mini goals in each round keeps you coming back for more, since usually completing those goals, leads to unlocking new locations, balls, decals and cues.At it's current price of $1.49, you'd be crazy not to grab a copy! I think I payed $3 or $5 for it at the time of purchase, but I would say that even if it was $10-$15, it's still worth every cent!			"

												This is the best virtual pool game that I've ever played, period. It's addictive and instructive. My Real Life™ game has improved, thanks to the accurate physics and cue aiming system. As an enthusiastic supporter, who wants this game to become a household name, I have a few humble suggestions for the developers:1.  Please add more tournaments featuring more game types:      a. British 8-ball      b. Snooker      c. Straight      d. anything else you can think of...2.  Maybe add more types of tables... at my local pool hall, there are, at least, three distinct styles of tables:      a. Quarter-drop - small green, big pockets      b. Big/Big - big green, big pockets      c. Big/Little - big green, itty-bitty pockets      d. Is ""Bumper Pool"" a real thing? I'd play it...3.  I am far more likely to pay for decals, cues, balls, and locations, than I am for trick-shot materials.4.  Some sort of local playlist ability for the background music.I'd like to say again...I'm a HUGE supporter of this game. If you like to shoot pool, in Real Life™, you'll love this game. "

												8/10 - Best Pool game since Yahoo! PoolI prefer the controls of Yahoo Pool and the intense player base, but this game brings an updated 3D Pool experience.Controls are a little clunky, but overall this is an amazingly full pool game. Combos, Tournaments, Working Online play and achievments. I got this on-sale for $5 or so; however I would pay around $19.99 for it to be honest.

												A pretty solid pool game, which is something Steam has being missing for a while. The physics feel right, the game looks pretty and it has several game modes to keep you entertained enough. Endurance mode is an especially neat game which tests the players skills over a prolonged (10-15 minute or so) session. With the Box Of Tricks DLC coming for free in the near future, and a (paid for) Snooker expansion planned as well, you can't really grumble at the game...providing you're into pool, duh!			"

												This is one game that made me hate the Steam special sales. I picked it up during the Summer Sale for 6€, asked a friend if he's interested in playing some pool and he was, bought it too and we enjoy the hell out of it, i would pay even 30€ for this game. I played PC Billard games from the 90's on, all the Virtua Pools and whatever is out there and i play Billard in real-life and this is the best simulation i've seen so far. There are a lot of game modes (3-Ball, 8-Ball, 9-Ball, Rotation, Killer, Golf, Speed, Endurance) and a small career style mode where you unlock locations, queues, ball designs and layouts for the table - so it's even fun in single player but absolutely shines in multiplayer. The graphics are nice an shiny and the music is greatBest thing of all is that the developers actually are active in the forums and listen to the fans and their wishes. I can't wait for the trick shoot stuff and the Snooker mode and whatever else they plan.			"

												Pool Nation is a fun fantasy pool game but I found frustration outweighed my enjoyment over time due to many small issues. I regularly had an issue where stars in levels would not be awarded after the match when the in-match tracking said I had completed the challange and I had won both the game and match. This lead to completing stars up to four times before the game successfully registered them. Another frustrating but not game breaking issue was that the overhead view became blocked on some levels which left me with only the on table view. This view is enough to play on, but still limited my options. A lot of little things like this detracted from the game for me and lead to me sending it to the done pile earlier than it should have been. I found this game to be worth the money I spent, but still fails to be something I can recommend.			"

												This game is possibly the best pool game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The sound design is fantastic, the graphics are shiny but non-intrusive, I haven't seen a single physics error. If you want to simulate a game of pool, this will do it almost to a tee.However. I have three reservations. The power meter gets stuck sometimes if the mouse is accidentally pulled to the edge of the window, even on fullscreen. This can cause some dodgy shots. The Endurance challenge instruction page seems to be bugged and will only let you see the last page of it. To be fair, the gist of the 6 page manual is that you need to pot balls fast, but it's not entirely apparent what parameters there are on this activity. The Straight challenge does not account for trick shots or indirect aiming the same way that the rest of the game is, and this is never explained. As such, and as the name might suggest, you should only shoot straight. No jumping, no swerving, don't even think about a combo.Aside from that, a very robust and well designed pool game.			"

												I spent a lot of time looking around for a good pool game. While there are a few options on steam, Pool Nation is by far the best option. I am quite satisfied playing it and, have lost track of time too often! The physics are great, it plays great and has a lot of different game options. The only thing I wish it had was Snooker, but it seems that most pool games do either 8-Ball & 9-Ball, or just Snooker.I picked this up while it was on sale and have been quite happy! I say even at full price, this game is well worth it for any pool enthusiasts!			"

												This is a really fun game, and if you really like pool then I recommend this game to you. It's fun to play both against the computer and online. Endurance mode is a good test of your skills as well. The only con is it seems like some of the bonus challenges are a bit too difficult to win against the AI, for example the one where you have to pot the entire table in less tim than the AI, that took a good 45 minutes of attempting. Overall it's a really nice game though and I don't have many complaints about it. I can finally feel good at pool.			"

												Best looking billiards sim i've seen. But quite frankly, there are a basket of errors still clearly visible. The UI is wonky, and this game crashes every other time I play it. Its fun, but slow paced. I just hope that the devs continue to support this game as it has quite the potential to be a lot of fun. The biggest downside, is that it flat out does not use the correct rules. Maybe it's a licensing issue, but it certainly is a pain when your opponent scratches on the 8 ball and does not lose the game.			"

												Pool Nation & Bumper Pack BundleIncludes 6 items: Pool Nation, Pool Nation - Flair Pack, Pool Nation - Pack of Pipes, Pool Nation - Ramp Pack, Pool Nation - Skate Pack, Pool Nation - Sports PackFor S$1.95, it wouldn't be a big loss even it sucks. It's a port over from Xbox so there are many problems. It won't be a mainstay but worth playing once in a while, just waiting for multiple ball collision help to come out.PROS1. Good priceEasy entry price and I don't mind supporting Cherry Pop Games at this price level.2. Pool ExplainationsHelped me to understand Pool terms in an easy manner.3. 3D tricksThe old pool games on Yahoo were only 2D and you weren't able to jump balls. In 3D, being able to jump the ball is quite satisfying.CONS1. TutorialsTricks with fine adjustments had a major problem. If you pressed F, the tutorial would give you a green tick even if you we aiming all over the place. 2. GraphicsThe default graphics suck. I couldn't even read the words in the tutorial, I thought Left Click was Left Shift. Tried it on 1280 * 768 resolution @ 60Hz... Much better...3. Overhead viewAs I played the game as a newbie, I realised I would never bother with trick shots. I would just use the Overhead view 4. Multiple ball collisionsThe game can't show how multiple collisions work e.g. proxying a ball. If you hit the cushion to hit your ball, it will only show where the white ball goes to. This turns me off from trying more difficult shots vs winning the game. If the issue is player difficulty, perhaps the developers could create 1. Easy 2. Medium 3. Hard 4. Pro modes for players. With Easy showing how all the balls will move and Pro having zero help.On a side note : Just learned that you need 5 minutes of game time even before you write a review. I changed my review to Yes after playing 8 ball.			"

												Probably the best, of many pool remakes I have played. It's very humble-feeling, with fantastic, smooth graphics and relaxing music. Not much else to be said. It's got Steam Workshop and plenty of built-in gamemodes, worth a decent amount of play-time. The only notable drawback is the lack of multiplayer matches, but I'm sure the current Summer sale will alleviate that. It's good to have a buddy to play with though, just in case. Another issue is that you can only have 2 player matches, when in reality there are many potential 3 player gamemodes. I play with a friend over Teamspeak, and this is our go-to game when we can't think of anything else to play. Heavily recommend.			"

It get's a 5 out of 5 in all categories applicable for me. I have a very small  complaint, you can't walk around as the other player in Local Multiplayer. On that note for some reason you can't play Golf in Network Multiplayer? This though, are only a very small complaints.Score 98. Due to some small features missing from Multiplayer. "

												It's ♥♥♥♥ing pool. If you enjoy pool, buy this game about pool, as its representation of the game of pool is accurate to its IRL counterpart, pool. If you're dissatisfied with the game of pool because your gf's bffs are always beating you at the bar using the almighty distraction technique of cleavage, buy this game about pool because it has no cleavage to distract you from the game you're playing, which is pool. If you don't like pool because you're bad at pool and just want to watch some random guy at the bar's gf's bffs squeezing their num-nums together to beat him at pool, then you'll probably want to skip this game about pool, as you don't enjoy pool and this game is all about the game of pool.tl;dr it's ♥♥♥♥ing pool.

												It's kinda tricky to review a Pool game so I will try and break it down into what matters. GraphicsAs you can see in the screenshots the game looks great, it is ported from the Xbox 360 so it will run pretty damn well on almost any computer set up you care to mention and with Anti-alising all the way up it is a very very nice game to look at. The UI is nice and easy to use as well although, whislt the controls have had there names changed. It still asks you to press A, B, Start and Back whenever you want to do something. That is more of a monor niggle thoughGameplayThe Pool on display here is very nice. The balls all act realistically and as far as I can tell things like friction have been modeled very well. In the close up slow-mo shots you get sometimes when a ball is potted you can see that the balls are lifting up and sliding about realistically. The sound design helps to sell this as well, with nice clear sound making it all the more satisfying when the ball drops. MultiplayerAs far as I can tell the multiplayer for this game is dead. Which is a shame and slightly confusing. I couldn't seem to find any games at all in any mode so unless one of your friends has the game it is most likely gonna be solo play for you. OverallConsidering The lack of a decent Pool game on PC and the promise of the release of the Trick Shot mode soon I would say this game is well worth picking up			"

												I can BARELY recommend this game, and that's only because it does offer some value as a good cool down game after a heavy shooter session. With that being said, I have a huge issue with how the challenge level progresses in this game. The opponents don't get better, you get worse, and that's really irritating. I'm on the final 8 ball tournament level now, and the AI has the same skill level as it was in the beginning. Your controls get worse as the game progresses and there are glitches that will force you to lose the game. So with that being said, if you're looking at this for a serious pool game, I would not suggest. If you're looking for a cool down, time killer, then proceed but be warned.			"

6/10 - Decent time waster.A very low-key game to throw on when you aren't in the mood for serious gaming.  It's just something to do.  That does come with some questionable physics, characters whose personalities consist of a one-line synopsis, and campaign modes that drag on with somewhat useless rewards.  It has its time and place and if you can get it for a buck like I did, it's definitely worth that.			"

												Don't buy this billiard-game for actual billiard-games.The focus in this game has been put on ""trick-shots"": The (extremely 1-1 strict) tutorial even teaches spins & jumps far before the very basics, which in reality would include chaining (or ""combos"") & bank-shots (bouncing cue or other balls from banks).Don't even bother playing without guidances or other ""deflection angle"" indicators, especially mainly because the full-power-shot hits like a unrestrained Superman, which will almost 100% guarantee send your cue-ball flying off the table.Also a large number shots that chalk the table simply makes my cringe, especially when the tutorial forces the players to do so at least once (I.E. when pool-stick hits the carpet of the table).So why is still getting an okay from me?Well, like i said, this focus in this game are the indeed the trick-shots, for which the game gives all the needed tools, especially for analyzes and other calculations, which are extremely useful with the recently released optional ""playground""-objects.So if you want to try out something even crazier than those seen during artistic-pool-competitions without risk of ruining ones pool-carpet, this is a game for you.Of course, the available amount of game-modes (""8-ball"" and so on) do allow playing ""normal games"" too; just be prepared to do lots of trick-shots instead of ""playing normally like in real-life"".

												The best pool experience on a computer that I know of.9-ball, 8-ball and Straight games are available together with a couple of for-fun modes (speed-potting, lose-a-life-when-you-miss etc.) and endurance (a ""survival mode"" with extra balls appearing on the table with increasing speed).The game makes it easy to execute the shots you know how to perform in theory (e.g. swerve, jump or back-spin with the 9-ball as a secondary target - and there are tutorials for those), if you just take your time with the available features (such as first-person/top-down view toggle or fine-tuning mode for precise aiming even at table-long distances) and do the necessary adjustments of shot power, spin and butt angle. The balls rebound (from cushions and other balls) in angles depending both on their spin and speed, and the cue ball's trajectory before the first impact (including jumps) can be made visible in different degrees, depending on the novice-to-expert settings.The default control settings turned out to be very practical once being used to, but custom key-binding can be set up. I would like the option of 9-ball games with more than 2 players, but the already available multiplayer options are very nice (whether on a single computer or over network). Whole matches can be archived for replay (I am not sure whether single shots can). Extensive trick-shot options and snooker are supposedly coming in the (near?) future.For any pool-lover that can afford it, I would consider this game a must-have. I got it myself in 90 % discount, but would now take it even for the full price.(Also, the visuals are great and the single-player opponents are funny at times.)			"

I play this a lot with my friends when ever we get sick of action based games and just want something calm.One thing that annoys me though is the game always crashes when I minimize it. This happens to my friends as well, not just me, and also happens on my work computer, and backup computer. I am running windows 7 on two computers and windows 8 on one... Don't ever get windows 8. I tried using window mode, but if I click off to the side and onto something else, the game locks up and crashes. Very annoying, and I hope they fix this issue soon.			"

												Very nice pool game, with main limitation being aim assist only calculating trajectories till the first collision. After the first collision, no collisions are taken into account. This means you can't tell how the balls will move if you hit one ball with another (unless you spend 1000s of hours practicing).Game has normal ""tournament"" mode, where you play against various AI players and collect ""stars"" for completing challenges, as well as ""endurance"" mode, where balls are continiously dropped on the field, and an online multiplayer, as well as ""versus AI"" mode, tricks mode (where you build levels and try to perform some sort of insanity). There could be more, but I mostly play endurance.Graphics is a bit too glossy with all the extra (unneeded, in my personal opinion) reflections and shines. Sound is nice, especially balls hitting other balls. Music is OK, but selection is quite limited, you'll be listening to same tunes over time.Overall, I like the game. It has its flaws, but its quite relaxing.			"

												I'm not afraid to admit: I bought Pool Nation solely on account of its graphics.Let me elaborate. One of my favorite ""sports"" games (let's not get into the semantics of whether pool is a sport) of all time has been the original Virtual Pool by Celeris. Since it's been literally years since I played the game, Pool Nation struck all the right chords with me: low price (on sale for $5), great artwork and graphics (ooh, shiny!), and those pangs of nostalgia that I'd been craving.Pool Nation sports a reasonably good tutorial mode and even teaches you how to pull off expert moves like jump shots, knife-edges, and all sorts of careful maneuvers with curving and banking. And those moves will generally score you loads of style points (which, as far as I can tell, are only useful on the in-game leaderboards - there's no way to spend them, and all the unlockables come from milestones in the Tournament modes).If I have only one complaint about Pool Nation, it's that the AI suffers from what I like to refer to as ""Worms Syndrome""; in short, the AI will alternate between being a complete and utter stooge (like pocketing the cueball) and being freakishly perfect at their shots (I've seen even low-tier opponents like Cousin Merl pull off insane curving bank shots and manage to pot two or more balls in one hit, on occasion).Of course, this ceases to matter if your intention is playing with friends. This is also a bit of a problem, though, as the online scene for Pool Nation is...well, pretty much nonexistant. You'll pretty much need to talk your friends into buying it if you want to play against anybody other than the AI opponents (or the timer in Endurance Mode). This said, though, given the game's low price, that shouldn't be too hard.And then, yes, there's the graphics. Everything in this game is really shiny. Not ""bloom and HDR"" shiny, but nice and reflective and smooth. The pool halls you compete in (there are several!) are lovingly rendered and actually remind me of the city from Mirror's Edge. Then there's the character artwork, which is occasionally hilarious (Cousin Merl and Beef Chillingham both elicited chuckles from my usual Livestream audience).So, yes, I give Pool Nation my recommendation. There are no crazy arcade elements (you won't see explosions or fancy particle effects); it's pretty much straight pool with a nice coat of gloss and some solid physics.			"

												Good game of stripes and solids. Its called 8 ball in the game. I enjoyed this part of the game the best. The computer is good but not overbearing. It brings back a lot of good times playing pool in bars. 9 Ball I want to like but Hate the game play of the computer who seems to be able to make any shot sometimes and then other times will miss the simplest of shots. Its  annoying and makes my want to punch his face. The physics feel very good its not perfect and some of the time it just feels a little off but its very good.I like the unlock system but for whatever reason they made it progressively difficult with 3 stars needed later on to unlock some stuff. However the worst is some of them are busted and dont work like they should. The jump shot is needed to unlock on of the stars and I have done it and not gotten credit for it. Its annoying. A few of the others are just based on luck and thats very annoying as well. The locations you play pool in are very well detailed and looks super great. Sound of the pool is very good. The music can get annoying so I turn it down a lot. Not prefect but very fun and more then worth the $1.50 its on sale for.			"

This is great! If you are the type of person who likes to have a game of pool when you're in a pub with a pool table, you'll love this. You'll be master trickshotting in no time! The best thing is (like stated on storefront) it's real life physics. In other words, it looks and feels great, no cornyness of crappy imaging, animations or things that make you go ""huh?""There is no such thing as being snookered on this game.The only downside is the boring game music, but this isn't a game where you need to hear whats going on, so turn it down n get the tunes on.The best side, trick shot (in closed beta right now) to be released for free when done.

												Great pool game, has a bunch of different game modes pool-related of course to spice it up a bit.Can do quite a few fancy shots and catch on really quickly thanks to the aiming helper.The tutorial explains all you need to know to score your own ""perfect game""only negative thing about this game is it doesn't really like it when you alt+tab, even going so far as crashing sometimes and the spectating/replay could have been better. 9/10 Grab a friend and play :D			"

												Bought 2 copies of this for £1 each, so I could gift one and have a friend play with me. I thought this would just be a time passer, and maybe I wouldn't play it much. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! This is great! If you are the type of person who likes to have a game of pool when you're in a pub with a pool table, you'll love this. You'll be master trickshotting in no time! The best thing is (like stated on storefront) it's real life physics. In other words, it looks and feels great, no cornyness of crappy imaging, animations or things that make you go ""huh?""There is no such thing as being snookered on this game.The only downside is the boring game music, but this isn't a game where you need to hear whats going on, so turn it down n get the tunes on.The best side, trick shot (in closed beta right now) to be released for free when done. (its a trickshot editor)			"

												Very nice pool game, with main limitation being aim assist only calculating trajectories till the first collision. After the first collision, no collisions are taken into account. This means you can't tell how the balls will move if you hit one ball with another (unless you spend 1000s of hours practicing).Game has normal ""tournament"" mode, where you play against various AI players and collect ""stars"" for completing challenges, as well as ""endurance"" mode, where balls are continiously dropped on the field, and an online multiplayer, as well as ""versus AI"" mode, tricks mode (where you build levels and try to perform some sort of insanity). There could be more, but I mostly play endurance.Graphics is a bit too glossy with all the extra (unneeded, in my personal opinion) reflections and shines. Sound is nice, especially balls hitting other balls. Music is OK, but selection is quite limited, you'll be listening to same tunes over time.Overall, I like the game. It has its flaws, but its quite relaxing.			"

(a simple feature too few games have)  This is one of my go-to games for when a friend comes over with some beers and we're hanging.  Definitely well worth the price!			"

												I can BARELY recommend this game, and that's only because it does offer some value as a good cool down game after a heavy shooter session. With that being said, I have a huge issue with how the challenge level progresses in this game. The opponents don't get better, you get worse, and that's really irritating. I'm on the final 8 ball tournament level now, and the AI has the same skill level as it was in the beginning. Your controls get worse as the game progresses and there are glitches that will force you to lose the game. So with that being said, if you're looking at this for a serious pool game, I would not suggest. If you're looking for a cool down, time killer, then proceed but be warned.			"

6/10 - Decent time waster.A very low-key game to throw on when you aren't in the mood for serious gaming.  It's just something to do.  That does come with some questionable physics, characters whose personalities consist of a one-line synopsis, and campaign modes that drag on with somewhat useless rewards.  It has its time and place and if you can get it for a buck like I did, it's definitely worth that.			"

												Don't buy this billiard-game for actual billiard-games.The focus in this game has been put on ""trick-shots"": The (extremely 1-1 strict) tutorial even teaches spins & jumps far before the very basics, which in reality would include chaining (or ""combos"") & bank-shots (bouncing cue or other balls from banks).Don't even bother playing without guidances or other ""deflection angle"" indicators, especially mainly because the full-power-shot hits like a unrestrained Superman, which will almost 100% guarantee send your cue-ball flying off the table.Also a large number shots that chalk the table simply makes my cringe, especially when the tutorial forces the players to do so at least once (I.E. when pool-stick hits the carpet of the table).So why is still getting an okay from me?Well, like i said, this focus in this game are the indeed the trick-shots, for which the game gives all the needed tools, especially for analyzes and other calculations, which are extremely useful with the recently released optional ""playground""-objects.So if you want to try out something even crazier than those seen during artistic-pool-competitions without risk of ruining ones pool-carpet, this is a game for you.Of course, the available amount of game-modes (""8-ball"" and so on) do allow playing ""normal games"" too; just be prepared to do lots of trick-shots instead of ""playing normally like in real-life"".

												This game is a lot more fun than it looks! The online play feature would be great, but all it needs is more people buying this game. The single-player mode is extremely fun. This is one of the best pool games to exist, and well worth whatever price it's currently going for! I 100% recommend this for EVERYONE. It's currently on sale for $1.99. The more people who play this, the more matches there are for online play. There are ways to do almost anything you've ever imagined in normal pool, in a 3D Virtual environment. I recommend everyone have this in their Steam Inventory, and play around with it first chance you get!			"

Pretty good ball physics. Clue controll is perfect, trick shots. Only negative is that the AI is stupid and unnature but It doesn't matter. This game offer you many opportunities to have a really good times. Im looking forward to a Snooker DLC. Now Box of Tricks FREE DLC is in beta. Probably will be soon			"

												I love billards in general and this is a good virtual form. Easy to get used to, easy to play and fun in short doses (tends to get boring after a while just like real pool) Only problem is in single player the AI ramps up from cant sink a shot in the begining but by the second touny the AI pretty much never misses, by the Third YOU CANT MISS A SINGLE SHOT, so the learning curve is more of a cliff, and as for the online matches I think I'm the only person on Steam who owns this game as I have never seen a single multiplayer match or a single person ever online... Customize your balls and cue (but who cares really)... all in all not a bad game if you can get it for cheap (I got it for 2.99), certainaly better than online flash based pool, but not by all that much considering it's still just billards...

												Pool nation is a team based fps that if you dont have a healer you are probably going to lose.  I like to play 3v3 since i only have 3 friends therefore i have other people i can communicate with. If you cannot communicate with your teammate you are bound to lose, since you will need to get health and ammo from your supports. All around great game and would recommend it to anyone that likes basketball and football but if you like tennis then u will hate this game. <3			"

												I play 9-ball and One Pocket a lot, so I was disappointed that there was no One-Pocket tourney option.  Despite that, I am just gushing with praise for this game.  I have never played a PC pool game that GOT IT RIGHT the way this game does.  The feeling of the stroke through the mouse, and the configurations options presented for adjusting that feeling, make this probably the closest one can be to playing the game of pool IRL that I have ever experienced.  Jumping balls off the table, kicking safe, figuring out how much you have to cut the ball with spin, everything.  It feels amazing to sit at a PC and really get the immersion of playing a match.I can't recommend it enough already, but if they ever add a 14:1 or One Pocket gameplay (with an AI that doesn't make me want to shoot myself)  I would absolutely go bananas.

												Reasonable game but the graphics are like some kind of hallucinogenic trip.  Needs to have some more down to earth locations and be a whole lot less shiny.With the arrival of VP4 Online I'm playing that now instead as it's just more realistic and has more tables, locations & game rules, including snooker and billiards amongst others.

												Enjoyable for like five minutes, that and it's pretty to look at. That's about the only nice things I have to say. I'm not going to rip this game a new one or pretend that I'm AVGN. The only things that♥♥♥♥♥♥me off is the controls. One slight twitch and away your cue aim goes. For a fast pace game you have to play slowly in order to even succed. I also hate the points system, it over shadows the whole ""clear up to win"" aspect of pool giving the impression that highest points wins. Why couldn't they just tally up a score at the end after you win, sort of like a Street Fighter kind of way. Don't buy this at full price, wait for a sale.			"

												Good looking game with pretty reasonable physics, even if the tables seem to have a lot of drag on them, balls feel like they slide rather than roll. Lining up shots is a chore with iffy mouse controls. This is one of those games where you are controlling something with the mouse (the cue stick), but there is still a mouse pointer in a different area of the screen and they don't correspond at all. It is frustrating and distracting and something I didn't expect to see this side of glitchy Windows XP games. It's like half of the game was designed around a controller and the other half was made for keyboard and mouse.I'm sure there is a bit of a gem buried in here if I dig long enough but it just doesn't seem worth the effort.On the plus side you can totally cheat using a straight edge on your monitor to line up your shots, if you cared enough.Bought on sale for $1.49.12-28-14 edit: Achievements are working again.

												Pool Nation is a game about, well, pool. You hit balls, get them in the pots, battle against AI or online, and rage at your friends for their skill at games. But there are a few flaws in this that make the game's screenshots exagerate how the game actually is.First of all, the physics in the balls are AWFUL. Atleast 20 times (not exageration) during my career I got the ball stuck RIGHT AT THE POT and it didn't go in. If we got it to atleast the edge, give us credit or something. It happens to everybody playing pool, but come on, you didn't have to make it THAT realistic. Besides, who has two extra fingers on each hand?Second, the camera controls are amazingly crap. You MOVE YOUR MOUSE to move the camera. That's nice. How about when I'm trying to hit the ball? Can you KEEP THE CAMERA WHERE IT'S AT????? Half the time I'm trying to fix my camera or looking down the cue or I'm a 500 feet tall man that looks on the very top of the pool table.Last, the AI in this game is the hardest I've ever played. If you don't hit a ball, this AI will hit every striped/coloured ball it sees and you realise that you should use your time wisely because he hit all the balls, he's ready to hit the 8 ball, and you have to hurry and hit all your balls. It took me 3 times to beat the first guy. THE FIRST GUY. I have played pool as well, and I've went through the tutorial.My honest review is that if this game is on sale, don't get your hopes too high but you could buy it. If it's at it's regular $10 price, it's not worth your money.			"

												Hands down one of my most enjoyed video games purchesed over Steam. In the time that I've beeb playing it I've actially become a better mroe confident player of pool in real life too! Which of ocurse doesnt mean that it transfers over immeditally but aftwer a half a dozen games of pool in real life, I found myself using stuff I learned here to beat my friends quite decidely. If that isn't a good sales pitch for a game I bought to just have fun with on slow nights that I can't play for long perioods of time due to school work, what else will?Oh and it's HUGE! I've played about 3.5 hours thus far and have barely scratche (no pun intended) the surface of what this game offers to those willing to play it! Pretty grateful they made it too, super relazing rarely fustrating but not cheap by any means, this is a serious Pool Table simulater and the computer will make ""human choices"" but when you do play it and it knows what its doing watch out, for those worried about it though one you learn how to play it well you realize that you could've done just as well if you hadn't tried to push your luck with that last big trick shot. I love it. You might too.			"

You could sink down 8 balls and rack up a huge score ahead of your opponent, but miss sinking that last ball and your opponent sinks it, guess what?

												The game has a ton of features, but the core simulation is hot garbage.  Virtual Pool 2 perfected the feel of playing pool with a mouse and did so in 1997, this console port can't come close to that level of fidelity 16 years later.  It's a shame that the most basic element of the game is so bad because there's certainly a lot of game surrounding it.  Maybe you'll like it if you're not a pool player and don't know what the real game feels like?			"

SInce i got Pool Nation, i now consider 8 Ball Pool a ultra dumbed down and stupid pool game .

Or they will put the balls in position where you can't win or make cheap moves to make the AI have a better or even greater advantage over you which isn't necessary because they already one they just want to rub it in your face some more.the tutorial doesn't help either or it does but the AI will still have that ""Better"" over you and also you might want to reconfigure the controls because this game is extremely senstitive I highly encourage players to play on multiplayer with friends and not play singleplayer until you are ready and sure of yourself.Honestly this game should be Multiplayer only and not singleplayer because the AI mechanics is broken adn this game is better with friends			"

												I only disliked one thing about this pool game.  The right joystick on a 360 pad is used to not only select shot power (pulling back the stick), but also to execute a shot (pushing up on the stick).  With all the strategy that goes into each shot, it's too easy to accidentally execute a shot in this manner.  Worse still, it is possible to push up on the stick with no options set, executing a medium power shot with no options set (power, stick angle, ball spin).  In the options, I could see where to remap some things, but not this.  I really want shot execute to be a button, not a stick that I can bump...otherwise, fantastic game, great price!  This flaw is gamebreaking for me though unless I have a solution to it.			"

												I would not recommend buying this title, at least not on Steam.  I bought this nearly 2 years ago and it completely quit working within a few weeks after buying it.  I have tried every signle troubleshooting method, suggested work-around and support option that I can possibly find about this, but it simply will not load and play.  I even contacted the developer of the game twice via their listed e-mail on Steam's support page concerning the problem, but they have not even bothered to reply in any way to either e-mail regarding this.  I can say that when I tried the game after purchasing and downloading it on Steam that it was a very nice pool sim with lots of options.  That was when it worked though.  Now it just starts to load, and quits before I even see a title screen.  I suggest spending that $ on something else.			"

												The best (being the only) contemporary pool simulator on Steam, Pool Nation is a reasonable sports simulation marred by controls that vacillate between twitchy and unresponsive, constant hiccups and stuttering, and a borderless windowed mode that locks the mouse to the window. While the core gameplay is functional, it unfortunately is also stuck with a number of UI problems, making it a difficult game to play. 5/10. Buy it on sale, but not at full price.			"

I have played some of the cheapest, most broken out of place (impossible) scales of difficulty titles, and this cheap / broken ♥♥♥♥er takes the whole cake. Taking on some CPU in a fighting game can be broken, like shao khan in MK, or seth in SSF4,♥♥♥♥♥♥ill toss asteroth from soul calibur in the mix, all broken, all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. BUT....BUT....it is a scale. You start with weak foes, and build to the killer fights.(Isnt this a review for a pool game? The hell is this guy going on about?)The point being, i loaded this *cough* game up today, as a friend picked it up for me. I like pool, so sure why not. The very first person you are told to battle is some russian guy with a dog i believe. And after 4 games, (Of which i lost all 4 games) ((2 of those games being a ♥♥♥♥ING clean sweep)) And im greeted with the note, ""He used to be the best around, but now he is a joke.""No, sir. I AM the joke. Who the ♥♥♥♥ developes day 1 toons to be capable of perfect shots, near to no misses, when the controlls for the humans are rather sketch, and the pressure system for a decent strike is....well messed.I doubt any DEV would ever read this, seeing the game is dated, but this is why research is needed, if only i had known what i was getting, id ask my friend to save his money.Straight up, ♥♥♥♥ this game. As a person who casually plays pool with his friends on the weekly, You would need to play real pool to know why i hate this title so much.			"

Which is unnaceptable.Pros:-Great Textures-Impressive Lighting-Addictive gameplay with multiple game modes, locations, and skins			"

												I love this game for 2 player local co-op.  We use 2 Steam Controllers and play via my Steam Link.This is a fun little pool game that is great for players of all skill levels.  The controls are very intuitive and have been easily picked up by my 75 year old father and others.   We all like the music and find it contributes nicely to the overall relaxing nature of 2 player pool.One of the great features is the versatile aiming aid which shows players the exact path of the cue ball and object ball as they aim and adjust spin and power.  As players get better they can shorten the length of the aid to increase the player skill required to make the shots.  In 2 player local co-op each player may choose the length of the aiming aid independent of the other player.  This means experts can have a very short aiming aid while less-experienced players may have a longer one.  This is a nifty way to handicap games that doesn't make new players feel pandered-to in my experience.A couple of negatives are that the physics are a bit questionable at times, and the aiming aid can permit some absolutely ludicrous shots that would be impossible outside of a physics simulation.  The single player career seems to be nothing more than a way to purposefully gate content... even though you bought the game if you want all the locations and wingdings unlocked you have to buy the ""unlock"" DLC or slog through the laborious and completely unfun ""career"".All in all, I recommend this game for local co-op play and pretty much no other reason.  Several times I've checked out the online lobbies and couldn't find anybody to ever play with though YMMV.			"

												Alright,  I read some reviews before buying this game so I thought this is a good pool game. I'm sorry, it is not. Absolutely not. I've played a lot of pool (and snooker) games in my life, this game is just  not good.Yes, it looks good, if you like unrealistical shiny balls and locations out of a designers wet dream. Where is the bar background? Why don't have the balls scratches? Why is everything so d. shiny, everything looks like through a filter?And then the controls. Neither with gamepad  nor mouse good to play. Inprecise controls plus stiff camera. It doesn't feel like playing  pool at all. Kind of sad. I would give it a 6 out of 10. If the ""story mode"" is any good later on maybe a 7/10. But the lack of options and configuration possibilities and the big weight on graphics instead of gameplay breaks it for me.			"

												I Was goign to give a reviw after using the promised Free BOT but it turns out it is tied to paid DLC,they promised that it would be free DLC.Wow was i mislead when the so called free BOT was released and you had to buy DLC to use it fully and to download most the workshop items you need said DLC.They said it took longer they thought and cost more then they thought but you still promised free content and did not deliver.That is part of making games,sometimes you have to eat it and sometimes you make mistakes.You do not get sued then go to cout and say your honor i know i promised to repay and it is in written,but cost of living was more then i planned so i need to take that off the top.That is not how it works you still owe the whole ammount no matter your hardship.As they say never make a promise you can not keep,in short making a promis is risky business and if it does not go as planned. Then be  prepared for it or do not make promises you do no intend to keep no matter what happens.I am for supporting games and buying DLC if it is worth it but not when it is promised for free then later tied to paid stuff or you need the DLC to truly enjoy the game or said DLC is tied to paid DLC.It is a really good pool game with a great community and decent online play and it allows for trick shots and other things and it does look good and has decent single player challanges.There is a ednurance mode where you try and picket as many balls and keep the timer going to see how long you can go.+Looks good plays good nice variety of balls and sticks once unlocked Good Price Easy to learn and fun to play decent Challanges-Could use more contentNeeds custom cues and tables for the workshopNeed DLC to use most of the trick shots in workshopBait and switch promised for DLC gave part DLC and part Pay DLCIn the end before this i would have reccomended said game but due to this bait and switch of sorts i have lost faith in them.I am not sure if i could take in good faith anything else they promise .In  conclusion i must say DO NOT BUY unless  you are ready to pay for DLC and the chance of futher DLC being released like this.Wish they had a mixed button for reviews like if you did not hate the game but did not like it and thought it was maybe worth a buy but it is not for you instead i have to say YES or NO and not a MAYBE.

												This game hasnt been updated in ages, feels like the developers grabbed the cash and ran leaving a half finished game.Its made by a UK company yet there isnt even UK rules pool in the game, just US rules. How hard would it be to add some red and yellow balls and a UK ruleset? They also need some extra options to turn down all the silly shiny crap on the balls and locations, it all looks OTT.Linux support was promised last year yet the developers have gone silent on that along with pretty much everything else.

												Another abysmal port. More abysmal controller support.After having a lot of fun with this on my console, I grabbed it on Steam. Unfortunately like several ""controller enabled"" titles here, the input progarmming is only half complete. Instead of having a fully functional control mapping feature, it simply picks up input devices and automatically assigns them to functions in the game. This means that if you have other controllers besides a gamepad, like throttles and sliders, menus and views will constantly scroll or move until you find the offending device and unplug or otherwise disable it.This is a fun little game, but I have no desire to constantly unplug or reconfigure controllers just to play, only to have to reconfigure again to play games which use those controllers.On top of this, there was no consideration for alternate resolutions (such as multiple monitor setups). The 3d portion of the game functions, but 2d elements such as splash screens fail to scale properly, making them unreadable.Either make PC games or don't make them. I have no interest in a product that not only doesn't fully support my platform, but forces me to disable features of the platform in order to make the product usable. "

												Couple of my friends bought the game and were having fun so I figured ""what the hell"".  Unforunately I couldn't ever get the game to even run.  I followed several threads between the DEP fix, all the redistribution installs, disabling eyefinity and lightboost but in the end it still crashed on launch.  Take one look at their steam forum, I'm not alone not by a long shot.Maybe you'll be lucky and it'll work great, you'll have a blast playing alone or with friends.  Or you might get unlucky and spend hours trying to fix a game that should just work.If it's on sale, might be worth the risk.  Otherwise don't.			"

												I knew my day was going to improve when the truck pulled up at my home with this game deep within. No ordinary truck, this one was Holy White, and the gold Delivery logo sparkled like a thousand suns reflected through shards of the purest ice formed with unadulterated water collected at the beginning of the universe. The driver, clad in a robe colored the softest of white, floated towards me on the cool fog of a hundred fire extinguishers. He smiled benevolently, like a father looking down upon his only child, and handed me a package wrapped in gold beaten thin to the point where you could see through it. I didn't have to sign, because the driver could see within my heart, and knew that I was pure. Upon opening the package, an angelic choir started to sing, and reached a crescendo as I laid this disc into my system. Instantly, my antiquated equipment transformed into components made from the clearest diamond-semiconductor. The game knew where to install, and hooked itself into the correct directories without help from me - all the while, the choir sang praises to the almighty digital god. With trepidation, I pushed ""play,"" and was instantly enveloped in a sound that echoed the creation of all matter, a sound that vibrated every cell in my body to perfection. I was instantly taken to the next plane, where I saw the all-father. I knew with my entire soul, that all was good in the world.But then I realized the game was blue, so I only gave it one star. I hate blue. 1 */ 5 *			"

												First off, indy games in my head always equal win; smaller companies generally are able to take greater risks. That having been said, the physics engine in this game is far and away the best that I've seen for a pool game since... ever. Mouse controls are interesting but not impossible at first and after a few playthroughs become incredibly easy. Graphically the game is fairly pretty and I like, for the most part, what they've done.Gameplay is incredible for what it is and, that having been said, the game feels like it should be priced in the mid-20's to early 30's. For the 10 I paid the game feels like a steal. This is as close as you're going to get to a pool game without a stick in your hand. An easy 10/10 for the price.			"

												Do you remember Rockstar Presents: Table Tennis? Yes, Rockstar, the people that make Grand Theft Auto and Max Payne 3, also made a table tennis (ping-pong to us plebians) game. And it was fantastic. Pool Nation very much riffs off of Rockstar's Table Tennis in the best of ways and presents an amazingly solid product.The models are sparse, as one might expect in a billiards game, but extremely well presented. Textures are rich, colors are vibrant, and the lounges are all fully decked out. The game really does look beautiful. The soundtrack is fairly pedestrian but enjoyable; soft-beat electronic music with a touch of disco.There are no models moving about, so the background does seem rather static. There are no human models at all, period. Floating poolsticks is the order. Your shot takes place behind your stick and the view can be easily manipulated by simply moving the mouse. Symbols will show you where your ball will ricochet, up to a distance, and show your line-of-path. (this can be turned off) Shooting is easily done on the mouse or joystick. It all feels very natural, responsive and the game runs very smoothly thanks to its low required specs.There are unloackbale pool cues, ball sets and decals for the pool tables, but not a lot of visual customization. Workshop integration is in the works which will allow a lot more things to be added to your virtual pool halls.There is a multiplayer for friends and even a searching feature to play with random players. Unfortunately, you can only do 1v1 pool matches. Multiplayer options let you set up frames, aiming helping ability, game type, etc.If you like billiards games, you'll probably enjoy Pool Nation. It's a fast, fun, and easy to pick up game that looks great and is easy to run. I've run this on my Surface Pro 2 with a USB joystick and hooked up to a TV with no problem.			"

												Although the physics is inferior to World Snooker Championship series and the game crashes when using Alt+Tab, I still recommend this game as the best modern pool game on the PC. It has plenty of single player challenges and tournaments, and the tutorials are very useful in real life too. If you are looking for the multiplayer action I must say I had trouble finding opponents when I restricted aiming help, but if you allow novice aiming help you will find an opponent in no time and it plays very nice.

												It's hard to big-up a Pool game, but trust me when i say, its just sooo good. Had my eye for this for several months, but for some reason, i never got around to buying it.I wish I had purchased this earlier. The graphics are top drawer, the ball physics are spot on and the leaning curve is just right. Despite being an older game, there is a busy online community and forum and the devs just published an update -  that tells you all you need to know doesnt it?.If youre still on this page then stop dawdling and buy it!Rack-em up.

												As somebody looking for a good billiards game, I have to say this was a great choice even for a novice.  It boasts an all-inclusive package including single player 8-Ball and 9-Ball tournaments againsts CPU opponents (don't be surprised if they run the table on you, though) and tutorials for helping you learn about how to make those trickier shots.  The additional challenges in each match that go towards unlocking bonus matches where you can earn new cues, ball desgins and table decals are good incentives for honing your skills.  A very worthwile pool game overall.			"

												Do you remember Rockstar Presents: Table Tennis? Yes, Rockstar, the people that make Grand Theft Auto and Max Payne 3, also made a table tennis (ping-pong to us plebians) game. And it was fantastic. Pool Nation very much riffs off of Rockstar's Table Tennis in the best of ways and presents an amazingly solid product.The models are sparse, as one might expect in a billiards game, but extremely well presented. Textures are rich, colors are vibrant, and the lounges are all fully decked out. The game really does look beautiful. The soundtrack is fairly pedestrian but enjoyable; soft-beat electronic music with a touch of disco.There are no models moving about, so the background does seem rather static. There are no human models at all, period. Floating poolsticks is the order. Your shot takes place behind your stick and the view can be easily manipulated by simply moving the mouse. Symbols will show you where your ball will ricochet, up to a distance, and show your line-of-path. (this can be turned off) Shooting is easily done on the mouse or joystick. It all feels very natural, responsive and the game runs very smoothly thanks to its low required specs.There are unloackbale pool cues, ball sets and decals for the pool tables, but not a lot of visual customization. Workshop integration is in the works which will allow a lot more things to be added to your virtual pool halls.There is a multiplayer for friends and even a searching feature to play with random players. Unfortunately, you can only do 1v1 pool matches. Multiplayer options let you set up frames, aiming helping ability, game type, etc.If you like billiards games, you'll probably enjoy Pool Nation. It's a fast, fun, and easy to pick up game that looks great and is easy to run. I've run this on my Surface Pro 2 with a USB joystick and hooked up to a TV with no problem.			"

												I got to say I was a little hesitant about buying this game but I'm glad I did.  Didn't catch the $6.99 sale but still well worth the $9.99 price.  I am not a big pool player and thought I wouldn't spend much time in it.  The graphics and the gameplay is superb.  It the fanciest pool game to date in my experience.  I am still looking forward to trying multiplayer.  For what little time I've played it, I will guarantee you will fall in love with this game even if you don't like pool.  The single player is solid and plenty of things to unlock in singleplayer mode!  I never felt bored and sometimes went back to unlock more stars on matches to up my score and I usually never repeat levels!  If you feel like this isn't for you, give it a try and it will be a great gaming experience!			"

												Very good game, as a player you are well guided after you have first started it. I would recommend this if you like pool! At some point it feels like a port though, because when you use the so called 'Flashbacks' an 'A' and 'B' in the style of controllerbuttons are shown. Next to that the menu does not seem to be always very responsive, resulting in clicking next to the item you actually want to click. These are not major details, so again: this is from my part a great game to play!			"

Maybe a Wii-like device with a cue that you hold but beyond that I can't think of any way to improve the gameplay. My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be a way to play against another live person that isn't on the web, such as a friend over for a visit. Maybe the option is there and I just haven't found it yet. At any rate...BUY IT!			"

Aiming assist makes it easy to pot balls, most of the time anyway, but it can be adjusted to the point of not even having it if you want. Something to play when you're bored, good buy. Also unlockable cues, ball sets, venues (most are just times of day changes) and table decals.			"

It's maybe not as hardcore a pool game as the old Virtual Pool series but it certainly gives it a run for it's money.  Especially with add-on content and modes such as UK 8-Ball, Snooker and the Box of Tricks Trickshot suite in the pipeline.  Very reasonably priced as well when you consider the digital download Virtual Pool 4, which I don't think has any online capabilites, is a whopping $30 from the publishers website.			"

												I'm not a pool player at all. I've only played snooker three times in my entire life and I suck at it.But the game looked fun and it was put on sale at a ridiculous bargain price of 3 dollars. I couldn't say no to that so I bought it.This game is not a game at all. It's a simulator. The tutorial teaches you many basic and advance techniques. It's very well developed and the gameplay can be relaxing. Playing without aiming aid gives one the most reward and this game screams multiplayer fun when played without aiming aid. Unfortunately not too many people play this game online so you will have to play with friends instead most of the time.I wish they will change the power meter from green and blue to anything but both. The tables are green and blue so it's hard to see the power meter when you're playing. I do wish they offer some quaint bar room instead an over modern apartment or a business tower.It's a very good game. I would recommend this game to anyone who has even the slightest interest in pool.			"

												First off, indy games in my head always equal win; smaller companies generally are able to take greater risks. That having been said, the physics engine in this game is far and away the best that I've seen for a pool game since... ever. Mouse controls are interesting but not impossible at first and after a few playthroughs become incredibly easy. Graphically the game is fairly pretty and I like, for the most part, what they've done.Gameplay is incredible for what it is and, that having been said, the game feels like it should be priced in the mid-20's to early 30's. For the 10 I paid the game feels like a steal. This is as close as you're going to get to a pool game without a stick in your hand. An easy 10/10 for the price.			"

												From the sound of the clacking of balls, to the feeling you get when you jump-swerve-combo shot your way to victory, this game delivers. The physics are spot-on, the variety of games is ideal, and pretty much everything else serves this game sweetly. The only downside I've found so far is the frontend UI. It feels clunky and ported from a console (perhaps it is). Once you start playing though, the controls are very intuitive and, with a bit of practice, you'll be slinging super trickshots off with ease before you know it.There are a bunch of ""special rules"" type games to play too, Endurance being the most exhilarating/frustrating. Here, you have to keep potting balls whilst playing to a timer. The longer you take, the more balls are added to the table, eventually maxxing out and ending your game.The camera views are terrific, with full control either 3D or overhead. The graphics are everything you'd want from a pool game, and most important of all, the balls behave as they should.Seriously, this is near-perfect for a pool game. The dodgy front-end aside, this is the best virtual pool experience you'll find on the PC today. Highly recommended.90% "

												i'd recommend this for people that like pool, even though virtual pool 3 the good old rusty one was more user friendly lets say, and menus were more attractive.but the photos (of virtual players and when loading) seem way off... something homophobic people would never like, not what a serious respectable game should look like.having said that, menu is almost ok, with a bit too may new stuff, and clicking from one match to the next is never accurate... can get annyoingchallenges with swirl shots and jump shots make the game a bit more time consuming for achievement hunters, endurance is pretty niceif you wanna get it wait for a special offer it is ok, but there are better games for that money			"

												9/10 at 'being a game about pool'.Goes for a very kinetic 'push your mouse forward to hit the ball' method which makes it way too easy to accidentally to accidentally hit the ball with a pathetic excuse for a punt when trying to set the power. It has happened frequently enough to consider that 'an issue' but it has still been great fun despite me being god awful at pool and generally disinterested in this kind of game.			"

I even uninstalled it twice and reinstalled with out the DLC and it still does not start. The developer likes to blame other systems in your computer but only enough out of the 114 games installed in my computer theirs is the only one that does not start.

												The physics they've used behind everything is spot on, from the angle of hit, force used, spin applied.. it's perfect imo. I used to play 9 ball about 15 hours a week for years... so i have a decent idea. What else can you really ask for? Single player is a tourney of increasingly harder opponents with brief backstory, 9 ball or 8 ball. I've not gotten into any trickshooting, not my thing.If you need to chill and play a one handed game that will keep your interest for a bit, or your're a pool enthusiast, I'd say go for it.			"

As other reviewers have said, Pool of Tricks mode was at first advertised as a free update. It wasn't. When, after a long, LONG time waiting they finally added said mode, it was walled behind paid DLC.I cannot advice to support developers like this. That being said, the game is not bad. It's just not what they promised.			"

												Very good pool game, probably the best on Steam. Only negative is that some of the challenges you have to complete to get 3 stars for a match (1 challenge for each star, so 3 challenges for 3 stars) are glitched. It comes up saying I have completed it then when the match is over (having won it) it does not get filled in, thus preventing 100% completion for some of the throphies and unlocking the bonus match associated with that match. Whether this is just happening to me I do not know.Good game none-the-less. Recommend checking it out.			"

												Aside from the real thing, this is the prettiest game of pool I have ever seen.  The graphics are fantastic, and the physics are phenomenal.It was fun unlocking all of the cosmetic items, and the AI can be pretty challenging at the upper levels (though it becomes a bit obvious when the AI ""deliberately"" messes up - it will often do things like make 3 tricky shots in a row, then miss the simplest straight-on shot.)If you use the aiming aid, and take time to figure out how to set up skill shots like swerves and jumps, this game will make you feel like a number one pro ace pool shark.  That is the job of this game, and it does it really well.  I will never be that skillful in pool in real life, but this game can give me a taste of what that is like.			"

 Recommendation  Recommended  Base Game Score  B+  Style  Simulation/Sports/Casual  Recommendation Summary  Pool Nation is a game basically involving you playing pool. The game itself has good graphics, and a good UI. I am not experienced with pool simulations, but this game is what I imagine to be the top tier video game for pool simulation. If you are not a pool player, such as myself, then you will still enjoy this game, whether actively engaged, or passively listening to something else. It is a great little game that is worth taking a look at if you are interested. I recommend this game for really anyone.			"

Trying to play it on a laptop was slightly horrific before I invested in a controller, due to heavy reliance on accurate mouse controls, but on a controller it's just dandy.  The bios of the various pool players are mildly amusing, and it seems like there's pretty good depth of appearance customization, trick shots, and challenge modes, although I've been focusing entirely on the main 8ball and 9ball tournaments.A good game to keep your hands busy while you're thinking or multitasking.

												It's got the grahics and the physics that would satisfy any lovers of the pool or snooker game genre. In single player mode I love the tongue in cheek characters you face against in each tournament. The 3 in-match challenges per foe make for a difficult task to those looking at getting every unlock and 100% completion... I like this sort of challenge.Graphically its very smooth with a good use of ambient lighting and color contrast. Theres something of a futuristic style about the in-game themes and pool halls.Another feature I love about this game is the use of trickshots, it can seem alittle exaggerated at times but its always fun to see one played well, or even better playing a beaut yourself. Trick shots without guidelines are where champions leave their mark. As others have said pool nation is a very relaxing experience if you allow it to be, as it's accompanied with a charming soundtrack, sweet visuals and spot on sound effects. It's easy to slump and play...Lastly, the online is where I find the real buzz in pool nation. The community seems friendly so far, though sadly its small in number I believe. (You should join us)For me 5 frames, 8 ball pool, without guide lines is the most enjoyable and of course the most testing in every sense of the word to play online, but its brilliant.9.5/10 - It delivers everything you'd want for this genre			"

												So i decided to get Pool Nation for myself and my girlfriend to play while she's away from home. Played a few rounds with her and we were both laughing up a storm/trading jabs with each other by the end of it. Needless to say, this was more than worth the sale price i paid for it. I love the settings for the ""pool halls"" in the game, along with the table skins. The pool cue's and ball types are nice, though some of the balls don't seem to show up well for me. Might just be my eyesight there.  Over all, the only ""Bug"" i've seen is when i alt tab out, the game crash's. Honestly thats not all that bad.Overall, i'd give the game a 10/10 and can't wait for the new content updates.			"

												Probably the best pool game you're gonna find out there. Lots of attention to detail and polish, even if the rules are a little bit out of date (at least for the UK). Also, I don't know how to file a bug report, but there's a glitch in online with the UK rules where if you shoot backwards from a free ball it doesn't move on to the next turn and the game can't be continued, so watch out for that.

Does not seem to keep table decals from session to session after they are selected - this  may be me not understanding.10/10			"

												I really enjoyed Pool Nation. It did a great job simulating a real pool experience in my opinion. The various aiming aid levels allow you to gradually get better at prediting angles and how the balls will bounce and roll. I have actually been able to transfer this into real world pool which has been great. The single player mode has a ton of games and objectives to play, along with aquite a few unlockables. I have had a great time with it and it is a solid part of the game where you need to increase your skills and use some strategy to succeed. The multiplayer is good as well, I have spent numerous hours making crazy trick shots with my friends in a  game of 9 or  8 ball. I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in pool games or likes the game in the real world.Overall I would buy the game again and would gift it or recommend it to anyone who asked			"

												Really good game. The rendering is top notch, the physics are amazing. It is so satifying to play, especially with some slow mo cameras when you get a good shot, kinda like a sniper bullet. You get points awarded based on the difficulty of the shot too, so it's not just about winning the frame. Loads of content. Really super addictive game modes and just all round fun. I can't recommend this game enough, even if you don't like pool. Easy to pick up and play, lots of customisation such as ball decals, table and new cues. From a technical standpoint, this game is beautiful. A must play. Best pool game out there.			"

												I've always had a soft spot for pool games, but I've been dissappointed with the offerings available. Nothing's come close to making pool a fun experience on PC since 3D Ultra Cool Pool. Until Now.This game is excellent. How to sum it up... the amount of polish is excellent, graphically stunning, smooth audio tracks and high fidelity, well-placed SFX, but most importantly, the physics engine. It's a trick shot game, where emphasis is placed on being able to perform crazy trick shots in a regular game of 8-ball, 9-ball, or any of the other games. Sure, it's weird to do those all the time IRL. Sure, you can choose to not do them and just play straight shots... but it's fun. Fun with a capital F.Many previous games I've played seemed like an exercise in potluck or else purely strategy with aiming guides being perfect. With this game, some unexpected things do happen, but they've always seemed deserved to me. Hit the cue ball with max force at the wrong time and it might fly off the table. You can also knock other balls of the table.I haven't yet tried online matchmaking, having only played with Steam friends, but I can say that playing with friends is very nicely done. Inviting a friend is very easy, it works with the Steam invite system you've likely already used. During an opponent's shot, you can walk around the table in first person view and see what they're doing, with WSAD and mouse.The game controls excellently. There's no ""Hot Shots Power Meter"", and getting the power just right is possible, and you can take your time on it, but it's not as precise as just dialing it in. I find it's a great balance between skill and the precision needed for the kinds of trickshots the game sells itself on.The amount of single player content is phenomenal, with new unlocks of ball sets and table decals, as well as pool cues, coming frequently, a little tiny bit at a time. It keeps the game fresh. Whoever hosts an online match can use his unlocks, so it's a fun way of showing how far you've gotten to new players. The single player is so good, I sometimes prefer it to multiplayer, simply to get more ""hats and crates.""In short - Best pool simulation game I've ever played. Even better than 3D Ultra Cool Pool, if you could count that as a ""simulation."" (And look up 3D Ultra Cool Pool by Sierra if you want a different kind of pool game, it's very old, but it still has it's charm.)			"

With many versions of pool to play, including US and UK 8-Ball there is something to find for all fans of the sport. Only issue is the dead online multiplayer, so make sure you have a friend to play with and I'm sure you'll both have great fun with this game.			"

It's maybe not as hardcore a pool game as the old Virtual Pool series but it certainly gives it a run for it's money.  Especially with add-on content and modes such as UK 8-Ball, Snooker and the Box of Tricks Trickshot suite in the pipeline.  Very reasonably priced as well when you consider the digital download Virtual Pool 4, which I don't think has any online capabilites, is a whopping $30 from the publishers website.			"

												For a few quid, you can get this really well put together indie pool game.8 and 9 ball pool await you, and each AI has it own set of challenges. Some of which I have yet to really master and get to grips with.The tutorial section is quite a nice touch, so you're not just dumped in to the game having to figure out things like bank shots etc. Hell, I didn't even know it had a name until I played this game!You can just whack the living bejesus out of the ball, but where's the skill in that??Try bouncing the ball off the top edge of the table to hit the ball you need, or jumping over other balls to get the pot.You've got, as near as I can tell, full control over the ball with spin, lockable power (nice touch!) and cue positioning. You can pull off some really bizarre moves.Overall, this is a really nice game. Presented in a simple to understand format and graphically delicious. The AI characters have some, shall we say, odd traits. . I did giggle a little at Tiffany Bouvier, who'll eat you for breakfast. . Tiffany. Breakfast. . . At least it has a little bit of humour. Music is quite nice, but a little repetative, especially in a long game. But at least you can skip the AI moves quickly. I've been using mouse & keyboard to controll things and it's easy enough. I'll have to give my controller a try and see how I fair.Only tiny tiny gripe I have, is every now and then it crashes. But, the devs are aware, and it should be fixed soon!It would be nice to have a personal table baize as well as the included and DLC. Ah well, maybe the devs could peer in to that as well??Overall, this rates highly in my list and has quickly been added to my favourites.			"

Some random guys I forget! and last but not least, some woman with wings. Mechanics featured: 16 balls per table, long sticks to hit them with, 6 holes in a big colored table, many engaging gamemodes, and tournaments! Recommended ages 1-99. Worth the price!			"

												if you like Pool, want to play Pool, and doesn't mind doing it on a virtual table, then this is one of the best virtual pool simulators you will probably find out there.although after playing it, it made me want to buy a professional pool table even more.find some people wanting to play it online and that are more or less on your skill level and you will have a blast.

												Chillest pool game i´ve played so far. The enviorement around the game is great , and the soundtrack can boost your desire of playing more. You have levels were you need to perform hard tricks , to reach the next pool player.As a multiplayer game is not so good , since nobody plays this online. "

												Great. ♥♥♥♥ing. Game feel.Got what I'm looking for in quote, ""Steam's only Pool game"". While the physics model was spot on and such, I really wasn't worrying about that so much. I just... Played it. It felt great! The AI doesn't exactly feel like they're bringing their absolute A-game, especially with the higher stage opponents. Maybe I configured it wrong. I didn't actually need to configure the game honestly, which, while welcoming, kind of makes me wonder if I should have.At the time of purchase this game was just $1. Would it be worth the full price? Yes. There's quite a bit of game, so the price was already justified, but there's also quite a bit of challenge that you're probably gonna want to slog back to. The game comes with online, workshop, and some extra challenges.Sadly, not many people I know own this game. IF you do buy, suggestion is that you get a copy for your good mate and maybe shoot some over a Skype call or whatever.Furthermore, you can screw around with a table by yourself. That's rad.			"

												I just bought this game for only $1 during the Steam Summer Sale.  It's the best pool game I have ever played. Good controls, nice music, nice graphics.  The only downside is the low playerbase.  I have been able to play against a few people online but it took a while for me to get into a match.  Overall I recommend this game to anyone who likes pool.			"

												For a standard pool game, Pool Nation offers good quality of gameplay and pretty catchy music. It's ""theme"" is fun and casual. By this, you can expect nice music, colorful graphics, and your basic pool game. So far, I enjoy it despite my low game time showed here. I do not play Pool Nation too often, unless I'm unable to go out to play pool in real-life. Not much to say about Pool Nation. Good quality graphics, enjoyable atmosphere, catchy music, but one thing I don't like is that their controller support is broken in my PC. My Xbox controller are unable to function properly, like some key does different action listed. I'm pretty sure my controller is ok, I'm still using it to play other Steam games that support controller. They have released some hotfix previously, but I'm still unable to get my controller working fine. And this is one of reasons why my playtime is low. I like pool, I like playing it digitally, laid-back on couch and enjoying the game. But without controller, It doesn't feel good for me (This previous sentence is obviously just my opinion.)Last but not least, that is my only problem with the game. Everything else, is pretty good. But still, if I have options to go play pool in real or virtually, I'd be choosing play it real with my friends. Enough said, if you don't have much time to go out and hang on with your friends playing pool, get this game. If you have time to go out, well... Nevertheless, game is ok, and if you have to have this game on your Steam library, go get it.			"

												I take my words back about the awesomeness of this game (I've been bragging about it to my friends)I'd really like to punch the developers' brains inin one game mode one has to clear the table in the same time the AI does it (without any time for aiming, without any time for the animations of the moving balls)and another where the game, without any possible input from the player, chooses which ball into which pocket the player is trying to hitin both cases it is impossible to do any sort of difficult shot, no swerving, no jumping, just straight on shotsin the latter mentioned mode, the game simply doesn't label anything when I try to swerve, and says I put the wrong ball in the wrong pocket, or tells me I'm trying to hit a nearby ball into heck knows what pocketI am ... I want to kill those people just a little bit, it's beyond frustratingit's an unfinished product and they obviously haven't done much testingthere are also some negative reviews I didn't read, and pool playing people say the physics are wrong somewhereWhy do I then recommend it? Well, only because it is a lot of fun if you stay clear of those things. Just keep those things in mind.Also, I haven't been able to download any trick shots into local storage, as the game says I don't have the basic ramps, and asks me to download/buy them. I own most of the dlcs. There are also some issues with customization options.			"

												Para os amantes de uma boa sinuca! Jogo muito divertido. Jogabilidade: É ótima, é preciso segurar o botão direito do mouse para medir a força da tacada e arrastando o mouse para trás e pra frente para tacar. Tem aquela câmera estilo ""Sniper Elite"", quando a bola vai acertar o buraco, em certas tacadas.Gráficos: São excelentes, há opções de AA, Vsync e DOF, aqui rodei com tudo no máximo em 1080p. Música: A música ambiente do jogo é bem chatinha, mas acredito que dê para mudar, não vi ainda.Multiplayer: Mais um ponto positivo, jogo barato e com multi, ainda não joguei, mas deve ser fantástico jogar com amigos.Vale a pena?: Com toda certeza, por apenas R$ 12,74 você terá um jogão de bilhar/sinuca para jogar sozinho, com amigos, ou com as pessoas do mundo. Possui vários desafios e rivais no single, além de conquistas e cartas colecionáveis. Possui também compatibilidade total com controle, modo Big Picture e tem suporte ao Steam workshop.			"

												I love this game, realistic shooting....jumping, spinning, using the rails, trick shots, everything you would do in an actual game of pool, and the graphics are amazing,  beautiful game. Tons of different table decals, cues, and balls to choose from, different locations to play, some are pretty wild and if you have a good graphics setup you will love it. I only play at night when i am tired, before bed. I love to fire up my media player and play pool, it's a lot of fun ! I own all the DLC and must say that it is really worth the money, i just got the full unlock DLC and now i love the game even more because i can stick to free play, it really didn't unlock everything though, there is a special que that is still locked, and you still have to go through each level in the tournements. Now for the part i don't like. When in free play mode, if you want to use any of the custom options you have to go into a different mode like single player or vs. to choose the customize options for changing tables, balls, ques, and locations, then you have to back out to the main menu then choose free play. There really needs to be a customize button added to the free play menu. Things would so much easier if there were. And it does not save your options after you close the game, you have to go back and choose your options again.Do i recommend this game ? ....HECK YES I DO !			"

												For Steam's Only (current) Pool Game, Pool Nation sets a high bar for any Billiard-themed game that wants to show up on Steam. The physics for this game are top notch with the ability to perform jump, swerve, bounce and multiball trick shots are but a minute's time and a precice accurate eye, away. And there is nothing more relaxing to me than taking time to set off the perfect shot, and rub it in the Computer's proverbial face.Positives: The Graphics are AMAZING. (I know what you are thinking: ""How The [Expletive] could a Pool game have good graphics?!"") Well, to put it this way, imagine the shiniest piece of metal to ever grace your eyes. A shine so great you could literally ogle at your perfect image in its reflections. That is how the game looks. It's that good.Negatives: With great graphics, comes great disk space. The ammount of data that was put into making this game look and feel soo good, creates alot of memory. The size of this game is atleast 5x the expected size of what someone would think a Pool game would be, numbers-wise. It is pretty damn big for a 'simple' Pool Game.Grey Areas: The AI. I like to compare the AI in this game slightly similar to the AI in Worms Revolution. How? They both are perfectly accurate when they try, but when they mess up, they mess up HARD. The nicer part about the AI in Pool Nation, though, is that the AI will give you a large break when you first start to play. And the chances of your Computer Counterpart getting a perfect 8 ball streak win against you is almost impossible. But rest assured, there will be no mercy if you can't learn to pocket well. But after touching upon all these needed areas, Pool Nation is definately a must have for cheap, simple, yet enjoyable for many-a-time-gaming. Overall Ranking of games I've played: (9/10 because Left 4 Dead 2 & Kingdom Hearts still have my ties for 10/10 of all time).			"

												It's got the grahics and the physics that would satisfy any lovers of the pool or snooker game genre. In single player mode I love the tongue in cheek characters you face against in each tournament. The 3 in-match challenges per foe make for a difficult task to those looking at getting every unlock and 100% completion... I like this sort of challenge.Graphically its very smooth with a good use of ambient lighting and color contrast. Theres something of a futuristic style about the in-game themes and pool halls.Another feature I love about this game is the use of trickshots, it can seem alittle exaggerated at times but its always fun to see one played well, or even better playing a beaut yourself. Trick shots without guidelines are where champions leave their mark. As others have said pool nation is a very relaxing experience if you allow it to be, as it's accompanied with a charming soundtrack, sweet visuals and spot on sound effects. It's easy to slump and play...Lastly, the online is where I find the real buzz in pool nation. The community seems friendly so far, though sadly its small in number I believe. (You should join us)For me 5 frames, 8 ball pool, without guide lines is the most enjoyable and of course the most testing in every sense of the word to play online, but its brilliant.9.5/10 - It delivers everything you'd want for this genre			"

												I have pretty much experience in real pool. I am also a big fan of Virtual Pool series. It's intuitive and controls and camera are great. This game looks great, but... Those random replays in game are annoying. I wan't to see my shot. Not close up replay in the middle of shot. Annoying. Also, when i scroll mouse wheel i don't want to go up. I wan't to go away or closer to table. When i'm turning around i don't want camera to stick to next ball. It's unnatural and it distracts me.Just copy Virtual Pool camera and controls and you will have a great game. Those additional minigames are great but i just wanna play pool with other people. I would recommend this only to someone who didn't play VP.			"

												Pool Nation is the pool game the steam community needs. It has a solid and balanced play system that almost identically replicates what it is like to actually go out to a pool hall on a friday night and just hit the tables with friends. I have noticed some very slight table friction that causes your que ball not to roll as it should always, but that is such a minimal issue. It's easily fixable by playing around and learning the physics. So why should you download Pool Nation>? Because Pool Nation is crazy fun. It has full fledge tournaments, rankings, online play, customizable Ques and Que Balls, solo play, a freaking trick shot maker and tester. It's a great find that is currently crazy affordable. Lets get the community rolling in this!			"

												This is a fantastic game and a must buy if you have any interest in Pool at all. The Variety and quality of ball sets, cues, tables and locations are unmatched on the PC. The  pool halls range from a retro 70's decor to a modernist penthouse high above a city. The sharpness and shininess of the graphics is something I wished existed in real life. You can choose from your standard 8-ball, and 9-ball, as well as several other variations of survival games, shot for shot matches, and many more. The AI is excellent. The early  AI is easy on you while you learn the nuances of the game and ramps up at a pace I would say is perfect as you learn to play the game and perfect your shots. There is a FREE trick shot DLC set coming out soon, and later, a pay DLC Snooker set, at a later date.Get this game now! "

To Hell with everything you know. This game will lead to endless hours of fun of nothing but you, a friend, and smacking some balls with extremely long sticks. What more do you need to know? What more to you WANT to know? For $10, this beats Skyrim, Oblivion, Professional Farming simulator, Call of Duty, and your abusive, self-righteous father figure.			"

												Amazing. If you like pool you should give this a try. Everything about this game is very well done. The multiplayer seems dead at first because you hardly see other rooms but everytime i create a game i have a player join in under ten minutes, There is even a practice option to kill time while you wait for a player to join. This is easily worth ten bucks.			"

												It's a pool game, it's what you think it is. Fun to play against your friends, it's got 8 ball and 9 ball, among other modes. Doesn't have Cutthroat but that's minor. Aiming assist makes it easy to pot balls, most of the time anyway, but it can be adjusted to the point of not even having it if you want. Something to play when you're bored, good buy. Also unlockable cues, ball sets, venues (most are just times of day changes) and table decals.			"

												I see people calling this the best pool game they've ever played. I've played a -lot- of PC (and console) pool games over the years, and this probably is the best one I know of.But! It does have a few quirks. Mainly, it was made to be played with a controller. It can be played with mouse/keyboard but it's a bit clunky. Kind of hard to line up your shot even when you know exactly what you want. I've tried it with a controller and it seems to be much more suited for that, so use one of those if you have one.There are a few other little problems. Most of them are in the UI. It's just not made for someone to navigate it using a mouse. They have released a couple of updates since I last played the game, though, and apparently they have fixed some of the UI problems. I'm eager to go play it again after writing this.All that said, the actual gameplay/physics/etc is phenomenal. That's why it's the best pool game out there.It's well worth $10 dollars, and I would say it'd even be worth the triple-A standard price of $60 without some of the UI problems.As of the time that I'm writing this, it's 70% off ($3) and it's a steal at that price, so go buy it!If you love pool, that is. I certainly do, and would love to play some multiplayer with anyone willing.			"

												Best pool game ever. I've only seen a few but I find it hard to imagine anyone improving upon this one, at least for some time to come. Maybe a Wii-like device with a cue that you hold but beyond that I can't think of any way to improve the gameplay. My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be a way to play against another live person that isn't on the web, such as a friend over for a visit. Maybe the option is there and I just haven't found it yet. At any rate...BUY IT!			"

												I got to say I was a little hesitant about buying this game but I'm glad I did.  Didn't catch the $6.99 sale but still well worth the $9.99 price.  I am not a big pool player and thought I wouldn't spend much time in it.  The graphics and the gameplay is superb.  It the fanciest pool game to date in my experience.  I am still looking forward to trying multiplayer.  For what little time I've played it, I will guarantee you will fall in love with this game even if you don't like pool.  The single player is solid and plenty of things to unlock in singleplayer mode!  I never felt bored and sometimes went back to unlock more stars on matches to up my score and I usually never repeat levels!  If you feel like this isn't for you, give it a try and it will be a great gaming experience!			"

												Very good game, as a player you are well guided after you have first started it. I would recommend this if you like pool! At some point it feels like a port though, because when you use the so called 'Flashbacks' an 'A' and 'B' in the style of controllerbuttons are shown. Next to that the menu does not seem to be always very responsive, resulting in clicking next to the item you actually want to click. These are not major details, so again: this is from my part a great game to play!			"

												The game is very shiny, the game physics feel like they're very good.   It's got 8-ball, 9-ball, Straight pool, 3 Ball, Rotation, Speed pool and they're going to add more.The AI seems kinda bland, like all the AI opponents are just ""I'll take 3 good shots and then screw up on purpose"".  The opponents don't talk to you, and heck, you don't even see them walk around the table or anything.  I feel like they could have gone that extra mile to make the opponents in game seem more lively or personable.There's also options for various kinds of customizations.  You have table decals (which range from the mildly distracting to the highly annoying), and decorative balls (all of which are EXTREMELY SHINY!).  You can even customize your pool cue though you'll barely notice that in game.  Finally you can change your game location from a huge room with a view, to a huge room with a view at night, and then to another room without that great of a view...  Again, I feel like they could have made the locations a bit more interesting instead of looking like you're inside a museum.There's an upcoming ""Trick shot"" mode which may be amusing to play around with, and also snooker is promised as DLC (whether that's worth the extra price or not remains to be seen).The music is a bit too ""jazzy"" or ""technoish"" for my tastes but you can turn the volume down.  It would be nice if each location had its own soundtrack (to add more personality to each place) but that could be asking for too much.  It would also be nice if you could tell the game your music folder location and let it play songs from that randomly.All in all though, this is worth the full price, and if it's on sale, buy it now... I've already gotten my money's worth out of it.			"

												EDIT: The mouse issues I had were due to having 2 mouses on my computer. Pretty rare setup, so most people should be fine. Devs were quick to help me solve the problem. Having to unplug one of my mouses when I want to play is only a minor annoyance, so my revised opinion is that the game is well and truly worth full price. #Original Review#The graphics are quite nice, and the physics seem good, but the interface seems a bit buggy; sometimes I have to click things multiple times to get it to register, and for some reason 90% of the time I start my turn, it's in ""take shot"" mode, which means I can't aim until I left click. Just a few minor idosyncracies like that make the gameplay a bit awkward. Still fairly fun to play though. My main gripe would be that there only ever seem to be one or two people online, and often I'll wait in a lobby for a while and no one shows up. Worth the $1.50 or so I paid for it, but I wouldn't pay full price.			"

												For a standard pool game, Pool Nation offers good quality of gameplay and pretty catchy music. It's ""theme"" is fun and casual. By this, you can expect nice music, colorful graphics, and your basic pool game. So far, I enjoy it despite my low game time showed here. I do not play Pool Nation too often, unless I'm unable to go out to play pool in real-life. Not much to say about Pool Nation. Good quality graphics, enjoyable atmosphere, catchy music, but one thing I don't like is that their controller support is broken in my PC. My Xbox controller are unable to function properly, like some key does different action listed. I'm pretty sure my controller is ok, I'm still using it to play other Steam games that support controller. They have released some hotfix previously, but I'm still unable to get my controller working fine. And this is one of reasons why my playtime is low. I like pool, I like playing it digitally, laid-back on couch and enjoying the game. But without controller, It doesn't feel good for me (This previous sentence is obviously just my opinion.)Last but not least, that is my only problem with the game. Everything else, is pretty good. But still, if I have options to go play pool in real or virtually, I'd be choosing play it real with my friends. Enough said, if you don't have much time to go out and hang on with your friends playing pool, get this game. If you have time to go out, well... Nevertheless, game is ok, and if you have to have this game on your Steam library, go get it.			"

												This is a really good pool sim, it has provided hours of entertainment for my girlfriend and myself. It fully supports 360 controller, and you can set it up to play vs. using just one controller wich is nice. The music gets on my nerves after a-while though, but that's where Pandora saves the day. I def·i·nite·ly would recomend this game.			"

												Pool nation is a pretty good time killer if you enjoy playing pool. The graphics in Pool Nation are pretty good and the physics are pretty good but could be better. Being a real pool player I can tell you that some of the shots are not as easy in real life as they are in Pool nation, but this is a game not a simulator so that is to be expected.Overall I can reccomend this game, especially if you can catch it on sale you won't be dissapointed if you enjoy playing billiards.

												I really enjoyed Pool Nation. It did a great job simulating a real pool experience in my opinion. The various aiming aid levels allow you to gradually get better at prediting angles and how the balls will bounce and roll. I have actually been able to transfer this into real world pool which has been great. The single player mode has a ton of games and objectives to play, along with aquite a few unlockables. I have had a great time with it and it is a solid part of the game where you need to increase your skills and use some strategy to succeed. The multiplayer is good as well, I have spent numerous hours making crazy trick shots with my friends in a  game of 9 or  8 ball. I would recommend this to anyone with an interest in pool games or likes the game in the real world.Overall I would buy the game again and would gift it or recommend it to anyone who asked			"

Pool Nation ReviewInformation About the GameIts a pool game - nothing more to sayThe ReviewThe word boring springs to mind, if you just want a game to play pool with a friend then yes its ok but if your looking for something that will keep you interested for more them 30 mins buy something else. The game lacks any player involement, the tournament mode makes it seem like you are playing the same game over and over and over and over and over and over again, its just lack anything to make it playable lol (one of the first games I have really feel alseep while playing)The RatingThe game needs some investment from the developers to add in more charecter background, maybe even I good story mode or something also need some better music, cue editing and table ediiting would be nice instead of the rubbish you get in the game, my rating is 2/10  Thanks for reading Cash			"

												Most realistic physics engine in any cue sport game that I've played. It really is quite impressive, you can pull off just about any shot you can imagine if you have the know how. The AI players start off easy enough for you to get used to the control scheme (which isn't actually that intuitive, but once you get used to it, it's pretty damn good) and the game in general, and they range up to players so hard that if you give them an opportunity, they will clear almost any table. For some, that may be off putting, but it's not too far from reality, a lot of top players will clear almost any table if theyre having a good day.Only issue i have really is that after a while, it gets kinda dull. Caning each AI player one after the other gets too easy after a while, and the only way to lose is to try and get 3 stars for the 3 challenges per match, but providing they don't ask you to do something that actually requires any thought, like a bank or kick shot, you have no excuse not to get all 3 stars.They also try and spice it up with bonus matches of different disciplines of pool, which again is cool for a while, I still haven't mastered them all. I don't really know what to suggest to make it better, it's pretty much as good as I can imagine a pool game getting, barring adding some kind of trick shot challenge, but then again, you may aswell make all shots a trick shot once you're used to the game. 8/10 - A very good time killer			"

												If you can get it on sale, definitely get it. It's a good pool sim, but I wouldn't say the best. It has some little things that irk me especially having played other pool games like Virtual Pool, and of course real life pool (in which I suck lol).The graphics are beautiful, though at times it may be a little too shiny, like everything is made of chrome. With some balls it's difficult to distinguish between the stripes and the solids due to how the light shines on them at some angles. It also has a tendency for the FPS to shoot up too much if you have a decent gaming rig, so be sure to use VSync or have some kind of frame limiter program like RTSS. The problem with the FPS shooting up is that it makes it harder to aim as how quickly the mouse moves is affected by it. There are no advanced graphics options adjustments except for VSync and anti-aliasing. An option to reduce shininess or even brightness/gamma would've been great.Cue and ball control are fairly good. It may take some getting used to how noticeably slow the rails and the table are if you're coming from other pool games. The speed of the table and whatnot are not adjustable in this game. However, they feel somewhat similar to real life pool tables so that's not a bad thing. The only other odd thing I've noticed is that the side pockets are very open. You can pocket shots into them from angles that you just can't do in real life. Pocket size can't be adjusted either.The UI and interface are very nice. I love the UI sound effects particularly. A minor issue about the interface is that it seems to have been optimized for play with a controller, however due to how slow and inaccurate you are with the controller when playing pool, it's much more comfortable to play with mouse and keyboard anyway. Because it was optimized for controller, the interface options can be a little confusing when playing on mouse and keyboard. Things like a ""select"" button to go forward/continue and they ask you to press ""start"" to view your completed challenges. Again it's a minor issue since these are mapped properly by default to certain keys and mouse buttons, but still something they could've addressed.The music is nice, but short and repetitive, and I wish they would've given us more of that. I ended up turning the music off entirely within the first hour and I just play music in the background via iTunes. It's odd, because with a shiny, cool-looking pool game like this you would think they'd have a bit of good music to go with it. Casual games often do.One more issue that bothers me about this game is that you watch your opponent taking the shot as if you're the one at the table taking the shot. This probably won't bother some people, but because of how quickly the AI thinks and how they move the cue, it can be very jarring. I wish they would give us the option to automatically switch to a fixed camera angle when it's the opponent's turn. I like the way Virtual Pool does it, where you're off to the side as if you're physically standing aside while your opponent takes their turn. An option for that would've gone a long way for me.And lastly, I need to comment on the game's AI. It's probably the worst part of it, and you have no choice but to play against it to unlock things like cue stick skins and ball sets. The AI seems to be suffering from a pre-programmed failure algorithm. You can watch even the low level AI make fantastic trick shots or amazing safety placings at the start of their turn, but then they'll suddenly miss on easy shots late in the turn, often on the last ball itself. After having played hundreds of matches against the AI, it feels like a pre-determined failure chance to make sure the player gets a chance at the table. It gets so bad that sometimes you'll miss on the 9-ball and it rattles in the pocket, and it'd go in if anybody sneezes, yet the AI somehow misses it too. As a testament to how rushed the AI feels, the AI never changes its shot (such as moving the ball or changing the angle at least) on the break. It's always dead center, and therefore you end up with very similar shot options all the time after the AI's break. I don't think that's cool. A good AI should make it feel like you're playing against humans too, again something that Virtual Pool did much better.Overall it's just another pool game. A good one, but it could definitely be better. Well worth the money if you get it on sale, and a great gift to give a friend if you know they're into this kind of game too. Then you can play each other online.			"

												Great. ♥♥♥♥ing. Game feel.Got what I'm looking for in quote, ""Steam's only Pool game"". While the physics model was spot on and such, I really wasn't worrying about that so much. I just... Played it. It felt great! The AI doesn't exactly feel like they're bringing their absolute A-game, especially with the higher stage opponents. Maybe I configured it wrong. I didn't actually need to configure the game honestly, which, while welcoming, kind of makes me wonder if I should have.At the time of purchase this game was just $1. Would it be worth the full price? Yes. There's quite a bit of game, so the price was already justified, but there's also quite a bit of challenge that you're probably gonna want to slog back to. The game comes with online, workshop, and some extra challenges.Sadly, not many people I know own this game. IF you do buy, suggestion is that you get a copy for your good mate and maybe shoot some over a Skype call or whatever.Furthermore, you can screw around with a table by yourself. That's rad.			"

												The game itself is great - 3 out of 5 stars - but the major quip I'm having right now is the inability to record without the game crashing, and the inability to alt-tab out of the game, then alt-tabbing back into the game (or choosing it on the taskbar) as it does nothing force me to alt-ctrl-del and have to shut down the game through the task manager to restore mouse movement and overall functionality of my system.With that out of the way - graphics are phenominal, producing realistic simulation and textures while maintaining a high FPS which is something you seldom see in most games anymore - even with an Intel Chipset.Gameplay flows smoothly, with the ability to choose how much you want to see for aiming your cueball at your target ball - be it with Novice and seeing the extended trail of the cueball and target ball, through several higher tier aiming difficulties that shorten this trail, or disabling it completely for a more realistic grasp of the game. Of course with aiming turned off you'll have issues with performing trickshots, but if you're able to line up your shots, why would you want to perform a trickshot in the first place?Windows 7 UltimateIntel Graphics 4000 HD4GB RAM			"

												There's a lot of good, free pool games on websites for you to play, so why should you even care about Pool Nation? Because if you like pool-games you'll have to buy a waterproof computer you really should care about it!Visually it's quite the looker... I'm not gonna go into the whole ""shiny balls"" discussion, but it is a good looking game. The physics are also spot on, and you can have a little bit more of finesse in your shots in comparison to most free web-based pool-games. There are a handful of game modes including your classics like 8ball and 9ball. The only thing missing is snooker, which isn't a pool-game by itself but it would've been fun to have it included.The single player campaign is fun with ""missions"" for every match that'll give you bonuses and unlocks if you manage to achieve them. Also, of course, there's online multiplayer.The only negative thing I can come to think of is that the port (it was originally released on console) didn't really manage to get the ""select ball and pocket""-mechanic to work with a mouse-and-keyboard-setup which feels kinda strange since it should be easier with a mouse than with a controller. You'll get past that but at first it gets really frustrating if you want to pocket the ball in another pocket than what the game assumes.With that said there's just one question you need to ask yourself; do I want to play pool on my computer? If the answer is ""yes"" then Pool Nation is the game for you. If the answer is ""no""... go get that waterproof PC.			"

												this pool game soooo great and defenetly worth the 0.99$!and for those who have put negative comments they're worthless scumbags Plet me set their issues straight..Audio: for the audio issue you got a thing called mixer which is bottom right on audio -.-just set bars properly to hear what you want.. Besides a pool game hasnt this so noisy backgroundmusic anyway..Controls: the cue doesnt follow exactly the mouse pointer, but just watch the cue for proper aimingand you're good to goWindow: since the cue doesnt properly follow the mouse pointer in window mode they wont let you clickoutside to give you freedom of movement with the cue, but there is still alt + tab if you really need to switchwindows...This only con i think of is that it's lacking a global chat. There are only lots of lobbies for 2 players only to startthe match, so you need search through lobbies or invite friends. And there is no stuck on lobby.. Just start another search to find players.Besides this, the game is just fine and fully reccomandable! Get it while it's on sale, guys!			"

												Well executed game, realistic, physics are perfect. Graphics are pretty cool, The disappointing parts are the fact that there is almost never a match online, and when I have seen any, there is ONLY ONE, and I have never been able to join it. :-( That limits playability for the most part to the offline 8- & 9-ball tournaments which start to get a little tedious towards the end. Unless you're really expecting to get a lot of long term fun out of creating trick shots, you may find the play time somewhat limited unless the online matches grow in frequency a LOT. OTOH for the price, it's a good game to have in your library when you want a diversion once in a while.			"

												It was really well done with some of the smoothest ball mechanics I've seen to date, though not with some flaws. (Edit online play summary) Well as promised once I'm editing in my take on online admittedly I only played one game but it was fun and decent, the best thing is I wasn't put on some shot clock and forced to shoot within a specific time frame (that's fine if it's a part of the game mechanic/style aka like a time attack or rush but in my personal opinion giving someone a shot clock in stanard play pool is just silly as it's not something to be rushed, especially if it's a difficult one that requires serious percision) which personaly always annoys me and has ruined my last half dozen or so ""online pool game experiences. Only gripe so far is that the power setting is a bit off or to be blunt it's not too realistic as max unless preforming a jump shot will almost always result in the ball going off the table which in my experience as an actual casual pool player rarely happens even with a full strength hit, also along those lines tagging a ball slightly doesn't always provide the moment it should making trick multishots, combinations, and the always fun clip shots extra difficult. And lastly this is just a pet peeve due to the fact that video game based pool games always lack a degree of visual depth so you kind of need an aim marker for precise shots which in real life pool you can make just with your own judgement/imagination and this one while highly decent lacks the key feature of projecting a line for each ball struck and instead focuses on the cue and the first ball it hits. In short for a pool game it's good for what it is, I'd say a 7/10 and if you enjoy pool and want a game that does a fairly good job of simulating it then this is a definite must while on sale, though honestly I'd never pay more than $5 for it.

												Pool Nation is a your run-of-the-mill billiards with impressive physics and graphics.I haven't played pool since I was at a christmas party with my relatives back around 2007, and playing this type of game brought back some nostalgia for me.This was my first in a very long time playing a billiards video game, and I'm talking a looong time...like around when Sega Genesis was still new and Sonic 3 hasn't even come out. I think I was only...what, five years old during the time?In any case, the controls took some getting used to, but after about 10 minutes into playing ""9 Ball"", everything felt natural.The camera angles give a nice sense of realism, and if adjusted correctly, you feel as if you're holding the pool stick yourself and hitting the target...with psychic eyes in seeing guidelines.The physics in this game felt just right for me, where like real pool, speed and precision matter when banking shots, as well as how you plan to hit the ball, such as curving and hopping.The graphics added a nice sense of realism to the game, and the crisp clear look on each ball gave the game a nice type of brilliance. The only thing I question is that every ball has a reflection, which is very awkward to me, since I know actual billiard balls aren't that reflective in real life. But I'm being anal at that point, and you might as well add scratches to the balls and pool table, and make the atmosphere bleak.Yeah, that's real pool right there, but I'm digressing at this point.Overall, with the different types of modes in the game, and the option to play with a friend or online, this game is pretty solid, and I would recommend this game to any of my friends that want to play a billiards game without the need of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off pool owners for scratching up the leather.

Worth purchasing as eye candy alone.But that's not all, the game offers a TON of content to boot. Dozens of decals, cues, ball sets, single player tournaments, multiplayer, this game has hours upon hours of fun.My only gripe with it is that steam achievements aren't working properly for some reason. Other than that, I can recommend it to anyone.			"

												If you can get it on sale, definitely get it. It's a good pool sim, but I wouldn't say the best. It has some little things that irk me especially having played other pool games like Virtual Pool, and of course real life pool (in which I suck lol).The graphics are beautiful, though at times it may be a little too shiny, like everything is made of chrome. With some balls it's difficult to distinguish between the stripes and the solids due to how the light shines on them at some angles. It also has a tendency for the FPS to shoot up too much if you have a decent gaming rig, so be sure to use VSync or have some kind of frame limiter program like RTSS. The problem with the FPS shooting up is that it makes it harder to aim as how quickly the mouse moves is affected by it. There are no advanced graphics options adjustments except for VSync and anti-aliasing. An option to reduce shininess or even brightness/gamma would've been great.Cue and ball control are fairly good. It may take some getting used to how noticeably slow the rails and the table are if you're coming from other pool games. The speed of the table and whatnot are not adjustable in this game. However, they feel somewhat similar to real life pool tables so that's not a bad thing. The only other odd thing I've noticed is that the side pockets are very open. You can pocket shots into them from angles that you just can't do in real life. Pocket size can't be adjusted either.The UI and interface are very nice. I love the UI sound effects particularly. A minor issue about the interface is that it seems to have been optimized for play with a controller, however due to how slow and inaccurate you are with the controller when playing pool, it's much more comfortable to play with mouse and keyboard anyway. Because it was optimized for controller, the interface options can be a little confusing when playing on mouse and keyboard. Things like a ""select"" button to go forward/continue and they ask you to press ""start"" to view your completed challenges. Again it's a minor issue since these are mapped properly by default to certain keys and mouse buttons, but still something they could've addressed.The music is nice, but short and repetitive, and I wish they would've given us more of that. I ended up turning the music off entirely within the first hour and I just play music in the background via iTunes. It's odd, because with a shiny, cool-looking pool game like this you would think they'd have a bit of good music to go with it. Casual games often do.One more issue that bothers me about this game is that you watch your opponent taking the shot as if you're the one at the table taking the shot. This probably won't bother some people, but because of how quickly the AI thinks and how they move the cue, it can be very jarring. I wish they would give us the option to automatically switch to a fixed camera angle when it's the opponent's turn. I like the way Virtual Pool does it, where you're off to the side as if you're physically standing aside while your opponent takes their turn. An option for that would've gone a long way for me.And lastly, I need to comment on the game's AI. It's probably the worst part of it, and you have no choice but to play against it to unlock things like cue stick skins and ball sets. The AI seems to be suffering from a pre-programmed failure algorithm. You can watch even the low level AI make fantastic trick shots or amazing safety placings at the start of their turn, but then they'll suddenly miss on easy shots late in the turn, often on the last ball itself. After having played hundreds of matches against the AI, it feels like a pre-determined failure chance to make sure the player gets a chance at the table. It gets so bad that sometimes you'll miss on the 9-ball and it rattles in the pocket, and it'd go in if anybody sneezes, yet the AI somehow misses it too. As a testament to how rushed the AI feels, the AI never changes its shot (such as moving the ball or changing the angle at least) on the break. It's always dead center, and therefore you end up with very similar shot options all the time after the AI's break. I don't think that's cool. A good AI should make it feel like you're playing against humans too, again something that Virtual Pool did much better.Overall it's just another pool game. A good one, but it could definitely be better. Well worth the money if you get it on sale, and a great gift to give a friend if you know they're into this kind of game too. Then you can play each other online.			"

												Realistic game of pool, sounds great and the physics are nice.There's different camera views, you have a top down mode for when you need to look at the entire table for extreme accuracy, and a first-person? (not sure what to call it) mode and it feels great to play in, like you're really at a pool table playing.They even have slow-mo cams that zoom in to the ball when you've shot one in (only happens once in a while so it's not annoying and you can skip it if you want by pressing the button for skipping; you can even choose to skip the turns the npc takes when you want to play against them).Singleplayer has different modes, and you can play against npcs in several types of games (while sometimes unlocking different designs for the cue, ball, or the table as rewards for certain things).There's 'free mode' where you can just play by yourself without a limit (if you just want to shoot while relaxing or try out certain moves).There's also an endurance mode, which is like free mode (the by yourself without npc aspect), but is timed or rather the goal is to shoot as many balls in as you can, as fast and accurate as you can before too many extra balls get added to the table.And they have a tutorial mode where you can learn how to play and learn advanced tricks.You can turn the guiding 'lines' completely off, for people who want to play real-world style;they're just like training wheels and you can choose to use them or not, and you can also choose to have the lines, but have different types, if you want.The npcs aren't perfect shots, but they're not terrible either, and sometimes they'll miss after perfectly shooting 4-ball in a row or something, for example;it's a bit random, kinda like a real person might miss, even if they're good.There's plenty of content to play, challenges in the game that unlock bonus rounds, new areas and npc characters, or reward you with a design for the cue, ball, or table, that you can use to play with.And of course there's still the steam achievements.Or you can try to master the advanced tricks from the tutorial and try them in free mode and then later against npcs.You can also repeat maps you've played already (when you unlock something it gets unlocked for permanent use).Some games I regret buying, but this is definitely not one of them.If you like pool games, this is a nice one to have			"

The only thing missing is snooker, which isn't a pool-game by itself but it would've been fun to have it included.The single player campaign is fun with ""missions"" for every match that'll give you bonuses and unlocks if you manage to achieve them. Also, of course, there's online multiplayer.The only negative thing I can come to think of is that the port (it was originally released on console) didn't really manage to get the ""select ball and pocket""-mechanic to work with a mouse-and-keyboard-setup which feels kinda strange since it should be easier with a mouse than with a controller. You'll get past that but at first it gets really frustrating if you want to pocket the ball in another pocket than what the game assumes.With that said there's just one question you need to ask yourself; do I want to play pool on my computer? If the answer is ""yes"" then Pool Nation is the game for you. If the answer is ""no""... go get that waterproof PC.			"

												this pool game soooo great and defenetly worth the 0.99$!and for those who have put negative comments they're worthless scumbags Plet me set their issues straight..Audio: for the audio issue you got a thing called mixer which is bottom right on audio -.-just set bars properly to hear what you want.. Besides a pool game hasnt this so noisy backgroundmusic anyway..Controls: the cue doesnt follow exactly the mouse pointer, but just watch the cue for proper aimingand you're good to goWindow: since the cue doesnt properly follow the mouse pointer in window mode they wont let you clickoutside to give you freedom of movement with the cue, but there is still alt + tab if you really need to switchwindows...This only con i think of is that it's lacking a global chat. There are only lots of lobbies for 2 players only to startthe match, so you need search through lobbies or invite friends. And there is no stuck on lobby.. Just start another search to find players.Besides this, the game is just fine and fully reccomandable! Get it while it's on sale, guys!			"

												If you're looking for a pool game on Steam, look no further. This is the most graphically, physically, and stylistically impressive pool game I've ever played, and I've been playing them for almost my whole life (going all the way back to Side Pocket on the NES.) The balls, rails and pockets behave just as they would on a real pool table. And there are a bunch of different ways to play, thanks to many diverse mini-games. There's a great training mode too, so even anyone who has never played pool before can pull off trick shots like a master. There's nothing more satisfying than seeing your perfectly aimed jump shot in slow motion as it knocks the target ball in the pocket. It's fun, it's calming, it's everything a great pool game should be. And I recommend it.			"

If I did that in real life, the ball would probably hit me in the face.  Yeah, this game makes me feel like I can totally own you in the pool hall.I love this game because it shows me that if I wanted to, I can own you in real life but I choose not to.			"

Not so. Pool Nation is not only stunning to look at and play, but it also offers a ton of AI players to play against along with a few tournaments and a wide variety of pool variations. Such as 8 ball, 9 ball, killer etc.etc. It's also great fun playing against a mate through Steam! Wicked.I got this on a really cheap day on Steam for just over £1.

												Great. ♥♥♥♥ing. Game feel.Got what I'm looking for in quote, ""Steam's only Pool game"". While the physics model was spot on and such, I really wasn't worrying about that so much. I just... Played it. It felt great! The AI doesn't exactly feel like they're bringing their absolute A-game, especially with the higher stage opponents. Maybe I configured it wrong. I didn't actually need to configure the game honestly, which, while welcoming, kind of makes me wonder if I should have.At the time of purchase this game was just $1. Would it be worth the full price? Yes. There's quite a bit of game, so the price was already justified, but there's also quite a bit of challenge that you're probably gonna want to slog back to. The game comes with online, workshop, and some extra challenges.Sadly, not many people I know own this game. IF you do buy, suggestion is that you get a copy for your good mate and maybe shoot some over a Skype call or whatever.Furthermore, you can screw around with a table by yourself. That's rad.			"

												I've been searching for a nice pool game for years now, and this is the one. This game beats all others in its genre with good physics and modern shiny graphics. You've got 9-ball & 8-ball, plus several other fun modes. Replay is a sweet addition, in which you can re-watch that awesome trick shot you just potted, and archive it for later. Of course there are several locations and customizable cues, balls, decals you can add to the table. Very friendly to the new players who are interested in pool. Best pool game on the market with many great features, totally get it!			"

												very nice pool gameas far as i know the best onephysics are perfectplaying with a friend is no hassle at allthe only drawbacks are the lack of a lobby so you are bound to 1v1 only and can not invite more friends to watch or to take turnsanother is the coloring which is a bit on the shiny side (the balls and the rooms etc) but luckily there is some less intrusive to choose frombut if you like pool get this game you cant go wrongim having great fun bashing my friends :)			"

												The designs in the game is freaking insane. I can hardly catch any polygons, even though I zoom in. I mean, you see them outside the pool table, but all that is irrelevant, but still gorgeous.Pros:-Plenty of songs that play in the background-Highly accurate physics-Nice, realistic sounds-Variation of ball sets to choose from if you can unlock them.-Game modes that I didn't even know you could do, like mini golf mode.-Shows you unexpected tricks that you may want to try out in real lifeCons:-Well... I guess the cons are the way characters in this game exist, but I can forgive all that.-When any balls fly out the pool table, the ball just vanishes. But I guess I can't complain about that if it were to take up more virtual memory.I bet you won't find any other pool games any more realistic than this fine art of a game.			"

												If you're looking for a pool game on Steam, look no further. This is the most graphically, physically, and stylistically impressive pool game I've ever played, and I've been playing them for almost my whole life (going all the way back to Side Pocket on the NES.) The balls, rails and pockets behave just as they would on a real pool table. And there are a bunch of different ways to play, thanks to many diverse mini-games. There's a great training mode too, so even anyone who has never played pool before can pull off trick shots like a master. There's nothing more satisfying than seeing your perfectly aimed jump shot in slow motion as it knocks the target ball in the pocket. It's fun, it's calming, it's everything a great pool game should be. And I recommend it.			"

												Probably the best pool simulator I have played. Definately the most visually pleasing. Looks quite good on optimum settings. A little ways into the campaign I am already starting to feel a challenge. As an actual competitive pool player, that is what I want. Also plenty of options for cursor modes. Making it suibtable for any skill level. Having a blast with this game so far.			"

												This is a fantastic game and a must buy if you have any interest in Pool at all. The Variety and quality of ball sets, cues, tables and locations are unmatched on the PC. The  pool halls range from a retro 70's decor to a modernist penthouse high above a city. The sharpness and shininess of the graphics is something I wished existed in real life. You can choose from your standard 8-ball, and 9-ball, as well as several other variations of survival games, shot for shot matches, and many more. The AI is excellent. The early  AI is easy on you while you learn the nuances of the game and ramps up at a pace I would say is perfect as you learn to play the game and perfect your shots. There is a FREE trick shot DLC set coming out soon, and later, a pay DLC Snooker set, at a later date.Get this game now! "

												Really good game. The rendering is top notch, the physics are amazing. It is so satifying to play, especially with some slow mo cameras when you get a good shot, kinda like a sniper bullet. You get points awarded based on the difficulty of the shot too, so it's not just about winning the frame. Loads of content. Really super addictive game modes and just all round fun. I can't recommend this game enough, even if you don't like pool. Easy to pick up and play, lots of customisation such as ball decals, table and new cues. From a technical standpoint, this game is beautiful. A must play. Best pool game out there.			"

												This game is obviously lovingly crafted from teh finest artisty type people, and coded really well too.I like the environments of the tables, although to be fair, they do clash a bit and on a large screen, the extra vibrant colours can be a bit much on the ol' eyeballs.The music is really good too, I didn't rate the clubby kind of music for the night-time sessions, but that's more subjective than anything else. It would be nice to see an option to turn some of the in-game tracks on or off, instead of turning the lot off and playing something out of the media library on my PC.I'm looking forward to the box of tricks update, although I hope the sounds are going to be much better than those that I've heard from the various test videos for the box of tricks - that is yet to be determined though, but will post more when I've checked out the end result.The online gameplay is a sadly lacking issue though, this afternoon, I could not find a single soul to play any pool with, I hope this is not indicative of a seriously non-existent multiplayer base, as the game is pretty good, and it's gonna be dumb for anyone to try and cheat on it (but there's probably quite a few who would try for some obscure reason).It's great game, well worth spending the money on.Nice job.

Other then that i would really recomend it to people that dont want to spend alot of money but want to have fun. Personaly i would not buy it if it was not on sale, so if you are interested in buying it get it well its on sale. I would also like to point out that if you want to try trick shooting you should buy the pool nation and bumper pack bundle.			"

												5/10Due to the recent craze of 8 ball pool on android I decided to give this a go from the new weekly bundle and I have to say it's what I expected it to be when I first saw it on steam.The controls are pretty hard to get the hang of and the game rules themselves are pretty unfamiliar to me; this isn't the kind of pool I'm used to and to be honest this is easier. Despite it being easier the game has a tendancy to not let me progress even though I get massive wins.Other than that there isn't much choice for pool games which is why I gave this a 5/10 / yes rating. The game could do with some nice progression like the android game, especially since the android game mentioned earlier is free.Suggestions: Allowing you to use an avatar (play as your character, no development though as that makes the game unfair), chips, betting, money, homes / clubs to spend your winnings, cues to buy etc and the list goes on.

When, after a long, LONG time waiting they finally added said mode, it was walled behind paid DLC.I cannot advice to support developers like this. That being said, the game is not bad.

												The physics they've used behind everything is spot on, from the angle of hit, force used, spin applied.. it's perfect imo. I used to play 9 ball about 15 hours a week for years... so i have a decent idea. What else can you really ask for? Single player is a tourney of increasingly harder opponents with brief backstory, 9 ball or 8 ball. I've not gotten into any trickshooting, not my thing.If you need to chill and play a one handed game that will keep your interest for a bit, or your're a pool enthusiast, I'd say go for it.			"

												This game has good graphics, great physics and is very fun to play. It's a great casual game, I was able to take breaks during the day and play a match or two and go back to work. Before I knew it, I had finished all the 8 ball and 9 ball tournaments.			"

												Purchased with no preconceived conceptions of the game, only that it looked nice.Totally unjoyed the graphics as well as the progression system and the simplicity of the game is quite simply easy to pick up and play.Love the fact you can play as competently with overhead view as with table height view.Could do with more achievements and certainly more people online but niggles aside, great game.

												It's the most enjoyable simulator for pool that I've played on steam. My favorite pool game, so far, has been Virtual Pool 4. This game is a bit more arcadey and social driven than that game, but it is still really enjoyable for someone that is into playing pool.In short:+ Good graphics compared to other pool games+ Entertaining game modes+ Multiplayer+ Unlockables+ Trick shots+ Social content+ Creatable content+ Pretty much endless replayability since it is pool+ Easy for a beginner trying to get into a pool sim- Sometimes a bit buggy when trying to move or shoot with the mouse- A little bit arcadey for pool especially when comparing physics to real life or even VP4, but forgiveable since it isn't trying to actually be a hardcore sim- Sometimes a bit more focused on everything else except for the actual game of pool itselfOverall, it's a great game for the price. I'd definitely would recommend this to a friend interested in pool sims.			"

												Not a terrible game. However, once I had gotten used to doing trick shots, which you need for achievements to unlock bonus matches for cues, ballsets and decals, it would pop up that I had gotten the achievement, then took it away at the end of the match. So there is literally no way to 100% this game.			"

												Almost as good as Super Monkey Ball Billiards. Almost.The gameplay is pretty smooth. Not too many crazy bugs or anything like that. The UI could use a whole lot of work, though. Navigating the menus is a slight challenge which should not be the case at all. Other than those two elements, the game plays very well (although I would still choose to play a different billiards game over this one).6/10			"

												Pool Nation resides in a niche genre that anyone interested knows generally what to expect. Like most people, I'm mainly concerned with a pool game feeling right. That means there must be a finely tuned physics engine in place to mimic physical actions and reactions, whether it be a simple or advanced system. Pool Nation absolutely meets this requirement and then some. It provide the player with a very nicely crafted physics system to experience billiards virtually. Of course, the actual game trumps experiencing it virtually, but the imitation is overall convincing and worthwhile. Not only is the core game well constructed, but the development team made sure to provide the extras that keeps players interested. It's definitely worth the buy if you're looking for a solid pool game, especially considering its fair sale price.			"

												The game is very shiny, the game physics feel like they're very good.   It's got 8-ball, 9-ball, Straight pool, 3 Ball, Rotation, Speed pool and they're going to add more.The AI seems kinda bland, like all the AI opponents are just ""I'll take 3 good shots and then screw up on purpose"".  The opponents don't talk to you, and heck, you don't even see them walk around the table or anything.  I feel like they could have gone that extra mile to make the opponents in game seem more lively or personable.There's also options for various kinds of customizations.  You have table decals (which range from the mildly distracting to the highly annoying), and decorative balls (all of which are EXTREMELY SHINY!).  You can even customize your pool cue though you'll barely notice that in game.  Finally you can change your game location from a huge room with a view, to a huge room with a view at night, and then to another room without that great of a view...  Again, I feel like they could have made the locations a bit more interesting instead of looking like you're inside a museum.There's an upcoming ""Trick shot"" mode which may be amusing to play around with, and also snooker is promised as DLC (whether that's worth the extra price or not remains to be seen).The music is a bit too ""jazzy"" or ""technoish"" for my tastes but you can turn the volume down.  It would be nice if each location had its own soundtrack (to add more personality to each place) but that could be asking for too much.  It would also be nice if you could tell the game your music folder location and let it play songs from that randomly.All in all though, this is worth the full price, and if it's on sale, buy it now... I've already gotten my money's worth out of it.			"

												Solid Physics. Online support for tournaments, ranked, and casual matches. Single player  is full of different challenges. Originally a game built for consoles, one should expect bugs and patches. Game has crashed twice. Even with the lack of plot, random bugs and small online community. This is a must buy if you love pool, love physics or want a new time sink.Also, just as in real life, physics is beautiful and unforgiving.  so practice practice practice.			"

												Best pool game ever. I've only seen a few but I find it hard to imagine anyone improving upon this one, at least for some time to come. Maybe a Wii-like device with a cue that you hold but beyond that I can't think of any way to improve the gameplay. My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be a way to play against another live person that isn't on the web, such as a friend over for a visit. Maybe the option is there and I just haven't found it yet. At any rate...BUY IT!			"

Sadly 1) You can't change how you shoot (which is weird), the whole mechanic of moving your mouse and pressing space bar doesn't really make it enjoyable to play.

 Recommendation  Recommended  Base Game Score  B+  Style  Simulation/Sports/Casual  Recommendation Summary  Pool Nation is a game basically involving you playing pool. The game itself has good graphics, and a good UI. I am not experienced with pool simulations, but this game is what I imagine to be the top tier video game for pool simulation. If you are not a pool player, such as myself, then you will still enjoy this game, whether actively engaged, or passively listening to something else. It is a great little game that is worth taking a look at if you are interested. I recommend this game for really anyone.			"

The developers tried really hard on making the tournaments exciting with interesting character and level designs, but playing against the AI still feels hollow since every game feels mostly the same, with no animations other than the pool table.Worth picking up, but has little staying power despite a lot of features.  Multiplayer servers are also dead.			"

I was impressed.Pros:Graphics are amazing and the physics is easy to understand once you finish the tutorial. I would definitely recommend finishing the tutorials because, if you play single player, then certain moves will need to be done (jump balls, swerves, and bank shots.)Cons:Some of the ball sets that are silver and reflective makes it kind of hard to tell if it's solid or striped if you're not paying attention.I will continue this game to unlock all the cues, ball sets, and decals I can get!
