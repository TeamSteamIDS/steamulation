												After a little more than 1 hour of playing, my jaw is still dangling at my chest. Please..Please tell me that this is an early development, pre-alpha release.I am all pro indie development, and it is only fair that everybody with a game on their mind gets a chance to show there creations to the world, but please.. please have an actual product when you start to release, even if it is an early access product, as are the majority of games I usually opt in for, if they have my interest in the first place.You can get FREE web based games in the Roblox engine primarily made by 13 year old kids, with better UI, Graphics, Sound, Animation, Player Controls - and the list goes on..Wow - for the first time in my Steam life, I am actually going to ask for a refund. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -eldrarak82, - im gonna do it this way instead of another comment, since they must be less than a 1000 characters..Graphics have muliple glitches. The sound of the air when gliding is a one take loop that gets pretty ugly to listen too after 20 min, The sound of the vario only kicks in when you hit one of the ""square"" static thermal bubbles so no ridge flying here.Thermal square boxes may not provide you lift unless you spiral violently when you pass through them, so forget about gaining height while passing through, or in some cases like I  experienced in The Alps short after take off, you may encounter  250+ feet per second doing nothing. At first I found that glitch hilarious, but at 50k above sea level I bailed out because it was just sad to watch..The minimap is mostly just a blue square in the upper right corner, and you cannot turn it off once turned on, unless you land.If you have ever been paragliding, skydiving, riding an ATV MC JetSki, Rollerblading skiing or just walking, you now that it is all about weight shifting, and there is no such thing in this simulator, NONE, there is only left and right that makes the glider tilt left or right, to give the ""impression"" of gravity pulling you around.Animation ... well the arms move up and down.. Thats It, basicly a Cartoon Jumping Jack like the ones you hang on a kids wall.The UI is to da** smal for my mouse pointer to catch, there is no way of reconfiguring controls.The glidersize, the sound, the wind strength, the glider speed, is all choosen on sliders with the value of 1 to 10.

												I spent an hour of my life watching a boomerang shaped arm hold a ring. I hope it somehow gets better though, someday this game may be the next Skyrim. But for now.. NONONO			"

												While it's not the greatest game ever or even that great of an idea in general. I did have quite a good few laughs during my idle session for the achievements. This game certainly does reach new heights, just not quite the heights you where expecting.More along the lines of being stuck in the sky...If you're gonna get this, wait for it to appear in a bundle again or grab it during a sale. Hopefully the developer fixes the bugs and makes this something worth playing because the game described on the notice board at the start of the game sounds appealing. Nothing that's going to make me jump out of my seat but hopefully will be a bit more fun than what it is right now. Still, the developer is a cool guy and is still working on fixing the game up so I won't judge too harshly at this moment in time.I've yet to try out the multiplayer aspects of the game but will update my review when I get round to it.

												I can't even. So I was flying around, thermals weren't working right. Graphical glitches all over town. I was flying around and I randomly stumbled into some zone that sent me shooting straight up at 100 meters per second. I waited for a while and got to 100,000 meters up (aka space) and then got bored and quit.My score for getting to space was.....  5.How can they ask for actual money for this game? This quality is significantly worse than a lot of free games.			"

												I bought it on Steam release day and im pretty sure there was no update since then. The game is full of bugs, the physics and graphics are :poop: ...absolutely no recommendation. zPARTACUz wrote everything you need to know in full detail on his review.http://steamcommunity.com/id/zPARTACUz/recommended/367990/ "
