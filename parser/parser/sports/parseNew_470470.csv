												Notice: This game is more suited with a controller. You can still play with a keyboard but it's just better with a controller!I played a few rounds at PAX Aus 2016 but loved it so much I bought it right there along with a t-shirt!This game is the perfect game to play with friends or family in spare time! Even if you don't have any friends you'll still be occupied with the campain (even when you beat it all).This is a great example that more isn't always better! It's amazing to see what games independent developers come up with no matter how complicated or simple! I love Birdsketball!Now scroll up and buy this game right now! GO ON!Love it! Definitely recommend it!			"

Early Access Review
								I managed to play a single round in PAX Australia, and fell in love with the game immediately, and bought it right on the spot. Deceptively simple, it is a game that is incredibly easy to learn (There's really only two buttons that you need to know, plus the joystick/dpad) yet there is a lot of depth to the game in terms of skill level and what you can do with creative playing.Easily a crowd pleaser; the group of people that gathered behind to watch us play cheered easily when amazing (or ridiculously lucky) plays were made, and it was hard not to follow suit when spectating other players. Developer is very responsive as well - we suggested that it should be more than 4 players and overnight the they were able to accommodate us and 4v4 Birdsketball was a blast. Unfortunately the current version as of writing this is only 2v2, but the experience is in no way diminished as a result.Birdsketball might be a bit steep for some looking for something more substantial to sink their time into, but seriously - as far as party games go I can't recommend it enough.

												Player Count: 1-4Controller Support: 2 on Keyboard & 4 ControllersPlaystyle: 2-Player Co-op & 4-Player CompetitiveOnline-Local Crossplay: UnknownReview: Birdsketball is a simple game but, with such a low price tag, it is more than worth it. It offers very fun and simple gameplay that can, hilariously, have intense moments. The aim of the game is to carry a ball to a goal section and score 5 points before your opponent. Combine this with goofy movement, full map free throws, and slam dunks, you can have an enjoyable few hours with your friends.Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this game, especially at the sale price I was able to purchase it at. I imagine this will hold a special place in the Couch Game section of my steam library for quick, casual fun similar to Starwhal or Mount your Friends.			"

+ The gameplay is simple, but quite a bit of fun. You play as a bird, and try to grab the ball and shoot it into the opponents goal before they steal it from you and try to do the same. + Local Multiplayer with up to 4 players along with a single player career mode+ The soundtrack and sound effects are super silly. Kind of sounds like something you would expect from Katamari- A bit low on content / replayability. (~15mins or so before geting repetitive) "

								WOW!This game is really nice! At first I thought it will be impossible for me to get a hold of the controls but it was fairly easy.I also enjoyed the music and art of the game, I do wish there was a online multilayer which I hope is coming soon. CPUs or Bots might be a nice add on if you have no one to play with. Overall I think its awesome!			"

								I've only played just a bit over 40 minutes of it...but I think...due to the simplistic nature of the game...that I have a firm grasp of what this is all about.Birdsketball is a neat little budget title that reminds me of something you may have seen in arcades or on Atari 2600 in the early 1980's. You immediately understand the point...it's pure / distilled gameplay with no bull here...and it's fun. Highly recommended if you're into a cheap, retro-arcadey-sport based good time.			"

								The perfect couch-play game! So much fun to laugh at with your friends whilst refusing to let on that you are actually feeling pretty compeditive about it, the single player career is short but hard enough to really hone your skills. 10/10 would birdsketball again.			"

												As simple and minimalistic it looks, as fun as it is. It's a very simple game where you're a bird who's trying to score in your opponent's goal, and keeping him from doing the same to you, it's fun for a while, yet repetitive.			"

												Great fun for a while with friends. Even has a couple single player levels but consider this a local multiplayer-only game. Has some quirks too which causes me to not recommend this at full price. The dash-against-a-wall-and-bounce-backwards feature is super annoying and makes you lose track of your position instantly. The level editor is broken: if you modify your own level only the additions are saved but removals are lost causing a broken mess of a level. Overall fun little indie game  made clearly with love and passion for games.			"

												Simple and fun!It's another quirky-movement-based local-multiplayer game in the vein of Starwhal, Nidhogg, and Push Me Pull You; but it takes its own form as a twist on the classic ""get ball into area"" game with a cute and minimalist visual style.I had a blast even just playing the single-player campaign, but I'm sure the game has much more replay value if you have a local friend to play (and level create!) with. For a cheap, quick game, I'd recommend it!			"

												Overall: a simple yet fun game!I could have hours of fun with this, playing with mates, watching them squirm as they try to get a hold of the controls (which started off a bit tricky and ever now after a few hours of gameplay can be hard nailing those shots at goals or tackles at opponents).It's got some good game feel to it. The cheers of the crowd provides satisfaction for each goal, the flash of being hit, the little simple sound effects are pleasant. It's hard to decide whether it needs some extra spark. Explosive affects when points are scored or animating birds to look happy or sad when a point is scored.The new cooperative editing mode is a great addition but I believe a single player editing tool also needs to be added. Maybe the switching button could go from ""no birds on screen (editing mode)"" to ""player only"" to ""player vs computer"" to ""computer only"" and then back to the beginning (but ehh, no biggy)Anyway still love the game! Will beg more mates to have a crack at it! "
