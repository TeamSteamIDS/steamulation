												I really like GRID 2 and I think it's the best racing game on Steam. Just keep in mind that it's not a racing simulator like GRID. It's Need for Speed: Greatest Hits. I can see huge chunks of various NFS games put into the game nicely like Touge on the California Dixon track at night is a canyon race from Carbon, sponsor decals, body and performance mods are from Underground, circuit races strongly remind me of ProStreet. Cote d'Azur track alone reminds me of Porsche Unleashed and brings a smile to my face. Codemasters made a great arcade racing game.Strong sides of the game: gorgeous graphics, awesome physics in terms of car behavior, great online matchmaking, single player campaign is fun to play and interesting to progress, AI can be easily adjusted to a desired difficulty.Minor complaints that I have: there's no way to change the in-game assistant's voice. Personally I really dislike that voice and ended up muting it. Many games have an option to change the voice that talks to you while you play 'cause it's important! You're stuck with this voice for hundreds of hours. In Crysis I was able to choose the voice of the nanosuit (male/female/robotic), in SR: TT and many other games there're similar options. The DLCs certainly crippled the game. Extra tracks and cars just don't fit in properly, e. g. you can't use Ford Sierra RS500 online and nobody races on Bathurst unless you create a custom lobby and invite friends to play it. The lack of cockpit view is an insult. I also miss Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche cars, but don't get me wrong, there's a lot of cars to play with.			"

												I got this game on sale, and I wanted to like this game, I really did. I loved the first GRID. The graphics are really nice, among the best for a racing game when it came out. The single-player story mode is cheesy, but it does okay to fill the gaps between races. The engine sounds are mostly accurate, far more so than the first GRID game. It's really unfortunate that this is where the good parts of the game end.The driving physics are awful. Literally some of the worst I've ever played. I understand they wanted to focus on drifting and making it a key component of racing, but it is so poorly implemented that certain vehicles are essentially unplayable. Driving the Koenigsegg Agera R is a nightmare... it feels exactly like driving on ice, which I have actual experience with, living in a place that gets really cold during the winter with tons of snow. It's really a shame that ALL of the cars drift. All of the vehicles, regardless of being described as ""Balanced"" and / or ""Grip"" when you select them, will drift, no matter how perfect you try to take a corner. As soon as you hit the brakes, you can feel the vehicle start to fishtail. Some cars are okay, but I've found at least 50% of the time, racing is just not an enjoyable experience.Even worse is the computer AI. They drive their line and regardless of if they hit a wall, if you bump them, and even if you try to spin them out, it's nearly impossible, they do not make mistakes. It feels exactly like a crappy simulation, minus actually simulating anything.I did enjoy the first 18 hours or so in the single-player game. Really the coolest part of the game was my second race when I drove up the side of a mountain, fell back down on top of the opponent's car, and still won the race. However, after over 21 hours, I've finally put my controller down in frustration, and most likely will not pick it back up for this game.			"

												This game is no simulator, and i've only played with gamepad. After 7 hours I have to say i'm disssapointed, coming from GRID 1.The game now focuses on city circuits with different gamemodes (Elimination, circuit changes on the go...) and doesn't focus on real competitions like the first one no Open wheel/DTM/GT/LMP classes of events and no Lemans Resistance races when the season ends. In 7 hours i've only visited 4 circuits so far, with no serious competition on them (just regular races, with different car classes on the same race), and the handling i'd say is a bit worse than on the first, with they wanting you to drift in every corner.The plot of the game is to make a new series of racing globally, taking the best drivers of each part of the world. in each part of the world there are different gamemodes. (guess what: in japan they drift)The game also feels like it puts together different vehicle classes and they more or less perform the same (Chevrolet Camaro against a Alfa Romeo 4C comes to mind)And the whole point of 'we have to get fans from social networks to talk about us' with the TV show stuff (The game's storyline, i'd say) just feels for 12 years old. I'd say they wanted to make the game easier for younger people. I really liked GRID 1, but this one is average, shouldn't call itself GRID.			"

												If you like games like Burnout and Need 4 Speed. You might like this game. If you're expecting an experience along the lines of something like Forza or GT look somewhere else.   I myself can't hate this game enough. I hate everything about it. Codemasters feels the need to infuse GRID and DIRT with this huge amount of 'bro talk', MT DEW and fake pop culture. Which really just makes me sick. It's insulting. The track line up is laughable as well. I can't think of anything positive to say about this game besides it's not for everyone. Some out there will find GRID 2 to be just what they need. The Burnout, and Need 4 Speed type of players. Nothing wrong with that.  I simply hate this game. The original GRID was so much more enjoyable and I was hoping to find that with GRID 2. That enjoyment was nowhere to be found for me.			"

												This review is focused on the singleplayer aspect of this game.Pros:- Fairly nice to look at- Good sound design- Bathurst- Decent length careerCons:- Handling inferior to the original GRID- I have seen better AI in N64 racing games- AI vehicles are also far stronger than player vehicle, which causes trouble with the high likelihood of AI colliding with player- Rubbing against a wall while turning a corner may result in a sudden outbreak of the Flips- No longer has the 'build your own racing team' style of the original, which I feel makes the game less appealing- Have to pay extra for Bathurst (and on that note, there is quite a catalogue of DLC which indicates that a decent amount of content was cut from the game for DLC, the same problem was had with DiRT 3.)This is not really a bad game. However, it is inferior to its predecessor- your money would be much better spent on that.Still could be worth picking up on sale if you are a fan of the series though.			"

												I want to clear up that im not going to include Grid 1 to this review. Gameplay on the tracks are mainly based on acrade style racing. Its all about investment in a new league of sport and becoming the number #1 contender and the number 1# fan.What I like about Grid 2 are the tracks. They are fun and challenging to race on in career mode and online. The car personaliztion is near enough good, throwing in real life sponsors to put onto your car and personalize. I was disappointed with the physics in use of the cars as the developers focused on the powersliding instead of clean turn exits to build better momentum through the corners. You may think thats essential for a great game but the handling will lead you to wreckless driving in most modes challenged on. Online as an example is almost unplayable for these reasons because players cant take full stable control around the corners for a clean race. Another thing I was disapointed in was the input controls on the game. For a controller it wont be much of a problem driving cars but for keyboard users it will be. Most racing inputs ive used was the simple w,s,a,d & (Arrows) and have no issues playing them smootly. For Grid 2 its difficult as its not keyboard friendly in a way of keeping your car stable around the corners and attempting most clean races. Ive tried both controller (F710)  & keyboard and its a major difference how you perform in the game.Cockpit is not required in the game which is another downside for a latest racing release. DLC packs have been scattered around as typical developers want more money off you. Pros:+ Tracks to drive on+ PersonalztionCons:- Controls are unstable- Not Keyboard friendly compare to most racing games- No Cockpit- Codemasters greedy DLC Schemes- Graphics are not as good for its ageMy rating: 65/100Metascore rating: 80/100Conclusion:I dont reccomend this game full price for the aspects ive pointed out from it. If steam provide a discount give it a go and see what you think. Hope you make the right decision on purchasing the game.			"

Before I proceed to the review, you should know that personally I'm racing games addict and cars lover from kid. You should know that I raced in many online leagues in reputable simulator: rFactor - it could have been even 800-1000 driven hours. You may ask ""why have you stepped back to GRID?"" - it's simple: I don't have time for preparations to compete in online leagues (1 race = whole week of training).Here's where the GRID2 steps in!HistoryGRID2 is the successor of Race Driver: GRID released in 2008, and it represents the same idea.. but somehow better. At first I need to refer into the roots of the first part of GRID - do you remember a game series called TOCA Race Driver? If not, Codemasters produced that series between 1997 and 2006. Because the sales were dropping, Codemasters decided to abandon TOCA and introduce new brand referring to the old product - Race Driver: GRID. I've personally played TOCA Race Driver 3 and I remember that game featured races not only in sportscars but also Monster Trucks and some motocross ones. It was therefore not only asphalt oriented races like the new GRID series. The success of Race Driver: GRID was an indicator to create a new game as GRID2.SingleplayerIn GRID2 you become professional racing driver from rookie just like in Race Driver: GRID. Your first race at Chicago circuit is the tutorial one before you become part of the WSR league (World Series Racing). After first race you're heading into your racing garage. The game features of a manager helping you to start your career. The campaign is very interesting because you start it from the rookie point of view: slow cars (Tier 1). Interesting thing introduced in GRID2 is that after every race you're not rewarded by money. You're rewarded by the number of fans that you got by completing the race. The game makes you feel like you're really important driver in that league. After a couple of races and challenges you need to complete the final one to get into higher tier. Every new tier brings new tracks from all over the world, game modes and of course new cars. Finishing the campaign on the difficulty set to high with all the achievements (50/60 without the DLCs) took me about 30-40 hours of playtime.Features* Game modes: Race, Elimination, Checkpoint and Faceoff.* Retrospection - the feature known from Race Driver: GRID, gives you the ability to rewind the time and correct your mistakes* There are some tracks based on the real life circuits like: Algarve, Red Bull Ring, Abu Dhabi and there are many configurations of the tracks* Cars are well balanced with their advantages and disadvantages measured on different tracks* Anti-cut-track system which gives you penalty (stop/go) for cutting the track* You can always change the difficulty and damage level* If you set the damage level to the highest, you can end up the race for example on the wall very easily* Very good graphics engine and optimalizations (playable on nVidia 9600 GT)* Nice destruction model and detailed statistics about your driver's career like in Race Driver: GRIDPhysicsThe game physics is demanding and the tracks are very well made with bumps and kerbs affecting the stability of the car. You can't set the details of the physics like traction control or ABS cause the physics is simplified. You need skills to control the situation all over the time. If you make a mistake, you pay for it. The physics gives slight advantage to those who oversteer the car in turns and drift while the FWD cars don't understeer as they should. You need to remember that the grip is changing depending on the surface. I would rate the physics as 70% arcade 30% simulation.MultiplayerAlive with many players as it's the extention of singleplayer mode. There are some moments where there's nobody to play with but that's a rare situation. The MP is hard because you start with the basic cars good for some tracks but bad for others. You need to race in order to receive money and buy better cars. Buying new cars isn't the end of story because afterwards you can modify them (of course by paying money). In the DLCs there are some paid cars that make the competition a little bit unfair. For example Mitsubishi Evo X is probably the best drift car in the game, better than the free ones. The anti-cut-track system is not perfect in some situations because there are places where huge cutting (cheating) won't give you the penalty. It's also popular that the penalized driver (stopped for a couple of seconds) does a very bad thing to others: he directs himselft on the path of incoming opponents to caught them on his bumper. It's also reffering to the culture of players because some of them race only to eliminate others, but it's better than it sounds :)ControllersI've tested the game on keyboard and externals: controller Logitech F310 and wheel Logitech G25. The controllers are well discovered and set perfectly. Some cars like Koenisegg are created to be the fastest and hardest so even on the wheel there's a lack of grip on that car and losing control. In general I can tell you that the cars from Tier 4 can be handed perfectly only on the wheel but I disliked doing it in MP.Drawbacks and issues* Anti-cut-track bugs on some tracks* Lack of cockpit camera which was in the Race Driver: GRID* Lack of the option to change the degree lock for wheel* Lack of balancing feature in MP - players are always mixed with different level and skill.* The serious issue I have is: problem with not saving the options to the configuration file (it's locked all the time so I can't even read it). I need therefore to change the graphics options everytime I run the game while there's no problem with the settings of controller (they are in different file). I got used to it but I have the same issue in Race Driver: GRID so maybe it's Windows 8.1 related issue.SummaryTo sum up the review, in my opinion GRID2 is worth the money. It provides a lot of fun both in singleplayer and multiplayer and on every controller. To this day I still enjoy the multiplayer and I was also invited to drive for one of the Polish leagues - Goes Like Hell. I don't treat it seriously cause I play GRID2 for chillout, but it's the next challenge for me and possibility for players to spend here many more hours.Race Driver: GRID or GRID2?The 1st part is a little more like simulation so my advice would be: enjoy your playtime at first in Race Driver: GRID and when you'll finish it, buy GRID2 :)Game tested on:AMD Phenom II X4 945, Nvidia 9600, Windows 8.1			"

												Game is good but i don't recommend it for a few reasons unless it's on sale or you can get it from a trader:_ ""Racenet"" If you want to do the global challenges or fully enjoy the multiplayer experience you need to have an account, like the rival thing. I thought your Steam friends are your rivals but no no, only racenets friends are your rivals._ DLC you have not many cars unless you buy the dlc, also some circuits are only available after you buy overpriced DLC (5$, 6$, 10$)_ Your car is made of ♥♥♥♥ing polysteren when your opponents car are made of titanium. Ram them while taking a turn you fly away, stick behind them but keep accelerating you'll go at their speed and they wont even flinch. If they ram you during a turn you can be sure you'll loose control of your vehicle. If they're behind you pushing and you try to slow down or break you'll loose control, if you keep at your pace the back of your car will go sideways until you loose control. Driving a muscle car and getting hit by a roadster still makes you fly + damage your vehicle. _ Drift cars, the worst thing in this game and there's plenty of race to do with these. The cars keep oversteering._ Pinball effect, if you hit a wall you'll bounce on the ramp on the other side of the road._ Sometimes if you're against the wall and hit a cone your car will explode._ Opponents are driving at your speed, if you're slow they'll be slow. If you're ahead of them they'll catch up with you no matter how perfect you're racing._ Except for you there's never any crash, if you're causing a pile up you'll be the only one ending up off road. The opponents will follow their racing lanes no matter what's happening ahead.I think that pretty much sums up why i can't recommend this game, maybe these seem like small things but when every races you're the only one loosing control (and not just a little) once there's frictions between you and your opponent that you have to restart or  go back in time every time it gets irritating.About the good things of this game?_ Graphics are pretty neat_ Different kind of events (Touge, Race, Time Attack, Drifts, Endurance, Takeover etc)_ Car customisation_ Decent career mode.

												Bought this game because I was a huge fan of the first game. I've been disapointed with this one. The graphics are improved and the damage model is still excellent. My problem is the handling and physics of the game. They just seem off. I spent most of the time starting out only drifting around turns (I hate drifting). Once I got it more figured out it got better but is still disapointing. Also not to mention that there is a lack of a cockpit view in the game. I got this game on summer sale for a great price and still feel like a wasted my money. There are better racing games out there if you are interested in buying one. I don't recomend this one unless you want to give it a try and don't have to spend much money on it.UPDATE: So I don't believe many people realize what I'm trying to explain. So let me go into some more details. The game is beatuiful, amazing in looks. The damage looks real and the system for the career looks like it's great and laid out very well. The handling of the cars is what really turns me off from this. It's a cross between an arcade racer and a simulator. This compared to arcade racers is much harder and this compared to simulaters such as Gran Turismo is a joke. If you are willing to tweke settings and work on controlling the car perfectly its worth a buy but if you are just interested in jumping into a car and racing avoid it.I like my simulators and Iike arcade racing games. Games like GRID 1, Forza, Gran Turismo, Burnout, Need for Speed all have pros and cons. Same with the game it has pros and cons. I tend to fall on a con side not liking this very much. I guess part is I was such a huge fan of GRID 1 that this one has changed so much I dislike it but I would rather play either a true arcade racer that I know what I'm getting or a true Simulator that I know how the car will handle. These crossover games that are an inbetween style I really don't like and hope they will fade out. If you try the game and like it great! If not it's probably a similar reason as me, it's not dedicated to one style of racing games it tries to hit both and misses the mark.			"

												People are very critical with this game saying:- Controls are pretty arcade- You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move- It is not a true successor to GRID (1)Actually:- Controls are pretty arcade- You can turn and you must turn in every corner with a big fat drifting move- It is not a true successor to GRID (1)So why I still recommend this game? Sure it is arcade and if you have ever driven a car with more than 200 HP than you will probably say this is bU11$h'""+t. I have not done it before. So I can say in here it is so much fun. There are a lots of nice cars, from the street and from the racing tracks also. Driving really gives you the 'fast' feeling unlike other racing games (and yes here I meant NFS). Tracks are also nice (altough maybe some more would be better but it is still enough for a career game). Graphics are okay I guess, the effects are cool but there are some details when you feel that it could have been done nicer - maybe it was a price to pay to let older PCs also run this.  If you like fast cars and you do not mind some little mistakes and arcade-ness this game is just for you. Else you should go with a real sim.			"

												I anxiously awaited this game.  For years I watched Codemasters release ""F1"" and uninspiring ""Dirt ""titles waiting for a followup to the original Race Driver: Grid.   When I finaly got my wish I found very little of the original GRID DNA.  Tracks are gorgeous but few in number.  Car control isn't as good as the original and it seems Codemasters has come down with a serious case of ""Need For Speed"" -Itis.  In other words, The game constantly pushes DLC and relies on a quirky multiplayer engine akin to EA's Autolog.  The real problem is, that unless you pay to play you're not going to get very far in MP racing.  The game is pale in comparison to the original and wasn't worth the wait IMHO.			"

												This is a fun arcade-racer that I have really enjoyed playing since I bought it back in September 2014, Some people like to base it off the original Grid, but this game is definitely has more of an arcade feel to it while Grid 1 I felt was more of a simulator. The Online Multiplayer Racing can be fun and enjoyable once you get the hang of the driving style that the game brings to the table and also when you make friends with a bunch of other respectable racers also... The sad things about the Online is that it is dying (I suggest you switch your download region on steam to London-UK to find more people) and there are those occasional hackers every now and then that can ruin the fun, but I enjoy the hell out of this game and playing with my racing buddies... I would recommend you buy this game when it is on sale, the $50 price tag for the reloaded edition is kind of expensive when you look at the age of the game. If you are an arcade racing game fan, I would recommend this game to you. I would believe you would enjoy this game.			"

												I think the biggest problem of this game is in it's name: if it wouldn't have been called ""GRID"" it could get away with what it is. But people look at it and expect the experience they had with Racedriver: GRID, which this game doesn't deliver.First of all, unlike Rd:Grid the game doesn't allow the player to customize his driving experience. Rd:Grid was like ""you wanna play with keyboard? fine, here is a bunch of assists so you can handle the car with those keys. you get better at it, turn some of them off and get extra enjoyment!"" or ""ofcourse a car would slide, but only if you are not carefull enough with the throttle in the exit of the corner. still cannot tame it? just move the TC slider a little bit backwards"". This freedoms resulted in great accessebility and immense fun of driving whatever you input device was. Instead, GRID 2 says ""we got TrueFeel(tm), we have World SIDEWAYS Racing, we are all flashy and hooked up on fans which you gotta impress, so you are going to play the game OUR way!""Obligatory drifting. Oh gosh, i didn't think i ever see it this series. Thing is, you cannot tell if you are faster without it. It has  become part of the game.Again, comparing to Rd:Grid, sliding the car was never an option if you were going to set a time. You would go for a clean line, resorting to sliding in rare instances, and yet it was fully up to the player. Sliding a corner made you feel ""Hahaha yeah!"" or ""Oops, steady, steady!"". GRID 2 does it like ""Right, here we go again..."".Not knowing all that, I jumped into it with my itching fingers ready over arrow keys and was for a surprise. ""OK, it won't be easy"", i thought, and i got better at it, although still failing to have as much fun as i expected. But i kept my hopes up by thinking, ""OK, maybe if i get a controller, i might actualy get to enjoy it..."". WRONG. No ingame customization for controller device leaves it almost as clunky as keyboard. (to be fair there might be a way to make it better by editing xml file, but that's yet to find out). As it turned out, reading different forums, the game was desigined primarily for full-on steering wheel controllers, walking straight past keyboards and pads like they are history. Only a handfull of those hardcore devices seem to provide a player with  full control over the car. Yet in a game, that positions itself as leaning towards arcade driving experience...Another complaint is the track design. There are not a lot of tracks and locations to choose from. Racing tracks are alright. The trouble hides on city circuits and winding road courses. Like if half-♥♥♥♥♥ controls isn't enough, these end up being littered with hazards, things to hit or send a car flying off the road. Moreover, there simply isn't enough room for 12 hotheads to have their way through, making every game mode a demolition derby. This was not an issue in Rd:Grid.Coupled with turtle-paced progression of multiplayer, which doesn't reward you for anything besides placing in top 3, you will soon find that if you can't enjoy the driving in this game, there is nothing else left to look for.

												GRID 2 tries to bring a sort of story element to its career progression. Longtime fans of Codemasters’ racing games might remember the TOCA Race Driver series implementing the same idea. In regards to GRID 2, it’s about one American billionaire called Patrick Callahan, who is launching a new franchise – World Series Racing (WSR) – and has noticed your dazzling skills in the game’s opening introduction race. From there, you become the material to promote WSR across the world and are given the challenge to bring more people to the sport. How do you do this? By beating all the other rivals around the world.An assortment of events populate each season in GRID 2. For example, the first season is set in America and involves racing from point A to point B, but then you move to season three, which is set in Asia and includes events like Touge and Drifting. Along the way you’ll also get to participate in elimination races and overtake challenges. It’s fantastic that the game is throwing a varied amount of events at the player. Making your way through the seasons introduces more powerful cars. Even though GRID 2 includes around 45 cars, it manages to cover a range of types.AI, for the most part, is good and feels to have been given an aggressive characteristic, as these racers aren’t afraid to grind metal with metal with the player. Codemasters has managed to pinpoint that line between realism and arcade racing, allowing anyone who enjoys racing games but isn’t into those that try to represent a serious realism of the sport to come to GRID 2 and get in with humble ease. Online multiplayer is great fun. Players can set up their own playlist of events and what cars to use. At first, the online is limited with its vehicle selection, since the online multiplayer has its own level-up system. Hitting a target level will unlock more cars, which you can then purchase with the earnings you get from taking part in race events online.GRID 2 is a fantastic looking game on the PC. The cars look great and tracks shine with plenty of details. Sound design is brilliant, with loud, roaring car engines blasting out, giving that sense of power coming from high-performance cars.The return of the GRID franchise isn’t as ground-breaking as I would have hoped, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great racer.

You don't need a high-end device.+Classic Codemasters handlings, easy to drive and drift.+Various race types.+High quality audio and visuals.+Customize your livery.+There are so many cars if you have all the DLCs.+No money no problem.+Many little details. They are really many I can't remember all of them.Cons-Can be a little bit boring. I never get bored but not everyone is same.			"

												The biggest issue with GRID 2 (and GRID 1 to an extent) is how much of a realist are you?If realism and or simulation of how race cars really handle is important to you, then GRID 2 is the worst of the bunch.A comparision I like to make on how the cars feel in Grid 2 is with Ridge Racer as the handling in GRID 2 follows the same overly eager grip that allows you to take a 90 degree turn at 120 mph. While the realism of GRID 2 is no where as dumbed down as a title like Ridge Racer, it IS pretty basic. If you have ANY experience in driving an automobile over 90 mph, then you will knowthat the cars in GRID 2 do not behave realistically at all.Graphically the game is fine. Nice effects that don't bog my system down.However, the gameplay and races themselves tend to get stale rather quickly.Once you have raced a certain type of race don't expect to see much difference in setup, length or quality of the AI from race to race either.The AI doesn't ""get better"" or any such luck, what you start with is what you get.The multiplayer in GRID 2 is dead (in the US at least) and has been for a long time.I have yet to find one single multiplayer session located in the US and no one ever joined any sessions I created.In the U.K. their seems to be a bigger following to non-oval type racing and so you can usually find more multiplayer options, but not many Steam users are willing to fiddle with Steam settings to get locked into U.K. race servers.All and all, GRID 2 was a big step back in the series with features missing, or massive DLC to get the whole package required.I hear GRID Autosport (Grid 2.5?) is a step back to the Grid 1 roots, but to be honest GRID 2 destroyed my faith in the GRID franchise to keep me away from any hope of liking it again anytime soon.If you are looking for a good arcade racer, GRID 2 is fine in short bursts.However, if you are the type to invest in a wheel and pedals and know the difference in how a car handles with or without automatic gear box, then I would stay away from GRID 2.

 About GRID 2	I have always been a fan of racing games, playing titles from NFS to GRID to DiRT to Forza, Nascar, and more. For PC, I must say that the GRID series, minus the first game, is phenomenal. GRID 2 deviates from its prior by balancing simulation-level damage and graphics with arcade-style racing. While there are a few things that were missed, such as an in-car view, the huge selection of vehicles, tracks, and environments make this game really stand out. Release Date: 28 May, 2013 Single Player Campaign	GRID 2 has a fantastic storyline. You are a new driver, trying to make a name for yourself and your racing league, WSR. You're led by the confident Patrick Callahan, who keeps you up to date on promo events, passing in races, and reminding you of sponsor objectives. The game is split into ""seasons,"" with each season taking place in a different region. At season 4, you race at tracks globally. In general, each season means a new tier of cars, but there is some overlap, making seasons 3 and 4 both T3 races. There are difficulties suitable for anyone, from racing newcomers to GRID experts. There are multiple race types, such as Endurance, Time Attack, Overtake, Drift, Race, Touge, and more, all of which are very enjoyable. The only caveat I find with any of the game modes is when playing Touge, the aggressiveness of your opponent will count against you, even if they hit you. Just avoid aggresion in this mode, and you'll be fine.Online Multiplayer	The GRID 2 community is alive and well, and the forums are still relevant. Performance is great online, and you can upgrade your cars to suit your own driving style. If I remember correctly, multiplayer lobbies can go up to 12 players at once, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Even when you beat the Single Player Campaign, you will still have loads of fun in online multiplayer.Replay Factor	One of the things that I look for in a game is whether or not it is enjoyable to play a second time, after you beat it once. I must say that this is one area where this game excels. I often found myself retrying races with different vehicles to beat my lap times, rise in the leaderboards, or just to see the difference each made.The Graphic	GRID 2 supports a wheel & pedals setup, but I simply use a keyboard. While there are disadvantages to doing so, i.e. pressing W is equivalent to going pedal-to-the-metal 24/7, the steering is very managable and drifting is easy to pick up on. The graphics are fantastic. I don't quite know what graphics engine this game runs, but I play the game on Ultra settings at 50-60 fps on a GTX 860M. It's optimized incredibly well, and lighting, shadows, and reflections all look great. You certainly won't have weather effects anywhere near games such as Project CARS or Assetto Corsa, but the game will be just fine for the vast majority of players.All in All  GRID 2 is a really nice Racing Game!9/10 From Me Sweep "

												According to some statistics made by the developers, they removed interior view since only like 30% used it and upon playing the game for a while you'll discover that was not the only thing they removed to save development cost and time.Pro:- Good graphics.- Decent audio, apart from the obnoxious low frequency noises switching between menus.- Fun for a short while.- Damage model- Online demolition derby.Cons:- Lack of interrior view.- Lack of any game music/theme.- No rear view mirror, you have to look back.- Extremely annoying slow animation transitions between menus, customisation..etc (aesthetics infavor of functionality)- Pure arcade car handling.- Most cars if not all are drift happy, as the game rewards drifting even in circuit racing.- Extremely annoying announcer everywhere with a sense of humor matching a cheesy car salesman, and unskipable.- Pay 2 win dlcs for online racing, as you get very few cars for online racing.- Rubberbanding AI.Overall impression: meh... skip it.

												While I enjoyed my time with GRID 2 (playing the campaign to completion), I can't in good conscience recommend it as a good example of a racing game.The odds in the game are pretty much stacked against you every which-way. If an opponent touches you your car will, nine times out of ten, spin out and you lose a ridiculous amount of ground. However, if YOU touch an opponent, you'll still receive the brunt of the damage and time lost. The AI relies wholly on rubber-banding too - drive badly, they will be more forgiving, drive well, and they'll go toe to toe with you. The gamemodes are generally enjoyable. The problem is how the game creates progression late-game. Instead of new tracks, the game simply extends old ones, or, by season 5, makes you do the same 6 mile course three times over. This wears thin quickly, and the endgame feels more like a grind than an edge-of-your-seat world championship.The game looks nice, the tracks are nice - hell, the cars are nice (if you're prepared to drop upwards of $5 to use the good ones). But when the actual gameplay is as infuriating as GRID 2 is, it really isn't worth your time/money - particularly at full price. I happpened across my copy in a Humble Bundle, and I'd be wary of paying any more than the $4 I shelled out for that bundle on this game alone.			"

Value I purchased GRID 2 on Steam during the 2015 Summer Sale, but I did have it installed previously. Feel free to add about 15 hours to my Steam timelog for it to make up for this. You can pick it up for USD $7.50 as of writing during this ""North Pole Noir"" sale, and you certainly won't regret it. There are  number of DLC packs, all of which I personally do own but don't use very often. I feel like Codemasters hit the sweet spot with the DLC attractiveness, as there are plenty of cars in the base game that will outperform the DLC vehicles, but some of the DLC packs offer more vibrant patterns. For example, the base game's T3 Honda will outperform the T3 DLC Camaro SS, but the Camaro SS is a fantastic looking car. The reloaded edition of this game is probably the best deal you will get, at least when it is on sale.Here's a rundown of each aspect of the game and how I would personally rate it.  Aspect Rating   Physics 10   Plot 10   Damage 9   Multiplayer 10   Community 10   Graphics 10+   Value 8   Overall 9.5

												This game is not like any other Codemasters racer. They went full on Arcade this time, with a big focus on drifting. A normal race is more about drifting around corners than about finding the fastest racing line. It is almost like OutRun, you just are slower if you don't drift your way around corners. The rewind feature makes a return, further solidifying the arcade direction the series has taken with this sequel.There is no cockpit view or car setup and tuning options are minimal and only available in multiplayer. Multiplayer may appear deserted and it does suffer from low population because of matchmaking regions being based upon your Steam download server's location. There is a lively multiplayer community, but to play with more people you need to change your Steam download region to UK - London and preferably also own all of the DLC packages to get better matchmaking.In multiplayer your goal is to gain money and experience to level up to unlock new cars and upgrades which you then have to buy with the money you earned. Your multiplayer experience can be a mixed bag then in itself. In ""Playlists"" there is no voting on game modes or choice of circuits, instead the lobby is assigned a random track, car tier and gamemode. Players then have the ability veto the combination once. If the combination is vetoed you are assigned another random combination without the ability to veto it.  There is also the ""Custom Events"" option which are events hosted by other players. You gain less money and experience from participating in ""Custom Events,"" and only the lobby host can decide the settings of the event. The host has a wide variety of changeable settings, varying from type of event to forcing every player to use manual gears. There is a system called ""Impact Ratings"" in the multiplayer, which shows other players how dirty their opponents race. These are represented by circles with exclamation marks in them, with the ranking going White-Green-Yellow-Red from the best to the worst. Players with too little data to assign them an ""Impact Rating"" show as grey. The rating persists over races, and can change over time. Lots of online races tend to have people crashing into each other a lot, so do not pay too much mind to your ""Impact Rating."" When ""Impact Ratings"" are enabled, you gain a small cash bonus at the end of the race based on your rating.Also available in the Multiplayer menu are the ""Global Challenges."" These are a set of random events raced on certain circuits with either a certain Tier of cars or a specific car. Instead of racing head-to-head with another player, this game mode is leaderboard based. The game tracks your performance in the events and compares your scores to your friends. The person on the top of the leaderboard is considered to be leading the event. There are medals on the events, granting you small amounts of money and experience for passing their requirements. Based on your position on the leaderboard in the specific events you gain points for the overall leaderboard which shows who among your friends is the best racer overall. The set of events changes every few days with the leaderboards wiped at the same time.The ""Singleplayer Career"" mode casts you as the rising new talent in the fictional new racing series called World Series Racing or WSR for short. In the singleplayer you proceed through ""Seasons"" of the series, completing events and unlocking new cars from challenges. As you progress through the career you gain access to more exotic cars, going from the old muscle cars and small European hatchbacks of Tier 1 to immensely powerful and rare cars like the Koenigsegg Agera R in Tier 4. The car selection has more of an emphasis on normal street legal cars rather than Touring Cars and the like. There is no Circuit de la Sarthe or the LMP class cars to be found in this game. The circuit selection varies from fantasy street courses to real life race tracks like Brands Hatch, Indianapolis and Yas Marina. Unlike the multiplayer, the cars are simply unlocked by completing separate challenges, and cannot be upgraded. The looks of the cars can be customised with paint colour, vinyls, wheels and sponsorship logos. The sponsors also have specific challenges for you to complete. Your progress throughout the career is tracked by the amount of ""Fans"" you have. You gain fans from completing sponsor objectives and placing well in events. The ""Fans"" statistic is hidden in Codemasters' ""Racenet"" service in the multiplayer, and has no real effect on that part of the game.I don't like how the AI can nudge your car around but you really can't do the same to them. I played the game mostly on Medium difficulty, and it is easy if you just race very physically, using the other cars to navigate corners. The AI gets really challenging on Hard and becomes a far more frustrating experience. In my opinion there is noticeable gap in the AI skill between Hard and Medium that really shows in the way they react to you driving aggressively.Graphically GRID 2 looks very impressive. The crashes look nice with parts flying off and shrapnel scattering all over. The stages look nicely detailed: urban stages have detailed buildings surrounding you as you race down the streets. Forest stages look threatening with hills and dense forest just outside the track, ready to punish from the slightest mistakes with formidable damage. The game is also very well optimised and runs well even on older hardware. Sounds are probably the weakest part of the game, with similar engine sounds for most of the cars and a very annoying tire squeal sound effect. There is also the sound of crowds cheering, but beyond that ambient sounds are nonexistent.Grid 2 is a solid arcade racer with great graphics, but is sadly hamstrung by its emphasis on drifting over real racing lines, stagnant AI and multiplayer which frequently devolves to a demolition derby. Fans of more arcade racing games like the Need For Speed series will find much to like here, while fans of the more realistic approach of the first game should give this game a pass.			"

												I wasn't sure if I could recommend it or not. The game can be fun, but it might be frustrating either.First of all: the sngle player mode. Basically your goal is to beat Harrison Carter (a bot), who always finishes first or second (if you're first). The rest of bots is always drunk so don't even mind them. A car driven by AI which is in front of you is always slower than you. It can't drift, never puts pedal to the metal. Is it easy to overtake them? Of course not. The roads are usually so narrow that you're usually blocked by AI cars. If any other car touches yours or you touch it, you'll instantly spin out so don't even try to crash the bots. And here goes the magic! Whenever a car driven by AI is behind you, it starts driving like a pro: never uses break, never reduces speed, never touches anything (and if so, its car isn't damaged at all). It overtakes you in a moment and then it becomes the slow one again. Oh and the best thing, you always starts from the second to last position so have fun with being blocked by cars in front of you and being bumped by cars behind you.The multiplayer is totally unfair. Guy who starts from better position (especially the first and the second) has always a huge adventage. If he is as good as you, and has a good car you have no chance to overtake him. Also there isn't really any punishment for attacking others so feel free to be a ♥♥♥♥ and keep on hitting any car you want.Multiplayer is fun when you play with your friends (unless they play fair).

												Good graphics, decent car list. That about sums up the positives.The physics, oh boy. To be quick, you have to drift, which in itself goes against ANY logic, at least on tarmac. And the way you drift is moronic as well- the car just steps out, no matter what you do. If you try driving sensibly, you understeer like you're running bald summer tires in snow. If you don't want to do so, you have to drift, but how can you do it properly when throttle control basically doesn't exist? It just boggles my brain that a game of this pedigree can handle worse than Mario Kart 64.This is the worst driving game I own by far. I regret spending 6EUR on it, even though it was in a bundle. Speaking of which, can you refund Humble Bundle games?			"

As someone brand new to the genre, and the series I really enjoyed this game from the start, It wasn’t hard to start; however as I left easy mode the game offered more rewards and challenges.The visuals are simply amazing, and the game play is very solid.

												Dear God, what have you done to GRID?Still insisting on finishing it as a fan, halfway through season 2 I realized they must've said something like ''Lets not bother with putting actual damage mechanics, simulation aspects from the original game, cockpit view etc, but instead, lets give the cars absurd physics and call it a simulation''.No matter which difficulty setting you're playing on (tried all), your car is your biggest opponent. It will constantly try to spin no matter what you do, just staying on the road is a challenge and it gets better and better when an opponent actually 'touches' your car, no matter which position, no matter what speed, say hello to the wall over there.I'll probably finish it for the sake of achievements and completion but hell, doing it with a vw golf because it's one of the few cars that manages to stay on the damned road is a shame...Screw graphics, go buy the original GRID, still beats this one.

												~ One of the best and also my favorite racing game of all time! ~PROS:- Quality PC port, featuring lots of graphics and control options;- Gorgeous DX11 graphics;- Completionist Playstyle delivers approximately 28h or even more of actual 'raw' gameplay;- It is very fun to be played online with a couple of friends; the more friends the better hahaCONS:- The lack of a soundtrack during races, except the sometimes annoying ""last lap excitement"" music;- The chance of getting a VAC Ban by messing with the Field of view (FOV) option and then play Multi-player afterwards.Version differences: Reloaded Edition includes all of the DLC, except for the Car Unlock Pack!All in all, I really do think that Codemasters have outdone themselves with Grid 2 and they created a masterpiece of a racing game, a Legend!

												TLDR at the bottom.I came into this expecting a better and updated Grid 1, a worthy successor to a pretty decent (although flawed) racing game.What i got was a chineese bootleg of need for speed.Grid 1's physics though quirky and in dire need of a few small fixes have been thrown completely out the window in favour of some simplified super arcady system that bears no resembelance of realism to the first one.Grid 1's cars had a ""points rating"" for performance 4/5 5/5 ect. This is not a very good system but in Grid 2 they have moved to an even worse system where each stat of performance is a bar. This makes comparing cars virtually impossible. not to mention the majority of cars share the same statline.the cutscenes are cringeworthy, They strike right into the heart of the ""old white man trying to appeal to young kids of the digital age"" as if the game is almost a parody of itself. The ESPN sections are especially cringeworthy, i wonder how much their paid for licensing to an american only complay for an american live action cutscene THAT IS UNSKIPPABLE. Atleast they have done away with the horrible sponsor screen from GRID 1. that would take  way too long to scroll. Grid 2 allows you to skip alot of parts.Pros:More carsUpdated GraphicsPost-Race Sponsor rundownCons:Physics is terribleunskippable cringeworhty cutscenesPhysics are awfulAI is on rails & cheatsThe game is legitimately not fun to drive in.By far the worst event is the random track events without a co-driver or minimap its a random chance that a corner is a hairpin or open. you have to take every corner at slow speed.Alot of other events are 1-3 laps meaning you have no time to learn the circuit at all. TLDR: its not Grid 2. Its bootleg need for speed. If you like the NFS series. enjoy if you wanted a successor to Grid1. youre SOL.			"

												Before buying the game be aware of what Codemasters Customer Services says: ""This version of the game does not officially support Windows 10"" and ""We have no plans for a Windows 10 patch"". The game runs like a charm on my PC, but it crashes to Windows desktop every 3-5 minutes, often in a middle of a race series.

												Its a very good game though for me not as good as the Grid One was. I just like more simulation than it's in this part. The grid one gave a choice in multiplayer. This one does not. Anyway, playability is still very good, competition and player development makes it almost imposible to stop playing the effect ""just one more race"" is definitely there, then you become a new car and have to test it and so on. Easy to play, hard to master. And nobody should be angry that it is not an Gran Tourismo or a Forza. Graphics 7/10, Sound 8/10, Gameplay 9/10. Arcade 70% Simulation 30% Gameplay isnt the most important  thing for me but I give it a nine out of 10 score because of the DLC politics.			"

												Well, Codemasters, I have been racing with you since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, V8 Supercars 2 and now in the present: coming from F1-2010 to 2013 I felt like a change, and decided over Dirt 3 that I buy Grid 2. First I will start with the cons. -Firstly, NO DRIVERS CAM? What kind of racing game doesn't have that!? Even Colin Mcrae which was a 2000s' era game had it! I get the feeling this isn't a simulation game but more of an arcade. -Secondly yes the realism. The damage model is excellent, smashing into things has never been so fun. But lacks, tire wear and rain? Can't change car setups in career mode unless its hidden? I have looked.-Thirdly Racenet... I am logged in, but I cannot for the life of me, figure out why my times don't show on the friend scoreboard in career mode, I have tried logging out and back in but no cigar. As a competitive racer, I is sad about this.-Lastly the price of the All In DLC is way too expensive for a game which is now dead. By dead I mean, I cannot find a single online race. I won't waste money on unlocking cars I cannot use.OK now for the pros!-Firstly I'm more of a grippy guy so seeing a variety of cars is great! I get such a rush from using the Caterham, it grips so well and it flies. -The graphics are beautiful and at max settings I never dip below 60fps-The career mode. What can I say, an immersive story in which you are a racer working up through the ranks with goodies like unlocking cars  watching the protagonist gain social media attention and fans, The AI provide a challenge even though I have yet to lose a race or even finish second (Hard difficaulty, damage on, flashbacks on)My conclusions is, as a racing fan who always leaned towards Formula One, it was nice to get back to actual road cars. Please remember this is my review, my opinion. I'm sure you think differently and you will let me know in the comments.			"

												Exceptional bad mechanics. Every single car drifts, making it totally unpleasant. The worst part is the abysmal AI of the cars, taking racing lines regardless if you are taking the line and then there is the factor that any car can bump you off track. They bump into your backside and you spin, you bump into their backside and you spin. All in all this is a poor game which I received as a gift and won't spend a penny on.  "

												This is probably one of the best, if not the best, racing games on Steam. Sure, the graphics are maybe a year or two behind, but the game was released in 2013. That being said, I think that it still stands up to newer games like Forza. Every once in a while this game goes on sale for next to nothing. That means that anyone can afford it if they wait for the perfect opportunity. If you want a realistic driving simulator, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a great driving game with an incredibly vast on-line mode and a story mode worth playing, it's all right here. I like it. I think you'll like it.			"

												- DLC bloated. Sometimes, from 10 cars you COULD use, 8 come from DLCs.- Annoying, long, cheesy cut-scene sequences- Drifting worse than GRID (1)- Bad bots are too bad, leading bots are too good. You always start at the end, and you have to mow through all the bad bots, who are simply road block for you. After you've done that, you have to chase down those bots, who HAPPEN to start at the front every single time. Gets pretty annoying after some time.			"

												9/10 -Great sense of speed and collection of cars. The damage system is spectacular and racing your friends is always fun. All the cars handle like a dream. The engines sound like the real thing. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the game doesn't have a cockpit view (inside the car) and you can't upgrade or tune your car in anyway in singleplayer but you can customize your ride like change rims, tire size, colors and decals. Multiplayer on the other hand you can tune your car making it faster. I hate how this game has so much DLC because if you own a certain DLC and your friend doesn't you can't play it with them making that new DLC useless unless you want to play it by yourself. Overall it's the best street racing game I ever played but just short of perfect.			"

												After my favorite racing game of all time called GRID and a long wait,I expected a lot of GRID 2 thinking that this will be another awesome simulation masterpiece,but I thought wrong.GRID 2 is nothing like it's previous part and it didn't achieve my expectation but still,I can not say that this game is not good.GRID 2 is a great racing game on it's own way.True it is arcade gameplay but still very enjoyable one and not that simple as it may seem like.Every car have it's own behaviour,grip,drift or balanced type cars they all have a different feel and most of them are challenging to drive if you are aiming for the limit.Driving get even more exciting knowing that there is no option to turn on stability or traction control,racing line or a breaking point.Your driving depends only on your own knowledge with the cars and tracks.Career mod is good,there are many different cars in a different tiers,a lot of tracks and a lot of different race types you will go through and makes you feel like a real driver.AI is not as strong as on GRID but they do sometimes hit you on a straight line with no reason maybe just to prepare you better for a multiplayer.Speaking of a multiplayer,great thing is that you can have all cars in garage and you are able to upgrade most of them.You even have a option to fully upgrade a car which will then be in a next tier with other stronger cars and making your driving more challenging.Driving clean races is very hard on multiplayer because there are so many different car types in a same tier which requires different racing style and ""I didn't mean to"" is almost unavoidable,so I mostly prefer collisions off settings.Not like on GRID,here you get penalized for cutting the corner but on the other hand,you wont get penalized for so-called ""riding the wall"" thing where you can gain time and make other players angry.Graphics are very good,details of the cars,tracks,places and cityes are awesome.Car damage is ok,physics are not so good.There is this ridiculous thing when you crash on some street track and the car bounces form side to side across the track like a pinball.As a fan of a GRID series,GRID 2 deserves a great 8.5/10 because for me game basicly have only 2 problems, 1.It steps out from first GRID, 2.GRID Autosport was released too soon.

												I played through single player with my Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. I didn't try playing it with a controller, but I do know that this game is designed to be controller friendly.I found this game to give a really fun racing experience without being punishingly difficult or realistic. Unlike games that are designed to be simulations first, it really feels like GRID 2 is designed to be a fun game first.The fun comes from a few things. First of all, the racing does really feel ""intense"" - this comes through thanks to all the great visuals and sounds. It's not easy to describe, but there's just loads of polish on the overall aesthetic. The wide variety of levels and locations really helps here as well.Second of all, they have lots of little ways to prevent you from getting frustrated. My favorite mechanic is the flashback mechanic - it basically lets you rewind time to undo a mistake you made. This is really great because not only does it prevent you from going ""oh no, I need to restart the whole race..."", it also gives you the opportunity to learn much more quickly. There's a limit to how many times you can do this so it doesn't make the game too easy. Furthermore, they have a wide range of difficulty settings for all levels of experience. I have only played a few racing games and found the Easy difficulty to be decently challenging without being frustrating. Finally, they have this guy who is talking to you all the time who will ocassionally offer useful suggestions and keep you focused on what to do during a race (and it doesn't get annoying, in my opinion).Third, the overarching story of trying to get fame for the WSR feels like a pretty significant goal. There's lots of different ways you can advance the story (for example, if you don't like a particular type of event you can focus on other types of events).My major issue with the game is that, towards the fourth WSR series, I felt like the content was becoming a bit same-y and it started to feel like a bit of a grind.Overall, if you are interested in having a fun racing experience as a change from a hardcore, realistic racing sim, this game is pretty fun. I haven't played many other PC games in the genre, though, so take this recommendation with a grain of salt.			"

												GRID 2 is a half-simulator, half arcade style racer that is a genuine balance between both styles of racing genre and can be categorised in a league of its own in terms of car handling and circuit design. Interior view has been removed from the original GRID which is disappointing as I feel that this camera view adds authenticity to a racing game, even if it is rarely used, I would’ve liked to switch views mid-race to know that my driver was steering the car.  The music being added at climatic points in each event adds immersion in the racing experience, unlike games such as Forza or Gran Turismo which have static tracks played all race. This game is a minor step down in drifting compared to GRID 1, however city circuit tracks for regular racing seem to have a realistic transition between brick, asphalt and kerbs unlike the games predecessor.Codemasters has created World Racing League ‘WCR’ were your job is to race a variety of racing clubs from the US, Middle-East, Europe and Asia to attract ‘fans’. The inclusion of ESPN a well-known sport commentating channel in the US adds a layer of mirrored fame found in real life and adds depth in the single player experience, which helps new players to the genre engage in this racing game. The addition of displaying short story clips of your racing fame across YouTube, the WSR in game website and SMS messages motivates you to aim for a greater number of fans. While story typically lacking in racing games, Codemasters has pulled of a story mode that doesn’t ruin the experience of racing or feel that there is any difficulty in progressing to the next race as skipping events is optional. As you near completion of a race, overtaking a threat (another popular driver), complete a race or experience damage issues your crew chief will annoy you which adds to the enjoyment of the game but gets repetitive as you progress through the game. Throughout the game the same tracks, modes and simular challenges were reused however the difficulty of driving a faster vehicle in the later stages of the game compensates for this. Codemasters could pull some of the officially licenced world class circuits from the F1 series into Grid 2.In short the singleplayer provides a decent range of content despite the large amount of additional content and will give at least 24 hours of gameplay in the base game*, additional tracks including the extravagant demolition derby has been brought from GRID 1 in a free DLC which is brilliant for local multiplayer fun with friends and family. The demolition derby features only one car to choose from that is kitted out just for demolition events which you can select in the quick race menu for single or multiplayer modes. It was disappointing that Grid 2 features the same tracks as its predecessor, which feels like Codemasters reworked the handling of the vehicle in this mode to be significantly easier to control, making it harder to slide out. *Please do note that I have played this game for console on release week. *In GRID 2 online unlike the ‘WRS’ singleplayer mode you can purchase and upgrade vehicles performance. The new rivalry mode allows users to set up randomly assigned online players which compete for XP to crown the ‘better racer’, this mode I feel is underused at the time of writing this review but is a great feature that I believe GRID should integrate with the main multiplayer mode of future titles. There is also a global challenge that ranks your account on various tracks against world times and a full featured online mode which has typical lobby matchmaking as you would expect. With some interesting indicators for racers which prefer to drive aggressively indicated by traffic light colour exclamation marks next to their profiles. Also by purchasing the DLC you get no advantage over users who have not purchased the DLC other than the specific vehicle, and all tiers are able to be used from the start in multiplayer however if you want more cars they need to be purchased unlike the singleplayer. Grid 2 is a graphically enhanced GRID 1 with several race types such as checkpoint, time attack, endurance, face off, drift, touge, races that change each lap and regular races found in the single payer as well as the multiplayer. GRID 2 is a well-priced game to buy standalone during a sale event, do not be pressured to purchase the DLC’s on offer for this title as the content is not worth what you pay for. The free DLC of demolition derby is to be expected as it features the same tracks and cars from the previous title, but I found that the gameplay was more enjoyable for the demolition derby races than in the original GRID. The lack of cockpit view is a major letdown and detracts the simulation aspect found in the previous title. Both GRID 1 and 2 are great games and if you prefer a more Arcady family and friend gaming experience than GRID 2 is the game of choice out of the two which is an easy game to get into for beginners. Overall GRID 2 is a brilliant game that can be set apart from the previous title in ways, however there has been key gameplay features removed and missed from the original game.*Please do note that I have received this game for the purpose of reviewing it*			"

												This game is not really an improvement over Race Driver: GRID, except for the graphics. This game has a number of defects including:- No cockpit view (apparently because of ""memory constraints"". Really? This is a PC game, right?)- A high chance of having zero multiplayer which still hasn't been fixed after 8 months- Cheaters in multiplayer if you are lucky enough to have it- DLC is pretty bad, seemingly just content ripped from release so you can pay extra- DLC shown during any car select so it feels like you're playing a demoThe physics are er, ...interesting. It's very drift friendly - perhaps for the younger generation - and sometimes I like this and sometimes it seems my car breaks into a slide purely at random.Singleplayer - Seems to be 90% city courses so far (I'm most of the way through tier 3) with only the occasional time trial on decent real world circuits, which might be quite a disappointment for Race Driver: GRID fans. The much hated Codemasters D0uchebag™ is alive and present in singleplayer, sounding like an absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot blabbering on about social media ... I want to punch that fool. Fortunately you can tun him off which is a massive improvement over Dirt 3, where you are forced to listen to the fūckwit tell you to ""upload your video to youtube!!11!1!!"". Only things it's got going for itself is the graphics and the damage modelling. If you're looking for a sequel to GRID I suggest you look at Shift 2 Unleashed, even for all it's problems it's far superior to this.			"

												A big disappointment, particularly compared to the first GRID.  While the UI and the conceit are cool, the game is disgustingly crammed with DLC. How disgusting? The cars that ""count"" as DLC are DIFFERENT between the single player and online versions of the game.  Also, it doesn't work with my racing wheel (a Microsoft Sidewinder Pro) which did work with the original game. Playing it with a Xbox gamepad just isn't the same.On a possitive note, the racing *feels* very fast, and the maps are good, particularly the country road ones. So if you value feeling fast over anything else, this might be the racing game for you.			"

												It's a solid game, with beautiful graphics, scenery and the sound effects are very good, but it feels mainly ""arcadeish"", good for people bad in driving games (myself included). The game however has settings that add more manual handling control to the user, but the gameplay itself lacks realism. The game main campaign might look interesting for the first few races, but then it gets too repetitive,  every time it's the same venues, the tracks are just slightly different from one another when racing in the same place or are exactly the same you played on before, very poor variablility. Also, some events are ultra repetitive as you have to run in the same track over and over, and do not add anything different to the gameplay.The multiplayer part of the game is fun at first, but levelling up was taking a lot of time and made me lose interest on keeping racing on every same track all the time. Also finding a lobby with a lot of people is not an easy task, maybe this can vary with the region of the world. The good part about the multiplayer is playing with friends and laughing about the mistakes and crashes.One thing very annoying is shoving in your face the ""add-on"" cars (DLC) when you go to select your car to play. Add-on cards should only be shown if I had the cars, not telling me to purchase them. If you want to advertise it in the game, make it so in the main menu... By the way, they added a ""Reloaded"" edition, which is just the same base game with all the DLC included in a single package, another way to milk more money out of DLC.--------Portuguese translation:O jogo é bem feito, tem belos gráficos, cenários e efeitos sonoros são muito bons, mas o jogo é muito arcade, bom para o público geral que não joga bem jogos de corrida (eu incluso nisso). Porém o jogo permite configurações que permitem maior controle manual por parte do jogador, mas mesmo assim o jogo não prima em realismo. A campanha principal do jogo é interessante no início, principalmente nas primeiras corridas, mas daí em diante se torna repetitivo demais, são sempre nas mesmas cidades, os circuitos mudam muito pouco mesmo quando o modo de corrida muda, muitas vezes são os mesmos circuitos/traçados, a variedade é bem fraca. Os eventos em si também são bem repetitivos, muitas vezes você tem que correr na mesma pista várias vezes, e nada de diferente é adicionado à jogabilidade.O modo multiplayer é início no começo, mas subir de level parece muito lento e me fez perder o interesse em jogar online nos mesmos circuitos de novo toda hora. Encontrar uma sala com muita gente também não é tarefa muito fácil, de repente falta jogador se for dividido por região. O legal do multiplayer é jogar com amigos e rir dos erros e batidas.Uma coisa bem chata é ficar mostrando toda hora os carros ""add-on"" (DLC) quando você vai selecionar o seu carro pra corrida. Esses carros opcionais só deveriam ser mostrados caso o usuário tivesse a DLC, não ficar toda hora mostrando que pode comprar, é irritante. Se quer fazer propaganda faça no menu inicial... A propósito, eles lançaram uma versão ""Reloaded"" que nada mais é do que o mesmo jogo com todas as DLCs inclusas num pacote, outra forma incentivar a prática caça-níquel de DLCs.			"

													Grid 2 is yet another racing game from arcade racing specialists Codemasters and make no mistake, this is no simulation.  Racing is centred around street circuits, permanent racing venues and a few single stage like events. 	There is a wide variety of events available from straight races, time trials, checkpoint races, endurance (7 whole minutes at a time!), drift, eliminator and others.  The best of these is the “liveroutes” events that occur in one of the major cities.  The route is randomly chosen when you start a race and the mini-map is disabled resulting in you having to pay attention to the upcoming corner to judge entry speed.  Though once you have been playing the single player portion of the game for a while it does become easier as the locations while appearing huge are quite limited in how many layouts are available.	The game is absolutely beautiful though, from the various locations like Paris, Hong Kong and Barcelona to all the car models and how damage appears on them.  The game also performs admirably on even modest machines.My biggest issue with the game is how the cars drive and more importantly how the AI cars drive.  Cars come in two varieties, tail happy and not, that's about it.  Front wheel drive cars drive like front wheel drive cars, four wheel drive cars are glued to the road and for rear wheel drive it's seemingly random whether it's glued to the road or wants to head for the bushes at every corner.  This behaviour tends to drive you to only driving a couple of cars like the Caterham LMP-like track car the Audi R8 LMS.The opposition AI is also an issue.  Instead of allowing the AI to drive the track and react to conditions and you as they appear, the AI cars seem to be pre-programmed to move around the track in a certain way like robots.  It's frustrating in many ways as you end up making the same passes all the time as you quickly become aware of their weaknesses.  There are also some bizarre changes in difficulty, some races are ridiculously easy on the highest setting while others are quite hard on the lowest.  Both these criticisms could be made of just about every Codemasters racing game, maybe with the next Dirt or Grid they could concentrate on AI?All in all this is a very decent Arcade racer, it doesn't do anything new or exciting that is deserving of paying full price, but is a good way or wasting a few hours here and there.

												Game is not worth it. Anything made good in this game is lost by the fact that every AI car in the game are on rails that are harder to break than Wolverine's Bones. You can not race against them without constant annoyance. They will push and shove you out of their way like your car is made out of paper cups and they are titanium. That is on any difficulty. I would recommend Dirt3 but that is a no go as well, as it can not save. It is a dark day for driving games, a dark day indeed.			"

												Although, It really is ALOT of fun to play, The truth of the matter is, the game have major flaws....The game saves becoming corrupted, I believe that was done by CM on purpose, just to sell the unlock pack to all the frustrated racers who would have to race with none of the cool unlocked cars. Then they ""fixed"" it.  So now, my gamesave file is corrupt again, and there is no way to fix it. Well, the 68.00 + tx  I spent on this game thus far, seems to be wasted money..DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. When I complained on a thread made by one of the developers re: VAC being intigrated into GRID 2, I fired of a comment""Are you going to corrupt our gamesaves, and sell us VAC like u did with the UNLOCK PACK.?""Now, before I posted, comments were coming in at around, 1 per 4 to 5 hours. 10 mins after I posted, 15 comments in 10 minutes, and NOT 1 had anything to do with my comment. The next morning. Codemasters deleted the tread, and moved all feedback to the forums, so they can instantly edit out comments that they dont like. And I know this sounds paranoid, But my gamesave didnt corrupt for the 2nd time, until I posted a VERY similar comment on a steam freinds profile.I am openly and publicly calling CODEMASTERS out.YOU SCAMMED US, AND YOU KNOW IT!!!!!!!!!-the worst part is. I really liked that game. Id recommend D/L a torrent, You wont have multiplayer, but with the gamesave issue, your only saving yourself the heart ache of losing all your work, and just when it get good, the game save corrupts...

												In my opinion, the game is worth it if it's under $20.  I've been a active racer for this game since day one.  I've preordered it on Steam because it had the best DLC bundle compared to the console counterparts.  The only DLC packs that matter are the mclaren pack, the mercedes pack, and the gt-r pack in my opinion.  Since there were a lot of folks that pre-ordered it too, you'll be able to use those cars on a regular basis in the public lobbies.  Both the Mclaren and Mercedes DLC cars for TIER 4 are the ONLY upgradeable ones.  You can not upgrade any other DLC cars.  Also, the GT-R pack is good because it gives you a good option to be competative in Tier 3 when you are starting out as a low level driver.As far as multiplayer goes, just make sure you set your download region to a European server (since the game is region-locked).  If you are looking forward to drift mode like the one from GRID 1, then be prepared to be let down.  Because of the new physics engine, it's nothing like it's predecessor.  But I like the racing portion a lot though.  The reason why I liked the GRID 1 was because all the cars had the SAME SPECS.  So the only thing that defines the winner is skill and the racing lines the driver takes to get to the top.  With the upgrade customization aspect thrown into the mix in GRID 2,  it's now about which setup get's you the best performance in the car along with what lines you take.  As you meet faster racers, you'll learn what are the best setups for the best car in each tier or, for me, the best setup for your driving style.  Add in the ""active obstactle"" for the mental game of how are you going to pass this racer cleanly for an extra challenge.  Also, if you are pretty confident in your skills and are in a room full of noobs, you can challenge yourself by giving the noobs a 10 second head start.

												Want a good racing game? Get original GRID, want a game you won't be able to complete unless you buy all dlc, get this! It's easier than original was, and yet it feels harder, almost all cars you get trough career are drifters (even the ones that really shouldn't be) So you will have a really hard time finishing some races without buying a good dlc pack :(			"

												I have not played a lot of racing games on pc, but I can say Grid 2 is one of the best I have tried. I hear a lot of complaints about it being not realistic enough, but for me that's just fine (after all my favorite racing series is the F Zero series). I have not played its predecessor but I can say that I do enjoy Grid 2 quite a bit. I am having trouble putting into words what I like about Grid 2, after all I cant even describe what sets it apart from other racing games. I can say however, that I have not noticed anything ""wrong"" with the game per se. It ran good for me, it was easy to learn, and it was fun to play, and in the end, are those not the most important aspects of a game? I cant tell you why you should be interested in Grid 2, but if you are a fan, you've got to at least give it a look. I cant guarantee you wont be disappointed. But you will never know until you try.			"

												One of the best racing games I have ever played!Really nice gameplay, cars, controls, graphics. Also runs amazing on laptop chips :)The story mode is great and the multiplayer is fun too, the only dowside can be the car styling but its not a big deal.You should really consider geting this if you are a fan of racing games but also if you like games with ""speed"", like going really fast. It really feels like you are in the car in this game and to be honest it feels great!This game is also very realistic on the crashes, it really looks like a real car that has been damaged.Is ths game worth buying at full price? Yes it is!Will it run on a older pc? Yeah it will, actually runned at medium/high settings on my laptop.1-10? 9/10 :)			"

												I have a need....a need for speed...err racing. Grabbed a copy of Grid 2 Reloaded to check out some fantastic racing fun. $19.25 tax in with a bunch of DLC so I figured I couldn't go wrong.It might not be the latest and greatest graphics, but I think it's a solid racer you can spend a few hrs messing around in it and having some fun. I am enjoying the career mode so far.7.8/10

												Don't get me wrong, this game had potential but just has some major issues that make it almost unplayable.- HandingThe cars handle like complete crap and are either boaty as ♥♥♥♥ or so sensative you can't drive in a straight line. The cars spin so freaking easily and its impossible to overcome a spin or control it. If you so much as touch someone, you spin, if you touch a wall you spin, if you do anything you spin. Trying to drift is nearly impossible, as soon as you start to slide, it's like a bar of soap sliding on the bottom of a wet bath tub. Honestly phone racing games have better handling this. 3/10- PerformanceI don't know if this is my own fault, or what but after playing the game for 10 hours the performance decided to jump off a cliff and I know it's not me playing on a weak PC, I play Shift 2 above 60 fps no issue at all on max. If it wasn't for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance, the graphics would be really good. 4/10- DifficultyI don't want to play a game that is so easy you dust everyone, but damn its nearly impossible to win even if the game didn't have the ♥♥♥♥♥iest handling ever. If all of the AI have the same car as you, they are still way faster in all ways despite them owning the EXACT same car as you. It makes winning more of a hassle than fun, you end up restarting the event over and over again until either you wreck one of the AI or they do something stupid and you get extremly lucky. 2/10If you want a nice looking track racing game, just get Shift 2, it's a lot better and cheaper, you even get all the DLCs for free.

												This game has fantastic graphics even on a laptop with very average specs. I like almost everything about it, except the handling. It's a huge drift fest. The developers decided that drifting around corners going 180 km/h is a good idea. I've played other racing games before, but simply had no luck with this one because the cornering physics is so different. I could train myself to handle the cars this way, but I don't want to change my habits for just one game.Mind you, this IS an ARCADE STYLE racing game. I shouldn't have been expecting realism. If you like more realistic handling (i.e. actually braking before cornering), try Grid Autosport. I bought this game with all the DLC, wish I could get all the money back but it's too late. I really want to like this game, and I had some good times with it in the beginning, but soon I realised that it's not meant for me.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game to any one after finishing the career mode.So this is the 2nd of the GRID series. It has better music and better graphics. A race in Algave on a sunny day is really beautiful. A richer car list than GRID, including those breathtaking racing cars and those flashing super or hyper car. The idea of WSR is also great, getting drivers from all over the world, from different clubs, having different driving style to race rogether is great fun.But seriously, because you're the post boy of WSR, and your job is to attract those racers to take part in WSR, you'll have no chance to take part in 24h Le Mans. And for this you're saying goodbye to those stunning prototypes, which is a great lost for me. Well they left me a SP300R though.So since I won't recommend this game to anyone else, how imperfect it is? Well, the career mode, I'd devide it into three parts, the boring part I like a game of NFS, the best second part and the total nightmare of the third part. Why is that? The cars in this game are divided in to three types: grip, balanced and drift. Sounds reasonable, right? But the problem is, GRID2 didn't have a right idea of drfting, and made drfting literally spinning. It's alright at first, when your cars are always slow so you can remain in control. But that makes it feel like NFS. When you're going into Europe, grip type of cars appear. You'll find them funny to drive, with sometimes a little bit of slide, you'll have a lot of fun in driving. But when it comes to the later part of the game, especially when you have those Tier 4 super car. The spin on those super car becomes uncontrollable, so when you are racing in HongKong or Co d'Azure, you'll have to go carefully (and slowly) to avoid spinning and crashing. And even worse, only one of the super cars is grip type. The problem is caused by the poor physics of this game, like everyone else said.And then, BOTs. Thanks to spinning, the Koenisegg Agera R is literally undrivable. But, you'll find out those BOTs will drive this car like a gust of wind, no crashing, no spinning and don't even slide! And like GRID, BOTs of GRID2 like crashing too. That Bruno Silva guy, before the race the radio will tell you he's so agressive and always crashing others, so he hit me, well, I can't blame anyone because they warned me the guy was dangerous. But when they tell me Eliminaciόn drivers are afraid of trade paint, those guys still crashed on me. My face was like ""dafaq"" as I was spinning. So since those BOTs made you so upset, why not spin them out or crash them out of track to take some revenge? No, you won't move them a little bit. If they crash you, you'll spin, and if you crash them, you'll spin too! And in two racing type the BOTs made themselves boss there. One of them is touge. In touge competitor will take penalty for hitting other driver. But in GRID2 it's directly disqualified. And here is the problem. If you crash them, you'll get disqualified, that's the rule. But if they crash you, you're still getting disqualified. Simple. The other one is drifting race. Drifting race is literally a series of jokes in GRID2. Just get behind one of your competitor and see how they drive and you'll find out that it's no even sliding, just driving fast through every corner like a normal race. And when you get to the finish you'll find out that they still have a decent score for that. Drifting itself is a joke in GRID2, drifting race is a series of jokes.In career mode you can test drive your cars. But it's only one lap only in Indianpolis. So in real life it's reasonable because those race track will charge you for using their tracks. If you don't have much money you won't be able to go like 10 laps on the track. But come on! If you can't drive those racing car on the race track freely, why are you still playing it? Are we playing a race manager simulator rather than a  race driver simulator, if it ever is?And, well, no Nürburgring, even worse.5/10, for the middle part of the career mode is a lot fun.			"

												A game with a splendid visual work. As well for tracks, cities, landscapes or cars, although the choice of Japanese and American is excessive. Here, neither Porsche, Ferrari, nor Lamborghini, etc. (And Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo or other AMG against which you run in WSR, are not available in DLC) But the principal critic to do to this game, it's that instead of being called “GRID 2”, it should be called “DRIFT 2” so much ALL the cars drift, in spite of medium settings. Some are almost impossible to handle, like Ford Sierra 500, Pagani Zonda Revolucion, McLaren MP4-12C, Honda NSX-R or Koenigsegg CCGT. Even the Dallara Indy with its slick tires drifts ! What is incredible for Racing Cars which should remain like on rails ! But at the opposite, others cars are totally understeer like the three types of Nissan GTR, the Ford UTE or the brilliant Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (With these cars, take care to the size choice of your rims !) And let's not speak about the non-existent braking of almost all the cars except this little fabulous Subaru Impreza, the ridiculous engine sound of some, or the too low top speed of others. Only 223 MpH for the CCGT and 214 for the Dallara : a bad surprise, because normaly these cars exceed 250 MpH ! And for the “OnLine Races"", better is to forget. It's Stock-Car between furious insane, not of the Automobile race...Un jeu avec un travail visuel magnifique, que ce soit pour les voitures, les circuits, les villes ou les paysages, bien que le choix des Japonaises et Américaines soit excessif. Ici, ni Porsche, ni Ferrari, ni Lamborghini, etc. (Et les Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo et autres AMG contre lesquelles on court en WSR, ne sont pas disponibles en DLC) Mais le principal reproche que je ferais à ce jeu, c'est qu'au lieu de s'appeller ""Grid 2"", il devrait s'appeller ""Drift 2"" tellement  TOUTES les voitures dérapent malgré des réglages medium. Certaines sont quasiment inconduisibles, comme la Ford Sierra 500, la Pagani Zonda Revolucion, la McLaren MP4-12C, la Honda NSX-R ou la Koenigsegg CCGT. Même la Dallara Indy avec ses pneus slicks, dérape ! Ce qui est un comble pour des Voitures de Course qui devraient rester sur des rails ! Mais à l'opposé, d'autres voitures sont totalement sous-vireuses comme les trois types de Nissan GTR, la Ford UTE ou la géniale Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (Avec ces bagnoles, faites gaffe au choix de la taille de vos jantes !) Et ne parlons pas du freinage inexistant de presque toutes les voitures excepté de cette fabuleuse petite Subaru Impreza, du ridicule son-moteur de certaines, ou de la trop basse vitesse de pointe d'autres. Seulement 360 KmH pour la CCGT et 345 pour la Dallara : une mauvaise surprise, parce que normalement ces voitures dépassent les 400 KmH ! Quant aux ""courses en Ligne"", mieux vaut oublier. C'est du Stock-Car entre fous furieux, pas de la Course Automobile...			"

												Overall a good game, but there a some points that are incredibly annyoing after a while. The Handling is everything but realistic. You always start at the back, that mean you have to overtake the slow KI which is constantly blocking you on small tracks. The KI in first place wins distance in this time and its just luck when you have enough time in the last lap to overtake him. Then if you touch another Car, yours instantly loses control and you have to shift back. If another car touches you the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing happens. Feels like that their cars weight like 3tons and yours 200kg.			"

												Bought on sale after loving GRID I was hoping for something good but came away disappointed. The cars and graphics are nice enough. Now on the bad bits. The menu system is akward and ends up intrusive to the game overall, instead of letting you get the best of it. That could be lived with if it was not for the biggest issue this game has. It lacks the visceral experience of a RACE compared to the original. This is down to cars feeling unpredictable/non linear in their behaviour. During gameplay there is an unmistakable feeling of driving aids being too overpowering. They don't make the game fun by taking care of a the odd blunder, they smother it sadly. All of the above was evident from the first few minutes of gameplay, I persevered for the sake of the game for 6 hours of total gameplay. In the end I am sad to say this is a game you should 100% avoid if you want a fun and thrilling racing experience. This is not on a sim or arcade spectrum. The core gameplay just does not work here... The original GRID left me thrilled, this just furstrated			"

I did and, besides the lower quality graphics, the overall experience is way better, a lot closer to one of my favorite racing games: Shift Unleashed.So, if you empathize with this review, you should try GRID, being advised it's a little outdated, but still fun.

												You think that you play Grid, but people think that they play Burnout! Instead of going faster, and turning smoother; majority of people on multiplayer prefer to hit you in the back and make you go full 360. The sad part is that there is no way to punish these players in-game! They ruin your Grid experience, and gain advantage of that! Codemasters does not do anything about it, the game does not have publisher support. Singleplayer is fun though, but multiplayer is nothing more than rage control.			"

												Grid 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.

												One of the most disappointing racing games for me. The first GRID was incredible and had a more semi-sim feeling to it where as GRID 2 is 100% arcade, something that is very unlike what Codemasters have been doing since the first Race Driver. The sponsors function has been changed completely, very dumbed down. And the absence of a decent monetary system is very disappointing. There's nothing left of what made the first GRID great.Thanks Codemasters for ruining a great game.			"

												GRID 2 is the successor of the great GRID, one of the first titles of the genre to popularize in the current generation of consoles. The game franchise's debut game impressed by presenting cutting-edge graphics and good gameplay. The most highlighted in the title was the amazing effect of speed that the game offered players. Upon reaching certain levels of speeds, the vehicle presented light bumps and a beginning of a lack of control in every wrong move could result in a spectacular collision.In this way, the Codemasters started to become a reference in the genre, which eventually finalized with the release of titles like DiRT 3 and the official Formula 1 games. The downside of all this is that before games so well accepted by critics and by the players, GRID 2 hits the market with a greater good than other games of the producer.Fortunately, the company has done the homework and, on top of a new engine, brought practically the same game with minor improvements. What makes the game a must-have for fans of the genre, even in the final stretch of this generation of consoles.Grid 2 offers a lot of speed and game modesFetching the popularizing of your eventGRID 2 focuses on the evolution of the pilot in a competition, the WSR, which seeks to become a known event. For this, it is necessary to popularize the attraction, attracting more fans with incredible feats, how to win duels and disputadíssimas evidence. Every amount reached by public, create more evidence and the event gets even more prominence, even with calls on television shows. Of course it's a joke of a partnership between the company and an American sports channel.And just as in the first game, you must also fulfill objectives imposed by sponsors, ranging from finished the race in a given place, to perform feats within a race, how to overcome a certain number of opponents. Fulfilling these goals, more evidence and vehicles are released.Incredible variety of game modesGRID 2 has an amazing range of modalities that are part of both the main mode, when descompromissadas evidence. They are:Race common race mode where WINS who arrives in frontAgainst the clock race against the clock where you need to score the best time of the trackPopular Drift mode skid, where every you need slippage accumulates point. Add WINSElimination Proof in that every 20 seconds, the last placed is eliminatedOverdrive Exceed the maximum of opponents, without colisòes, to score pointsTougue Wins who open more than 5 second advantage over his opponent firstConfrontation Duels against an opponent where WINS who arrives in frontControl point Run to achieve the maximum possible checpoints and add a few seconds to your time. WINS who spend more time on the track.Resistance test with a particular overtime. WINS who is at first when this time finishEven so, none of them have so much prominence when the mode in which the path becomes totally random. That is, the player doesn't have a map and the straights and curves appear in a way unexpected. This requires a cautious and riding at the same time a lot of reflection.Pilotage in that you dictate the paceThe GRID 2 gameplay remains the high point of the game. Despite not running at 60 frames per second, it features movements which depict very well the realism of disputes at high speed, with a great progression of difficulty. In other words, while at the beginning of your journey, the cars, the tracks and the opponents are not terrifying, as the progress of the game, his skill is increasingly required, both to stay on the right path, how to get in front.Another interesting point of the game is the player's freedom to fly in their strokes. There are all kinds of curves for various vehicles, in this way, it is up to the player to opt for boldness or by doing the basics. That is, every moment you can decide by simply attacking a curve, requiring the maximum of brakes and tires, or just get around it the safest way possible-of course there are exceptions to everything, and some curves require much more accurate movements.The greatest proof of this freedom is the absence of the already popular auxiliary line. Virtually all racing games released in this generation include the famous coloured line showing the ideal stroke. With his absence in GRID 2, back to the old and traditional custom of get to know better the path before to master certain clues. But if the player still find some difficulty-or making a big error-replay mode, which remains intact, can be activated. It allows players to go back up to a certain point of the race, and can change their past movements.Visually, GRID 2 is even more beautiful			"

												I'm a pretty huge fan of racing games in general, and to be honest, I've played most of them too, whether it be forza, dirt, gran turismo, test drive, need for speed... you get the point. This game is truely up there with the rest. Codemasters have made yet another awesome title, however I can't stop thinking its Dirt on asphalt, the driving mechanics are very similar to Dirt, however they are very different to that of other racing games. To be honest, i'm not complaining tho, the driving is much smoother than most racing games and can become quite enjoyable after a while.GRID 2 provides an awesome variety of maps and enviroments from places in USA, Europe and Asia. Not to mention the cars, there is more than enough to choose from for each season and the difficulties are neither too hard, too easy... but just right, compared to that of Dirt 3 (way too easy).Although it may not have the open world gameplay of test drive unlimited, or the graphics in forza and it is hardly an improvement multiplayer, but with aggressive AI and enjoyable handling, Codemasters ensure that this game is always challeging, and there is more than enough hours of fun packed within this game.

												Absolute ♥♥♥♥ing garbage. I can't even believe the ♥♥♥♥ that Codemasters is trying to pull by having made this game. This is literally a downgrade from Grid 1. I'm ♥♥♥♥ing stunned that this is even a game. Pros:looks niceCons:.Driving physics are stripped down and completely different resulting in a straight downgrade from the first game      .the handling is too sensitive. you drift simply by turning hard enough and the game has nothing but hairpin turns      .You HAVE to use the brake instead of the E-brake to drift.drifting is god awful.Simplified hud.default controller layout is changed for no reason and is worse. .Blatant advertising.dated references     .Seriously the first achievement you get is a reference to a 3-year old pop song. It's only going to get more dated as time goes on. .linear story mode     .Some ♥♥♥♥ is constantly yammering in my ear and attempting to stroke my ego while simultaneously screaming about     some stupid competition that I care nothing about and then proceeds to explain it to me like I've never played a racing game or watched a racing movie. .announcer/coach that holds your hand and patronizes you every step of the way no matter how bad you mess up.Forced account signup for some stupid network you're never gonna use.no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cockpit view.NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ RACE DAY MODE     This is probably the worst part about the game. I could handle all of the above. Even the inferior handling but when you can't even stop the campaign to enjoy some laps by yourself and trying out new cars then it's not even worth playing. I don't know of any racing game and I sure as hell don't know any racing sims that doens't have a test track mode. -3/10. I paid next to nothing for this game and I still regret it.			"

												I really wish there was a better rating system on Steam than just yes or no.. i would give this game a 5/10.The CONS just out-weigh the PROS for me. That being said its still an enjoyable fun game.PROS:>Very polished, optimized game. would probably run on a laptop on medium-ish settings and still look great!>Beautiful Graphics, Seriously better than the first GRID's graphics and even those were really good in 07.>Fantastic Damage model for all cars! this could almost pass for ""Soft body Physics"".CONS:>Boring compared to the first one, seriously gets boring when you travel to Europe.>crappy car list compared to the first game, a lot of missing car classes (no Open-wheel, DTM, GT, LMP and no Le Mans). it starts out like the first one and i was excited. I won muscle car after muscle car, then when you travel to Europe you get crappy Econo-box  tier cars i wouldn't be seen dead in like: Subaru BRZ, Ford Focus ST, Alfa Romeo Giulietta and a freaking Hyundai Genesis!!! a Hyundai!!! why?? all that Econo-box list is missing is a Kia Soul!! The only exciting cars you will get in Europe is the Volkswagen Golf R, or the few BMWs you get.... >they want you to buy the better cars in various over priced DLC packs...>CRAPPY HANDLING PHYSICS. Okay, this one is my biggest complaint over this game since this was FINE in the first GRID, and also what made me give it a ""Not Recommended"" rating. They made it so that you may as well drift around every corner, its the fastest way to get around any corner! don't get me wrong, i love drifting, but this is advertised as a racing sim. NOT EVERY CAR SHOULD SLIDE AROUND A CORNER LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF INITIAL D AT THE SLIGHTEST TAP OF THE BREAK CODEMASTERS! No lie, you can seriously fly around a corner faster than any competition by just tapping the E-break, even in ""grip"" or ""balanced"" type cars. Its more of a challenge to race properly and grip the road, this is just silly...For me GRID 2 is a bit of a let down since the first one, and also i grew up playing Codemaster's games like Colin McRae. I still enjoy playing it in small bursts. The CONS just out-weigh the PROS for me to be able to fairly give it a ""Recommended"", i wish i could give it a ""Its Ok"" rating,			"

												As an arcade racer sure, it is decent and can be fun. However I was hoping for something closer to NFS Shift 2, a game that has the heart of a Sim racer with a bit more accessibility. The driving feels very drifty and exaggerated and is easier to manage with a gamepad controller then it is with a racing wheel. The biggest gripe I have is the omission on the cockpit view, it makes me just not want to play the game at all. My second biggest Gripe is the way DLC is handled. The game feels more like a F2P pay2win game where all the best parts are behind a pay wall. The base game comes with enough to get by but why do I need to pay more to race with my favorite car or on my favorite track. It is just a shame.			"

												While the graphics have improved, the racing excitement and game-play from Grid is gone; no teams or team mate, no licenses, no money (win fans instead!!!), no open seaters, no LeMans and few actual circuits.

												Grid 2 is a game which tries too many different things and does most of them poorly. The biggest disappointment here for most Codies fans will be the driving physics, which are laughable. When you realise drifing round a corner is faster than braking and clipping the apex, the game immediately loses any shine.It looks good enough, but the huge amount of street courses versus the comparatively few road courses and the shonky driving model make for a pretty bland experience. Little bugs here and there once again dent the presentation, which - like DiRT - gets caught up in big name sponsors instead of focusing on the driving itself.A lack of a cockpit view is the final nail in the coffin for Grid 2. Very disappointing experience.			"

I mean come on! you crash on them with 270km, you get tossed like <3 <3 <3 <3 and they are just keep going like nothing happened AND NO DAMAGES? really? The maps .. All the same, no matter what mode you play. 5-6 areas with a biiiiiiiit modified tracks.The ""freezing"" because of enviromental lightning.. Doesn't matter how high or low you have your graphics. Doesn't matter if it's Intel or AMD. IT WILL FREEZE for a few miliseconds that will propably ruin your race especialy online.The car handling. The whole thing was bad. where are those awesome ORIGINAL GRID settings for realistic driving? They don't even have the HEAD VIEW option.Now for the online mode.This was the worst. The menus.. You have to click in damn LOT choices to just enter an event.. You need to exit a party to change car settings or get new unlocks or upgrade cars -means you will lose that party, take it's sweet time to find new-. The car menu was poorly designed.. To upgrade cars you kept needed to move up and down on riddiculus selections, to swich between cars you need to do all over menu browse from start.. ReALLY?Second most stupid thing online.. CHEATERS .. yep just like dirt or f1 we have a lots of those here .. nothing more to say. And ofcourse that there is no penalty for those who are just playing to crash on you so their ""pals"" can get the flag. THIS IS NO <3<3<3ING DIRT!My opinion, get GRID 1 if you want a really good racing game.. with a LOT of tracks and cars again, with NO need for stupid upgrates.. Just get money and buy cars.. Just no online games there. lan and splitscreen are still available.			"

												Truth be told, it isn't the best when it comes to the amount of content featured: 50 ish cars and less than 20 tracks, not including the layouts, as well as stupidly overpriced DLC just for (mostly) modified versions of existing cars.It also handles almost nothing like the original Race Driver: GRID. Any car can drift, even Grippy-type ones, with some handbrake persuasion. About the only thing that's improved instead of replaced is the damage modelling. Frankly, Codemasters should've renamed the game if the only thing keeping it in touch with the original GRID is the premise of tackling multiple motorsport disciplines, from straight up races to touges.Visually, there's no denying it; GRID 2 looks beautiful, and for once I accept the large amounts of lens flare and lens grime, only because there is no true Dashboard Camera. This game really doesn't need it anyway.Sound design is also amazingly well done. It's quite rare to see a racing game do the Skyline R34 engine and exhaust sounds as close to the real thing as it gets, and then there's the tunnels and terrain echoing.Career mode offers varied racing disciplines, and the multiplayer is very solid, but it all depends on your ability to look past the changed features, little content and LACK OF COCKPIT VIEW *grrrr* for an otherwise pure racing experience.

It's not that bad to give up playing it, still, you can have a bit of fun playing online with your friend.Not a proper sequel, absolutley.The Grid series was a good arcade-simulator series, getting pretty close to being a simulator (Not comparing to Gran Turismo, because it's a true simulator and Grid is not near that, but pretty close). Race Driver: Grid was a pretty neat racing game, that was all about motorsport and very realsitic physics. But then cames out the second one and gives motorsport a middle finger.Pros:+Good graphics and optimization. Game looks and runs very good on Intel HD graphics, which sounds a little bit odd.+light-hearted fun in multiplayer. If you, of course, playing it with a friend, not a random group of people.Cons:-Arcade physics. The thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most. You have to bloody drift in order to get through a tight corner, and if your car doesn't drift, you can always corner with a wall. In Race driver: Grid you spin all over the place if you do drift, but here, you HAVE to drift. The more appropriate title for this game is: ""NFS: Codemasters edition"".-No real motivation to do anything. (I'm sorry if i've missed something during career mode) In the first one you had money, here you have fans that don't do ♥♥♥♥.-Everybody drives like crazy. That's why i don't like to play it with some random people. Everybody is trying their hardest for you to fail, bashing into walls, bashing into you, bashing into a wall and make a great wall of cars, that is impossible not to hit and etc.Summary:Not a good game, arcade physics, DLCs that don't make any sense (exept for the one where you get a Koennigseg CCGT),and overall, the game doesnt make any sense, with an autosport series. If you like it -  go ahead, enjoy it, but personally, i prefer the first one and Grid Autosport.			"

												For someone like me, (who loves Codemasters' games as well as the orginal GRID) the standard version of GRID 2 is dissapointing and deviates from what made the original game so good. I really want to praise the fantastic visuals, incredible sound design, with impressive roster of cars and a decent online multiplayer, but there are some glaring problems. I could go on about the horrible americanised story, which is tedious and dull. I could do a rant on the 'Truefeel' handling system that robs the car's identity when driving and I could rage about the omission of the cockpit view, but these aren't the true reasons why, I just can't in good faith, give this game the recommended verdict.   The actual reasoning is it's DLC, which is FAR too overpriced. At £25 for all the DLC you get the following:- 5 Tracks (15 routes). - 24 Cars (2 liveries).- A 15% discount on every in-game purchase in online multiplayer.- Instant access to every online car.(This doesn't include the free demoliton derby game mode)That may seem much, but as the game is £20, it's far less value, while creating a massive player disconnect in the multiplayer.Overall if you like GRID stay the hell away from this, and wait for GRID Autosport. This is too much of a cash grab that tarnishes the GRID name. 5/10   "

TL/DR REVIEW: MediocreGRID 2 is a very arcady racer. Multiplayer is dead, singleplayer is not that great in my opinion. I guess the events and fan system is kind of cool, but the actual racing with AI in this game is not good in my opinion. The game bored me quickly. If you just want a simple, casual arcady (no problem with that) racing game with decent graphics, this might be for you. But for me it's just very mediocre.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game.

												Grid 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.Best Game Moment: Aggressively drifting round a final corner to take first place and win a championship.

On city streets, and windy, country roads. There is just the right amount of grip and slip that just feels good with a Xbox controller. I say if you want realism.

The things they added.- The LiveTrack. 100% unrealistic, painful if you like to know the tracks you are racing on, the LiveTrack is used for classic races or Endurance... Speaking of which:- Endurance mode. Basically, it's a fancy name to try and make you believe it's also brand new, when it's really just a race that ends at a specific time rather than a specific line.- Story. Let's face it, the first GRID was minimalist, story speaking. But it also didn't need it, and the lack of it - or the small presence of it - didn't bother me. This time, however, there is a scenario. This time, you are building the WSR, the World Series Racing. Some cinematics, some (fake) coverage by ESPN... It definitely feels more alive.Now, for the things they modified or deleted.- Cameras. No more interior camera - which is a shame, we'll admit it - and, more importantly, totally trashed up TV cameras - taking away all the value of the replays. No really, replaying your best drifts on GRID was like watching 2 Fast 2 Furious, in GRID2 it feels like the cameraman browses /r/trees on a daily basis.- Teammate. It was fun, knowing your fellow crew member was out there, helping you out on the track, pushing opponents out of the track, stealing the first place and apologizing deeply when he finished last. Now, all you have is the guy talking to you since day 1 (but you still don't know who it is) and complaining he'll have to mend your car when you wreck it.- The Drifting. It's hard to explain. But the drifting in GRID felt a hundred times better. Firstly, you were alone on the track, without stupid people pushing you out of the way because they forgot which race category they were in. Secondly, the vibe was astonishing - the japanse speakerman going crazy over your moves, the crowd... And lastly, it just felt more responsive. The combo system was nice and clear, the way the car drifted was purely arcade but so enjoyable...- No more rep/money system. GRID2 brings in the ""fan system"", already seen in Blur, for example. - Aaaaaand the way the sponsors work changed too. And this time, it clearly is below what GRID offered.That's not all, these are just the things that pop out first when I think about it. Now, the graphics are really nice, there are plenty of cars to choose from, and the tracks are still interesting. So ?1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIt's probably still better to grab it while it's on sale - hint: it's really cheap - but if you like arcade racing, and/or the first GRID, well, go for it.

												Excellent arcade and terrible sequel. It's even not a sequel, it's completely another game, named GRID2 by mistake.If you are looking for some racing action - GRID2 is good choice. If you're looking for real GRID sequel... Well, I have bad news for you. It is still not released yet.			"

												very good graphics and driving mechanics, and it's very fun to put sponsors on your cars! very nice career mode that you can set the liveries for each of your car. it's enough to be a recommended racing game.but i miss my teammate from the first Grid game, it must be more fun if you can recruit one driver to be your teammate like in the previous Grid.

												Short version: Not anywhere as good as Grid 1, but still a fun $5 for a racing game.  Multiplayer is pretty inactive & the DLC is mostly stupid.Long version:I was a huge Grid 1 fan, and at first play this game disappointed me at how different it is.  Grid 1 wants you to turn corners carefully, 2 wants you to drift drift drift all the time.  It's very arcadey & far from the sim based racer 1 is.  Multiplayer servers aren't very active, I think people have moved on to Autosport & other games.  I really hate the corner cutting ""feature"", its punishment enough when you accidentally go over gravel or grass, I don't need an additional penalty for a mistake.The maps get pretty old, even though they have you race on different sections of the same area.  The later parts of the game get really hard because the tier4 cars are nigh uncontrollable.  I had better times in the slower tier2 cars than I did the 200 mph+ tier4 cars because I crash at every turn in the tier3/4 cars.One thing this game did well was a variety of gametypes.  As opposed to just race, drift & head to head from 1, it added checkpoint, overtake, time attack & togue.As a comparison to Grid 1, it's very inferior.  As a cheap racing game, it's fun enough.Overall verdict: 7.2/10			"

												Wow at the time I got this game I thought it was awsome, its finally for the right priceas a racing fan I was let down that I cannot use my wheel to drive this game due to the reason of the view, it was a very big deal to many people to feel like you're in a car but that didn't come with grid 2 which was a letdown, some might say the originals was much better but this is fun too, The Dlc cars are super POWERFUL and you'll pretty much own everyone, Drifting was extremly hard in this game and well it felt good at time but at the same time it felt unatural.This game has+  Graphics are great+ The sound  is fantastic very realistic.+ Adrenaline pumping racing+ Theres alot of different gameplay modes you can do+ Multiplayer is smooth runs smooth+20 dollars or below is a reasonable price.- Not many customization on your vehicle and lack of it- Lots of people hated it because of the view, missing COCKPIT view was taken out of the game, very big deal for racers who wants immersion- DLC cars are overpowered- Drifting feels unsatisfying - game feels more arcadey this time around			"

												Like all racing titles from Codemasters, this one is another piece of crap. If you want a good racing sim, pick one from EA or Atari. You start with an undriveable car, that won`t make a curve if your life depended on it. That makes the game very frustrating. In terms on UI, this game is also a fail. Is most parts of the game, the only option to exit the game is to use ALT+F4. The ESC key won't always work and there is no way to skip the painfully long and slow cinematics. From a scale of 0-10, this game gets a very round ZERO.			"

Game was played on Hard6/10Pros- Great graphics- Good selection of cars- Nice tracks- Lengthy game(20+ hours)- Game feels ""real"" compared to Grid 1- Circuit races and sprints are very satisfying and provide a good amount of challenge- Can run smoothly on weak/medium PCsCons- AI is still ♥♥♥♥, some cars are almost impossible to beat while the rest try to slow you down- Drifting sucks- Your car becomes unstable at high speeds. CPU can cruise the tight corners easily.- NO RACING LINE- Inconsistent difficulty- Grip cars feel uselessRace Driver Grid was a fantastic game, but in terms of driving it felt quite similar to the Need for Speed series. It feels more arcadey than realistic. Grid 2 on the other hand did a better job of making the game feel real. You can't just hit the pedal and force your car to turn. You have to find the right moment to brake and accelerate. The game feels much better in terms of circuit racing or sprints. You actually have to fight all the way to get to the number 1 spot. In Grid 1 it was quite easy to get to 1st. There are lots of cars as well, and they are classified as one of the three : Balanced, Drift or Grip. In my entire playtime I don't think I have ever used a Grip car for a race, unless I had no choice and the game forced me to use it. You're going to have to drift a lot in Grid 2, and some grip cars suck at drifting. Speaking of drifting, it sucks in this game. Grid 1 absolutely nailed drifting. It was perfect. Now drifting here is a 30 second track and no customizations. Plain horrible. It tried to go Japanese since most drift races are on mountain passes.The game still has no racing line, which can become crucial in those difficult tracks for the Vehicle Challenges on the higher tiers. There were 3 difficult challenges where the racing line would have helped significantly. The Jaguar at Hong Kong, the Benz at Okutama and the Pagani Huayra challenge. Cars also become unstable at high speeds while other cars can just stick to the ground and not slide. I've seen this several times already. I forcefully rammed a CPU car and took a 10 second lead, but he was able to catch up and beat me on the last corner. I've seen his style and even with the car he should not be able to just accelerate through corners at that speed. Don't be surprised if you see the CPUs blast through chicanes at 250km/hr without slowing down. It's a good game, but I can't recommended it. A lot of race types just suck and the circuit races and sprints are the only fun ones.			"

												Not a simulation but definately one of the best arcade racing game i have played.Great Graphic optimisation , Drift to Win what actually need skills and makes a lot of fun racing on it , Xbox 360 Controller friendly so you don't need some bomb equipment to be able to race clean , great tracks and cars incluiding all those DLC Contents to. Moding posible ""only for singleplayer aloved"" !I give it a 10/10 as i never get any problems with it , spent a lot of hours playing it and enjoyed every second on it.Bad on it is only if you play MP with a bad looby where you catch a lot Rammer's and not skilled driver's , but this is not a codemaster's fail !

												Alot of complaints that this is worse than Grid1, but for those casual racers like me you will probably like this one too.   Get this if you just want to load up a game and race quick, without messing with car settings and mods.  This has excellent eye candy too, and don't forget that flashback feature.  Stick this out long enough past the first season, there's new race modes that unlock that keep it feeling fresh. On sale this is a must buy for arcade race fans.			"

												Looks good. Everything else is S.H.I.T.E.When  you think NFS Underground 2 or Carbod had bad physics, think again. This one is BAD.Game should be called DRIFT, not GRID. i mean even effing 4by4 subaru or lancer is spinning and drifting on every corner, and god forbid you to touch the wall, u will be making 360 turn x10 times in no time. Flip the car over the roof x50 times - no problem, just touch that curb at slow speed.But man, graphics are good.Grid Online menu is crap. All those tiers and how to join particular game level? Dunno. VERY CONFUSING MENUS.Online challenges are fun. Weekly rivals WTF??!!!!! Finding online game is like finding Nemo (proably less sun tho).What else? oh, music - fine , good soundtrack.Make sure you turn off Voice volume, really those comments are annoying (but that goes to every Codemasters game, like DIRT, etc.)6/10 overall, and really just bought it because sales.played Grid 1 ages ago, but cant rememer it being so bad. Was it?anyway, this one is probably worth 12 bucks with all DLC.or was it too much Forza for me over last few years :)))))Gonna try Grid Autosport, see what its like. "

												GRID 2 is an arcade racing game made for players using a gamepad or their keyboard. If you want a realistic racing game, you should not buy GRID 2. I was very disappointed... I preordered it for 35,99€ and I have to say it was a waste of money. Because of that preordering I received a free copy of GRID 1, which was a big reason for me buying the game, because I really liked the car physics and graphics of GRID 1 at that time. Do not get me wrong, I still think GRID 1 is an excellent racing game! Actually it is the best I have ever played. I just can't understand what codemasters tried to do with GRID 2, I just don't get it...I played the first part of GRID and GRID 2 is a totally different game. GRID 1 had a cockpit view, which does NOT exist in GRID 2! For me personally the cockpit view is one of the most important things to make a racing game realistic. The developers said they invested much time in making the cars behave realistic on the asphalt. They failed miserably... Every car feels the same. There is no real difference. Drifting is totally unrealistic. If you want to drift you just have to fastly turn the wheel to one side, then turn it back to the other side and you are drifting. Normally when you're drifting in a realistic racing game or in reality itself you should lose time, but not in GRID 2. It feels like you always have to drift to maintain your speed. So many good game modes (drift-challenge, touge, profi-touge etc.) from GRID 1 are just left out completely in GRID 2. They tried to put a story into the game, which is actually a good idea. You have to show your skills in different racing leagues all over the world to get their appreciation and win them for the WRC (World Series Racing), a league where the best drivers of the world meet each other on the racetrack. The idea is great, but the implementation didn't succeed... It's always the same: Win in leagues, unlock new leagues, win against those leagues, win the WRC, win in new leagues, unlock, WRC...If you want to play a realistic racing game with great game modes and a cockpit view, buy GRID 1 instead of GRID 2.If you already played GRID 1 and think about buying GRID 2, because you liked the gameplay, do NOT do that. You will only be very disappointed. It has nothing to do with the previous version of GRID.			"

												Best graphics of all the Codies racing games.Tight, intense, wheel to wheel racing against both the AI and online competitors.Ignore the fuss about no cockpit view, modders added that in before it even came out in EU.If you enjoy racing games, whether simulation or arcade, GRiD 2 strikes a solid balance between the two.

												I like racing games.  I lean more towards the arcade racers as simulators don't do much for me.  I'm not a car guy and most of the things that sims go into mean absolutely nothing to me. Grid 2 is a weird one as it isn't really a simulator at all, yet it doesn't quite fit into the super-fast and drifty style of your common arcade racer. Burnout and Forza Horizon are the kind of arcade racers that are usually right up my alley.  Grid 2 just isn't quite there.  All of the tracks consist of tight turns through city streets and country sides and the drift controls just aren't tight enough to make this game stand out from the pack.  Too many times I've found myself leading a race for three laps only to blow in one hair pin turn that I *should* have drifted through.  Although, it's possible I just suck! Yet... I still find myself recommending Grid 2.  Despite my dislike of it, it's not horrible.  I still find myself drawn back to it time after time.  When the controls are working, the races are fun.  Just not quite Burnout/Forza Horizon fun.  The stickers are paint job options are fun, yet there's no real incentive as you just have them, you don't have to unlock them.  In fact, there's really not a whole lot of incentive to unlock stuff.  The more I type, the more it's kind of a tough sell. This racer's not great.  It's not the worst racer you'll ever play.  It's somewhere in the middle.  The important bit is, if you watch the sales, you'll find it cheap and it makes good filler in between the next big thing in urban racing excitement. "

												To the senses, this game is amazing. Beautiful graphics and with accurate and detailed sounds easily draw you in. After that, however, things can become a bit muddy. Is it a sim? Is it an arcade racer? It's difficult to tell exactly what this game was intended to be. And while it may seem a bit pedantic to complain, there's a point to be made. When going through the first few minutes of any game, it is essential to get a good feel for how things handle. Physics and controls are VERY important, and once you get a handle on what to expect, the better you become. That goes doubly so for racers. In a simulation game, physics and car characteristics vary from vehicle to vehicle, but all within reason; opponents follow the rules of their car. Conversely, arcade racers are allowed some wiggle room with drift or grip handling and wacky doodle physics to make the ride fun; opponents follow their own rules of performance. This game just kind of screws you around with everything. Car handling is weird and unpredictable, and the moment you get a hang of how goofy your car is, they make you switch to something else that is equally ridiculous and goofy. The ""marked"" opponents that you're supposed to ""watch out for"" have god-like attributes to their vehicles in most cases, as they always shoot to the front and away from the pack. So while you're busy flopping around trying to deal with your car on a new track you cannot practice on (another huge gripe), the marked opponent, in the very same car you have, is inexplicably way ahead of you.I don't exactly hate it, I'm still trying to get the hang of it, but everything is just so imbalanced that when I try to treat it like one type of racer, I'm immediately punished for it. Where's the fun in that?			"

												Yeah, this game is fun, I guess. Some of the mechanics are ridiculous, though.  If an NPC spins you out or even nudges your bumper mid-race, you are guaranteed to end up facing the opposite way you need to be, though, regardless of how well you try to steer out of it, and might as well just restart as there is no possible way to recover.  So just be forewarned - save yourself a lot of frustration and know that unless you race perfectly, be prepared to ""restart"" a lot of races.  Some races are factually unwinnable, especially the ones at the racetracks.  The best, though, are the races where you're all in the exact same car, but the NPCs can corner at 120mph and you spin out at 60.The game is fun, to be sure, once you know what you're doing, but just be prepared for a lot of WTF head shaking at the blatant cheating.  I am going to say that I recommend this game, but only if you can get it for two dollars or less.			"

												I have recently bought GRID autosport, which probably means that i am not going to be playing GRID 2 very regularly as i have migrated to playing autosport, so i decided that i would write a review, seeing as i was rather close to 100 hours so i think i know what im talking about, or atleast mostly.GRID 2 is an amazing game, probably the best racing game that i am yet to play, other than the new release of GRID which is infact GRID autosport. There are so many features and aspects that i like about GRID 2, but im not going to list them all as i would be going on forever, so im going to keep them blunt, short but informative at the same time.Things i liked about the game:--------------------------------The controls: The controls took me a matter of minutes to get use to, and from there i was able to drive nice and smoothly, without having to worry about pressing the wrong button on my remote. (I believe you can also use a steering wheel for this game).The detail/graphics: The maps, the cars, the road, even the cones. you name it. Everything looks brilliant. The reflections on the cars are brilliant, and this detail is consistent throughout the whole game, and the graphics that they have produced, can even run on my computer which i am suprised about. The game is not slow or laggy whatsoever, meaning that you can have a very smooth racing experience, but at the same time have a lovely eyesite of distant mountains, as you control your car.Music: The game has a variety of different tracks that are played throughout the game. The loading music, the main menu music, the racing music, all of it is of a high standard, and is great to listen to, and really makes you feel like your driving a car.AI: The AI of this game are great. The WSR campaign, which is pretty much a singleplayer mode, is absolutely realistic, due to the fact that the computer drivers have been programmed so good. When driving, the way that the drivers move and think are so lifelike, and occasionally challenge you if you do in-fact smash into the back of there car, but i wouldn't try it.Handling: All of the cars are tuned to perfection, and getting use to each type of handling, which each of the cars uniquely have is done with ease. Multiplayer: Although the multiplayer is on the verge of becoming dead, its still great fun when playing with a full lobby, and the feeling of taking another persons car out after them doing it before hand is beautiful. (Not that thats how you should drive.)Bad points about the game:-----------------------------What are you talking about? There are no bad points about this game! Despite all the people that have played GRID 2 and complained about it, i think that they should simply realise that codemasters took their time making this, as it is truly a masterpiece, and an experience that i am never going to forget. The game is absolutely brillaint, and upon buying GRID autosport which was released shortly after im reviewing this, i cannot wait to carry on with the next game in the series. Thank you so much codemasters for bringing us this game, and i would like to thank you for also releasing Autosport, as so far it is brilliant. Thank you, and i hope that this review has influenced anyone that is planning on buying the game.			"

												Look, I'm not all that coordinated anymore. I get that. It happens with old age. We fall down. We drop things. We lose our dentures. I want to die sleeping peacefully, not like the other screaming passengers in my car. But if I'm awake, there's one thing I can still do well and that's drive. If real cars had physics like this, no one would be able to stay on the road and I've raced vehicles before. These ice skates with axles handle horribly. They don't turn or brake worth a darn. Tapping on the brakes will send the car suddenly careening off 90 degrees in some random direction. It would be easier to drive a pinball than these tings. I've tried this game from hard to very easy and the handling isn't much different. Cars just can't stay on the road. Bumping another car - even if you hit their back quarter panel on a turn - will send your car careening off wildly while their car isn't impacted at all. I guess Newton's Second Law does not exist in the GRID2 universe.The most important things about any racing game are the driving and physics. GRID2 seems to have forgotten both. Perhaps it is different with a wheel, but with a gamepad I find it unplayable. It smacks of a poor console port and you can do better for your money. This game isn't worth your time or your dollars.			"

												Grid 2 likes to use the tagline ""The Thrill of Driving"" to describe the game in a single marketing slogan.  I think that's a pretty apt phrase because this is a driving game that really, fully, single-mindedly commits to the ""thrill"" of driving as compared to other driving games both from Codemasters and other development houses out there which throw their focus more on the lavish depth of accuracy in the presentation of the cars, or the devoted attention to the sport of motor racing with a high emphasis on realism in performance.  No, Grid 2 is a game so devoted to that ""Thrill of Driving"" aspect that I think it's carved out a whole niche to itself: Driving Pornography.In Grid 2 you are encouraged to drive full tilt without consideration for gas, tire wear, or weather conditions.  You need not concern yourself about the damage you incur by driving clumsy, and there are no penalties for being unsportsmanlike.  All Grid 2 wants from you is to drive fast, fast, fast, and to feel awesome and look cool while you're doing it.  Here's some thoughts about what makes this game unique in presentation: you will be given cars that have minimal explanation of the differences between them and yet enjoyable handling subtleties are there which render some choices powerful while others are over-the-top suicidal until you've had 60+ hours of practice with them.  The single player campaign throws the beginner driver (without practice first) into the midst of tracks that can and will destroy your vehicle if you lose traction, then makes sure that the sun is shining in your face as you round hairpin turns.  You will be given control of cars that can do 220 mph in straight runs and then be asked to make near constant right angle turns through the narrow streets of Chicago.  Cost is literally no object here as your garage grows regularly in size because of the ephemeral power of ""fans"" which is a weak and poorly executed stand-in for ""money"" in the single player game.  You will drive your multi-million dollar supercars as though they were replaceable toys and slam them, drift them, and wear them out with gleeful abandon and then see them magically repaired at no cost or penalty for the next race.  For better or worse you'll never spend too much time on any given race as they typically last between two and six minutes in length and even the custom and online races limit you to no more than 10 laps at a time.  Grid 2 is also *EXTREMELY* drift-happy and loves nothing better than to see 12 cars sliding their way through an apex and bumping and slapping each other and the walls all the way.Driving pornography: Grid 2 is definitely not to be confused with a full depth driving simulation experience, -it is absolutely an arcade game and as such it is very, very approachable and very, very fun.As a followup to Grid 1, the sequel is pretty much more of the same with an even greater emphasis on the ""pretty"".  While the cars aren't as lushly rendered as Forza the presentation is slick and polished and there's a nice sense of differentiation between both the different tier levels of cars on offer and the various types within each tier.  The tracks come in many varieties from narrow street point-to-point journeys to real-world circuit tracks that offer more true sport-like experiences.  Unlike some other Codemasters racing games you won't be constantly bugged and mugged by the different personalities of the competition drivers although you'll still be able to pick out which of the AI drivers has been tweaked to always be at the head of the pack no matter what.  Unlike Grid 1 this sequel feels compelled to offer some sort of story explanation for why you're racing in so many different styles of cars and racing disciplines and I found the presentation to be ridiculous and unnecessary, particularly when my beginner racing performance (consisting of bulldozing my way through the lead cars in order to get ahead) was hailed as ""champion"" material by the ESPN hosts complete with inane online message forum ""fans"" frothing at the bit because of my awesomeness.Multiplayer has the potential to be really entertaining but at this point in the game's release it's pretty hit-and-miss.  For starters I found the my default U.S. server literally empty for days at a time until I read on a forum that you should change your regional setting to Europe (I chose London) where there's more people frequently playing (still sparse though with less than 7 race sessions at any given time).  Once I succesfully joined a match it was good to see that the tiered performance structure means that it's difficult for veteran players to have cars which are inherently better than what a newcomer would be able to compete against.  The bad news is that it doesn't matter because veterans will have memorized all the track layouts and know where to brake and accelerate and squeeze every millisecond of performance from the car choices making it tough to stay competitive until you've personally put in the aforementioned 60+ hours.  There's also a tendency for online matches to go with the ""full damage"" mode where collisions will regularly destroy your vehicle or at least cause you to hobble about the course on bare rims and minimal steering control.  Worse is the frequent situation where a slight mistake in the lead car of the pack will cause a massive unavoidable pile-up collision with the rest of the following.  Such a thing renders all your skill and track knowledge useless... it takes such a tiny error to screw things up for the rest and sometimes you'll find yourself with a twit who purposely takes the chance to screw with you.One special note is that demolition derby, the fun and guilty-pleasure free-download available, has a MAJOR bug in it where you will frequently discover your progress is set back an entire lap for no explainable reason at all which makes it damn near impossible to recover from.  It's bad enough that demolition derby encourages people to fu** with you by willfully inflicting fishtail spinouts but this bug stacks the deck against you from the start with a frequency approaching 8 out of every 10 races having this bomb blow up in your face.  I also have a serious issue with how the corner-cutting mechanic is executed.  The developers have stated in the first game they had to build indestructable barriers around the tracks in order to keep people from cutting corners and that had gameplay ramifications they wanted to avoid, so in Grid 2 the tracks are free(er) from such obstructions but if you do cut through a corner improperly you'll find your momentum immediately halted and you can't resume acceleration for a period of time ""equal to the time advantage gained by corner cutting"".  That's fine... in theory.  In practice it becomes very frustrating because it's possible to avoid the penalty hit if you're careful how you exit your shortcut but then there are corners where there's a wall two feet from the apex of the turn and if you drift through that two foot gap you'll be slapped down for it even though the supposed ""shortcut cheat"" advantage is almost nil and the course essentially requires you to move through that gap to maintain your speed.  Is Grid 2 worth buying?  I think $30 for the base game is worthy.  $15 to $10 is an instant purchase.  The DLC car packs are so-so... it's hard to figure out the differences between the 80(?) cars on offer so you could easily skip all the extra cars and not miss them.  If the ""Reloaded"" edition is on sale for less than $30 though, yeah, get that.  The new tracks and routes are worth buying since they help keep the track choices from getting too repetitive.I had lots of fun with this, and yeah.... soft-core driving porn.  It's like that.			"

												Graphics are good.That's pretty much my only positive.Sadly, I have racing games that are more sim orientated as well as racing games that are more arcade orientated, so for me there was no need for GRID2.It doesn't have the nostalgia factor of old NFS titles (Most Wanted, Underground) although it does suffer (badly) from horrendous narrations telling me to drive faster, or drift...driftier. There are annoying cutscenes as well. Ugh.Far and away the most annoying thing was the incessant screen resolution errors - it kept resizing the game as a box in the middle of my screen - this has been a bane of a lot of games in my library: if it gives me customization issues, I'll close it and jump to the next most similar game.  There are very very few games nowadays that are worth the time to try and fix little issues and niggles.I'm not saying you won't enjoy it, but I found it not worth my time. I might come back to it and it'll work better. I might let it just hover in my library.I don't like it, I don't hate it. I probably won't talk about it again after I post this review - it's like reviewing the Lightly Salted crisp flavour.Update after a re-visitI recently revisited this game when going through my racing games in order to have a bit more of a comparison, and these are some points I noticed now (after sinking even more hours into other racing games as well):The cars seem to be locked behind a progress barrier. That means that you can't access them until you've unlocked them (or, if you can, I certainly couldn't find it). That formula worked for games like NFS Underground or Most Wanted, but gaming has changed since then.The cars and tracks have no realism to them. Which, I guess, is fine; but as I said - it's not really arcade-y enough to get away with that.I am seriously unimpressed with the ""drifty"" nature of the racing. Cars seemed far too likely to slide constantly; not an issue, but with a game like Ridge Racer it feels a lot more fun. Plus, I have Burnout in my library, so I see no need to play a game where the cars handle badly and it isn't fun.I played this on a Logitec G27 - this should explain a lot of my frustrations, since a game that supports a steering wheel and pedals shouldn't punish you for using it - lightest touch on the brakes locks you up and slides you around.Your pit crew yak away in your ear more often than a rally navigator. I have no idea why the dev thought this was a good idea.Ultimately - this game is okay, and this may have been a positive review if I hadn't already played games like NFS, Assetto Corsa, Ridge Racer, Burnout, Project CARS etc etc etc...it's kinda like your first relationship - feels perfect because you have nothing to compare it to. When you do, you'll hate it.			"

												TL;DR - Vroom vroom crash sometimes but smiley face. 6/10PRO:1. Good arcade racing - I've spent many, many hours in this game, primarily in the multiplayer section. While it can be frustrating at times with the amount of accidents people seem to get into, I've also had a great number of tremendously fun and close races2. Seeminly endless supply of new blood - lots of people are at or near the MP level cap (level 99), but there are usually a good number of lower levels floating about. While that mixture of levels and experience does segregate the field a bit on track (which is kind of a con really), it also evens out the gradient a bit. Also gives great opportunity for lower levels to learn which cars suit which tracks and how to corner effectively (NOT THAT THEY SEEM TO NOTICE!)CON: 1. Very poor DLC integration - things like the Spa pack provide content that only very rarely can be used. Not many people choose to host the extra tracks in custom events, and even if they do there are often problems in joining sessions. If you don't EXACTLY match the number of DLC packs they have, you can't join their game.For single-player only guys, this isn't an issue as you can use the content at your whim, but it's been the multiplayer that kept this game going for me2. Poor car balance - there are clear favourite cars in each of the four tiers. You can beat them in ""lesser"" cars, but only if you absolutely nail every single braking point and apex of every single metre of track. Cars which are already powerful get a great number of upgrade slots, while poor cars only have space for a handful, which don't even make a difference. "

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Grid 2

			We take a look at Codemasters flagship tarmac based racing game Grid 2. Please leave you feedback in the comments below and be sure to like and subscribe!		

Grid 2 is about the role of your driver in the formation and proliferation of World Series Racing, an international racing series that encompasses several racing disciplines across a wide range of car types. While this structure makes sense in the context of the narrative it has the unfortunate side effect of wearing out each location's welcome. Each region has three or four primary race location with varying routes through each. While the tracks themselves are technically different they share sections and landmarks from tracks that you previously raced in. Spreading a dozen races across three locations where you encounter some of the same sections across various routes does not leave the impression that variety is this game's strong suit despite a track list that would indicate otherwise. Grid 2's greatest innovation is it's LiveRoute system. Basically track designs are modular and with LiveRoutes these sections of track are loaded on the fly completely randomizing the track and forcing players to react to each change since the mini map is unavailable. Each section of track comes together seamlessly without creating any awkward or impossible turns though some sections of track can be repeated several time throughout an event which really detracts from the novelty of the feature.Vehicles embody the characteristics of their real world counterparts but sliding and drifting are much easier and emphasized but Grid 2 is devoid of the turbo boosts and jumps that characterize pure arcade racers. Ultimately it's a system that is extremely enjoyable. Muscle cars roar and and corner like hippos sprinting around a KY jelly covered skating rink. Tuners slide around like asthmatic mosquitoes as their turbos hiss and wheeze while track cars warp across the asphalt and slice through corners like razors through the wrists of a My Chemical Romance fan. Unfortunately the car count is on the small side, encompassing less than fifty of the most elite performance vehicles from the past and present. Well I should say the most elite races not to wear Porsche, Ferrari or Lamborghini badges. Customization is also limited to changing wheels and adding garish liveries to your machines. Copious sponsor stickers also spoil your vehicle's aesthetics while offering an opportunity to complete objectives that earn WSR more fans. Togue events, Checkpoint races, Overtake events, Endurance races, Drift events, elimination races, and head to head races round out the event types. These events do an admirable job of keeping the main campaign from becoming stale. Likewise strong AI ensures that you have to work a bit for victories. You opponents can be really aggressive and full damage means that trying to play bumper cars in the corners can end your race or severely hamper your car's performance. Ricocheting off of your opponents in the first turn and holding the lead isn't as viable a strategy in Grid as it is other racing games.Car models are appropriately detailed though they lack cockpit views. Matte, gloss, metallic and pearlescent paint are convincingly rendered and the damage models are unrivaled. Hoods, bumpers, fenders, spoilers and trunk lids can be smashed off and tires can even rupture. Geometry wrinkles and deforms after impacts in a rather convincing manner. As great as all of this is what really stands out are the tracks... Sparks from overhead subway rails shower the streets of Chicago and papers blow over the roadway, mists hover over the pavement in California as leaves blow around. Dubai's glorious skyscrapers and yachts dot the landscape. In short the tracks seem alive... It's a nice departure from the often drab and dead cityscapes that many games have you race through. The sound is also solid. Races are mostly scored with a symphony of pistons pumping like drums, turbos whistling like woodwinds and tires squealing like the string section. Exhausts howl, echoing off of mountain sides and tunnels and the echoing of your opponent’s vehicle seconds off of your lead can be intense.			"

												GRID 2 ReviewI have always been a fan of racing games, playing titles from NFS to GRID to DiRT to Forza, Nascar, and more. For PC, I must say that the GRID series, minus the first game, is phenomenal. GRID 2 deviates from its prior by balancing simulation-level damage and graphics with arcade-style racing. While there are a few things that were missed, such as an in-car view, the huge selection of vehicles, tracks, and environments make this game really stand out.Single Player CampaignGRID 2 has a fantastic storyline. You are a new driver, trying to make a name for yourself and your racing league, WSR. You're led by the confident Patrick Callahan, who keeps you up to date on promo events, passing in races, and reminding you of sponsor objectives. The game is split into ""seasons,"" with each season taking place in a different region. At season 4, you race at tracks globally. In general, each season means a new tier of cars, but there is some overlap, making seasons 3 and 4 both T3 races. There are difficulties suitable for anyone, from racing newcomers to GRID experts. There are multiple race types, such as Endurance, Time Attack, Overtake, Drift, Race, Touge, and more, all of which are very enjoyable. The only caveat I find with any of the game modes is when playing Touge, the aggressiveness of your opponent will count against you, even if they hit you. Just avoid aggresion in this mode, and you'll be fine.Online MultiplayerThe GRID 2 community is alive and well, and the forums are still relevant. Performance is great online, and you can upgrade your cars to suit your own driving style. If I remember correctly, multiplayer lobbies can go up to 12 players at once, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Even when you beat the Single Player Campaign, you will still have loads of fun in online multiplayer.Replay FactorOne of the things that I look for in a game is whether or not it is enjoyable to play a second time, after you beat it once. I must say that this is one area where this game excels. I often found myself retrying races with different vehicles to beat my lap times, rise in the leaderboards, or just to see the difference each made.Controls and GraphicsGRID 2 supports a wheel & pedals setup, but I simply use a keyboard. While there are disadvantages to doing so, i.e. pressing W is equivalent to going pedal-to-the-metal 24/7, the steering is very managable and drifting is easy to pick up on. The graphics are fantastic. I don't quite know what graphics engine this game runs, but I play the game on Ultra settings at 50-60 fps on a GTX 860M. It's optimized incredibly well, and lighting, shadows, and reflections all look great. You certainly won't have weather effects anywhere near games such as Project CARS or Assetto Corsa, but the game will be just fine for the vast majority of players.ValueI purchased GRID 2 on Steam during the 2015 Summer Sale, but I did have it installed previously. Feel free to add about 15 hours to my Steam timelog for it to make up for this. You can pick it up for USD $7.50 as of writing during this ""North Pole Noir"" sale, and you certainly won't regret it. There are number of DLC packs, all of which I personally do own but don't use very often. I feel like Codemasters hit the sweet spot with the DLC attractiveness, as there are plenty of cars in the base game that will outperform the DLC vehicles, but some of the DLC packs offer more vibrant patterns. For example, the base game's T3 Honda will outperform the T3 DLC Camaro SS, but the Camaro SS is a fantastic looking car. The reloaded edition of this game is probably the best deal you will get, at least when it is on sale.Here's a rundown of each aspect of the game and how I would personally rate it.Aspect	RatingPhysics	10Plot	10Damage	9Multiplayer	10Community	10Graphics	10+Value	8Overall	9.5Final Points on the GameNot only is GRID 2 the best racing game in its class, the unique storyline makes up from something looked over in most racing games.

												It's just so bad . First of all your car is made out of paper, but all other cars are made out of alluminium .  I doesn't matter which car you pick , hell if you even had a frickin monster truck it would according to this game also be made out of paper . But that's not the worst part oh no . The worst part is the fricking handling of the cars . The cars are so out of control you would had better luck doing it in real life . Other than that there's not much to complain . It's just so dissapointing , this could have been a great racing game but it just fails on the most simplest thing's .			"

												There are several racing games out there. Some are realistic, simulating the hardcore aspects of driving, correct braking and approach to turns. Some are fantastic, with weapons and whatnot turning the racetrack into a hectic battlefield of missiles and banana peels.Some are inbetween, focusing on keeping the pedal to the metal and powersliding your way through the race and to the podium.GRID 2 is not like any of these games.GRID 2 is about second chances.GRID 2 is about besting yourself in every race.GRID 2 is about mastering every car and every driving style.GRID 2 is about incredibly awesome, high speed overtakes. GRID 2 is about doing turns at 200 km/h with both left tires empty.GRID 2 is about keeping your car straight when it has no front wheels.GRID 2 is about having fun.			"

												I bought Grid 2 because of the amazing game called Grid 1. Grid 2 brings good graphics and details with a lot of sound especially when you're going around the race track. However this game is not as good as Grid 1 as you get the cars during the game, so it's pretty much straight forward for when you're playing on single player. It would of been great to have the visual of what part of your vehicle is broken instead of some audio saying ""Your left wheel is damaged, expect some pull when you turn.""The game would have been good if it carried on with the cars mileages and the price of them as this made you think more on saving on your budget.I’ve tried multiplayer once and didn’t really enjoy it as it’s just the same concept as single player but you just play with other people and gain levels. I can’t really say much about it as I’ve only played one game and didn’t enjoy it much.The game is good overall but it could have been much better if they didn’t change it all!  "

												Grid 2 is a really good Arcade style racing game, thoroughly recommended (especially over most of the recent Need for Speed games). Varied racing modes, decent variety of cars and mechanically it plays well. The Single Player campaign is enjoyable and lasts around 20 hours. Multiplayer is ok, it adds more longevity to the game with a Call Of Duty style progression system. However, race events are a bit of a destruction derby where the podium positions are usually determined by whoever manages to get through the first few corners without being ran off the road by another vehicle.  I can't comment on racing wheel support or how the game plays for wheel users, I just played it using an Xbox 360 controller and enjoyed my time with it.			"

												This game is great for a while with a pretty good singleplayer story and fun driving physics, but it certainly has some (at times) game-breaking/ruining flaws. Although some flaws might draw you away from this game, I would probably still suggest it. HOWEVER: The Reloaded Edition is a true waste of money; half the cars just performance versions of the previous ones, and in multiplayer, (if you can find a game) DLC is almost always disabled. Also, IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!PROS:- Physics (while at times completely unrealistic) make this game for me. They're probably the most fun/realistic of many racing games I've played- Singleplayer mode is quite extensive and fun, and it lets you use most cars in the game pretty regularly- Customization might not be the best, and it has a serious flaw (as shown in cons), but it is very expansive for personalizing a car to your liking- This game adapts to your driving style very well, for example: If you prefer drifting, you know you can overtake/attack opponents at corners very effectively, while using a more powerful car with more traction lets you overtake others on straightsCONS:- Customization has a very annoying flaw: You cannot use the default liveries of your cars unless you're in multiplayer; in singleplayer the default livery is automatically applied to all vehicles without any confirmation from the player ... This actually ruins customization for me, especially being an owner of the Reloaded Edition and not being able to use the DLC liveries (but meh, the Reloaded Edition was under $30 on ♥♥♥)- The AI in this game is the worst I've seen in any game for years; AI using drift cars act exactly as others using grip cars; each AI has no personality of its own ... In addition, the AI units don't have any apparent awareness of your positon; they commit to their actions regardless of where you are, commonly resulting in them pitting you, ramming you into the side of the wall, or braking before necessary, causing you to crash into them (it is quite obvious that this is not meant to be a feature excused by ""aggressive drivers"")- The multiplayer is indeed the worst I've seen of any game; not only are there very rarely players on, and if you manage to find some, DLC is always disabled, and overall its design is terrible: flashbacks (if enabled) have clearly had 5 minutes spent in their design, the AI is even worse (driving absurdly slowly, having even less awareness of you, etc.), players are able to ram you out of the way without any effect to their progress, etc ... AGAIN: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER GAME!Despite all these flaws, I would still suggest this game for its pros; it is still a fun game and decent racing game.			"

												Probably the greatest racing sim I've ever played. No, it's not as realistic or in-depth as Forza, and lack the tuning options of many other successful racers, but it strikes a delicate balance between Need For Speed arcade-ey-ness, and Forza's realism.  You'll be challenged by the delicate drifting mechanics and creative track designs, but the simple control scheme means you'll never need to worry about your controller getting in the way of your driving. Every race feels tense and exciting, every tracks prsents unique hazards and challenges, and provides new way to excel. You can attack courses an race series with a variety of tactics, from agressive and physical, to straight speed, to graceful drifting, and that combination of approaches is the secret to Grid's formula- you really don't have the chance to get bored with one mode before you're off playing a different format. The learning curve is rough, but you don't have to get first in every race to beat the game. My advice is to really take your time on the tack day after the intro race, really get a hang of high speed driving and drifting before you head out to the actual races. This game will suck up your time and test your abilities and reflexes, but it's worth every last drop of petrol. 9/10.			"

Even if it's not your fault          Expensive DLCs           Too much drift.          Seems like the AI cars follow a specific route in circuits no matter what.

												Not really sure what happened but this game is worse than GRID 1 in pretty much every way. Fewer/Lamer modes, appears not to have the driving options from GRID 1, no cockpits, DLC to play a bunch of cars... Most of the neat things about single player campaign are gone leaving you with only custom races. About the only thing positive I can say is that the I like the tracks a lot better.			"

												There are several racing games out there. Some are realistic, simulating the hardcore aspects of driving, correct braking and approach to turns. Some are fantastic, with weapons and whatnot turning the racetrack into a hectic battlefield of missiles and banana peels.Some are inbetween, focusing on keeping the pedal to the metal and powersliding your way through the race and to the podium.GRID 2 is not like any of these games.GRID 2 is about second chances.GRID 2 is about besting yourself in every race.GRID 2 is about mastering every car and every driving style.GRID 2 is about incredibly awesome, high speed overtakes. GRID 2 is about doing turns at 200 km/h with both left tires empty.GRID 2 is about keeping your car straight when it has no front wheels.GRID 2 is about having fun.			"

												I bought Grid 2 because of the amazing game called Grid 1. Grid 2 brings good graphics and details with a lot of sound especially when you're going around the race track. However this game is not as good as Grid 1 as you get the cars during the game, so it's pretty much straight forward for when you're playing on single player. It would of been great to have the visual of what part of your vehicle is broken instead of some audio saying ""Your left wheel is damaged, expect some pull when you turn.""The game would have been good if it carried on with the cars mileages and the price of them as this made you think more on saving on your budget.I’ve tried multiplayer once and didn’t really enjoy it as it’s just the same concept as single player but you just play with other people and gain levels. I can’t really say much about it as I’ve only played one game and didn’t enjoy it much.The game is good overall but it could have been much better if they didn’t change it all!  "

												I was having a blast with this game until I got to Season 5. When you get to Season 5, the game kicks in the worst rubber banding I have ever seen in a racing game since the old racing games you would play on Genesis or SNES. We are talking being in an Elimination race with a 5 - 10 second lead over the entire field and in the last minute an AI car will not only catch you, but will maintain a 2+ second lead on you. I understand the game isn't a simulator, but this is crap. I am glad I didn't pay full price for it and I won't be buying GRID Autosport. I enjoy the F1 series that Codemasters develops, but I will look for something else to try and fill the GT racing void.			"

TL;DR While GRID 2 challenging and sometimes enjoyable, refusing to allow players access to more than just 'Drift"" cars unless they purchase cut-content style DLC ultimately ruins the experience.Those of us who hate Drifting get nickel and dimed by DLC that should have been included in the game itself.I like the difficulty of this game. I like that it's hard, that it makes me think about what I'm doing, that it's closer to a simulator than most games are these days. That's all great. I really wish I could give this game the thumbs up.But I can't.This game has decided that ""drifting,"" a showboating activity, should be an integral part of racing. The Majority of cars you have access to in this game are ""Drift Cars.""Or to put it another way, this game features cars with looser back ends than a trucker with irritable bowel syndrome in a budget diner. You can't slide around a corner in any of these cars without the back end kicking out, because the game wants you to take your car sideways. I really enjoyed the ""grip"" style cars, where when one slid around a corner, the back end stayed right where it should, instead of trying to rub itself on a guardrail. But Codemasters decided to make grip cars DLC. In the beginning of Season 4, instead of offering me a Drift Car, a Balanced Car, and a Grip car, it offered me two drift cars, and the chance to unlock more cars. Great, I said, and went through the painful process of unlocking each secret car one by one, only to discover that they are all bleeding drift cars. Every single one of them.I can get my hands on a grip car if I purchase some DLC.Which I'm not doing.Instead, I'm telling you not to spend money on this game, and uninstalling it immediately. Codemasters, I'm never buying a racing game from you again. Cutting grip cars from the game and then trying to sell them back to me as DLC was a terrible idea, and one that's lost codemasters a customer.  "

												This game is great for a while with a pretty good singleplayer story and fun driving physics, but it certainly has some (at times) game-breaking/ruining flaws. Although some flaws might draw you away from this game, I would probably still suggest it. HOWEVER: The Reloaded Edition is a true waste of money; half the cars just performance versions of the previous ones, and in multiplayer, (if you can find a game) DLC is almost always disabled. Also, IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!PROS:- Physics (while at times completely unrealistic) make this game for me. They're probably the most fun/realistic of many racing games I've played- Singleplayer mode is quite extensive and fun, and it lets you use most cars in the game pretty regularly- Customization might not be the best, and it has a serious flaw (as shown in cons), but it is very expansive for personalizing a car to your liking- This game adapts to your driving style very well, for example: If you prefer drifting, you know you can overtake/attack opponents at corners very effectively, while using a more powerful car with more traction lets you overtake others on straightsCONS:- Customization has a very annoying flaw: You cannot use the default liveries of your cars unless you're in multiplayer; in singleplayer the default livery is automatically applied to all vehicles without any confirmation from the player ... This actually ruins customization for me, especially being an owner of the Reloaded Edition and not being able to use the DLC liveries (but meh, the Reloaded Edition was under $30 on ♥♥♥)- The AI in this game is the worst I've seen in any game for years; AI using drift cars act exactly as others using grip cars; each AI has no personality of its own ... In addition, the AI units don't have any apparent awareness of your positon; they commit to their actions regardless of where you are, commonly resulting in them pitting you, ramming you into the side of the wall, or braking before necessary, causing you to crash into them (it is quite obvious that this is not meant to be a feature excused by ""aggressive drivers"")- The multiplayer is indeed the worst I've seen of any game; not only are there very rarely players on, and if you manage to find some, DLC is always disabled, and overall its design is terrible: flashbacks (if enabled) have clearly had 5 minutes spent in their design, the AI is even worse (driving absurdly slowly, having even less awareness of you, etc.), players are able to ram you out of the way without any effect to their progress, etc ... AGAIN: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER GAME!Despite all these flaws, I would still suggest this game for its pros; it is still a fun game and decent racing game.			"

												GRID 2 is one of the best driver games I ever have played, and the most fun driver game I know. Race against your friends, beat your pwn highscores, play many of the gamemodes and much more. There is always something to do in GRID 2.GRID 2 is a skill based driver game, which I liked very much. It is very great to see a driver game, where you needs to learn how to control the car. This gave me new challenges, which I enjoyed a lot.If you prefer to play Single Player, the game also has a Carrer Mode. I enjoyed the Carrer Mode from start to the end. You're starting as a driver, who not has many fans and not many sponsors. But every match you win, every season you win will more sponsers get interested in you and more fans will come. It's like being a real driver. The goal is being the best driver in the world, and winning all ""World Series Racing"" which is the seasons. GRID 2 will only give you a great experience, and it is recommended so much if you like driver games.  "

												First to say, I really don't like playing racing games. I tried this some time ago with mouse and keyboard and maybe one hour later I gave up and uninstalled a game. But now I got controller and it is completly different. Just finished the third seasson and game is really fun. A lot of cars to choose. I like the rewind feature. Some of the maps are really beautiful (dubai) and graphics overall is very nice. Game consist of a lot of racing modes also with I believe some completly optional which adds fans or cars, it is a nice feature. One thing that I do not like is that no matter in which position I end in previous races, I almost all time starting at last position and in some situations is really hard to get to the top from that.

												In short: Great racing game.Longer version: You're being discovered as a talent in motor sports by Patrik Calahan and he tells you about this idea he's been having: WSR - World Series of Racing. In order to make this idea come true he would need a guy who could persuade different driving clubs over the world to participate in the series. So...The first season you're driving in the US, the second one in Europe, the third one in Asia... and the fourth one is the best drivers combined. What ""grinds my gears"" is that the fifth season makes the game SOMEWHAT outstaying its welcome, it doesn't need the fifth season since it's pracically the fourth one but with some faster cars.Also... Codemasters decided to remove the cockpit view. WHY?!?! It's the best one.But I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun (arcadey) racing game.			"

												All in all I would recommend this game... BUT !! There are some issues..1) Where on Earth going side by side with another car makes you unable to turn your car AWAY from the other car ??? Soooo annoying...2) The Arcade style is a bit too much I would say, definetley too much disadvantage of not having a wheel, cuz the buttons sometimes cause funny and unrealistic accidents, and then you'll have to use a FLASHBACK, which is the dumbest thing in a car game... Learn to drive..3) AI is often stupid, and on higher Tiers they don't stand a chance, but you always have to fight through them, zig-zagging all the time.. which is fine...4) Multi... The cars are way too unpredictable and sensitive, so even if you don't want to cause any trouble for the other players, there will always be lots of accidents, not to mention the intentional T-bones and FishTails...On the Contrary, the game feels just about right, and with practicing a track a few times you can constantly set your lap records, the cars are awesome, the maps offer a wide variety, you can find which suits you.Btw DLC cars are pretty damn powerful...

												I had the original Grid on xbox along with Forza 3 and while Forza puts you to sleep playing it Grid kept you wide awake. To this day Grid is the only racing game i've played where you actually get a real sense of speed when racing.Grid 2 isn't as good as the first, they took a few things out like being able to spectate when waiting to race when a session has already started (you can now only spectate if you had already been playing and crashed/retired) . I also don't like the interface either.Car handling is similar to the first Grid but maybe slightly easier? i still get the same sense of speed playing this that i did playing the first one, so in that sense it's just as addictive for me playing it.Graphics with everything turned up to max only really seem marginally improved over the original (but then the first one looked great to begin with), I guess the smoke effects have improved and the exhaust heat.I should warn people actually that if you buy it now you really need to buy the car DLC as well to stand a chance in a race as you have to level up to buy certain tiers of cars. If you don't have certain cars unlocked you will only be able to realistically come 6th place in a race, you won't be able to win or come in the top 3 that's for sure. Also what's ridiculous is you can only unlock tier 4 cars (highest tier supercars) when you are in the mid 20 ranks. I am rank 31 right now and put in about 70 hours of play time, so you are looking at playing for 50ish hours to unlock the last tier of cars without DLC. The game does loan you a car if you don't have one for the required tier but the one they loan you for tier 4 is terrible, can't steer or turn to save its life. The cars they loan you for tier 2 and 3 are fine, tier 1 not so much.If you played and liked the first game you will probably like this, if you haven't played the first one i'd wait till it's on sale to try it out as it's a polarizing ARCADE game (not a sim) as you might not like the fairly simplistic car handling.But saying all that, the sheer sense of speed you get while playing it you can't get anywhere else, and that's what does it for me which is why i'm addicted to this racer.7.5/10			"

												There are many better racing games on the market and very few more pointless.This takes what was good about the first Grid and turns it down a notch, so they could spend more time designing a menu screen that would look at home on a Need for Speed game. Originality is not a selling point of this title, nor is the racing. Graphically it's alright, nothing that will save it from a sale purchase at best. That is of course once you manually change the replay file to read-only so you don't suffer stuttering throughout the race, once again the customers solve the lazy devs work. Is it good? No, is it worth buying? If you own GRID, Need for Speed, Dirt... No...CTRL-C, CTRL-V racing at it's worst.			"

Graphics:The graphics looks really nice and I'm on a older GPU, GTX260 and it still looks really good even if it's now maxed, with sparks flying when someone rolls their car or crashes into a wall.Sound/Soundtrack:The sound are good i must say, especially the crash noise, which if you drive like me hear pretty often. You can hear what other cars are doing around you even if you don't see them. The sound track tho, the first thing i did was to go in the menu and turn it off, haven't turned it on since i started it the first time.Handling:The handling isn't great, the car tends to drift way to much and when drifting have super tires that can grip anything, but if you see it from an arcade point of view it's not to bad, there is worse but there are worse. I do find the handling of the destruction derby cars to be better then the other cars, they actually feel heavy.Multiplayer:Here is where GRID 2 shines, many different game modes, from racing, drifting to destruction derby. And it's easy to create a lobby and start a game and you can create a mini league with up to 5 races which is super nice.Cockpit view:This is a hot one, when i first heard it i disregarded the game totally, but when i got i and started driving, it isn't something i really miss, sure i use it when playing Assetto Corsa and GTR2, but they are a completely different genre. The hood view is in my opinion just as good or even better in this type of game.DLC:I don't have any numbers here, but it feels like half the cars are DLC packs, which is totally rubbish, there are 11 pay DLC packs on steam 11!! That's like 10 to much. If i buy a game i want all the content. Soon Codemaster will starting to slice up the F1 games, knock on wood...Tracks/Cars:As said above there aren't many cars unfortunately, you've got your standard European BMW, American Muscle, some JDM, but it's not much. And for tracks i was disappointed, i usually like proper race tracks, but there are so few (without DLC) that the only tracks i tend to race are the A to B tracks.Overall:If you look at it for what it is and not for what it's predecessor was, it's a very fun game to play with your mates, get a lobby full of 12 people and just race. If you don't mind the drift handling it has and the lack of cars and tracks and like me find it for a fiver, it's definitely worth it.And for you hardcore GRID1 fans wait to see what Grid Autosport may have to offer.

												The graphics are really nice for this game, the car control feels the same as grid 1 with some minor improvements. The story section (world series) I've only done a few races but so far seems decent. The multiplayer has alot of fun when you get into a full room. Not sure on how many modes there are to do, there seems to be a few but only raced so far. The amount if cars is decent and could do with more. The audio of the game are good, from the engines to tyre screeching around roads. The little features are cool like a car infront if you wipes out goes through grass and sand and covers the road in smoke nice. There are a few things that I like but otherwise it is an improvement of grid 1. All I can say really. I hope for more cars but I know they will be paid DLC. If you enjoy grid 1 then you will enjoy this. Worth the cheap price for this game £26 and that's a bloody good price specially on this game. Grid is a superb game and so is grid 2.			"

												Terrible game, AI cheats, car design is a mis-mash, zero attempt to adhere to the realism of many of the cars.  AI ignores players and plows into players ad-nauseum.  Cars are randomly fat, slow, or drift happy (drift is so unreal it's moronic).  Drift design ignores the laws of physics.  Drift, tire squeeeeeeeellll.Lens flare is often blinding, camera shakes absurdly over 120 MPH (why do all the bad racing games have this effect?), most of the races in the campaign are done without a sighting lap, so you'll be at a perpetual disadvantage.  The random levels are stupid, most of the locations are the same one backwards and forwards with such little variety.  It's like playing a late 90s racer with new graphics.0/10 at worst, 5/10 at the best moments.  DO NOT BUY.			"

												Lots of fun, both singleplayer and multiplayer. The singleplayer is shorter than a Codemasters game usually is, but it isn't extremely short. The multiplayer is epic - especially with friends. People who crash into you can get annoying - since you usually end up losing, but once you learn to avoid them, it's a lot of fun. The biggest issue overall are the drift races - they're not well done, but considering all the positives of the game, this is a minor issue. Overall I was impressed.			"

												Though it is somewhat enjoyable, I cannot recommend this game. After six hours of playing, I can say that every new race just adds frustration and disappointment.  The AI is a nightmare Sunday afternoon. Whenever a corner comes along, they all slam on their brakes in syncronization and take it at a driving-school safe speed. When not on a corner, they form a massive rolling roadblock between you and the ""chosen one;"" the AI who started in first. Except in very rare cases, the AI do not trade positions.  If you are tired of the AI, you can try a gate-to-gate race, where every time you pass a truck you get points, every truck you pass increases the points given by the next truck, and losing paint resets the combo. However, you will soon find that the truck drivers are the same AI drivers, except after having been out partying and drinking all night. They have no ability to maintain their lane and seem determined to slam into you as you try to pass.  There are three types of cars. Drift, Grip, and Balanced. To me, drift seems to be like trying to drive a greased whale on ice, grip is the absolute reverse (whatever that may be. A rough shark in sand?), and balanced is so far in the middle that it is incapable of either drifting or gripping. Probably with more practice I could make any of the cars perform, but I simply don't care to.  In summary, I would suggest downloading the demo and just playing that. It's free and has most of the experience of the full game.			"

It's still a great racing game, though there is a learning curve to become a good and clean driver.Online is fun, but it's not without it's issues. Always be on noob alert, they'll take you out on the first corner. This game is region-locked, meaning you'll only be connected to the server according to your steam download region. It's mostly UK and US players that are still active.

												When I was looking at some information on this game, I found a quote from Codemasters in relation to the length of time it would take to complete Grid 2. This game is supposed to take more than 30 hours to complete.“We’ve noticed a trend in recent years with some of the supposedly ‘big’ games that were actually six hours long, and we didn’t feel that was sufficient value for money for our fans at all. We wanted to make sure there was so much more for them to do.”Normally I would complete a game prior to reviewing it, but in this instance I could not bring myself to do it. I will start with the cons first as this will give me some time to think of something good that this game has to offer.Cons:	Realism in this game has gone out the window. Codemasters pride themselves in the amount of effort they spend on realism in their F1 series. Unfortunately this is the only series that has remained true to its original. The original grid game was a lot of fun and on both the Xbox and PC version I have spent untold hours playing (mainly drifting) and hat a lot of fun. This game just doesn’t have the same appeal. Even The Colin McRae series died along with Colin Dirt 1 was the last of the series that was any good. Dirt 2 was supposed to be a homage to Colin McRae, but it was appalling.	Drifting: DRIFTS ARE NOT POPPING THE HANDBRAKE AND DOING A LITTLE SLIDE ROUND THE CORNER. Grid was so much fun when it came to the drift challenges. There was nothing more satisfying than pulling off a linked chain of drifts for an entire lap and then watching the replay for that satisfaction. All you do in this game is pull the handbrake (or E-Brake) coming in to a corner, do a little slide, drive up to the next corner and repeat. You cannot keep drifts going in this game. For those of you that are looking at buying this game to relive those font memories of drifting around an entire track but with revised graphics, don’t bother. Just like me, you will be sorely disappointed.	Your friendly AI team coordinator that is in your ear every race: Even if your mechanical knowledge is strictly limited to knowing where the fuel goes in to your car, you will find the commentators remarks cringe worthy. Unfortunately when he first introduced himself at the start of the game, something in the back of my mind was telling me that this game was not going to live up to its predecessor.	It’s not fun: There are 2 types of games, ones that you look at the time and think; “gees, is that the time, I should have eaten 5 hours ago” and those that make you look at the clock like you are at work and are waiting impatiently for 5:00 so you can go home and do something FUN. Grid 2 falls in to the latter category. 	No cockpit view… Not that it matters in an arcade racer… But it was a real game it would need an in car view.Pros Pro	It looks pretty.Codemasters should look at creating entire new games when they want to change from realism to arcade, instead of leeching off the popularity of their previous games and developing cruddy arcade racers. Basically, this game would be better if they didn’t call it Grid 2 and get everyone’s hopes up. "

												Didn't grab me as much as the first incarnation but still a damn fine racing game. Codemasters need to lose the race guy progression story and concentrate on actual content. I love the look and feel of these games and as racing games go they are my best. If you like a balanced racing game then go right ahead, just ignore the waffle and you'll be fine.Must play!			"

												Despite the fact that you're using Steam, you need to make a special account to play this online. Since I didn't want to, I played single player. It was okay, but I really couldn't enjoy it. They force you to use drift cars for the first few missions and as a long time Forza player, this made these races really REALLY annoying. The drift physics are really weird and you can't skip these missions. I even have other cars from DLC which I should be allowed to drive in the races, but they restrict the cars to ONLY the drift car you start with, then ONLY the drift car you win during that race. You get to pick between two prize cars, but they were both drift. Maybe I'm just oversensitive, but the refusal to let me not drift took all fun out of the game for me.			"

												Graphic, sound are good, damage physics is good.But the most important thing in racing games, Car physics (control) is really bad.It's no where near simulation. It's somewhere near arcade, but it's not. It's like... somewhere between them and it's awful.In this game, you go through corners faster with drifting than braking and following the racing lines. It's ok for arcade style, but then it tries to be like simulation, tiny error will ♥♥♥♥ you up and make you lose places or even crash your car (that's why there is rewind feature?). This control will make you very frustrated when you go deeper in the career mode (when your cars are faster and facing harder components).May be you can do better after practicing more with this game. But when you played another racing games, no matter it's simulation type like F1 2013 or arcade type like NFS, you will find it hard to adapt to this controls. It's very unique that no racing game is similar to this.This game shows potential but it's totally ruined by its car physics.			"

												Good game, but multiplayer has some serious flaws.1: Noobs are at a disadvantage from the off, the vets have faster, tuned cars, so you have little chance to win.2: If you cut a corner, your car gets slowed down for 3 seconds. The system is flawed, other players can push you off track, you receive the penalty and you did nothing wrong. Oversteer or understeer on the cars can also cause you to go off track, you get penalty, your race is ruined. Others players use you car as their brake, pushing you off the track, you get the penalty3: Grid, the grid is flawed, if you get pole, you're in with a chance of winning, unless your car isnt as fast as the others then you're not in with a chance. if you're at the back or in the middle, it is highly likely you car will be smashed up into the first few corners by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags who cant drive.Other than thosethings and a few others like the various dlc, then it's a good game.

												I'm greatly enjoying this game. Love the handling - reminds me of PGR.Runs really smooth with my HD 7870. I'd go as far as to claim that this is the best looking Racing Game available at this moment - since Need for Speed Rivals has been crippled to 30fps and Forza 5 has been downgraded to accomodate to the Xbox One's lacklustre performance ;PMy only gripe with GRID 2 so far is its businessmodel and pricing - there should have been no pre-order incentives to begin with - since there is no shortage of supply or shipping cost when it comes to digital distribution. I shouldn't be paying more just because I choose to buy the game during the week of its release rather than paying ahead of release... I simply like to be able to access the stuff I buy immediately once I put my money on the table. In addition I'm not a big fan of microtransactions only devalue the initial purchase and make people hold out for Sales and Collectors Editions... which I did. Aside from being rather pervasively integrated into this game - most of the car-pacs seem to be variations on the cars you can unlock in the game - thus don't seem to affect the balance of the game.The one DLC that does offer something interesting (Destruction Derby) comes at no additional cost.It appears that some Tier 3 cars which you should be able to win in career mode are locked away behind some nasty difficultiy spike - but thankfully you are able to switch difficultiy in the options at any time during your career which negates the frustration.I'm having a blast with this game so far - the WSR is a brilliant idea and provides a lot of diversity and motivation. There's a distinct Street Race Action-Movie feel to the game and its events which make it very cohesive - though its gritty Sepia tone and Hollywood Soundtrack may not be for everyone... but this is more down to personal preference and subjecitve perception. The Car demolition and aggressive AI work really well and add an additional layer to the challenge.I'm not missing the Cockpit View all that much, since I don't use it for racing - In other games I mostly use it  to check out the interiors - it kinda adds to the feel of driving a real car. Maybe with the arrival of Occulus Rift the Cockpit View will become relevant once again?All in all I can recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging Racing Game.9/10: Top of its Genre			"

												Beautiful, simplistic models, realistic lighting, tight controls, and awesome multiplayer mayhem.The story is also suprisingly strong. Progress that you make gives access to more events, giving a sense of accomplishment than most racing games.The car physics are also fantastic; I've never had my car tilt on it's side when I overshoot a drift. And then tumble thirty or so feet before somehow landing back on it's tires. Or cringing at how much car smashing carnage online races have within ten seconds into the first turn. Or edging off a cliffside/ wall at high speed and having the car really react to it.The only peeve I'd give it is how I'd have to manually change my resolution back to fullscreen from a windowed 800x600 when I go glance at my desktop.Otherwise, amazing game. I'd recommend it to any racing enthusiasts.			"

												Grid 2 give you the most incredible experience behind the wheel. In spite of being focused on a touring concept, it has the largest choice of cars and tracks on the urban and mountain territory, where you can race on a ford focus or on a bmw in midtown chicago or drift them in the mountains of japan. Grid 2 brings the old school muscle cars, the brand new urban cars, the fastest touring cars, mixing them and put you into a test of different race modes, like drift, sprint, lap race, endurance, etc, giving you a total experience of racing your way to the top.The multiplayer is outstanding, unfortunately since the release of Grid Autosport, the number of players have decreased but believe me guys, Grid 2 is even more worthy to buy because its more versatile and not so ""one dimensional"" like autosport is, only focusing his gameplay on touring. Btw, the demolition derby free dlc is awesome and just gave me a ton of good laughs when i smash my friends!			"

												 GRID 2 is an arcade fun racing game, is not any realistic or serious car racing genre so if your mind are looking for some serious car racing I strongly suggest to look for other title to avoid disappointment. What can I tell from my experience by playing GRID 2? To this time 2017, GRID 2 still offer one of the most gorgeously stunning looking in game graphic  of environment,surrounding and vehicle as well. it look immersively amazing and polished. As for the gameplay and control for my taste; it feel like GRID 2 emphasize pretty heavy on drifting, so here and there almost every vehicle I drive just need some plus-minus and understanding of handling to catch the drift.GRID and GRID 2 has a totaly different handling and control for the vehicle. Either you get used to both of em or you going to dislikes one of it, so maketh your mind which would you consider to buy and play em! That's how I feel for both of the game. If you plan to bought GRID 2, please just ignore GRID by the time you get used to the handling and then you try to play GRID it would just mess up both of your game rhythm. From this, I understand WHY much GRID player complaint GRID 2 feel like driving on top of ice and GRID 2 control. Overall I had to sayeth; for a 75% discounted car racing game, GRID 2 is not a bad game. GRID 2 still able to offer car racing adrenaline rush and a good racing game at the end of day,not to forgot the amazingly stunning graphic. Although GRID 2 come with pretty limited customization but the paint job is seriously good and fun to play with. Save yourself a couple of buck and buy another car racing game if you plan to grab the full pack with DLC, You can just ignore all the DLC it don't make much a difference from usin factory preset car to run all the lap, you will drift and race just fine and have fun just the same or you could just choose which DLC content that have your prefer car instead of grabbing all of em.

												The first GRID game , did the world see the games drive differently, what we are familiar , this new GRID 2 its not better than the first Grid, but also is one of the most realistic and impressive than the others racing games,  in my opinion the only things can make the first Grid games better than Grid 2, is the fact have removed the inside car camera (1° Person mode) , and you can not buy more cars, they only earn, thats make you lose the financial vision off the sponsors chalenges etc, anyway this is a highest games recommended race today.

												I just finished GRID 2. I have to say that I'm a fan of it overall. They went for something different from what fans of GRID were expecting, and the drifty handling took a while to get a hold of. Yet, once I built some skill and realized what the devs were going for - a video-gamey crash and bash beautiful looking racer that takes some skill to master - I really got into it. I think, most people didn't give GRID 2 a chance. They flipped out when it wasn't exactly what they were expecting. Learning the handling is somewhat frustrating - I understand - but once I did, the game became super fun, and the racing was friggin' white knuckle right to the end. I really enjoyed my time with it, and I expect I'll return to it again sometime. There really isn't anything quite like it.			"

												GRID2 is the worst race game I've ever played, hard to believe its from the same developer as DiRT, although each iteration of dirt has got worst, wish I had stopped at dirt 2 but got and played dirt 3 as little as Grid 2. GRID 2 is just mindless street racing, with random lobbies in multyplayer your up against anyone from lvl 1 to lvl99, the only balancing to the game is that the lowest level player starts at the front, this only makes things worse as everyone else who is behind you has a faster car, one the race starts someone steers you into the wall then someone else smashes into your car spinning you round by the time you know which way your facing 2 -3 more cars smash you back into the wall, its like being inside a football rather than a car. Once everyone has passed and your moving again everyone else is out of sight, so you carry on in your crappy level 1 car possibly catching up to a few others but the leader is always gaining more ground & once they pass the finish line starts the 30 second count down, on avverage 50% of players then fail with a DNF as the race stops.    Defiantly not worth the 10 GB of hdd space it wastes.Racing games I have and highly recommend are, Screamer 2, Xpand Rally, DiRT, NSF Shift, WRC3			"

												Having completed GRID 100%, i just had to get this new edition. Have to say Codemasters have this game to a T. There is nothing out there i can compare this game to other than its predecessor. GRID2 has been improved in a lot of ways and all positive too. If you are seeking a Racing Game with all ranges of cars from classic to modern, high detailed graphics, and epic sound, then this is a must purchase. You won't be disappointed. The is a game you can have a quick race, or you can get right into the thick of managing your sponsors, car graphics and team. Multiplayer is good, but only prefer split screen with my kids, and its great fun too.Just awesome!			"

												GRID 2 manages to inject a nice dose of realistic physics within an arcade style racing game. The result is a game that simulator purists will surely frown upon....

												I was pretty disappointed with this one.  It gets by as a predictable and safe arcade racer, but that's about the best to be said about it.  The graphics and effects are OK.  The story mode is less cringey than many of its counterparts, but it still holds your hand a bit more than i care for.  The controls feel like a standard, mediocre arcade racer and don't do much to excite.I have a stability issue with the game that i haven't been able to resolve, which is that it crashes without fail about 15 minutes into every play session.  Others have this issue as well, but i have yet to be able to resolve it.  The game doesn't do enough to get me to keep attempting a fix anyway.Recently, i grabbed this game's predecessor, GRID, and was shocked to find that it is a better game in practically every way.  I enjoy it's UI more, it feels better optimized, it doesn't crash, the controls feel much better, the tracks are more fun and exciting, and it's story mode is less intrusive.If you're looking for a solid arcade racer, I would definitely suggest the original GRID over this one.If you enjoy a challenge and have a decent computer, definitely consider a game like Project Cars or Assetto Corsa over this series, as they go on sale frequently and have much more to offer.

												This game has a lot of quick races compared to Grid and there is an arcade type of feel. It lacks the cockpit view and is a blend of NFS underground, Dirt 2, and Grid. The Dirt 2 factor is an annoying announcer and goofy menus. Where this game shines is that it smacks down every NFS title on this platform. It lacks upgrades to vehicles but that can be forgiven due to the great exhaust sounds and eye candy. If you want longer races and better handling go pick up Grid. If you want some quicker racing and some drifting this is a great game. You may even prefer the handling it's just more arcadish and you can smack your car around a bit more. The DLC is mostly just more cars and this is where your upgrades were hidden. Oh you wanted to upgrade your ride like on NFS underground well that will be $4.99. It's still a bit pricey even when bundled together but it compliments a solid title.			"

It definitely isn't worth paying 18 bucks for it.Anyway, it is still one of the best racing arcades on the market.To conclude: If you had fun playing GRID - don't even bother installing GRID 2, have fun playing the original game If you had never played GRID - wait for sales or promo-actions and get GRID 2 "

There is nothing very wrong with this game, but nothing right either, except maybe the re-wind function. I also had a few CTDs.

												Hi all,What can  I say? THis must be the worst excuse of a sequel I have seen in years. Technically solid with nice graphics and a lot of feel for the car, albeit very simcade-ish. But that is as far as the good goes. The bad: No real gameplay ala GRID. It's more of strung together orgy of races like Dirt or similar. No more raceteam of your own, no more spnsors to win, no more money to earn to buy cars etc etc. Grid 2 is a sub-par game. It is actually an insult to call this Grid at all. It has nothing in common with the original. Codemasters(yea I know the nameis a joke) proves yet again (after the F1 series) how able they are in dumbing down a formerly good concept and ruin the fun. Don't get me wrong, the driving is ok, but if the game around it fails then there is no purpose, no sense of achievement in actual fact there is not much left. 4/10 :(			"

												When I was 11, I bought a racing game called Gran Turismo for my Playstation Portable. Back then I couldn't tell the difference between a pickup truck and a Lamborghini (I'm exaggerating, but when it came to cars, I really did lack knowledge). I didn't have any interest of cars back then, just like every other kid, I liked Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft. Yeah that's right, I'm not afraid to tell the world that I used to like it! But after I bought that game, that one little racing game with over 800 cars, it changed my life, my perspective on how I saw the world around me. In no time, I became a car enthusiast, and switched to PC gaming. But I lost my Gran Turismo... and for 3 years I've never had a legitimate racing game. But then I bought this game. It took me a whole week to decide on buying this game. I had to break everything down, such as seeing the requirements, reading online reviews, and looking at gameplays. At first I thought to myself, ""I should probably save this game for an H1Z1 sale."" But then I thought back to Gran Tursimo days. After that, there was no stopping me from buying it. And then, after 2 hours of waiting for 6 GB to go through, while watching episodes of How I Met Your Mother... I launched it. I clicked on career mode and then I started my first race with the Ford Mustang Match 1. It was an amazing race and brought back so many memories of 11 year old me... Plus I had all the DLC for the game and had a lot of fun. Everything about this game is amazing! The graphics, the physics, the handling of the cars, it's all just so realistic! Despite the fact that this game only has a limited amount of cars everything else is amazing! And it has split-screen mode so if you want to challenge your friend to a race, you can! If you are a car enthusiast, I encourage you to get this game!			"

												The #1 Driving Simulator for the PC at present, far beyond the competition, and close behind Forza and Gran Turismo as the greatest Driving Sims ever made.Accurate cars and tracks, with excellent physics, each car has it's own charecteristics which are lost on a lot of PC driving games. Sure, it's like every other driving game, however it uses a range of tracks that aren't found in any other game, therefore keeping the game fresh and interesting.Turn the graphics up to ultra @1440p and then it really shines.

												I've been wary of Codemasters since they destroyed the Dirt franchise...But I have to say...As a 'pure racer' with little extra fluff (daft challenges that shouldn't appear in racing games) - it excels..All cars handle brilliantly and the graphics are excellent and the difficulty is pitched just right (only gets REALLY difficult towards the end)Heartily recommended... a return to form!

												Okay uh this is my first negative review and I'm sad it has to be on this one.The game has cool graphics and stuff, but VERY bad physics and it slips a lot, I'm using a steering wheel to play it and it's AWFULLY slippy everywhere. I like drifting but drifting on here it's mad crazy. I've seen other people agree that it's like if you were driving on ice. It also has no cockpit view........ but I think you can fix that with a mod so whateverbut seriously... it's way easier to play with keyboard... I have the game + all the DLC but I wish I could refund it, don't waste your time on this game unless you enjoy pain and suffering			"

												Not bad. I got it on sale and Im glad I tried this before buying the newer and more expensive Grid: Autosport. This is more of an arcade style racer than a simulator. When I think racing simulator I instantly think Gran Tourismo or even Assetto Corsa. Its still a great game but the only tweaking you will be doing to your car is placing sponsor decals and other aesthetics.All in all, its fairly easy to play. Newcomers to driving games can probably master the controls very soon while seasoned racers will be able to come in and start with a bang. One thing I love, is there seem to be a lot of short races. I was (and still am) a Gran Tourismo junkie. But what I always hated about taht game was in order to complete 100% of the game you had to do the extremely long, marathon style races. Some take hours and hours to finish. Im not sure if Grid has any of those but it doesnt seem to be that type of game. GT only has them because it tries to be a true simulator.Im not crazy about the focus on drifting with every single car/class. While I dont mind drifting, I think drifting capable cars (and those amde jsut for drifting) fall into a different class than all of the other cars available. Matter of fact, drift cars and that style of racing, belongs to a small minority. But in most racing games now, they tend to add drifting into the game no matter tha car or track style. Well, thats not always the best way to drive a track. Also, your car type really matters when it comes to sliding around. In Grid, so far, Ive even been expected to drift an old Dodge Charger in a ""takeover"" style race while simultaneously racing against a clock. Well, I may be sliding the rear-end out to get around some turns, but Im not going to be holding a full-on drift. The car is too heavy, tires spin too much, and I wouldnt be able to accelerate out of the turn enough to make up for lost time in the drift. But then here is what makes it an arcade racer and not a simulator...my acceleration and grip coming out the turn (while drifting) was perfectly fine. A real simulator wouldnt allow that to occur.As an Arcade style racer its great. When properly placed into the category I literally have no complaints. Due to certain graphics and the fact that some of the menu layouts are poor, I would give this an 8/10 in the arcade racer category.			"

												Too slippery.No matter what car you chose and the road and weather conditions, your car will slide. The handling hardly differs between cars other than the fact that some are heavier than others. I wish they had put more work in realisticly simulating tire traction.There is absolutely no incentive to play the game in story more since you don't earn cash or rack up points towards unlocking cars. I hear there's an actual incentive to play the game online, but the servers are empty and no one's there.			"

												Race Driver: Grid is a beloved modern classic, so everyone had huge expectations for GRID 2. I myself bought it on day one...Sadly, some basic features are missing in GRID 2:- Cockpit view- Assists options (this is a huge one)- chat in online lobbies  And...The DLCs are overpriced and they further split the now small community (the game is region locked).Codemasters implemented the so called ""TrueFeel Handling System"". The handling is constant drifting on ""ice covered"" tracks, because if you keep on the non-existent racing line/not drifting you take the corners slower - ridiculous! Less cars, less liveries (most are ugly, a thing a 10 year old would put on a car)Small amount of mostly fake tracks which are very narrow, making a regular online race into a crash derby  + all that social media / ""fans"" thing  in the single player campaign... No words.You are not a racer, you are a teenage pop-star, who is given cars to drift/crash and show off to the crowds.That is what Codemasters went for.A shallow copy of Race Driver: Grid... At least they had the decency to leave out ""Race Driver"" . Good  choice, Codies.			"

												Following the impactful original Grid this game has some big shoes to fill. However, this game does an exeptional job of mantaining replayability and keeping with ""Grid"" and its addictive gameplay. This game does lack the classic arcade style of driving. In its attempt for realism this game fall hard in the specific aspect of drifting. While it is possible to get some long stretching drifts, the cars have a lack of feeling like the original grid. Despite this, ""Grid 2"" is an amazing game and I would sincerely recommend it.			"

												The successor of Race Driver: GRID is nowhere as good as the first game from the series but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad game. It still has some really good mechanics and absolutely great looking graphics. GRID2 contains a large amount of cars with various characteristics so players with different driving styles should be able to find something for themselves. Difficulty level of the game is pretty much unbalanced because on the same level some of the challenges are way too easy and some may cause serious problems. Unfortunately, there is also a small amount of race tracks and it's easy to get bored when you have to race on the same circuit over and over again. In overall the game is good but not great. Still, it's one of the best racing games you can find on PC and it's worth to give it a shot.			"

												If you are looking for a game with good steering wheel support this is not the game to buy. The steering is way to sensitive and when you try and counter-steer with the wheel when the game forces you to drift every turn, you wil spin out or swerve back and forth several times until hitting a wall. I've been playing racing games for the past 11 years, and I would rather play a game from 2006.			"

												First thing everyone needs to know about this game is that it's not a racing simulation game. GRID 2 is an arcade racing game without realistic driving dynamics. This game is for people who like going around corners drifting at 100mph as opposed to people like me who prefer having to actually touch the brakes at some point during a race. This was even more annoying for me because it looks like codemasters have spent a lot of time and effort creating a stunning game engine with amazing graphics. The handling of the cars just seems to cheapen the game after all this hard work.Saying that, it's not actually a bad game; you just need to know what you are actually buying. It's a fun game for casual gamers and good value if you get it on sale. It is not worth the usual £30 price though.Buy it if you like arcade racers. Don't buy it if you don't like arcade racers.

												If you're just the average gamer looking for a fun racing game, this is a great option.  The physics aren't ultra realistic like racing simulators, but they're better than the basic arcade games like Need for Speed or Burnout.  It can be extremely challenging to nail a corner perfect, but the cars are very forgiving if you make mistakes.  If you like the DiRT games, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the Grid games too.

												A very entertaining and enjoyable game. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer modes are fun to play. Great variety of cars, but some cars and tracks require you to purchase a DLC pack. Multiplayer is the most fun, and a lobby with you and a couple of friends can lead to some amazing moments and awkward crashes. Controller recommended!The biggest problem is, you can't depend on random people to play fair. They will crash into you and most probably ruin your day. But if you aren't one to take such incidents seriously, go for it when it's on sale.Note: Problems with the Logitech G110 keyboard - Sometimes the keyboard locks up whenever you have more than 3 keys pressed. Not like ghosting, but the keboard doesn't respond until plugged in again. So G110 users, stay away.			"

												I love and hate this game. However, after over 130h I think I more hate it than love it. Anyway, it's a nice racing game with reasonable  arcade / sim compromise, mostly for those, who plan to play multiplayer. And there we come to the part where I really hate it. Single player is very short. No problem. Switch to multi, where:- you have no way to report cheaters (yep, after couple of years they still haven't dealt with it). So there you are, racing, and suddenly one accellerates from 100 to 300 withing 0.5 sec. kicking you out. Nice, right?- then there are Touge races, with absurd disqualification rules. Being hit from left/right -> OK . Slowing down before corner and being hit from behind -> DQ. Hitting the wall, spinning and being hit -> DQ.I like the game but because it was never finished, I will never ever buy anything from this publisher. End of story. Back to Assetto Corsa			"

												If you like racing games that look great and are forgiving of little mistakes, then this is your game.  The third person camera angle, beautiful graphics, and great handling on the PC make this game great on the PC.  A must buy if it's on sale.			"

												The unskippable, cringeworthy live-action films aside, there's not much wrong with this. With a keyboard it's very easy to defeat the AI, who seem to be programmed to tap the brakes unnecessarily to allow you, the human, to get past and win. All the cars in their classes (drift, grip etc.) feel the same as eachother, so no need to worry about getting used to newly unlocked cars, if you've driven one drift car you've driven them all. The graphics are fine for the age of the game, the sounds are... there, sadly the camera options are lacking & the option to turn sound down past 50% is blocked for some unknown reason, but thankfully you can turn off the repetitive voice clips.If you've played other non-serious racing games, might as well give this a shot.

												The game's dynamics are very good and very well refined for all cars of any specifications. It has a story line, which is not typical of a racing game but it is very well done so that as you complete targets and objectives the story continues and you can play the game at your own pace.If you set it to easy the races still pose a challenge perhaps not from the bots but from the game play its self, the harder difficulties offer a great challenge from the bots and forces you to better your skills.You have the option to customise your vehicles in any variation of colour with each section of the car (tags, wheels, stripes etc.), however you don't have the option to customise (add/remove) stripes etc, which is a disappointment. Also the game looks amazing with the graphics set to maximum.If you're looking for a racing game that isn't 100% realistic but will still give you a lot of realism along with some awesomely fine tuned game play I highly recommend buying GRID 2.

												GRID 2 is highly recommended for fans of the racing genre. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I think anyone who likes the Codemasters or NFS series this should be a no brainer.PROS -- Huge variety in cars, tracks and race types- Graphics- Damage modelling- Paint job customization- Driving model- Rewind featureCONS -- No race line feature- Car spins during painting- Driving modelIf you noticed that I put the driving model as both a pro and a con, it's because really the model is subjective. It is not a 'hardcore' model like you will find in other high end racers. Nor is it too arcady. Like I said, if you enjoy NFS etc, this fits in well with those.The rewind feature is a huge step forward to reduce frustration in racing games. Ever run the perfect race only to make a small error at the last lap and get dumped to the end of the pack? That's over. Have a crash or take a corner wrong and spin out? Just rewind a few seconds and have another go at it. Feel that's cheating? Don't use it. Personally, I love the option.Cars look great, tracks look great. Track your best times and stats against your Steam friends. I haven't used the multiplayer much, but its there if that's your thing. Get bored of racing? Try the demolition derby! You'll have lots of fun with this one.			"

												This is such a good driving engine in my opinion. Similar to CMR and Dirt 1,2,3. The game has its faults but there is nothing else to beat it yet. The driving just feels right. I just tried playing NFS Shift after 150 hrs of this, and it feels like crap now. Now I just wish they would design a game campaign like Forza 4 or Gran Turismo 5, but using this graphics\physics engine. Then include tracks like Bathurst, Nurburgring\Nordschleife etc, and all the production and tuner cars like in GT. I think that would sell a million or 3!More accessable than the SimBin series, maybe not as realistic, but a lot more fun.			"

												At first I didnt like this game, the races came thick n fast and didnt really give me time to enjoy it. I think if id of played the game on hard instead of normal then that wouldnt of been a problem. The graphics are awesome, better than the more recent driving game ive bought The Crew. I remember playing the original Grid and loving it and after finishing this I have to say once again im impressed. The driving style is a little arcadey but thats not such a bad thing for the mainstream... rather a good thing. Theres plenty of cars, which are all grouped up into tiers. The amount of tracks is acceptable although at times it seems you do race the same track once to often in a different race type or direction. Overall this is a great racing game, and I thoroughly reccommend it. If you can pick it up cheap, n play it on hard youre get hours of enjoyment. 8/10			"

Multyplayer is amazing, shame that this game isint as popular as others multyplayer games, (normal for a racing game) . that for getting into the race might take a while (Usualy it takes from 0-3 mins to get room full)4.

												The game is a bit harder than regular racers, but it is easier than full on simulators. Go at it for 30-60 minutes and you will get the hang of it. Cars handle extremely different from each other making mastering the whole game quite a challenge. It is quite fun. AI is ridiculosly aggresive, which can become annoying. Fun game all in all.

												Great Arcade racing game but not a true sequel to the original GRID in my opinion.. Yes, they've bumped up the Graphics and added more tracks, depth etc.. but it doesn't feel like a true GRID sequel due to the fact it's lacking different race categories. Where are race modes like Touge, Classic Muscle, Formula 3? Can recommend it but don't expect the same magic they've achieved with GRID.			"

												To me this game feels like it's DiRT 3 on pavement, which is exactly what I was hoping for, i'd say around 65% arcade the rest sim, the tracks and cars are awesome. GreenManGaming had this game for prepurchase for $33 with 1 DLC pack and it's worth full price. Again Codemasters EGO engine is perfect, looks gorgeous and it's smooth as butter. Multiplayer is pretty addicting and I like the unlocking system they're using, makes you ""look forward"" to more and more stuff. If you want a mix of arcade/sim racing games look into Codemasters titles, good stuff.			"

												This is a ""fun"" and good ""driving"" game with a lot of drifting, and last but not least: F*CKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO CRASHES INTO YOU ALL THE TIME IN ONLINE GAMEPLAY! WOOOHOOO! BEST THING!I like the single player, with the bots, because you can easily drift around and it is not always that hard to win and the bots are not idiots (most of the time) so they dont just bang into the side of you, and if they do, you can just use some slowmotion back in time to prevent that sh*t. In ONLINE you need to start a bit behind after you get smashed and the player who did it wont even feel that big penalty if he succed to crash you without himself crashing. He earns a bit less in impact money, but ♥♥♥♥ that sh*t.I will give this game 8/10, because it is still fun and it is better if you play it with a friend. It is one of the best car/racing games with drifting i have played (i have not played that many racing games). There is also a lot of custimazation (might have spelled that wrond) that can be done, which is great and i like that. The things i find bad in this game is, as mentioned, the stupid players in ONLINE matches. Some race fairly enough and may hit someone, but not one purpose, but then there is those f*ckers who just come with 300 km/h and bang into the side of you and if you choose to respawn, then you will probably start behind them and if you get near them again ""BANG MOTHERF*UCKER"", you have crashed again.Because of my rage i would almost give this game just 5/10 because of the people in ONLINE and the little penalty they get for crashing people, but that would be a bit unfair, because the game is not just about ONLINE and they can decide if idiots decide to play this game.I will recommend this game if you like a good drifting racer game with a lot of custimazation and i think it will be best if you play some SINGLE PLAYER before you start at playing ONLINE with high levels and crashers.Unless you like to rage and probably lose some times against crashers and high levels, then i would not recommend to play ONLINE. Of course it can be more challenging than SINGE PLAYER.			"

It's got a wide selection of cars which you can customize the livery and rims on.  While the tracks are limitied, it does help you with memorizing them (like real race car drivers do).

												The lack of cockpit view is not missed since this is an arcade racer through and through.What is really great about Grid 2 (sp) is the lack of vehicle modding and customisation. The focus is purely on racing and the lack of upgrades means that you get really tense and challenging races.Graphics are superb and if you have a decent card the game is spectacular in eyefinity and isn't too demanding so you don't need SLI.I pre-ordered when it first came available on steam. There were a few things that I hated about the meta-game (career sp), for example, the animation that counts your fans after each race was un-skippable. I gave codemasters feedback about aspects that could be improved and they were implemented soon after in a patch! I will always have respect for codemasters and by and large they make some of the most enjoyable racing games available.			"

												As Grid was the greatest racing game of a generation, Codemasters has done it again by taking that greatness and reworked it as a successor from the ground up. Grid is no longer that benchmark. Grid 2 is. THIS is by far, the greatest racing game I've ever played. Pure adrenaline, high-octane action which doesn't let up until you've crossed that finish line. Make no mistake; there is NO rubberbanding from the AI in this game. You wanna win and claim 1st? FIGHT FOR IT, because the AI will work just as hard as you do to be there: Trading paint, slicing corners, braking risky turns and burning off every inch of asphalt on those treacherous straight aways.Come to think of it, this is more than a racing game. This is an experience. Just as Skyrim has done for RPGs, Grid 2 has done for racers. To oversimplify the fact: this is the Dark Souls equivalent of racing. A challenging, but extremely rewarding experience that will captivate you again and again behind every wheel of every car you take to the pavement.Incredible sound design, outstanding controls which truly make you feel like you are behind the wheel of every car you drive, and the reactive environments you race in: no two races EVER feel the same and I would be hard pressed to believe anyone who claims otherwise.If you've never played Grid, now is the time to acclimate yourself to the one and only racer that might just be the only thing truest to the form.Trust me. This is one HELL of a game!			"

												Great tracks, great cars, great graphics. Physics is debatable, but great game overall.*Recently, there have been issues with the keys not registering/keys getting jammed. It was a common problem for users with the Logitech G110 gaming keyboard (myself included), as well as some Microsoft Sidewinder at first, but now, it's happening to my new Logitech G710+ mechanical keyboard too. It doens't happen anywhere else, so it isn't an issue with the keyboard.

												If you're looking for a racing game that's looking great, easy accessible and delivers a ton of fun right from the start, this is the game for you. It's a pure and satisfying arcade racer with imho the best xbox360 controls I've ever seen yet. The AI drivers are well balanced and tend to be more fair than aggressiv. Grid 1 was a ""crash party"" for me most of the time in this regard especially because you've got too less time to really reach the top without driving like an insane psychopath yourself. Grid 2 feels quite different, way less insane, though it becomes harder and harder to catch the #1 while you progress through the events. Still I wish (career) races would last longer with more rounds, I always have the feeling that the race is already over when it just gets really fun. (I played a few true racings sims in the past with considerably longer races, it just makes it way more intense). But this is a complaint I have with arcade racers in general besides not beeing sims anyway ;-)Missing cockpits - everyone has them today, even arcade racers. But the game is still pretty fun without them.DLC, way to go today it seems. Questionable but I'm to tired to get upset. Take it or leave it.			"

												The game is a good halfway between simulation and arcade. Visually the game is stunning, the controlls works perfectly and the  car damages are pretty well done.

												The game's dynamics are very good and very well refined for all cars of any specifications. It has a story line, which is not typical of a racing game but it is very well done so that as you complete targets and objectives the story continues and you can play the game at your own pace.If you set it to easy the races still pose a challenge perhaps not from the bots but from the game play its self, the harder difficulties offer a great challenge from the bots and forces you to better your skills.You have the option to customise your vehicles in any variation of colour with each section of the car (tags, wheels, stripes etc.), however you don't have the option to customise (add/remove) stripes etc, which is a disappointment. Also the game looks amazing with the graphics set to maximum.If you're looking for a racing game that isn't 100% realistic but will still give you a lot of realism along with some awesomely fine tuned game play I highly recommend buying GRID 2.

												This is a ""fun"" and good ""driving"" game with a lot of drifting, and last but not least: F*CKING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S WHO CRASHES INTO YOU ALL THE TIME IN ONLINE GAMEPLAY! WOOOHOOO! BEST THING!I like the single player, with the bots, because you can easily drift around and it is not always that hard to win and the bots are not idiots (most of the time) so they dont just bang into the side of you, and if they do, you can just use some slowmotion back in time to prevent that sh*t. In ONLINE you need to start a bit behind after you get smashed and the player who did it wont even feel that big penalty if he succed to crash you without himself crashing. He earns a bit less in impact money, but ♥♥♥♥ that sh*t.I will give this game 8/10, because it is still fun and it is better if you play it with a friend. It is one of the best car/racing games with drifting i have played (i have not played that many racing games). There is also a lot of custimazation (might have spelled that wrond) that can be done, which is great and i like that. The things i find bad in this game is, as mentioned, the stupid players in ONLINE matches. Some race fairly enough and may hit someone, but not one purpose, but then there is those f*ckers who just come with 300 km/h and bang into the side of you and if you choose to respawn, then you will probably start behind them and if you get near them again ""BANG MOTHERF*UCKER"", you have crashed again.Because of my rage i would almost give this game just 5/10 because of the people in ONLINE and the little penalty they get for crashing people, but that would be a bit unfair, because the game is not just about ONLINE and they can decide if idiots decide to play this game.I will recommend this game if you like a good drifting racer game with a lot of custimazation and i think it will be best if you play some SINGLE PLAYER before you start at playing ONLINE with high levels and crashers.Unless you like to rage and probably lose some times against crashers and high levels, then i would not recommend to play ONLINE. Of course it can be more challenging than SINGE PLAYER.			"

												Grid 2 (stylised as GRID 2 and known as Race Driver: Grid 2 in Japan) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters and is the sequel to 2008's Race Driver: Grid. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.The game includes numerous real world locations and cities such as Paris. It also includes motor vehicles spanning four decades. In addition, it includes a new handling system that developer Codemasters has dubbed 'TrueFeel', which aims to hit a sweet spot between realism and accessibility. Races do not include a first person cockpit view.Drivers are given certain cars before some race modes, and can unlock others through other vehicle challenges. Car liveries can be customised by the player, using preset graphic designs adapted with colours or varying shades.			"

												The successor of Race Driver: GRID is nowhere as good as the first game from the series but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad game. It still has some really good mechanics and absolutely great looking graphics. GRID2 contains a large amount of cars with various characteristics so players with different driving styles should be able to find something for themselves. Difficulty level of the game is pretty much unbalanced because on the same level some of the challenges are way too easy and some may cause serious problems. Unfortunately, there is also a small amount of race tracks and it's easy to get bored when you have to race on the same circuit over and over again. In overall the game is good but not great. Still, it's one of the best racing games you can find on PC and it's worth to give it a shot.			"

												A very entertaining and enjoyable game. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer modes are fun to play. Great variety of cars, but some cars and tracks require you to purchase a DLC pack. Multiplayer is the most fun, and a lobby with you and a couple of friends can lead to some amazing moments and awkward crashes. Controller recommended!The biggest problem is, you can't depend on random people to play fair. They will crash into you and most probably ruin your day. But if you aren't one to take such incidents seriously, go for it when it's on sale.Note: Problems with the Logitech G110 keyboard - Sometimes the keyboard locks up whenever you have more than 3 keys pressed. Not like ghosting, but the keboard doesn't respond until plugged in again. So G110 users, stay away.			"

												If you're just the average gamer looking for a fun racing game, this is a great option.  The physics aren't ultra realistic like racing simulators, but they're better than the basic arcade games like Need for Speed or Burnout.  It can be extremely challenging to nail a corner perfect, but the cars are very forgiving if you make mistakes.  If you like the DiRT games, there's a good chance you'll enjoy the Grid games too.

												First thing everyone needs to know about this game is that it's not a racing simulation game. GRID 2 is an arcade racing game without realistic driving dynamics. This game is for people who like going around corners drifting at 100mph as opposed to people like me who prefer having to actually touch the brakes at some point during a race. This was even more annoying for me because it looks like codemasters have spent a lot of time and effort creating a stunning game engine with amazing graphics. The handling of the cars just seems to cheapen the game after all this hard work.Saying that, it's not actually a bad game; you just need to know what you are actually buying. It's a fun game for casual gamers and good value if you get it on sale. It is not worth the usual £30 price though.Buy it if you like arcade racers. Don't buy it if you don't like arcade racers. Simples.			"

												I'm glad I at least got the game with the DLC pack when it was on sale. Aside from that, the game itself is not worth more than $5. Let me elaborate; enlighten you if you will. Lol. The menu is disorderly. It feels like you are sitting through a loading screen every time you want to switch from, among other things, gamemodes such as Time Attack, Elimination, or customizing your car, which, by the way, is very limited. I've been playing for a while and all it seems I can do is choose a couple of sponsors (no, not unlock aftermarket parts), change the pattern / colour of my vehicle and the wheels. I dislike the fact that you are forced to drive different, garbage, stock vehicles. You can't invest heavily into a single car. To me, this makes all the difference. Multiplayer is a completely separate thing in itself. I've yet to find out what the money I'm earning is for. I mean when you start SP, you work your way to the top. In MP, regardless of your not being able to choose a vehicle for a race because you haven't went that far, you're still able to race with it. This feels weird as you're not accustomed to flying a jet in SP. The tracks all feel the same. The visuals, handling of the car and graphics are quite pleasing on the other hand. I'd recommend this game if you're looking for leisure, kick back with friends and play on a steering-wheel kind of thing.			"

												Fun physics, not a sim at all, about as easy as Need for Speed games. And like those games it doesn't take itself too seriously.For instance the AI tries to murder you. Usually it's not a problem, but some drivers won't hesitate to let you drive off a cliff. And the camera is low to the ground which means you can't see anything but bumper if you're behind somebody and it also means you can't see the next turn. Makes you feel like you're going fast, even though you'll miss the next corner if you don't know the track. You can switch to hood cam, but then you don't get a visual representation of the smallest bumps in the road which have an IMMENSE effect on the handling of certain cars on certain tracks. So that's not an option either.It also promotes to ignore all techniques you've ever learned, ignore the racing line, ignore braking points, ignore weight shifts and just go flat out all the time and drift around every single corner. Using proper techniques will make you go slower. But if you have a track in the mountains suddenly you have to keep in mind how driving uphill and downhill has an effect on the weight shifts and steering which is really hard compared to the NFS-style of racing you had used in the previous race. And in those races all of a sudden 1 wheel on the grass means guaranteed spin-out. This game can't decide whether it's a serious racing game or not and this inconsistency makes the difficult races much more difficult then they need to be. Both the sim races and the arcade races are fun, but it's not fun if you can't tell in advance what you'll get, can't pick a car to suit that style of race and you have to flip a switch and drive differently. Especially if the enemies keep trying to do PIT manoeuvres on you. They'll even ram you during a Drift event which makes no sense.Another strange inconsistency is the track times you need to finish first. If you finish in say 2 minutes flat you might win the one time, but the next time you play the same races you might encounter much faster enemies and you'll have to do it 5 seconds quicker. If it's random, what's the point of having to be first? Just give us a set time goal. AI aggressiveness is random as well.The Flashback option is confusing. You can use it quite a bit and then suddenly not anymore, so use it wisely because there is no way to tell how long or how often you can use it. Sometimes you can use it 8 times, but it's also been disabled after about 3 uses. The game tells you it exists and what key activates it in the very first race and then no more information ever. Maybe so it stays a bit of a gamble.All in all... It's usually fun, it's random, it's aggressive, it's adrenaline filled, if you don't care about it being a little unfair at times (scripted crashes happen in front of you, AI tries to murder you) and don't take racing too seriously you'll probably like this. Personally I still like TOCA 3 a lot better. It doesn't have better mechanics, but at least it's not all randomness and I didn't have to follow a career path that suits a very boring story. If this game would have been consistent and if they would have made a proper hood camera I would have loved this, but they made it unnecessarily frustrating. The physics and vehicles are mostly awesome, but the rest seems rushed. Most people will like it I think, this is how race games often are nowadays.			"

												I love and hate this game. However, after over 130h I think I more hate it than love it. Anyway, it's a nice racing game with reasonable  arcade / sim compromise, mostly for those, who plan to play multiplayer. And there we come to the part where I really hate it. Single player is very short. No problem. Switch to multi, where:- you have no way to report cheaters (yep, after couple of years they still haven't dealt with it). So there you are, racing, and suddenly one accellerates from 100 to 300 withing 0.5 sec. kicking you out. Nice, right?- then there are Touge races, with absurd disqualification rules. Being hit from left/right -> OK . Slowing down before corner and being hit from behind -> DQ. Hitting the wall, spinning and being hit -> DQ.I like the game but because it was never finished, I will never ever buy anything from this publisher. End of story. Back to Assetto Corsa			"

												THis game has its problems with Windows 10. It is standard racing as so many others, and as this is the case, there is a logical conclusion considering the trouble it causes to get it to run, i.e. not to recommend it at any rate. It can take a lot of time to adjust the GPU to GRID 2, what should be done automatically and correctly, but isn't on Windows 10. Asking the developers, they do not intend to make a patch. After a while, even if the GPU is fine with Windows 10 then, the sound may still be stuttering and terribly irritating,  kind of terror for the ears. As has been said before, there are a lot of very similar games out there. Better catching those.			"

												So I noticed today that GRID 2 was free on steam for the next two days. I haven't played any racing games in a while, and figured I would give this one a shot. So after waiting for it to download, and the lengthy load time - I see a cut scene of chicago that takes like 3 minutes to run through, until it finally zoomed into the car and then froze. Had to try to CTRL+ALT+DEL and kill the task, which did not work. It still said it was opened and froze everything on that monitor, thankfully I have two monitors. I get my computer to the point I see that everything else I try to open freezes as well and it will not kill the task, so it looks like restarting the system is my only option. Tell my system to restart and the windows restart comes up, and tells me that it needs to force steam (grid) to close. Fine. System restart then locks up as well. Ugh, this is the first game to freeze my system in well over a year. I think to myself, well that was annoying glitch, lets try this again. GOD DAMMIT SAME THING HAPPENS. 20 minutes later, I think I'm just uninstalling this bad boy. Kudos to being the first game to ever lock up my system so horribly though.			"

												Grid 2 is an excellent and diverse racing game, I totally recommend it. Pro:- offers way more than 30 hours in the career mode. It features many different race types, such as endurance, time attack, head to head duels etc. There are fie seasons and four different vehicle tiers. As you proress toward world fame, you get vehicle challenges to obtain the more expensive cars. - nice enviroments and car models. They actually break, get damaged and this influences the driving. They are not as detailed as in Forza, but from behind it is fine. There are many locations, both in Europe, Asia and in the USA. - each car drives different. The developers really put the emphasis on car handling. You can feel them, especially through a controller. - Splitscreen mode is really fun. Contra:-no cockpit view!!!- in normal difficulty and above the AI is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. It bumps into you in the corners - and everywhere else -  resulting in a spin out, accelerates to unreal speed if it wants to catch up with you and just before the finish line it goes hardcore and tries to ♥♥♥♥ you up. It was programmed so there is ALWAYS a driver who launches at the start like a russian torpedo, goes on the perfect lines. Then there's the next three driver, who often tend to race in a pack way in front of the rest. Problem is, you start at the very back of each race so going through all these idiots can be not only challenging but often frustrating. - the radio guy is a moron. - car customization isn't deep enough. You can change only the tires, the rest is all about paint and sponsors. - I found only one bug but it was awkward, in Dubai at a night race the ligths started to flash like a strobe and I could barely drive safely because of that. It's a great game with some minor annoying aspects, but mostly these can be solved by setting the difficulty to easy.			"

Makes you feel like you're going fast, even though you'll miss the next corner if you don't know the track. You can switch to hood cam, but then you don't get a visual representation of the smallest bumps in the road which have an IMMENSE effect on the handling of certain cars on certain tracks. So that's not an option either.It also promotes to ignore all techniques you've ever learned, ignore the racing line, ignore braking points, ignore weight shifts and just go flat out all the time and drift around every single corner. Using proper techniques will make you go slower. But if you have a track in the mountains suddenly you have to keep in mind how driving uphill and downhill has an effect on the weight shifts and steering which is really hard compared to the NFS-style of racing you had used in the previous race. And in those races all of a sudden 1 wheel on the grass means guaranteed spin-out. This game can't decide whether it's a serious racing game or not and this inconsistency makes the difficult races much more difficult then they need to be. Both the sim races and the arcade races are fun, but it's not fun if you can't tell in advance what you'll get, can't pick a car to suit that style of race and you have to flip a switch and drive differently. Especially if the enemies keep trying to do PIT manoeuvres on you. They'll even ram you during a Drift event which makes no sense.Another strange inconsistency is the track times you need to finish first. If you finish in say 2 minutes flat you might win the one time, but the next time you play the same races you might encounter much faster enemies and you'll have to do it 5 seconds quicker. If it's random, what's the point of having to be first? Just give us a set time goal. AI aggressiveness is random as well.The Flashback option is confusing. You can use it quite a bit and then suddenly not anymore, so use it wisely because there is no way to tell how long or how often you can use it. Sometimes you can use it 8 times, but it's also been disabled after about 3 uses. The game tells you it exists and what key activates it in the very first race and then no more information ever. Maybe so it stays a bit of a gamble.All in all... It's usually fun, it's random, it's aggressive, it's adrenaline filled, if you don't care about it being a little unfair at times (scripted crashes happen in front of you, AI tries to murder you) and don't take racing too seriously you'll probably like this. Personally I still like TOCA 3 a lot better. It doesn't have better mechanics, but at least it's not all randomness and I didn't have to follow a career path that suits a very boring story. If this game would have been consistent and if they would have made a proper hood camera I would have loved this, but they made it unnecessarily frustrating. The physics and vehicles are mostly awesome, but the rest seems rushed. Most people will like it I think, this is how race games often are nowadays.			"

												To be honest i didn't play grid 1, so i don't know what was there.GRID 2 should change name on RAGE 2, if you play with no experienced players.Why? Because everyone will hit you and after it you will do some 360 on the road, and you will be last in race.i recommend this game for calm people, who like fast races!			"

												Do you know what's great about realistic driving physics and traction?Well this game doesn't. FOR EXAMPLE: race a car in a normal race, then drive it in a drift style race. AND VOILA! They are tuned exactly the same. Just loose enough to make it insanely obnoxious in a race, yet too tight to make it feel natural in a drift competition. why!? That's how it's done in real life, oh, and let alone IN THE ORIGINAL FRACKING GAME! great graphics, but not even a driver perspective camera. I give this game 1-ply toilet paper/10			"

												So I noticed today that GRID 2 was free on steam for the next two days. I haven't played any racing games in a while, and figured I would give this one a shot. So after waiting for it to download, and the lengthy load time - I see a cut scene of chicago that takes like 3 minutes to run through, until it finally zoomed into the car and then froze. Had to try to CTRL+ALT+DEL and kill the task, which did not work. It still said it was opened and froze everything on that monitor, thankfully I have two monitors. I get my computer to the point I see that everything else I try to open freezes as well and it will not kill the task, so it looks like restarting the system is my only option. Tell my system to restart and the windows restart comes up, and tells me that it needs to force steam (grid) to close. Fine. System restart then locks up as well. Ugh, this is the first game to freeze my system in well over a year. I think to myself, well that was annoying glitch, lets try this again. GOD DAMMIT SAME THING HAPPENS. 20 minutes later, I think I'm just uninstalling this bad boy. Kudos to being the first game to ever lock up my system so horribly though.			"

												Too slippery.No matter what car you chose and the road and weather conditions, your car will slide. The handling hardly differs between cars other than the fact that some are heavier than others. I wish they had put more work in realisticly simulating tire traction.There is absolutely no incentive to play the game in story more since you don't earn cash or rack up points towards unlocking cars. I hear there's an actual incentive to play the game online, but the servers are empty and no one's there.			"

												After I played this game for 5 months since lauch in the first day, here's what I gotGood :1. Graphics Optimization = Graphics is looks good and run great even in low settings and it's laptop friendly. my 3 years old laptop can still run this with Low-Mid settings.2. Pretty good online mode = It's great and fun to play in my opinion (if it doesn't have the terrible drivers who hit me in the first corner and annoying voice chat.)3. Variety of cars = a lot of car selection to drive.4. LiveRoutes system.5. Soundtracks.Bad :1. Cockpit camera view is missing. and this is the huge mistake.2. Too overpriced DLCs3. No text chat in online mode.4. Terrible replay cameras. and it's had the worst replays camera compared to all Codemasters racing games in the past.5. Career Mode (Can't create the team name, no teammate system, race to earn the ""fans"" ?)6. Le Mans 24 hours event is missing.7. Drift events is terrible and so boring compared to the first GRID. (and the freestyle drift and full-lap drift mode is missing too. only point-to-point drift.)8. A.I. in Single Player are too rude especially in Season 5 even you set it on medium difficulty.GRID 2 is still the fun and enjoyable racing games with the variety of cars, beautiful scenary and mix of challenges. but if compared this to the first Race Driver : GRID, this is the dissappointment sequel because a lot of great feature that in the first game doesn't featured in this sequel.7/10(Sorry for my bad english skill and grammar.)

												I will give this title a fair rating and even though i liked the play through there are some cons that can not be overlooked.- Fanboys seem to downvote anything negative. Just same as COD or Miscreated, it destroys a fair trial- Overimpressive physics: Or did you think you can give a car a 13 times side spin when hitting the wall in Hong kong before touching the ground. Also whenever you hit the side, Rocks won't stop you but signs can send you flinging around. - Sloppy controls: My G27 wheel and my Xbox controller show 15°+ dead angle, which is nowadays impossible in cars.   If there is a game where it does not matter what you use to play with, then this one.- Drifting mechanic: Some cars just will slide like crazy and others stick to the ground like Carrera cars and still it has nothing to do with aerodynamics, weight or which wheel is driven.- Generally funny behaivor of actual super cars that have to go slower in corners than a 40 year old car, specially seen at the Koenigsegg Agrea R, which is plain unraceable (similar to Testdrive 2)- Repetetive Tracks with around 12 Locations, where many corners got copied several times (Chicago, Miami, ...)- Too expensive DLCs with mostly only slightly tuned cars from those which are already in. Any DLC car can be ignored for racing either in carreer or online. - Unfair competition as the AI seem not to care or see the player and rams it, sending only the player to fling around or being highly damaged.- AI seem not to compete with each other and does only change the average speed with different setting but not the actual skill.- Online multiplayer is already quite deadHere some good stuff:+ Acknowledged my G27 racing wheel but only with semi automatic+ Lovely made cars and generally good graphics+ Story mode feels very tempting and rewarding+ No endless trials thanks to time line, variable difficulty, run backs, no economy,...+ Split screen multiplayer is getting rare nowadaysAnyway get this on sale without DLCs then you can enjoy some hours, as this is one of the never ending arcarde racers that can really be a pain once you'll get to it's end.

												Jumping in to this right on the trail of completing Grid 1 took a little getting used to. This is not the same game as the original, It feels completely different. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, this is a very competent and fun racing game. The handling model is a lot more arcade based to the point where you mostly drift round corners even in grip class cars. This is sometimes fun to just sling your car round a corner but sometimes it can be frustrating with cars often sliding out of contol and straight into a wall. Where this game really shines is the design, this game is visually stunning and the audio for the cars is great. You can take some amazing screenshots of this game on nearly any track. It does still let you down in some bits like having no cockpit cam and the voice over constantly yapping in your ear can get very annoying, thankfully both these problems can be altered with mods. To me this game was just as good as the last and I was surprised to find it as good as I did after hearing countless people tell me it was crap. 8.5/10			"

												I will give this title a fair rating and even though i liked the play through there are some cons that can not be overlooked.- Fanboys seem to downvote anything negative. Just same as COD or Miscreated, it destroys a fair trial- Overimpressive physics: Or did you think you can give a car a 13 times side spin when hitting the wall in Hong kong before touching the ground. Also whenever you hit the side, Rocks won't stop you but signs can send you flinging around. - Sloppy controls: My G27 wheel and my Xbox controller show 15°+ dead angle, which is nowadays impossible in cars.   If there is a game where it does not matter what you use to play with, then this one.- Drifting mechanic: Some cars just will slide like crazy and others stick to the ground like Carrera cars and still it has nothing to do with aerodynamics, weight or which wheel is driven.- Generally funny behaivor of actual super cars that have to go slower in corners than a 40 year old car, specially seen at the Koenigsegg Agrea R, which is plain unraceable (similar to Testdrive 2)- Repetetive Tracks with around 12 Locations, where many corners got copied several times (Chicago, Miami, ...)- Too expensive DLCs with mostly only slightly tuned cars from those which are already in. Any DLC car can be ignored for racing either in carreer or online. - Unfair competition as the AI seem not to care or see the player and rams it, sending only the player to fling around or being highly damaged.- AI seem not to compete with each other and does only change the average speed with different setting but not the actual skill.- Online multiplayer is already quite deadHere some good stuff:+ Acknowledged my G27 racing wheel but only with semi automatic+ Lovely made cars and generally good graphics+ Story mode feels very tempting and rewarding+ No endless trials thanks to time line, variable difficulty, run backs, no economy,...+ Split screen multiplayer is getting rare nowadaysAnyway get this on sale without DLCs then you can enjoy some hours, as this is one of the never ending arcarde racers that can really be a pain once you'll get to it's end.

												I've played Race Driver: GRID (the first one) for a pretty long time. Even though GRID 2 is a lot of fun, the mutation into a 100% arcade-racer is kinda sad. Drift-Races with my buddies at the docks without any electronical help and with your cockpit-view won't be possible anymore. Still like I've said - the game itself is fun and worth any buck - but don't expect a new generation version of the first GRID.			"

												Jumping in to this right on the trail of completing Grid 1 took a little getting used to. This is not the same game as the original, It feels completely different. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, this is a very competent and fun racing game. The handling model is a lot more arcade based to the point where you mostly drift round corners even in grip class cars. This is sometimes fun to just sling your car round a corner but sometimes it can be frustrating with cars often sliding out of contol and straight into a wall. Where this game really shines is the design, this game is visually stunning and the audio for the cars is great. You can take some amazing screenshots of this game on nearly any track. It does still let you down in some bits like having no cockpit cam and the voice over constantly yapping in your ear can get very annoying, thankfully both these problems can be altered with mods. To me this game was just as good as the last and I was surprised to find it as good as I did after hearing countless people tell me it was crap. 8.5/10			"

 Positive + With a different career experience this time ‘round, the more story-focused single-player feels a lot more fleshed out than its predecessor. Feeling like a driving personality rather than a member of a team makes the solo experience much more memorable and charming. Clocking in at around 11 hours, the career mode is easily long enough to satisfy gamers who enjoy a bit of character with their driving experience+ Again, just like the first game, the handling strikes the perfect balance between simulation and arcade. While I will admit there is a bit more of a learning curve when it comes to oversteering (especially when it comes to drift events), and less customisation when it comes to driving assists, there’s still no denying that the driving is as fun as ever+ Different to the first game however, this game seems to focus a bit more on street circuits, as a lot of the newly added tracks take place in city streets rather than strictly closed-off racing circuits. This does give the game a slightly more arcade aesthetic than the previous game, but for me it didn’t really detract from the experience at all (though people who prefer simulation games may be put off by this)+ Compared to its predecessor, the graphics here are a definite step up. Every positive graphical aspect that was in the first game has been touched up and been given even more polish (though the bloom effect is a tad excessive). Negative - While the game does have a lengthy career, compared to the first game, there is a noticeable lack of variety in the courses. While the game does add a good amount of new tracks, it also reuses quite a lot from the previous game, which does hurt the total amount of different and unique tracks that you can race on- The same audio problem that existed in the first game is still present here, in terms of the in-game dialogue getting boring and repetitive. If that was an issue for you before, not much has changed unfortunately (though I do prefer the voice actor more so this time around). Worth Mentioning • Codemasters decided to remove the in-car view in this entry of the series. Personally, I have never used this view in a driving game, so the absence of this did not phase me at all. However, if you are the sort of person who does play their driving games using that view, then you will be disappointed in this aspect (though there is a community mod that adds an in-car view if you want to check that out first). Verdict “Just like its predecessor, GRID 2 is another highly enjoyable and fun racing game. While some people may be put off by the game feeling more arcade-like than the first one, for me, it didn’t deter me from playing the game at all. Another great driving experience!” 8.5/10 TJBs  "

												I'm very disappointed by this game. But first the good parts:- graphics are quite good and the game runs smoohly on my low-end gaming notebook- sound is quite good too- controls and drifts are quite nice. you have to get used to it I guess. It's challenging, but doable.Bad parts- no story (except ""ok, go drive and make fame"")- no characters (except their voices.. but you never ever see a human being but the crowds behind their fences)- rewind option. you need this a lot. every time an opponent hits you you have a 50% change to do a 180 turn. And the feature is no fun at all. You think undoing your failures makes the game more entertaining? no, it doesn't. you get a second chance and screw up again -> rewind -> try again. yay...- menu. there's not much wrong with the menu, but there's just so much clutter and so many confirmation dialogs you'll learn to confirm without even thinking about it.- no tuning (in career)- no freakin' camera view of the car while painting it or changing the wheels?! (the only parts you can change) REALLY?! i tried mouse, the race-view keys. NADA. how am i supposed to chose a paint without seeing the FKin car?			"

												I know I've only played a tiny portion of the game at just 10 hours, but I am confident I can give it a glowing review right this split second.It's amazing. Absolutely, truly. A real finisher!This is coming from someone who has stayed away from racing games for the better portion of the last 25 years. Why? Because I hate 'timers' in games... and what is a race? mostly timers! However this game may have some timers (the checkpoint races I 'just' started are a bit annoying), they are in no way abusive like how 'other' games do timers. So here I am feeling stupid and sheepish for staying away from racing games due to that. ANYHOW...There is so much variety in this. Different kinds of races and events and locations. So many different kinds of cars, some of which I have quickly found suck (I'm looking at you crystler and mazda)! While some are just so in sync with me that I'm ripping up the events (oh my volkswagon I'm in love)! Its just great.To top it all off, this game absolutely roars on my system. I have that 144hz monitor, and this game never hitches a single frame off 144fps at max detail. Its absolutely gorgeous and smooth, making it so intense I feel like I'm there! I began playing in the 3rd person behind the car mode, because I had wanted to see my car and others nearby. But then I switched to hoodcam (where you see the hood), and my effectivity increased insanely... I was drifting tight corners and barely running into anything. It was night and day. Its awesome the game has the choice! Some games force you to their way or the highway, no pun intended.If you dont already have this game, and even if you are not a racing game fan... I say get this. Its a blast!			"

												OK, so let me tell you about the one aspect of GRID 2 that was irritating enough for me to stop playing it for a few weeks, and then when I came back to it, irritating enough, again, to uninstall it for good.I am well aware that pretty much every racing game uses ""tournament"" modes to prolong gameplay hours.That's fine with me.But GRID 2 takes that concept to a ridiculous level.You have the Touge and Faceoff ""tournaments"".Here's how they work:You need to win a 1-on-1 race. Three times in a row. On the SAME EXACT TRACK.I will not really even try to explain here why this is NOT a tournament mode, but merely a ""hey, you know what's fun? beating the same race, three times in a row"" brainfart of an idea someone came up with at a design meeting and walked away really proud of themselves.So yes, I'm thumbing this game down in my review because of this very idea, which in my personal opinion, completely broke the otherwise nearly-perfect arcade racer for me.

												The vehicle control dynamics are certainly different from many other racing games. Someone stated in previous comments,  that it's a lot like driving around in a snow. And it kind of is, sometimes. One of the main reasons I'm stuck playing this game is that it's challanging. Along with great graphics, good variety of locations and wide vehicle selection.			"

												As a professional racing driver I got this game due to being injured in a high speed race, which I won. I thought I was going to miss all the excitement of the track being injured, but this game has me drifting and overtaking like a pro again. I highly recommend the game, if you are playing and hear a whoosh sound whizzing past you, thats me....			"

												Just bought on special, wish I had not bothered. I am sure if you stick with it you can get some enjoyment out of it, but for me I if dont gel with the experience fairly rapidly its all over and after half hour fannying about with it, I hate it.Such as, jumps you right into a race, no chance to check your options for graphics etc, which I find pretty weird to be honest, so I had to wait untl the 'it takes forever' intros and long winded cut scenes at the start of the game/race, none of which I managed to avoid or kill, then wait for the race to start, and then pause the race just to modify options such as resolutions, vsync etc...very crappy...Controls, supremely crappy, its way way way, way, too slippy out there, and I play Dirt 3 so I dont mind some drifting, but this was just ridiculous, and of course, at this stage (dont know if you can later on) there is no obvious way to modify the vehicle setup so you can at least try to get it to work with the way you like drive in game.Other stuff that started to annoy me, what a load of long winded blah blah blah from the commentary about how you can youtube your progress and how awesome you are, blah blah blah blah, blah blah blah, no obvious way to stop it in game, I just wanted to say please please just shut up and sod off, an option to just cut past the scene/voiceover by pressing esc or something would be fantastic, but couldnt find one and kept pressing any buttons on my controller and keyboard in the hope could kill the story teller. Also I didnt do the raceday, which you are offered right after doing the first race, and being told how awesome you are even if you ♥♥♥♥ it up, and despite this, the game still behaved like I had done it, and numbed me yet again with some more background chat and story telling blah blah blah, blah blah blah, for gods sake please please please shut up and go away...Ooh and of course theres the crashing, and I dont mean into other cars, I mean program, just stops working and you find yourself dumped back out onto your desktop...Theres just so much i dislike about this experience at the outset that I just dont want to play it again, I could probably get used to all the drifting, but whats the point, I may as well just play a rally style game, and I just cant bear the thought of having to go through all that mind numbing commentary, what an utter waste of cash and an hour of my time...and did I mention it crashes too? Maybe autosport is better, i dont know, but im not wasting my cash on it to find out.Some folks obviously get on ok with this game and enjoy it, not for me though...I should have spent the cash on a mighty bucket for one...Ive requested a refund as I just cannot bring myself to try it again...

												Racing games are a huge past time for me. growing up with ones like gran turismo, forza, wipeout, yadda yadda yadda. Grid 2 is not one i will put on this list. i got it because i ghave been looking for a decent pc racer  and damn she sure does look beautiful. BUT, the gameplay and over mechanics and feel behind the car while driving is so incredibly lackluster and poorly engineered it had me yelling at my screen through every turn i took. it seems they spent more time on things like motion blur and unneccesary camera angles instead of what makes a driving game fun....how the $%^&-ing car actually drives. save your money, dont buy it. steam, get forza already!!

												One my favourite racing simulators, that plays and looks amazing via Windows OS 8 using DirectX 11Only really bad part is, it's uses CodeMasters own network for all sync/on-line stuff and not Steam, which is rather slow, but worst of all it only uses Facebook rubbish and no Google+ connectivity, which is awful, but avoidable at least.The above issues are also found in F1 Race Stars, which is equally brilliant, but also plagued by the same issues!*2/3* - One mark lost for rubbish network usage and very limiting connectivity options			"

												No, my screen name was not based off this game. It never was or is. My recent interests in cars and all that further makes my screen name fitting, but that wasn't the original intent.Grid 2 is decent. It starts off strong. Amazing intro, right into action, with orchestrated and epic soundtrack pulsing as you pound the track in an old Mustang. Your handler can say your first name, out loud, from a list of common names. He says cool things while you're cornering... Heads up on collisions, or remembers that you need to work on sector 3 of the track. The damage effects are bland but get the job done. The graphics are fantastic. The style of the game is awesome. But it gets entirely bland about as fast as the races become.Grid doesn't know what it wants to be. You get Drift events, Japanese Domestics everyone loves like the Silvia and Fairlady Z.... You get some muscle... You get a slathering of European, German... And then suddenly, karts. Boring ♥♥♥♥ing Formula style cars. I hate the British love of motorsports with a passion. It has no soul. It has 0 anything interesting. It's boring and lame. And little Caterhams are ugly, and boring. Sadly, Grid 2 loves the British take on motorsports... And quickly the awesome Chicago, Miami and Curvey Japanese tracks give way to ugly, bland boring night time race-maps... They offer you a Jaguar, the almighty SLS AMG of course, the most boring and ugly Mclaren, and most European only vehicles by the time you're in Tier 3... But good luck winning any races if you do not pick the stupid karts to race alongside them. That is a gigantic slap in the face. I like racing to be a test of REAL road cars and what a man or woman can do within a realistic, mostly every-day type vehicle. Track-only specific cars are ugly, boring, and honestly in my opinion an extremely lame lifestyle to pursue if that is your interest. And that's the issue. Grid 2 can't decide whether it wants you in the grounded, fun street race-style cars or in full on boring F1 style races. And in the middle it forces you to put both on the table at the same time, much to frustration and misery as one of the obnoxious AI is 6 seconds ahead of you in his little lame kart because you wanted to break the back-end out on the Jaguar. +Starts off strong+Fun handling and racing in the first 2 tiers+Great graphics+Epic soundtrack+A great overall presentation-Turns into F1 style kart racing quickly-Puts Caterham track karts agains full sedans in Tier 3, creating a gigantic rift-Forces you to drive karts to win-Tiniest selection of vehicles, a smattering of some greats, with little to no character-Lush lighting and car visuals give way to the ugliest track renders I've ever seen outside of the Japanese, Chicago and Miami tracks...-Can't decide whether you should drift, or keep it tight, the handling model in the game appears to give up and surprises you on every corner.In terms of the whole package i'd say the game is a solid 6/10. Great graphics, great racing. The ""car culture"" style is nowhere to be found... Sterile and as dull as a doctors office... The game swerves from a great showing to Formula 1 style quick, sapping the fun and life out of the genre while beating laptimes over your head. Blech. "

												One of the best arcade racing games I've ever played. With a gaympad. I don't understand how people play arcade racers with wheels but that's just me.Despite all its problems/omissions/dlc overload mentioned in other reviews.But all those dlcs begs the question - where the sexual intercourse is cockpit dlc?!Warning: Random public multiplayer lobbies may contain individuals more toxic than Adolf Hitler in April 1945.So if you're new into multiplayer pc games and don't have enough (e-)friends to play with, be prepared for possible occurence of some really sad, pathetic cheaters and griefers going full-re-turd.But from my experience, most players are just fine and won't intentionally ram you like brainless morons.Yeah, and there are some obvious balancing issues which from some unexplicable *cough*lazy devs*cough* have never been fixed - in each tier, a few cars are objectively much faster/better, so I'd suggest you read some guides before spending your in-game currency.

Steams ""opposite of the customer is always right"" no-return policy should come with a ""publishers need to be responsive to bug reports"" policy. Codemasters most recent update on the thread is September.Let the buyer beware.

												From the people who package you understeer and oversteer, we present you all supercars in Grid 2. Nevertheless I'd reccomend this game IF it is on sale. For the $10 I spent on it I think it was completely worth the money, however I cannot see myself forking over $30 for it. The game is very well put together, I especially like that you actually have to use the brakes unlike in Forza Horizon, however it loses some points from me on the car selection. There are some cars I really would have liked to see in this game that I have not seen yet, such as the Audi R8 and the Lamborghini Gallardo. That being said I did not finish the main game yet, I just started the final season. Another small hit the game will take from me is the test drive because there is only one track you can drive on, it is not a major issue but I would have liked to have seen one or two more tracks. The last thing negative about the game is not the makers fault. The online community seems to be dead, everytime I try to play an online race I wait for a while before the game tells me it could not find any online races. Despite the few drawbacks the game is very fun and recommended.			"

												Months after release, the most active forum thread is one in which the screen keeps flashing black. Seems to mostly affect NVidia GPUs. Unfortunately, it affected me.  Steams ""opposite of the customer is always right"" no-return policy should come with a ""publishers need to be responsive to bug reports"" policy. Codemasters most recent update on the thread is September.Let the buyer beware. This game, even at sale price, is not worth it.[Edit: 10 months later (October, 2014), the issue is now pinned to the top of the discussion board, with dozens of possible work-arounds, but no firm solution or answer from the Developers]			"

												GRID 2 is a racing game that rewards skill without punishing you for the tiniest mistakes, letting you master a simple system with a forgiving attitude. It may stray too close towards the easy side of the scale at times, and it'll be interesting to see how the game works online (which unfortunately wasn't tested in this review), but its career mode is well worth playing and you won't be satisfied until you've mastered every single corner.85/100			"

												I found this purchase to be a difficult one as a lot of people bad mouth the game for not being a sim or for not having a cockpit view, Then procede to unfairly dismiss the rest of the game due to their inability to do some research before they purchase a game.I have found the game to be great fun so far, the presentation is a little over the top, but that is something codemasters have been doing since DIRT 3.The cars handle well, with a good feel of weight vs. power,  powersliding is a lot of fun, the AI is a little plain but it fills it's roll well.Engine sounds are fantastic, ambient noise is somewhat lacking, but the squeal of steel on steel as you trade paint with competitors is good and tire screech is well done. The graphics are fantastic and optimised well, with some great smoke effects from tires as you push your car through corners, some of the best reflections on cars I have seen.After reading all the mixed reviews, I waited for a sale on steam and it was definatly worth the $11 on sale, I would have paid the $30 they ask when it's not on sale, if not for so many negative reviews from disgruntled sim fan boys.If you like car games at all, I recommend you add this to your game list.I would give this an 89 out of 100. GREAT FUN.			"

												Tried online mode first. You can create an account and start customizing a car. There are no opponents, you can't race against anyone. No sessions to join, creating a session leaves you sitting by yourself in the lobby.On to career mode:Handling/controls are terrible. ""Drifting"" often results in the car flinging out of control, even at low speeds.My second career race: Shortly after starting the second lap (of 4) I passed an opponent and then in a turn my right front tire exploded. Due to the horrid camera controls (or lack thereof) I could not see the extent of the damage, only being notified by the lack of being able to turn left and the sparks flying off the ground. When the race ended it turned out that my entire wheel was gone, not just the rubber. When I started the final lap (now in second place) the announcer or whatever finally told me about the missing tire.Finished in second.Third career race: things are going well, we're 3 laps in and I've managed to just pass a vehicle into second place. About 10 seconds later I go to take a turn, only to be rammed by the guy I passed. His car stopped about where the impact occurred and he quickly drove away with minor damage. My car spun around fully and stopped in reverse. Got turned around and get rammed again, this time my car went flying into a wall and stopped abruptly. The car that hit me had no ill effects and just kept driving. Now I'm in 7th place. Get going again and I lose control of the vehicle. Slam into wall and car explodes.Done with this game			"

												Game was unplayable due to constant stuttering, even after setting graphics to all low and getting 150+ fps. Was able to fix the issue by deleting replay30.pbf and replay60.pbf and replacing them with blank read-only text files. Before that nothing helped, not even a clean OS install. After that the game worked fine, but I can't give a positive review to a game that does something like that, and caused a huge amount of frustration before I managed to fix it.

General GameplayGRID 2 is the sequel to the BAFTA-award winning, multi-million selling Race Driver: GRID.What disappoints overall is the single-player experience, lots of content was removed and changed.The Multi-Player experience is still alive unlike the first game (servers were closed), but it's full with kids and cheaters, it's only enjoyable with a group of mature friends.As an arcade car game it's awesome, as a Race Driver: GRID sequel it's disappointing, if you want a Race Driver: GRID experience look at Grid: Autosport instead.The DLCs make it a minus too, considering some cars are locked under a paywall both in Single-Player and Multi-Player!Gameplay Rating: 2/5EngineEGO 3.0Graphics OptionsHas the same set of options has the first game, it's on par with all other games in the market!Graphics QualityThe engine suffered a huge improvement, specially in lightning! The colours feel more natural and the textures have higher quality too (Compared to Race Driver: GRID)!PerformanceA low-end PC can run this game at 60FPS without problems, some tweaking may be involved depending on the hardware!Engine Rating: 5/5Overall Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs).

												Dear AmericaYou produced some very attractive looking vehicles in the form of the Ford Mustang, Dodge Charger and Chevy Camero. However, these vehicles are deeply, deeply awful racing cars. Even the game itself seems to accept this as they handle like the dogs they are. Therefore, why do you insist we have to drive these lumps of pig iron when it is obvious that your European and Japanese allies make much better vehicles? We have McDonalds, Pizza Hut and KFC. Why can you not simply accept that we make better cars and that it is really dumb to make us have to drive these blocks of lard.Thank youLoveEuropeps. nice game			"

												Você está acostumado a jogar alguns jogos de corrida onde os oponentes praticamente entregam suas posições para você e isto lhe parece muito chato ? Tente jogar GRID e não passar raiva por não conseguir nem ultrapassar o oponente mais próximo de você. Certeza que muito reinicios de fase serão necessários que até que consiga pegar as ""manhas"" da corrida e do trajeto. Sem falar em um companheiro chato que fica o tempo todo falando frases que eram para te motivar mas que acabam te deixando com mais raiva ainda. Se eu recomendo ? Claro, mas não como um jogo para aliviar a raiva e sim para te fazer passar raiva.			"

												I managed to complete the game pretty quickly. I liked the progression system that didn't require any money and all the cars were done beautifully. I didn't particularly like the drifiting system compared to the first GRID and drift type cars were a bit difficult to control, however the steering in general was pretty good for a keyboard. Tracks weren't too hard except for one on one races through mountain roads and vehicle challenges on the same roads.. Those were frustraiting at times.			"

												i don't know and i dont care why this game has so many negative reviews by users. ( Probably their expectations were to high). First of all GRID 2 isn't a simulation game. IF you want that, look elsewhere. If you want a fast paced racing, arcade style game then Grid is an excellent choice. It's fun, thrilling and still has great graphics. PIcked up again recently and played for a few hours and i was blown away. Very cool game !			"

												Ever wonder what it's like to powerslide your way to fame? Grid 2's got you covered.This is seriously one of the most arcadey racers I've ever played, and I had bought this and went in expecting a sim a-la Gran Turismo. Initially I was extremely disappointed as a result, but it grew on me. It's frantic fun.If I could compare the driving to any other game, it would be Need for Speed: High Stakes (PC), a callback to 1999 (you know, when NFS games were quality fun). It's fast, the slides are flashy and make you go ""DAAAAAMMMMMN!"", the wrecks are insane and the cars have absolutely no weight to them whatsoever. It literally feels like you're driving a delicate piece of paper where one small bump or wrinkle crumples and destroys the entire paper. It takes quite a while to get used to the driving style, frustratingly so, but give it some time; you'll get there eventually.The career mode is as follows: A new racing organization called the WSR wants to score the big time. Thank ♥♥♥♥ you came along because you're gonna make it happen. As you complete races, fame and faster cars come your way. That's basically about it, but it's fine for a racing game. Who the hell plays a racing game for story, anyway?It's got a decent roster of cars, though its all mostly what you've probably seen in any other racing game; Nissan R34 Skyline and 300ZX, Dodge/SRT Viper GTS, Mazda RX-7, Aerial Atom, Chevrolet Camaro (both old and new), Pagani Huayra just to name a few.One of my biggest complaints is that there is NO customization for any of the cars in terms of performance. What you see is what you get. Perhaps it's my fault for, again, expecting a racing sim, so maybe I just can't let that go, but it would've still been fun have the option. The only thing you can customize is the car's livery. You can do them individually for each car or use the same one for every car; the choice is yours.There are several different types of racing events, including but not limited to: standard circuit (WHOA! Who would've thought?!), checkpoint challenge, knockout, drift and ""face off"" which is basically a one-on-one duel. There's enough variety to keep things from getting too stale.The controls are nice and responsive, almost too much so, and controller support is great; my PS3 controller and Logitech F310 work fantastic. Game client is stable; no crashes at all. On very rare occasions I get small frame drops in particularly intensive situations but anyone with a higher-end card shouldn't have an issue with that (I would assume most of you aren't using a decade old card like a GeForce 8800 GTS like my broke ♥♥♥). And even with that considered, the drops are incredibly rare.If you're looking for the ultimate arcade racer in modernized form, Grid 2's worth checking out.			"

												Ah yes, GRID 2. I just got this game, and I fell in love with it as soon as I got it. Want to hear my full story about it? Read down. If not, then just read this TL;DR: I love it, it has a easy learning curve, and the DLC cars are amazing. Graphics look great, even on low. Nice buy.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As I was browsing Steam, I came upon some sales. I was happy because I had just recently been given a $20 Steam Gift Card for my birthday, so I knew that I may be able to snag a sweet deal on some game. So, being me, the first category I checked was Simulation. I found a few deals on some games but they didn't appeal to my style, so I left those. I decided to see if the Racing category had any sales. Checking the Specials, I scrolled down and saw a game called ""GRID"" and GRID 2"". They were both on for $8.89, and GRID 2 with all the DLC was on for a great deal of $13.39. I was intrigued by this game, so I decided to take a look. The reivews made the game look promising, although a few negatives would pop up here and there, complaining of ""rubber-necking AI', which that terminolgy is completely wasted on me. I decided to watch a few videos on it, and it looks great. Like Need For Speed, but just a tad more realistic with the breakable meshes and no nitrous boosts. Gladly, I forked over $13 and began my descent into GRID.I honestly have never played a racing game as great as this. I've only played for a few hours, well not even hours but I absolutely adore this game. Everything is very smooth in the way it runs, and the way the gameplay works exhilrates you and makes you feel like you're fighting to win these championships. I really enjoy this game and I can't wait to rack up hours on it.My ratings:Gameplay: 4/5 or 8/10 IN DEPTH ANALYSIS Car Models: 4.5/10 or 9/10 Sound Quality: 2/5 or 4/10 (most likely CPU) Track Quality: 3/5 or 6/10 AI Quality: 4/5 or 8/10 Overall Diffculty:5/5 or 10/10 ( You'll crash a lot :) ) GUI: 3/5 or 6/10Story: N/APros and Cons are kind of overrated, so just take my ratings and see if you'll enjoy this little game. It's great, and with the DLCs it makes the game more open and easier and relaxing, but with the challenging start and getting back into the racing category it's kind of hard for me.But I'll get there.

												Ah yes, GRID 2. I just got this game, and I fell in love with it as soon as I got it. Want to hear my full story about it? Read down. If not, then just read this TL;DR: I love it, it has a easy learning curve, and the DLC cars are amazing. Graphics look great, even on low. Nice buy.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As I was browsing Steam, I came upon some sales. I was happy because I had just recently been given a $20 Steam Gift Card for my birthday, so I knew that I may be able to snag a sweet deal on some game. So, being me, the first category I checked was Simulation. I found a few deals on some games but they didn't appeal to my style, so I left those. I decided to see if the Racing category had any sales. Checking the Specials, I scrolled down and saw a game called ""GRID"" and GRID 2"". They were both on for $8.89, and GRID 2 with all the DLC was on for a great deal of $13.39. I was intrigued by this game, so I decided to take a look. The reivews made the game look promising, although a few negatives would pop up here and there, complaining of ""rubber-necking AI', which that terminolgy is completely wasted on me. I decided to watch a few videos on it, and it looks great. Like Need For Speed, but just a tad more realistic with the breakable meshes and no nitrous boosts. Gladly, I forked over $13 and began my descent into GRID.I honestly have never played a racing game as great as this. I've only played for a few hours, well not even hours but I absolutely adore this game. Everything is very smooth in the way it runs, and the way the gameplay works exhilrates you and makes you feel like you're fighting to win these championships. I really enjoy this game and I can't wait to rack up hours on it.My ratings:Gameplay: 4/5 or 8/10 IN DEPTH ANALYSIS Car Models: 4.5/10 or 9/10 Sound Quality: 2/5 or 4/10 (most likely CPU) Track Quality: 3/5 or 6/10 AI Quality: 4/5 or 8/10 Overall Diffculty:5/5 or 10/10 ( You'll crash a lot :) ) GUI: 3/5 or 6/10Story: N/APros and Cons are kind of overrated, so just take my ratings and see if you'll enjoy this little game. It's great, and with the DLCs it makes the game more open and easier and relaxing, but with the challenging start and getting back into the racing category it's kind of hard for me.But I'll get there.

												I love Grid 2, even more since they rolled out the Demolition Derby mode. But be warned, the game does not like the newest video card drivers from Invidia. If you aren't planning on getting the latest Star Wars game, don't download it. The latest driver is making Grid stutter and freeze, and I'm running dual GTX 960's. Hope they come out with a patch or update, because I can't play Grid 2 anymore.			"

												Do you want an honest advice from somebody who knows what he is talking about? The advice is the best you can find and it is very effective! If you are running Windows 10, with the latest updates and a high end graphics card as the nVidia 980, DON'T BUY THIS GAME! It will mess up your computer so bad, if you don't know about computers, you may have to bring your computer to a computer service center and it may stay there for weeks before you get it back. The reason why it is cheap is, it does not run on latest hardware and operating systems properly, and they still want to sell this thing to you anyway to make the last bit of profit. They don't care if it will work or not on your latest PC. Your PC will crash, and if you have read this feedback and if you still buy this game, the crash will only be your responsibility. Don't be fooled when you see this game under the list of compatible games with Windows 10, of course it will be there.The game play is over-rated also. To make things look hard, the controls were made non-linear, meaning that there is no ratio between your input and how the dynamics of the car behaves. This only means that it will be difficult to master this game, in other words, you will not have fun playing the game, you will suffer trying to learn what they are trying to teach you how to play.

												Good game, great graphics with not too high specs required. Sounds is pretty good but seemed roary in cars. It uses a drift to turn mechanics but still has to slow down for corners. I only play in multiplayers as you can upgrade the cars. The single player pretty much like a basic unlocking game with some achievements, specials here and there. Get it on discount like me. Buy DLC only when you play a lot online multiplayer, and beware of carnages in multiplayer.			"

The only bummer is that Codemasters did away with the in car veiw. The sim meets arcade feel that grid 1 had is gone. This is an arcade game like NFS or any other. It's a good game and really fun, but it just lacks the intensity of it's predecessor.			"

												Ok, so I'm not a huge racing game fan. I've never really been into need4speed, gran turismo, project gotham and so on. This probably has a lot to do with a friend who would take great pleasure in showing no mercy to noobs to racing games he'd been playing for months. Getting repeatedly lapped sucked the joy out of most of these games for me. Then I discovered Forza 2, a game that had somehow gone under his radar. And having not lost the will to live whilst playing it I actually got ok at it and played it upto the point when the endurance races begun. Then my friend discovered it and finally here was a racing game that I could beat him at. So the Forza franchise will forever hold a special place in my affections. But sadly Microsoft have not ported any version of Forza to the PC, which sucks.Step up Grid 2. Grid 2 has a feel of Forza about it. It looks beautiful, with graphics that are comparable to Forza 5. It boasts game play that can be exhillerating and infuriating during the same race. It also includes Brands Hatch and two F1 tracks in Yas Marina in the UAE and the Red Bull Ring in Austria. In short I have been looking for a racing game that I can find as enjoyable as I used to Forza. And although Grid 2 lacks the depth of Forza, I have found it every bit as enjoyable in the few short hours that I have played it, and for me there can be no higher praise for a racing game than that.8/10 (would be 9/10 if it was Forza)			"

												Absolutely wonderful. I'm not even done the game, but having played with cars in Tier 3, I can safely say that this game is an absolute blast especially with friends.+Fantastic graphics.+Well optimized. (I have it maxed out at 45-55fps without much fluctuation, so it's smooth!)+Lacking rubberband AI. They're just fast and don't really make mistakes.+No more need for a useless teammate!+Nice, arcade style racing. Oversteering never felt so satisfying.+Soundtrack is pretty bumpin'.+Your steering doesn't lock up at high speeds like some OTHER ""racing games"".+/-A big change from the more simulation oriented GRID 1+/-Lots of DLC cars.+/- Not too many tracks. Enough to be satisfying, and allow racers to learn the tracks.+/-Crashes are sometimes fun to watch when you screw up.-The difficulty can be a pain. Again, the AI makes virtually no mistakes.-AI cars are heavy, making it damn near impossible to wreck them for personal gain.			"

												Don't get me wrong. The game is addictive and if you buy it, you will probably spend a lot of time with it. But there will also be a lot of anger and frustration. I won't mention multiplayer -- find complaints of hacked game servers elsewhere. I consider the Career mode the core part of the game. You haven't played a game untill you have finished the career, right? Now what I hate the most is that the game does not just offer a variety of cars. It forces them on you. You find yourself constantly switching from supercars to musclecars to hypercars to kitcars. No way to get used to anything. Also, don't think you'll get fair competition. There's no way to qualify in front. You always start from somewhere towards the back, where AI drivers are more than willing to bump you out of the track and into the railings every time you get near. There's no protection once they get close. Can you repay them in kind? No. They stick like tanks.Outside the track there's also little to look at. You will win dozens of cars in your career but is there a way do look at them? You can apply intricate colour patterns but there's no way to walk around watch. There's no upgrading until the end of the career. It's all a shame.If you want to race, buy a real racing game!			"

The only bummer is that Codemasters did away with the in car veiw. The sim meets arcade feel that grid 1 had is gone. This is an arcade game like NFS or any other. It's a good game and really fun, but it just lacks the intensity of it's predecessor.			"

												Want a Simulator racing but with a little arcade? Here's your answer. Unless you're a full sim fan, go Grid 1, Assetto Corsa etc. Grid 2 is more towards arcade racing just so you know. Modifying and customizing cars? Just paints, a little bit of vinyl and rims. Nothing like engine etc in campaign. Go online for more fun. Online is basically what we want.			"

												This game is pretty fun, I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys racing games.However it is not without it's flaws:- Some of the cars feel like you're driving on ice most of the time, for example the T4 Mercedes that you get when you haven't levelled up enough to buy T4 cars...- When playing online the community seems hell-bent on screwing you over rather than properly racing.But, overall, a fun racer with good controls and, when you're up against reasonable opponents, you can have some pretty intense races.

												Ah yes, GRID 2. I just got this game, and I fell in love with it as soon as I got it. Want to hear my full story about it? Read down. If not, then just read this TL;DR: I love it, it has a easy learning curve, and the DLC cars are amazing. Graphics look great, even on low. Nice buy.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~As I was browsing Steam, I came upon some sales. I was happy because I had just recently been given a $20 Steam Gift Card for my birthday, so I knew that I may be able to snag a sweet deal on some game. So, being me, the first category I checked was Simulation. I found a few deals on some games but they didn't appeal to my style, so I left those. I decided to see if the Racing category had any sales. Checking the Specials, I scrolled down and saw a game called ""GRID"" and GRID 2"". They were both on for $8.89, and GRID 2 with all the DLC was on for a great deal of $13.39. I was intrigued by this game, so I decided to take a look. The reivews made the game look promising, although a few negatives would pop up here and there, complaining of ""rubber-necking AI', which that terminolgy is completely wasted on me. I decided to watch a few videos on it, and it looks great. Like Need For Speed, but just a tad more realistic with the breakable meshes and no nitrous boosts. Gladly, I forked over $13 and began my descent into GRID.I honestly have never played a racing game as great as this. I've only played for a few hours, well not even hours but I absolutely adore this game. Everything is very smooth in the way it runs, and the way the gameplay works exhilrates you and makes you feel like you're fighting to win these championships. I really enjoy this game and I can't wait to rack up hours on it.My ratings:Gameplay: 4/5 or 8/10 IN DEPTH ANALYSIS Car Models: 4.5/10 or 9/10 Sound Quality: 2/5 or 4/10 (most likely CPU) Track Quality: 3/5 or 6/10 AI Quality: 4/5 or 8/10 Overall Diffculty:5/5 or 10/10 ( You'll crash a lot :) ) GUI: 3/5 or 6/10Story: N/APros and Cons are kind of overrated, so just take my ratings and see if you'll enjoy this little game. It's great, and with the DLCs it makes the game more open and easier and relaxing, but with the challenging start and getting back into the racing category it's kind of hard for me.But I'll get there.

												I love Grid 2, even more since they rolled out the Demolition Derby mode. But be warned, the game does not like the newest video card drivers from Invidia. If you aren't planning on getting the latest Star Wars game, don't download it. The latest driver is making Grid stutter and freeze, and I'm running dual GTX 960's. Hope they come out with a patch or update, because I can't play Grid 2 anymore.			"

												Although this is a game that bases on legal racing, it doesn't have the typical steering guidance system that most games of this type within the genre are expected to have. Instead, it has a raw but smooth steering system that is pleasing to use, even with a keyboard. There is no economy (on carreer mode), but still has a big capability for car customization. And the variety of vehicles and gamemodes that can be unlocked are simply astonishing, giving the player an actual ""personality"" in-game, as he or she will pick the type of vehicle that pleases them the most and the events that they are best at. Also, the graphics, physics and AI give the game a very refined and smooth look, while providing a pleasing challenge to the average racing gamer.9/10			"

												GRID 2 is a great racing game. It has almost anything a racing fan would love in a game.The gameplay is like a normal racing. You go, you brake, you turn. It certainly doesn't get old as I feel like I must keep playing this game for at least 10 hours (I won't though). Very fast paced and the drifts are so satifing.The game looks great also. Every car looks great and you can customize your car to your liking. Any damage done to your car is clearly seen and it can make you sad when it tears your car up.Sound is nice with the sound of engines and pieces of metal when crashing. Soundtrack is good and sets the mode for a fast paced racing game.Would not be a bad buy at full price. (Get it for a good deal right now on Humble Bundle[www.humblebundle.com].

												First i bought Poject cars, thinking that it was the kind of game that i was looking for. But i coulndt drive any of the cars becaouse its a ""simulator"",,, and its everything slippery like hell. So ive got the refund of the game. After 2 days i found GRID2, and its exacty what i was looking for, funny driving game, nice graphics, good and smooth controls, slip screen, diferent gamemodes. Everything that i was looking for. So, for me 10/10 grid2 5/10project cars =/ !!			"

												Grid 2 is what I went to as a racing game fan for the PC because Forza is an Xbox only title. Not only does it offer an expansive and interesting single player campaign with various challenges but it also has a great multiplayer experience. It is always fun to play with friends while online and win or lose- it's always worth the laughs.Would recommend to those who enjoy racing games with a bit of challenge and a lot of fun.			"

												Key problem with the game... it's damn arcade. This game has nothing to do with racing, hitting the racing line correctly, accelerating but not overreving it at start. Absolutely nothing.From my point of view any game that includes drifting and gives reward for it, should be avoided in wide wide circle by real race fans.If you want casual racing, bumper cars so to say... then this is game for you. Younger players will like it as it does not require any skill on easier levels. I however, I'm deeply disapointed. I don't play games on easy settings, so I go for max difficulty and it's just insane that you can't compete with drifting of AI. This is not racing... I repeat, NOT RACING. "

												GRID 2 is great! even though the way to win is unrelisticly drifting round corners it makes for a really good game as its not as heavy as othe rgames of the genre. the only note i have is that it is very hard to play using a keyboard so i suggest using a wheel.			"

												This game is not all about racing, sadly. It's also about gaining fans in fake social networks within the game. As you win more and more races, you gain more fans.I find that this whole ""let's get our popularity up"" game gets in the way of the racing game. You even get videos about how many fans you gained post-race... after each and every single race. The sponsor deals are all about gaining fans, too.The game makes a nice attempt at immersion by giving you a garage. In said garage you can go browse your in-game computer to see which races to go on next, you can paint your rides and stuff. All of this browsing is done through the most uncomfortable menus ever, since they were made for consoles. So yeah, no mouse pointer, no way of picking the last choice without browsing through them all and so on.GRID 2 also forces you to wait through shiny animations in the menus and in between actions. For example if I know I'm looking for the third option in a menu, I can't click the down arrow three times for it to be selected until it has finished popping up said menu. I feel tied of hands.But to top it off, this game is a DLC fest. You choose a car category and half the cars are locked out because they're DLC cars. That's the most horrible thing they could have done.The racing itself is flawfree though. It's up to you if you wanna endure the popularity contest stuff and the clunky menus and all the crap for the sake of it.			"

I only play in multiplayers as you can upgrade the cars. The single player pretty much like a basic unlocking game with some achievements, specials here and there. Get it on discount like me. Buy DLC only when you play a lot online multiplayer, and beware of carnages in multiplayer.			"

I didn't particularly like the drifiting system compared to the first GRID and drift type cars were a bit difficult to control, however the steering in general was pretty good for a keyboard. Tracks weren't too hard except for one on one races through mountain roads and vehicle challenges on the same roads.. Those were frustraiting at times.			"

												Decent enough racing game if you have never played Forza or Gran Turismo. They simply took the physics of DIRT and applied it to road cars instead. As you can imagine that doesn't really work too well once you get into supercars. AI is, quite simply, braindead. They do not react to player presence on the track in any way and in the event of any contact the player is screwed. AI vehicles appear to have the defensive abilities of tanks whereas you are sent flying at a mean look. The vehicles all look nice and the environment is kind of pretty but this game is only really worth it if you get it at a steep discount.			"

												i have played grid 2 for a while now and  i am really enjoying the game which is why i hope to buy it realitively soon. now there are a lot of dlcs but a lot of reallyy good cars are unlocked within the game like a nissan gtr which is great for people who dont like the dlc cars but hey the option is out there. the game itself is really hard to control on a keyboard so i recommend using a controller to improve the game experience i found this incredibly useful and now i get first and second place nearly on my first try. this game is probably one of the greatest racing games i have played in a long time and i recommend it to any new players of racing games.

												A brilliant follow-up to GRID. If you are looking for an exciting fast-paced arcade racer, then you'll not get better than this. With stunning visuals and a well formed storyline, yeah, you read right, storyline; GRID 2 delivers on all levels. Right from the get-go the Tier1 cars are all pretty solid and fun to drive and the races are varied and interesting. Progression through the tiers as you slowly ramp up the World Series Racing is engaging and fun. With some top cars, exciting moments and great battles, you'll remember the races for a while. Especially as you can record them and upload to YouTube from right in the game...and that's just the single player! Not even taking into account RaceNet and the world of online competition and rivalries you can setup along with global challenge races, I'm hopeful that it will continue to deliver for quite some time.A beautiful, fun and exciting arcade racer. A solid 9.5/10 from me			"

												Grid 2 is very similar to the original grid, but maintains all the problems with the first one and adds quite a few new ones.Biggest overall issue, car handling. Its very difficult and frustrating to play any driving game where the handling is poor, and this game has some of the worst. Every car snaps loose multiple times every race. Not just breaking a bit loose and having to oversteer to correct, but snapping loose, losing control constantly. Even the front wheel drive cars are constntly oversteering. Many of the cars go from massive understeer to wild oversteer in a second. If you make contact with an AI driver, you will spin. If an AI driver makes contact with you, you will spin. The driving feels unrealistic, unpleasant, and unfair.Other issues are: Money system replaced with ""youtube fans"". No decision making for car unlocks, you just get it all at a slow pace. Single player story is on a rail and feels like you have no choice over tracks or direction of play. Endurance races are abysmal, short in duration, no map and random turns makes for frustrating gameplay.Positives: This game is very pretty "

												The physics in this game must have come from another planet because it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. Your car  feels like it's made out of paper and opponents charge through you like there's nothing in their way. The cars, especially drift cars like honda nsx, are completely uncontrollable over 200 kmh. You could say that this is realistic but the problem is that your opponents don't seem to have this problem. Even at slow speeds it feels like you are driving on ice and you find yourself struggling to drive in a straight line. Extremely frustrating			"

												Love it! Environments are so dynamic, crashing is so realistic, almost to the point where I enjoy crashes, because they're so visually beautiful to watch, if you have an 'average' rig, you can still run ultra setting at about 30-40peak. Which is great! Mechanics on driving are so realistic too!Pros:-Realistic driving mechanics-Car customization.-Great races and AI mechanics are realistic and smart.-Visually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic.Cons:Car customization is limited to rims, patterns, colours, and vinyls. No engine customization, making you just as good as the AI (no bumpers/spoilers)loading screens can be a bit annoying.OVERALL!Game is great! would recommend to all people who are beginner or ametuer to racing games! or Pro.

												This game could have been great, it has mediocre but graphics a good general theme, but then a few small details went and ruined it. While racing I found that the camera angle kept changing and faced to the side of the car or even backwards, which is a huge problem. I could not play more than 10 minutes of this game but when trying to quit I noticed there was no option of quitting on the menu and the only option was opening task manager and ending it. If you are willing to deal with these small problems and you like Driving/Racing game this may be a good game for you.			"

												The A.I. cars are on rails and I'm sliding around like on ice with slicks. I kept trying, thinking maybe I would get a handle on the loose cars but never did. I had bought all the DLC with the game because it was on sale and the game looked awesome.    In a last ditch hope the cars would improve I created a Tier 4 race and used a DLC car to test...I was still on ice and they were still on rails. I could forgive this if the tracks were at least designed with power-sliding in mind but it was like there were two different teams making this game. Team one designed the curvy, tree lined, cliff dropping couses with tight controls and handling in mind. Team two designed the cars and physics of said cars with wide fast tracks and arcade like controls in mind. Now the problem is it seems like they didn't consult with each other until the product was ready too launch and this is what we are left with. I wish at the very least the squirelly handling effected the A.I. cars as badly as it does me. At least then it would feel fair.			"

												Don't listen to Bullet. His points are ridiculous. The game is an 'ARCADE' racer and it does not pretend to be otherwise.'No interior view'. So what, it's not missed. the bonnet view is good enough. It's not a simulation. 'Lack of game music/theme'. Who cares? I don't play racing games for the music. 'Lack of rear view mirror'. Again it's not a simulation. I don't miss it and the fact is the game gets better performance without it.'Pure arcade car handling'. Yeh because it's an 'ARCADE' racer.'Most cars if not all are drift happy, as the game rewards drifting even in circuit racing'. Yeh because it's an 'ARCADE' racer.Do you see where I am going with this? As Arcade racers go the damage model is really good. It's not just asthetic, your car's handling changes. You lose speed, pull to the left, slip gears etc WHich forces you to drive correctly and not just bounce of the walls and ram other drivers.My score. 8.5/10 "

												In a world where need for speed most wanted (the original before some idiot decided to ruin the name) exists GRID 2 just isn't up to par, an annoying voice is forced on to you during the races unless you've made it to the options to turn the voices off, the options menu isn't even accessable from the main menu because ♥♥♥♥ logic, game defaults to a small window with a bunch of terrible graphical settings as defaults that force unwanted blur and such, no soundtrack because they prefer droning d bags talking at you, and slight side on crash can tear camera control from you ruining recovery, there's a needless rewind system (hey if the game handles bad enough that it's a requirement that's a red light) and the small amounts of superficial car customization is ruined by forced sponsor decals all over any half decent paint job you can put together.If you need a good racing game buy NFS: Most Wanted from 08 I believe it was (the terrible one of the same name was 2012) with it's optional slowtime (mainly used in cop chases), good soundtrack, actual feel of force to the cars, proper customization, open-ish world, and interesting race tracks/events.

Visuals asisde the gameplay has ""updated"" the drifting but i feel they have over done it for me it was a steap learning cuvre that took me ages to figure out this also makes the game feel more of an arcade game rather than a sim. Personally the only high point of this game were the graphics i also hope that they sort out this drifting feature for the next one (if there is going to be one) i give this game a 6/10pros .nice graphics.plenty of cars.interesting game modes cons.shoddy drifting mechanic.very repetitive			"

												Let's cut to the chase: the driving is simply not fun. Specifically, it doesn't ever leave you satisfied. It's an arcade racer with heavy drift emphasis trying to play off being a semi realistic experience, and it fails miserably at both. Vehicle physics are all over the place too, and don't even try to match its real world specifications.With that summary out of the way, more details below.I just finished the game's single player 100%. This review primarily focuses on that. Went through what the game calls ""Season 1"" on the hardest difficulty, then bumped it down to the 2nd hardest difficulty for the remainder of the game. That excludes most ""drift"" events and the final set of races, where I did it on the hardest difficulty. I did this all on a PS4 controller.Here's the problem with the game: To go fast, you drift. What the game calls ""drift"", ""balanced"", and ""grip"" race styles? Nonsense. If you want to go around a corner fast, you must break out the rear end. Otherwise, you will crash into a wall or hit a track due to understeer at the same speed.This problem compounds itself: Have a series of slow turns that alternate direction? Good luck breaking out the rear end or getting the vehicle to drift how you want it. Luckily, this is a mostly rare occasion, but it is something that will frustrate you.Then there's every single car with regard to drifting, minus the final, fastest car (more on that later): Even if you stomp on the gas/accelerator, you cannot hold the drift. But here's the silly part: if you don't hit the accelerator all the way, you can hold it longer. How does that make any sense? Who knows. This discovery I made about 75% of the way through the singleplayer did make the game slightly more bearable for some vehicles, but it's a complete mess still.Now of course, this is just your vehicle. The computers/AI? Horrible. This is both because they cheat heavily and because of the complete imbalance between vehicles.Let's go with the AI first: hardest difficulty, you have to race almost perfectly, or you have no chance of catching up. This means learning how to deal with your chosen car's behavior, the specific track in question, and how to get around the AI in the first place.Yes, most of the difficulty with AI is getting in front of them in the first place. This is abnormally annoying given how on the hard/hardest difficulties, they will gain acceleration and turning speed out of the blue just to stay in front of you.Once you are out in front though, you can drive at about 90% of the speed you were just racing and usually will stay out on top. The AI has trouble passing you too... but sometimes will crash into you and spin you out (your car is weightless compared to their vehicles, regardless of vehicle characteristics). If you continue to race as well as you can, a large lead usually makes all the AI vehicles fall further and further behind.Every time you crash/ tap a wall however, the AI has a tendency to speed up. On the 2nd hardest difficulty, when I ran into a wall, 3rd place drifted around the corner fast enough to overtake the current 1st place AI, where first place is usually faster than the rest.The AI is also severely imbalanced. On some tracks, I can pull out a 15-20 second lead quite often (2nd hardest difficulty). On others, I struggle to stay even one second ahead. This is both due to rubberbanding and horrible AI racing lines. Specifically, Cote d Azeur has some brutal AI, and is what made me change from hardest difficulty to 2nd hardest difficulty: there simply didn't seem like a way to win without blind luck (which did allow me to actually win a Season 1 race on the hardest difficulty: the fastest AI racer crashed/retired).Now let's go on to vehicles specifically: their balance is all over the place. This isn't too noticeable early-mid game, but the huge imbalance in their performance despite being in the same ""tier"" becomes extremely noticeable by late game. Generally speaking, you really want your opponents to have heavier, slow accelerating cars so you can pass them in the corners by braking later than them/ going around it faster. Every time my opponent (assuming a 1-on-1) is in a slower, heavier car, I can win easily on the 2nd hardest difficulty.This doesn't even mention how drifting works in each. While each car can break out the rear end, some have a lot more trouble than others in doing so. This is regardless of its acceleration/power: some cars just don't feel right. I can't give specifics given how the game put me into several different cars against my will.The exception to that drifting rule is the fastest car in the game: the Koenigsegg Agera R.This is the only car where i can get the rear end out on demand: turn in hard, stomp on the accelerator, control throttle to maintain the drift. It makes the most sense, and why every single car cannot do this is beyond me. In fact, why it requires over 1000 horsepower to drift a car properly, even in an arcade racer, is far beyond me.As a note, the speeds you ""drift"" the car would be fatal in most real world situations. While you do still have to brake/slow down for corners, the speeds you take them are... I want to say 1.5x-2x what you would be able to in a real world scenario. In most cases at least.Anyway, back to the Koenigsegg: I went against one of these cars on 2nd hardest difficulty before i unlocked it myself. The amount of work i had to put in (about 40 minutes alone of my total time, which only matched one race back in season 1 hardest difficulty) to win that race was absurd. The car accelerates so ridiculously fast for this game that once I unlocked it myself, I felt like the game's difficulty levels all jumped down one (on the remaining races I could use the vehicle in). Hence why I did the final set of races on the hardest difficulty: it felt about the same as what I had been racing at.It just astonishes me that the car that made the game feel ""right"" was at the end. It felt so proper that it made the rest of the game feel disgusting. Looking back at my approximate 15 hours spent on this game, it feels so wasted.Terrible ""gameplay"" aside, the visuals are at least pretty good looking. Especially when you consider when the game released.  Engine noises sound okay. Commentator needs to shut up, and the whole premise of the single player campaign is laughable. Vehicle damage looks a bit excessive sometimes, but does the trick. How it affects each car specifically I never found out, but slight vehicle damage did sometimes help me with a race seemingly.Overall, after about 15 different play sessions over about 15 hours (that's the maximum amount of time this game could hold my attention) and completing all single player events, this is a game I can't recommend. I had fun with 1 car in the end. And that lasted at most about 45 minutes, including two custom events with it.There's nothing to bring me back either; I don't want the overpriced and pointless DLC at all.Go with a proper racing SIM or a proper arcade racer. This is neither, and it's an overall shallow experience.			"

Team two designed the cars and physics of said cars with wide fast tracks and arcade like controls in mind. Now the problem is it seems like they didn't consult with each other until the product was ready too launch and this is what we are left with. I wish at the very least the squirelly handling effected the A.I. cars as badly as it does me. At least then it would feel fair.			"

												Don't listen to Bullet. His points are ridiculous. The game is an 'ARCADE' racer and it does not pretend to be otherwise.'No interior view'. So what, it's not missed. the bonnet view is good enough. It's not a simulation. 'Lack of game music/theme'. Who cares? I don't play racing games for the music. 'Lack of rear view mirror'. Again it's not a simulation. I don't miss it and the fact is the game gets better performance without it.'Pure arcade car handling'. Yeh because it's an 'ARCADE' racer.'Most cars if not all are drift happy, as the game rewards drifting even in circuit racing'. Yeh because it's an 'ARCADE' racer.Do you see where I am going with this? As Arcade racers go the damage model is really good. It's not just asthetic, your car's handling changes. You lose speed, pull to the left, slip gears etc WHich forces you to drive correctly and not just bounce of the walls and ram other drivers.My score. 8.5/10 "

												This game could have been great, it has mediocre but graphics a good general theme, but then a few small details went and ruined it. While racing I found that the camera angle kept changing and faced to the side of the car or even backwards, which is a huge problem. I could not play more than 10 minutes of this game but when trying to quit I noticed there was no option of quitting on the menu and the only option was opening task manager and ending it. If you are willing to deal with these small problems and you like Driving/Racing game this may be a good game for you.			"

												The A.I. cars are on rails and I'm sliding around like on ice with slicks. I kept trying, thinking maybe I would get a handle on the loose cars but never did. I had bought all the DLC with the game because it was on sale and the game looked awesome.    In a last ditch hope the cars would improve I created a Tier 4 race and used a DLC car to test...I was still on ice and they were still on rails.

												First I'd like to say that you dont need to use the brake in this game at all (look at the achievement, if you dont believe me)Second this is  an arcade racer where the other (AI) racers main job is to bash you around the track, feels like theyre driving solid granite cars compared to your cardboard crumple zone.  This is a step backwards compared to Grid and to add to that someone screwed up the controls, why do we need two handbrake buttons?  The normal brake button feels as if all the brake bias is set to the rear, it instantly sends you into a drift as soon as you touch the left or right button at the same time.Also unlike Grid you cannot fine tune your controller deadzones or sensitivity.  Good thing I bought this at 75% off otherwise I would have been peeved.			"

												Slightly older game, but it still manages to holds its own against newer titles. Controls feel good without being *too* silly and arcade-y. Good selection of cars with fairly distinct characteristics to choose from. Pretty nice selection of tracks — the downhill mountain track in Japan is a personal favourite. Excellent casual online racing fun against your friends, especially if you have a good range of cars unlocked.

												GRID 2 suffers from severe issues in the user interface. It forces you to race a match before it will let you do anything else, such as pick your player name. And the list of names available are all MALE, names like Randy, Jeff, Muhammed and even Jesus... but not a single female name to pick from! Way to alienate half of the population, Codemasters.In one race I got spun around, and amidst the confusion and smoke I didn't realise I was facing the wrong way. The game didn't tell me that I was going the wrong way, but it did abruptly disqualify me.It also seems to lock most of the cars away from you, until you've levelled up. If you want to play a Level 1 multiplayer game with anything but an Alfa Romeo, you're sweet outta luck. Try again in about a dozen or so races.It boggles my mind that a game that feels so fun to play is being choked to death by bad designers.			"

The game didn't tell me that I was going the wrong way, but it did abruptly disqualify me.It also seems to lock most of the cars away from you, until you've levelled up. If you want to play a Level 1 multiplayer game with anything but an Alfa Romeo, you're sweet outta luck. Try again in about a dozen or so races.It boggles my mind that a game that feels so fun to play is being choked to death by bad designers.			"

												I didn't expect a lot from this game as i bought this for £5, surprisingly it is very fun!People complain about traction and drifting, but it is not easy to drift anyway, it is more realistic in that way.People complain about cars having to be bought in a DLC, come on, this game is £5 in the sale, what else do you need? A pretty good game to play in my past time, commentary is great aswell!Yes, the graphics COULD be improved but it runs very well, even on my i3 potato laptop.I would recommend this game to people who love their racing games and don't expect drifting and traction to be easy!

												GRID 2 like its predecessor is an amazing and solid racing game. Unlike the 1st game there is no longer a cockpit view and the control of the cars is extremely arcady but once you get past these points what you get is an extremely satisfying and rewarding racing game. The campaign isn't as long as in the 1st game but the multiplayer portion is alot better with more game modes, things to unlock and cars to buy. 9/10			"

												Could've been a good racing game but sadly it's being let down by pretty much all of it's parts. I can accept arcadey physics and handling as long as car behaviour is at least somewhat plausible. In this game however seems to be made with the sole purpose of looking cool from the outside. If you have the slight interest in driving and racing just stay away from this one. It's about style, not much else. Also every single design choice seems to be made to make the experience as annoying as possible.			"

Second, Grid is a great game if your hand eye coordination is lacking and you dont like cars driving like they do in the real world. Three, Grid is a great game if you hate customization of any sort, i mean absolutley loathe it.

												Ah Grid 2, the ugly child of Grid. I've never played Grid, perhaps that eased me into it, and made it just a little bit less infuriating to get into. I've played allot of Grid 2 online, I've not touched on the single player (but from my brief peak, it looked rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because the buying mechanics were off). I've become very good at controlling the butter brick driving mechanics and consider this game to be a pick up and play sort of thing. The butter brick mechanics I've so aptly named makes the game a noble effort to gently encourage your car (this being the butter brick) in the direction you want it to career. But after hours of tedium you begin to master this and the driving becomes very arcade-y, and very fun. Online, people are reckless and cause massive pileups on the initial corners of the track, which often screw your race up; but if you drive cautiously you can come out on top almost all the time. The rest of it is fun; the game is undoubtedly pretty and runs like a dream. I recommend this, but not for a simulator, or anyone looking for a 'realistic' experience.			"

												You get a really small variety of cars with the base game. I'd say at most, you get maybe 15? Then theres a ton more in DLC packs. If I didnt buy this game for $1, and was able to get the Grid 2 All in One DLC for like $6, I'd feel really quite ripped off.However, online is fun. All the cars feel different. Driving feels great. Except for the beginning of races with more than 4 people. The beginning is like a ♥♥♥♥ing demoliton derby. If you're in first, steer the hell out of anyones way. If you're in the middle, you're pretty lucky. I cant tell if a lot of the community is trolling or just really terrible at racing. I'll be slowing down at a corner, like most people do, and this idiot rear ends me, makes me spin out, and slams into the wall.

I'll look behind me and see this guy trying to take turns going way too fast and slamming into a wall or going off track. Either way, trolling or terrible skill, its really annoying getting slammed by them and then your car is just destroyed, and you fall way behind.But after a while you get used to it, and learn to stay the hell away from people, and pickout the trolls/idiots and the people who actually want to race. A con is that theres only upgrading and modding your vehicles on multiplayer. Single player is pretty much you getting a pre setup car, and taking it for racing. I dont get why they went this route instead of letting us having modding on and offline. Eventually, this games online will completely die out. Online is nearly dead.

												This game just isn't that fun when you compare it to other racing titles out there, for $30 it's a joke.The phyics are bad - even for an arcade-style game - just bad. Cars don't work well for the categories they're listed as, and the multiplayer is broken.			"

												You get a really small variety of cars with the base game. I'd say at most, you get maybe 15? Then theres a ton more in DLC packs. If I didnt buy this game for $1, and was able to get the Grid 2 All in One DLC for like $6, I'd feel really quite ripped off.However, online is fun. All the cars feel different. Driving feels great. Except for the beginning of races with more than 4 people. The beginning is like a ♥♥♥♥ing demoliton derby. If you're in first, steer the hell out of anyones way. If you're in the middle, you're pretty lucky. I cant tell if a lot of the community is trolling or just really terrible at racing. I'll be slowing down at a corner, like most people do, and this idiot rear ends me, makes me spin out, and slams into the wall.

Nope.Software issues aside if you have no problems running the game it looks decent and it's mediocre-ly fun with the free Derby DLC.

												I am NOT a racing game fan. I find racing games difficult to get into, often counterintuitive to control, and unnecessarily restrictive with cars and tracks.Also, I'm terrible at it.However, I found myself in the mood for a fun racing game after playing GTA V with its many amazing modded cars, and saw GRID 2 on the Lunar New Year sale, so I gave it a try.I'm glad I did.PROS:- GRID 2 doesn't punish hilariously inept racers like me from the get-go. It does a great job of easing you in, and you can start on noob settings, like I did, or try genuinely difficult settings. It's great for all skill levels.- It's FUN! Some racing games feel stressful. GRID 2 doesn't. The game does a good job of capturing the joy of driving.- The controls feel INTUITIVE! You know how the best games almost make you ""feel"" obstacles with your controller, mouse, joystick or steering wheel? The games that make you duck IRL when you're flying below something, or recoil to dodge a projectile or piece of shrapnel? GRID 2 is the racing version of that. The controls feel completely natural from the start, and they are equally precise.- The cities are lovingly rendered. You can race through Barcelona and see the Sagrada Familia looming over the streets; rocket through brightly lit Hong Kong at night; cruise Dubai's ultra-modern tracks; race in the shadow of the Eiffel tower...and on and on. The background art in this game is spectacular. - It's well optimized. Framerate holds up fantastically, and I'm using a GTX 760, not the worst but not the best either. The important thing is, this game runs incredibly smooth, something that's always appreciated in a game where twitch response is important.- The cars are awesome. It's not exclusively supercars, although the game has its share of Paganis and McLarens. There are American muscle cars, drift cars from Nissan and Honda, and high-performance vehicles from makers like BMW, Audi, etc. The paint options are legion, with a shading system to get the exact colors you want, and choices between things like metallic, matte, pearlescant, flip, etc.- The game can be set to speak your real name, and your racing team leader gives you helpful tips when you're on the track or practicing. It's all situational, and so far it hasn't been repetitive at all.CONS:- While you can choose from any track (or so it seems) in custom events, you still have to unlock cars in career mode, unfortunately. - You can change wheels, but it's not clear if they're anything more than aesthetic changes. That's  fine with me, but maybe some people would want more depth.- I'm not Vin Diesel.OVERALL: Would recommend, even for terrible racers like me. Most of all, it's FUN.			"

												Decent game. Playability, very similar to Grid 1. Longevity, depends on whether you want to drop 30 snots for DLC. Plenty of playtime without, though.Reliability - honestly, terrible. Ridiculous bugs that plagued DiRT 3 are still present.Overall - no way do I recommend this game, until such a time as the bugs are ironed out (which won't happen) and the DLC drops in price.Update 5th/October/2014 - to date, still no patch to fix the bugs since I originally reviewed this on 3rd/December/2013. And, of course, no patch in sight, seeing as the same bugs have carried over to it's predecessor. And a tech support team who aren't in any way familiar with it's products. Codemasters.....

												This game is such a let-down in terms of playability because it suffers from the 'Black Screen Crash' and unfortunately no one is taking responsibility nor prepared to fix the issue.A number of workarounds have been posted here on Steam and on various websites and after trying out many of the suggestions I have managed to play the game for short periods of time before the inevitable crash occurs.Therefore I do not recommend this game which clearly suffers from bad programming , it is a game which should never had been sold to the public in it's current state.If this were a hardware product it would have not been sold in the first place because it would be classed as faulty goods, I don't see why any digital product should be any different.

												I really hate this new trend where game sequels are now crap compared to their predecessors, where all of the substances and originality of the first game is tossed away in favor of generic, trend tedium that we have seen in a million other games. Buy Grid 1, it's better. On it's own merits, Grid 2 is about average or slightly better than your average racer. Grid 1 is a 3rd the price though and superior in most ways. Aside from being completely linear with no real choice in what races to compete in (and a cluster ♥♥♥♥ of completely bland cars), Grid 2 takes itself way too seriously and sacrifices game modes and gameplay for flashy cutscenes.

They literally limit your selection for no reason.

												I would not recommend buying this game! Compared to Grid 1 (which is one of my fav racing games of all time) the cars feel wonky and uncontrollable. They break out in corners and as the driver you constantly feel like you're not in control! This sucks! I can never play this game more than 15 minutes....because the uncontrollable cars drive me crazy! Shame....this could have been an amazing game if it would've been a bit closer to the first part!

												Grid 2 is a confident, aggressive, good-looking racer that boasts a level of focus last year’s Dirt: Showdown didn’t have. It’s well executed and easily the measure of the award-winning original in all but a couple of areas. However, missteps with how it approaches its track content will harm its long-term appeal, and further shedding of its sim-based roots will continue to alienate fans of the racing games Codemasters made back in the late ’90s and early 2000s.

												This review does not take into account multiplayer, as I did not play multiplayer.Admittedly, I wasn't much of a fan of GRID 1.  But having seen the new race types via YouTube videos, I picked up GRID 2 and the two track packs for about $16USD.GRID 2 is alright if you're wanting to run some quick, custom races and don't mind drifting around every corner.  But the career mode is little more than a trickle of new race types on the same few tracks shoved between infuriatingly long and unskippable cut scenes.I suppose I got my $16 worth.  I'll probably do some single-player custom races from time to time (in order to see the two additional tracks I bought), but career mode is dead to me.			"

												This is THE racing game of all time!!!The fun level is off the charts, and it's the kind of racing game that makes you crave the first position at all costs. No matter how many times you have to repeat the track over and over and over until you get the first position. Third will not do. It's the kind of game that will leave you with muscle cramps in your fingers and hand and rist from turning and braking and drifting. it's insane!!! The graphics are a treat for the eyes, and the feel and sound of the car work perfectly. It's a lovely game and I wanna thank the producers from the very core of my gaming heart. I haven't felt this good about a game in a long, long time.			"

												AI ramming you up the backside all the time. One example is winning the race with 10 seconds to go and get rammed into a wall and car dies so I just wasted 6 minutes for nothing. The better the car the worse the handling gets to the point of being on icy with no grip because the game wants you to drift everywhere. The commentator keeps talking about having to fix the car, which doesn't matter as you don't have money and it is his job to fix the car so why not stfu? The cutscenes for your career feel so cheap and tacky and this game is nowhere near as good as the original Grid, which also had a car cockpit which Codemasters taken out of this Grid.			"

												Do not buy!The first time you start the game you're taken to a tutorial, so to say, which constists of a couple of different, short races. At this point I was already shocked; how can the driving of this game be this horrible? I shook my head and hoped that this was just a tutorial thing; maybe the developers wanted to give a very hand-held driving mode for the tutorial so no one can lose it. But I was wrong, so wrong. I completed the tutorial, and found out that the handling of this game is still horrible. It's even worse than that of GTA V, which, bear in mind, is NOT a driving game at all! It's not worth paying any money for this at all, even if you get this game for free, there's no reason to play it. It has no vehicle upgrading, it has no free driving, and most importantly, it has the worst driving mode I have ever experienced. This game doesn't seem to cater to any player group, hence my listing of lacking features above. What it does have is a career-mode with different tracks and styles: street, race and drift. I can not tell anything more though, as I quit the game after 38 minutes, but apparently there are quite a few of those available. I completed the tutorial, one additional race and of course I had to test drive an Alfa Romeo, but that's it. Enough for me and never again. I hope I can get a refund of this.TL;DR: The handling is the worst of any game I've ever tested.			"

Not much improvement at all from the first GRID. This game sucks.

												At first I was really excited about this game. I have not played a racing game in ages. The last one I played was NFS Hot Pursuit.   It started out pretty good. The graphics were great and the interface was pretty decent.   Regarding the offline career, there are different ways you can get through it. Either you have to complete racing missions or you have to complete drifting missions. You get two cars to chose between, and then you are off. The main goal is to win the missions which will increase your fan base (amount of followers / viewers). When you have enough fans, you unlock a big event, which you have to complete. Then, you basically start over. The only difference is the tracks change and the opponents get a little harder. On your way up, you win new cars. There is no feature, where you can tweak and tune them. The cars are how they are, though you can change their appearance.The gameplay is okay. It is not that hard to master the drifting and the racing is pretty easy as well. If you fail, you can always use the rewind button and correct your mistake. Besides that, there are no features worth mentioning. I bought the game to play the career, so all over it was a pretty disappointing experience. I would not recommend anyone to buy this game if they like me expect a good career.			"

												Solid racer, but I prefer the more real world race world of the original grid. I also prefer the cars, tracks and handling of the old game, not to forget the team approach with multiple cars.Codemasters chose not use real world licenses and ended up with a fantasy race league, which is IMHO again a real step back.A city race with dynamically changing routes is not believable, as it would be virtually impossible to change a layout while the race is ongoing as is the case in Grid 2. Not that it isn't fun, but again it detracts from the level of realism that was present in the original Grid.In the end, regardless of some graphical improvements, I just prefer the original over Grid 2 and hope that Codemasters will revert to the same type of game if they ever produce Grid 3.Good game, but I recommend you look at Grid before Grid 2, unless you want to play multiplayer.Codemasters pulled the plug on the old Grid MP, not very nice of them...certainly not a long term selling point.

												This game has so much squandared potential... Great visuals, amazing audio, distinct characteristics for each car (handling feel, acceleration, etc), but fails spectacularly in the campaign. The AI absolutely CANNOT pass. They do not yield to the faster car (race regulations), and when they attempt a pass, instead of going around you they simply press into your rear bumper until the physics engine decides the appropriate action is to have your car spin out into the nearest retaining wall.I'm thankful for the flasbacks, because one thing is for sure, you'll need them.What also drives me insane is your race manager, with such helpful insights as, ""Keep pushing, go for first!"". NO F****** S***!!! Save yourself the heartache of unrealized hopes and dreams, as well as the money. Stay away.			"

												I have really been enjoying GRID 2. It is a hybrid sim/arcade racer. By that I mean you do need to break, and you do need to know how to go around corners, but with a very high incorporation of drifting and forgiveness. There are only two real downsides to this game: There are no online games anymore, rendering half of the game useless, and the AI can often times be infuriating. The AI very clearly has a set idea as to what it wants to do, regardless of where or what the players car is doing. There is very clearly no connection between the AI and where the player is.			"

												GRID 2 has some very nice graphics, it can also be a lot of fun in multiplayer when you have some good players to go up against (alas, next to no online players in my region). I do not see that it is an improvement on the original GRID, just different. Some features that made the original game great are missing or are not as good, however there are new aspects which make up for some of the losses. Watch out for the computer players they are not subject to the same rules as players (at this time) for example in Touge when you the player overtake, you can be disqualified for touching the opponent, however you also get disqualified if the PC crashes into you when it is overtaking, a little unfair!To summarise, this is a good game with some nice graphics, it would be a great game if you could connect to more servers for multiplayer and if the game rules were better balanced.

												GRID 2 is not a great racer back when it first release, the lack of race discipline variety, road car focus, average driving physic and weak track selection really kills the game. The driving physic in the game is more to the arcade side (more than GRID 1), the tail of the car is constantly out even the GT3 cars cant really take a corner steadily. The game modes included in GRID 2 are Live Route, Endurance, Time Attack, Race, Elimination, Touge, Face Off and Drift. Career is focus on a new sort of racing series called ""World Series Racing"" and you are the star driver in this racing series. In GRID 2, you dont need to buy cars like GRID 1, whenever you require a new car to particpate a race event, the game will let you pick 1 car out of 2. The car that you didnt picked can be unlocked later in the game by joining one of the events. There are sponsors event that have races such as overtake and endurance as well. Even with all DLCs, the game still feels empty in comparison to GRID 1. The DLCs adds 2 new tracks which is Spa and Bathurst, the DLCs tracks are great but 2 great tracks cant really save the poor tracks selection from the base game. As for the DLC cars, the AIs wont use them. You will always be the only driver driving it and there are a few weird car classing for the DLC cars. For example the Ford Sierra is class with the modern Volvo S60 for some reason. The drift cars can be used in normal racing mode but those cars lack of top speed. Another example is the Tier 3 cars, the Ariel Atom and Caterham SP300R could easily outrun the typical supercars like Aston Martin Vanquish and Mclaren 12C. The only good thing I found in GRID 2 is the splitscreen option, it is great when you have friends to race with.I'll suggest getting GRID 1 instead of GRID 2, it may be old but it plays a lot better. GRID 2 will be suitable for you if you dont mind the drifty driving physics.			"

												Grid 2 is just more goodness of Grid 1. If you enjoy the semi-arcade/semi-simulation style of the Grid series then you will likely enjoy this game. After getting used to the controls of the game in general, then getting accustomed to a certain car, you will find yourself flying through corners and overtaking your opponents without as much as a scratch on your vehicle. While I don't enjoy the general interface of the game (I thoroughly enjoyed the trophie room interface of the first game) it is still usable and while I find it less user friendly, it does play into the realism of the overall game. With multiplayer, Grid 2 comes with a split screen feature, which I find is extremely hard to come by these days, especially on PC versions of games. Online is something I haven't spent much time with, you are required to set up an account to access these features, and at the time that I tried, I was having issues with Steam Big Picture mode, issues that were preventing me from making an account. I will likely revisit this review to add comments on multiplayer.As a huge fan of the original Grid, I can easily recommend Grid 2 as fun, fast paced, ""arcadmulation"" racer.			"

												wouldnt recomend, if you loved the first grid then you will be really disapointed in this one.First no cockpit view, the game almost has no challenge to it since they give you everything, I have came in first every time and if you pick a car you get the one you didnt pick buy doing another race thats avilable almost right after picking your car. no more racing for money in story mode no its for fans.The loading scene Is horrible looks like your drunk and looking at an on coming car about to hit you.They have really taken the focus away from racing and the challenge grid 1 had, now it more feels like its about being trendy and about the scene style then about racing. this game has just gone down. they should just infect it with that x-games crap they destroyed dirt with and get it over with.their DLC is crap too, they release DLC car packs when they release the game and its of all the top teir cars...all they do is try and bleed you for money, its one thing to add cars down the line its another to basicly say hey you want better car? pay for them after you already paid $30-$40 for this game. DLC has gotten to the point where they sell you an unfinished game and charge you for the rest. Atleat alot of indie devs do it right and just give you more content.			"

												This game was a huge disappointment for a number a reasons, the biggest being the driving experience which focuses almost exclusively on drifting. The graphics are acceptable but for the price you'd expect much better. The use of a story line is obnoxious. The boring, senseless plot serves only to force you to complete challenges in order to unlock new vehicles and tracks. You get the sense the developers where locked in a room with nothing but a case of Red Bull and the entire Fast & Furious DVD collection until they spat out this game. I actually like their Formula 1 games so it's hard to believe this one was so far off the mark.			"

												Theres hardly any racing games on PC nowadays so I decided to pick this up. I guess its fine as an arcade racer, but its nothing more to it than that. I was hoping it would be more like a racing sim like Gran Turismo, but its not. The handling of the cars can get really annoying and its like the game wants you to drift all of the time. This can get annoying on tracks where the corners are not as sharp and require slight movements. The visuals of the game are good. The most annoying part of the game is its focus on ""modern"" trends. For example it frequently wants to remind you about camera-phones and social media. I died a little inside when it gave me an acheivment labeled, ""SWAGtastic"". Stuff like this left a sour taste in my mouth. I also think the whole point of the single player campaign to be about gathering ""fans"" is kinda shallow. Is my character some sort of fame hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?All in all, its a good racer if you just want to have a fun arcade style experience. While it wasn't the game I hoped it would be, fun can still be had. If I gave this game a score I'd give it a 7/10.			"

												Allright, let's get one thing out of the way, for those who are looking for a realistic racing sim: you're not going to find it here.Not only is this nothing like the first GRID Race Driver, this is nothing more than a quick cash-in on the GRID franschise.Racing is arcadey as hell, AI is lackluster and customisation in singleplayer is limited to your livery.In short, get the first GRID or wait for Asetto Corsa if you want the true racing sim feel.

												All arcade racing fans out there that don't own Grid 2 and are contemplating whether or not to purchase it,  at $10 this is truely a bargain.  The DLC's are worth purchasing as well!The graphics are brilliant, the cars and circuits are awesome and you get a great variety of tracks to race on, and there's also a free Demolition Derby DLC that will automatically be downloaded after purchasing the sim.In regards to the vehicles, it has a decent amount of cars to start with, however I strongly recommend purchasing all of the DLC's which aren't that expensive considering how many cars you'll end up in the game!Important note:  When I first purchased this game it was running fantastic with all the settings on high with my Intel Quad Core 2.8 Ghz processor (Overclocked at 3.8Ghz), then suddenly one day I went to play it and it ran like a dogs breakfast!  I spent a good month or so trying to figure out what the issue was, and I finally came across a very helpful person who gave me the immediate remedy to the problem!   Sorry for pointing the finger at you guys at Steam, but someone had at Steam had changed the compatibility settings under properties for the Grid 2 application by adding a tick to run it in Windows 8  compatibility mode! Once I removed the tick as recommended by this helpful gamer, the game was running brilliantly once again.Their are even a few mods on other sites that improve the graphics and make the cars handle more like the cars in a racing sim than an arcade racer.Note -  Overclocking is entirely your choice, just make sure you  understand the risks that are involved, and what is required to overclock your PC!  This is not something I recommend, nor do any of the staff at STEAM!			"

												The original GRID was not a favorite with fans of racing simulators, but in my view it trod the fine line between simulator and arcade very well. The successor has given up and gone with a limp, dull sequel.The driving mechanics of the previous GRID were perhaps a little forgiving, but subtle variations in car choice and the wide range of event types lead to an almost inifinite level of replay value. There was the strong sense of team progression, and a sense of adversity was found in the way that other drivers were named and recognisable, but never so important as to be 'bosses'. Instead, teams took that role.In short GRID was fun, casual gaming that alllowed you to tackle the same track 10 times and end up with ten completely different, intense outcomes without any feel of rubberbanding or jumping through hoops.Now, on to GRID 2. Having played a few hours of the game I have yet to understand exactly what the difference between the first ten cars is. There is an overwhelming focus on 'drift' mechanics. The first five or six cars were all classed as 'drift' even though the circuits are all allegedy street. I was actually quite excited to get the opportunity to try a car with 'balanced' classifications, however on the first hard corner I locked up the wheels and was treated to exactly the same on-rails-feeling drift mechanic as the other cars had provided. In short, this is the first major flaw with GRID 2: the driving mechanic is facile. Apparantly drifting is the way they want you to drive, and their idea of drifting is applying the brake and steering in. Countersteer is frequently unecessary. The clunky driver aids interfere with any attempt at deliberate over/understeer outside of this narrow definition, making all the cars feel samey (at least in my short time with the game).Beyond the fact that this is a racing game with poor driving mechanics, I feel that the rather pointless and restrictive story is another aspect that I rapidly came to dislike. Similarly the irritating focus on a social media-driven prestige system with kudos - I mean fans - as the currency, without any actual finance system or budget, meaning that you mindlessly plonk from race to race. Whilst driving the same car. However, these flaw would be liveable, if only the racing itself wasn't so crap. The 'top notch' AI is as pants as the driving, with very apparant rubberbanding, a heavy brake foot and none of the panache or daring-do of the drivers in the first of the series. Also, the damage system in GRID was regarded as forgiving. You've not seen forgiving until you've played this game.Before the review descends into a complete disappointed rant, I feel I should focus on the positives. Some of the levels are devastatingly pretty. Dashing along the California coastline through wooded clifftop roads in the morning sun was absolutely brilliant. Also, the gameplay mechanics really bring this to the fore as you don't have to watch the road as you drive, allowing you to soak up the glorious vistas. That being said, however, the city levels are bordering on the sterile. There is some sense of place, but very few of the city centre layouts provide the same level of white-knuckle experience and, strangely, do not look as good as the venerable predecessor. Whether it's the layout of the tracks, the less immersive sound design, the feeling that your car is wrapped in cotton wool or the flabby handling, the city racetracks do not deliver. Furthermore, I feel I should add that there is a game mode which involves the track getting switched around as you drive laps, which would be great if it was some kind of add on once you got to know, and presumably love, each track. Howver, being thrown into this mechanic after a few goes, without being given any preview or name for each layout, is bewildering and dull. Put simply, it heightens the feeling of banality introduced by the handling: driving at pace on a racetrack whose layout you do not know should kill you, not be easy.To conclude, do not buy this game unless you want something apocalyptically dull. I would even recommend buying the original GRID, flawed as it is, because it is a much better game. It even still looks good, and the experience of throwing yourself down a head-to-head midnight togué track has to be one of the most fun racing experiences I've ever had.			"

												While I really enjoyed the first GRID, GRID 2 leaves me wanting a lot more out of my racing experience.Make no mistake, this is not a simulator, nor should it be reviewed as one. This is an arcade racer with simulator-esque physics. What I mean is this: At the highest levels (Season 5 supercars, etc)Racing a ""GRIP"" car will feel slow, when in comparison to the other cars, you're going fairly fast.Racing a ""Balanced"" car will feel like you should be drifting a lot more than you are, but the car feels like it's on training wheelsRacing a ""DRIFT"" car will feel like your tires are made of ice and no matter what you do the car will not cooperate.I would prefer that my racing games fit into one category or the other when it comes to street racing (not DiRTs. DiRTs are awesome as-is)When a driving game with arcade steering has simulation knife's-edge cornering, I find it much harder to enjoy.TL;DR: The first 4 seasons and 25 hours are fun. Really fun. However, this game is dated enough that multiplayer is dead, so unless you plan on racing with friends in your living room/split screen, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this game.			"

												Poor FPS: runs fine for first few races then for some reasons starts to slow down and down and down...Edit: OK, I have figured why the frame rate drops; it is because I have my logitech wheel attached...which is pretty stupid for a racing game which doesn't run smoothly with a wheel attached. As soon as you disconnect the wheel (i.e. use a controller instead) the game runs really well! Given that this Codemaster game don't expect any fixes as they normally abandon the game after a few months,If you play with controller then this is a good arcade racing game.			"

												Best driving game ever.  Following in the footsteps of GRID and its predecessors.  I was convinced that these guys were making the best racing games on PC (perhaps even better than GT4 on PS) ever since I sat down to play Toca DTM Race Driver 2 back in 2005.  This game doesn't disappoint.  The commentator is a bit annoying but otherwise its a phenomenal game with fantastic balance between fun and simulation and the cars/graphics are unmatched even by GT because let's face it, no console game ever looked better than the same game on PC at 1080p with max AA and Anistropy.

												This is a terrible game. The graphics were deciving beacuse the car is grainy, scenery is well done, but steering is almost impossible, if you hold the turn out for too long you do a dougnut but can never recover. If anyone from Steam  or even th makers and developers of GRID 2 see's this please refund me my 12.49 because this game s absolutely terrible!I should have got Need For Speed Rivals instead!			"

												I wouldnt recommend this game to my worst enemy. If someone came up to me and said ""I need a really terrible game to play"" I wouldnt recommend it to them either..because this is something that goes WAY beyond terrible. If you enjoyed the first GRID and you're considering this, turn around...turn around and run as far away from this as possible. Mario kart is closer to the first GRID than this. Consider the GRID series ruined.			"

												Good fun game! The graphics looks great overall with some awesome scale to the tracks. The single player has plenty of depth and diversity as well as a semi structure story to keep things refreshing. Finally the multiplayer is amazing, I don't think I've played a racing game recently that makes it so easy just to jump into a race. It also has a bit of complexity behind to with car upgrades and car choices for each track/event type.Overall it is a great game, it might not be breaking any barriers in terms of design but it is a highly polished fun racer with a lot of variety.

												""Recommend""? Yes. But by the smallest possible margin.(On bad days, ""No""!) If Administration were better, this game would be aslam-dunk piece of awesomeness. But, it's not.Call it 2.5 out of 5 stars(average of 0 for administration, and 5 for driving.)TWO parts of Grid 2:-- administer the game, and-- play the simulator.In Grid 2, I count using the steering wheel, brakes, etc.  to drive acourse as Playing, and everything else (getting online, creatingraces, finding a race, quitting, etc.) as Administration.Playing is phenomenal (5/5 stars)! It just about balances out the rest of theproduct, because _everything_ else is a miserable, tedious, annoying,and frustrating experience, one which, had I known before purchase,would have caused me to look elsewhere -- anywhere else (0 stars).Here are a few examples:1. A race could take anywhere from a few seconds to hours (depending   upon settings and the point at which you arrived). A typical race of   a lap or two might take a minute or two to play. But, it takes   almost that long to start the next race. Literally, you are waiting   as much, or more, than you are playing.   Solution - I set longer races, 4 or 5 laps or more - though that   has it's problems, too. How long should a new arrival have to wait?   There should be no waiting for players to do stuff - such as while   looking at/changing cars. If I am joining the race, I should have   made those decisions first. If I am changing to a new car for the   next race, allow me to make a request (e.g., poke the F12 key   during the LOAD process), and THEN delay to give me time (e.g., 20   seconds so I can choose a new car). 20 second countdowns between   races is ridiculous!2. Sound stutters, especially between races when LOADING the next.   Put audio communication on a separate thread!3. User interface - certain things should be changeable on the fly.   I prefer to leave talking on (not Push-To_Talk). But, when the kids   start carrying on, or the TV, etc., I want to change this - worse   yet - when it happens at my buddy's house, I want HIM to change it.   But we don't because it means leaving the simulator, making the   change, then waiting until the next race begins. And that's   tedious!4. When a new race starts, show race characteristics:    Damage is on, Collision is on, etc.   I _want_ people to know race settings. Especially since I leave the   race open so anyone can join. And I want people to know that, if   they play crash derby, their car won't last any longer than the   ones they hit.5. Be consistent about behavior. For example, there should be an Exit   or Back option on EVERY non-race screen.    Much of the behavior looks like each Developer just ""did their own   thing"" when they designed and wrote the component.   For example, if at the Online race board screen, how to Quit /   Back?  Not mentioned (and it's an error in a lot of places, don't   just add it here, add it wherever it isn't!)6. Quitting the game can be a nightmare! I should be able to hit the   ESC key, anyplace in the game - even while racing, and see   appropriate Options, one of which should always be Quit. Sometimes,   I have to leave _now_. I don't want to argue with the computer   about whether I can shutdown now, I don't want to wait while it is   dislaying ""Longest Online Drift"". I want out, now!   There was even a scenario in which I had to finish creating the   race, then race it, just so I could Quit. Bad. Very Bad.7. When I create a game, I should be able to start playing it, even if   there is no one else to race [yet].   Right now, you have a huge problem - people can only Online-Race if   there are two or more people ready to race - me and my buddy. No   buddy? Then no race.   I'm not going to create a [custom] race because I'm not going to   sit there for an indefinite amount of time waiting for someone else   to show up. I can't race without them, and I won't wait for them.   Not a great Online situation.   I should be able to either race myself, or race the AIs, until   others arrive.8. When I am waiting, e.g., as a new arrival to a Race group, for the   current race to finish so I can join the next, I should be able to   Spectate. I want to do _something_ enjoyable while waiting, perhaps   several minutes, for the current race to finish. Right now, I have   to twiddle my thumbs, because the race in progress could take 1   second or several minutes (10+) to finish (no indicator).   If I walk away, I might miss the start of the next race, but, if I   have to wait, I might get so bored I write critiques of Grid 2.   An alternative to ""something to do"" is to allow me, as a new   arrival, to take over an AI vehicle, e.g., the last one.   I'd create a new option for game configuration:       New arrivals must wait for a new race, or       New arrivals may take over the last place AI car.   People should not have to wait!9. In the category of not waiting, At the end of a race, the program   displayes the finish-board, alternating with lap times. Useful.   Then it makes me wait while ""LOADING ..."" twiddles. No, bad!   One thread should be displaying the leader board, the other thread   should be loading the next race. (for the same old reason, Don't.   Make. Me. Wait.) Display the Leader board at least twice, but   otherwise as many times as necessary to allow the LOADING to   finish.10. Settings were at the ""intermediate level"".  I suspect a newcomer   to the gaming world would have some minor grief.  (In this case, I   might not call it ""bad"", just a ""lot of room for improvment"").   It was not always clear what or how to set things. If you have some   experience with this sort of thing, you'll figure it out quickly,   if not, choosing settings may be a bit awkward.   For example: Under Options > Controls, Arrow to the option you want   to change, hit Enter to put in change mode, poke desired button,   switch, or key to set. When all set, hit ESC to return to the   previous panel.   Anyone should be able to install the game, select a Help button,   and get the gist of how to do things, whether trivial like setting   action keys, or much more complex - like what the various options   in Create Race > Tier are.   You support the Logitech G25 - great! But, I can't seem to use what   are called ""Buttons 1-4"", button 4 is considered the default PTT   button, and it does not work (you'll probably want to set that to   button 8 so it's easily accessible while racing - if you like   Push-To-Talk). Why - is there something I must do? (they work in   other apps).In summary, this is a great racing game, from a racing / drivingperspective. And I highly recommend it based on that, but thatalone.EVERYTHING except the driving is an annoying, frustrating hodge podge,apparently designed and built by the lowest bidder; and if I had knownI would have all the problems we had before hand, I would definitelyhave looked elsewhere for a racing simulator.However, note that the problems I described above are the types ofproblems that can be ""easily"" fixed via a patch release. You don'tneed to change the racing process, scope new tracks, design new cars,reconsider the physics of the simulation. That's all done, andincredibly well. It's all the glue that binds the parts together thatneeds a [major] overhaul.Version 2.1, anyone? "

												I'm not car guy nor a fan of each year's installment of a new racing game, but I got this for free with a processor and decided to download it and give it a try. That being said, I wasn't expecting much nor did I think that I would enjoy this game, seeing as the only racing series I've ever kind of enjoyed is Burnout. After playing a few races, I thought that it looked pretty good, and that it was kind of fun, actually. I enjoyed the rewind feature, which alleviates the frustration for those who prefer to ""just drive"" and are not into the driving optimally for each turn and whatnot. I also really enjoyed the way the career mode works, as it made it seem like you were an up and comer. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised and did manage to beat the campaign mode. 8/10 "

												I have really been enjoying GRID 2. It is a hybrid sim/arcade racer. By that I mean you do need to break, and you do need to know how to go around corners, but with a very high incorporation of drifting and forgiveness. There are only two real downsides to this game: There are no online games anymore, rendering half of the game useless, and the AI can often times be infuriating. The AI very clearly has a set idea as to what it wants to do, regardless of where or what the players car is doing. There is very clearly no connection between the AI and where the player is.			"

												Grid 2 is a great looking competent racer let down by numerious dumb decisions by Codemasters. Firstly they completely removed the cockpit view leaving you with a crappy bonnet view or outside view. This was probably to save development time but it just felt extremely lazy for a AAA racing title. Secondly they totally overhauled the driving physics. The cars don't feel realistic to drive anymore and you are pretty much forced to drift around every corner to win the races. The racing feels closer to Daytona, Ridge Racer or Outrun which really doesn't mix well with a realistic damage model.Lastly the story is rubbish. You're an up and coming racer taking the social media by storm which just feels really dumb. The cutscenes are cheesy and only get in the way of the racing. Overall the single player just isn't a very fun experience.This only leaves multiplayer and considering the car physics and lack of a cockpit view will turn away most enthusists that played the original game, I can't see many people sticking around for it.Visually it looks good although it loves to throw insane amounts of motion blur and there is some horrendous looking textures under the cars when they start breaking apart. It's definitely the weakest Codemasters game running on the Ego Engine from a visual standpoint.The game is also jam packed full of DLC and you can't acquire many high tier vehicles without dropping extra money into the game. This really makes the game feel incomplete and that's something most people have come to expect from Codemasters sadly.Overall, I'd only give this a look if you're after an arcadey racer and it's extremely cheap. I can't recommend this game to serious racing game fans at all.			"

												4/10 This game can be very fun, but the AI can not detect you AT ALL, they will brake when they are in front of you, so you can not move, they will smash into you with full force when they want, sometimes you can not even finish a race because the ♥♥♥♥ing stupid AI can not detect you, this game took a lot of effort, but when it came to the AI they did no work at all, oh I forgot to mention, online servers are only in your area, not public, so you can never find anyone online unless you live in the UK or USA. However this game can be tremendously fun arcade drift racer, and if you know how to do good handbrake turns, you will dominate ... oh nevermind, your drift was ruined by the ♥♥♥♥ing AI who is braking at the wrong time as ussual, however if you have a lot of patience, this game will be the best racing game ever. Changng dificulty makes almost no difference at all, because you cant finish the race because of the AI in front of you			"

												I compare this game to Mario Kart Wii, Why you ask? Because most people like a game they can master ( Yes you can master Mario Kart Wii), but its pretty hard to master,  but once you do you'll love it even though im sure some people use this game to just goof off in, crash cars, and just flat out have fun! To tell you the truth thats all I did in this game for about a year (Don't worry it wasn't online) and I had a blast! I think Codemasters took out driving assists in Grid 2 to just create a new type of racing game or now that I think about it completely reverse how nearly every other racing game is. For example Forza, Gran Turismo ect. all those game are about hitting the apex of each turn perfectly and making sure to put on the brakes at the exact right time. Well in Grid 2 its just about the oppsosite you still want to to get a good angle on a turn but if you haven't already noticed you are meant to drift around every turn and if you don't like that DO NOT buy this game! because its all you do in it! If you are looking to buy this game. 1. MAKE SURE TO GET THE DEMO FIRST!  2. Get it and its DLC when it goes on sale (Cause it gets pretty cheap)Also playing with the keyboard is pretty good, but a Xbox 360 controller (or somthing like it) is recommended.			"

												On the whole there is much to recommend this game, but I think it is not in any way a racing game for the novice or hobby racing aficianado.  Tracks are beautiful, the sound is fantastic, race modes are surprisingly diverse and engaging, course layout is well-balanced and challenging, but there are a few significant shortcomings that easily-frustrated racers will struggle with.  AI is atrocious and will run you over in the pursuit of their racing line, any collision with AI vehicles will remove all steering capacity from your car until you disengage (meaning you will have to brake as the AI won't do so to disentangle itself), and the game's inexplicable career decision to constantly shift you between disciplines and vehicle classes will rapidly grow weary.  It is almost impossible to develop any kind of racing groove when you are boomeranged between track toys, drift cars, and heavy upper class vehicles that steer like couches.  And then the shuddering camera - evidently set that way to give the sensation of car vibration and sway - will give you fits if you suffer from any kind of motion sickness.  In the chase view, and especially racing at night, the sway becomes infuriating and actively impedes developing skill and consistency.  The handling can be an issue, too, but with practice you will get a solid handle on how cars respond to steering inputs, and indeed the (unalterable) steering sensitivity comes to make sense with time.  In the end, the game is excellent, but is perhaps not suitable (re: fun) for gamers not familiar with its quirks and oft-puzzling handling/viewing designs.  The difficulty slider can only help with the competitiveness and timing of the AI and cannot help with those issues that are most likely to cause the greatest frustrations: camera shudder, collision detections, and erratic career arc.Mac-specific notes: the game performed fine - and indeed better than most Codemasters titles have for me! - crashing to desktop only 1 time.  Menus are easy to negotiate and understand, although there is no slider to adjust steering sensitivity and linearity.  On just a few races there was significant screen-tearing as well as general hiccups on loading screens, but for the most part these did not influence the game negatively.EDIT: after further time with the game, new issues which have resulted in its removal from my installed library - without finishing the game campaign - have popped up.  The WSR in Asia section offers a mix of race types with restricted car selection; many of these vehicles are ""grip"" RWD which behave in unpredictable ways.  The light track toys, for example, will sometimes drift as instructed and on other sweeping turns will not.  Combining unpredictable handling response with downhill driving at high speeds and ridiculous amounts of camera shake ended with me terminating the game.  Speeds that would result in my car being unable to steer were met by the AI with no issue at all, in fact the AI gained speed on some corners!  The difficulty spike is understandable, but I have zero desire to grind seconds off of long, twisting races where I cannot guarantee that handling will remain the same upon application of braking and throttle.  And elimination races with drift cars became simply tedious; starting in 9th with a drift car that you can not drift with - because contact with any other racer causes you to lose all steering regardless of contact point - makes it less a race and more a demo derby.  The game is still recommended, but only to racers of sufficient patience and understanding to deal with the game's plethora of puzzling design schemes.			"

												This game is pretty bada$$, if you do end up playing make sure you have a wheel. Controllers suck in any racing game i think except for shift 2 which i thought was really bad. Yes it's true its no simulator but its quite fun to play. Might have people complaining about the cars drifting, i would like for you to really think this one out. If you are speeding 140 and you are going to hit a semi-sharp to sharp bend, ""YOU ARE GOING TO DRIFT!"". Lol well thats my say-so and if you don't like it you can shove it!			"

												Hands down the best racer I have played in a long time. Heres Why.Pros:+ Perfectly balanced between arcade racer and simulator+ Great selection of tracks, cars and game modes available + Graphics are very impressive, lots of good lighting, world effects and damage looks great+ Overall a good online experience+ Awsome sequelCons:- Alot of the cars are only unlockable through DLC- Can occasionally get repetitive tracks in WSR Career Mode- They removed the in car view (not a big problem as alot of people didnt use it)8.5/10			"

												This game is excellent! All though theres no Cockpit view, it's not a game ruiner. I love the fact that theres more custmaztion options now, and it makes the game better in my opinion. The handling physics are also pretty good, the idea of drifitng around the track in order to go the fastest possible, is actually surprsingly good, and gives the game a great arcade feel to it. I'm not disappointed and am looking forward for future GRID titles. As a Reloaded edition owner, the DLC's are very worth while in my opinion, 50$ worth of items for just an extra 20$. That's a good deal. This game is one of the best PC games out there for the PC. My only wish is for Drag Races in the next GRID title.To conclude my review, the game is probably the best Racing Game on Steam. Keep up the good work, codemasters!Rating: 9.1/10 "

												""Recommend""? Yes. But by the smallest possible margin.(On bad days, ""No""!) If Administration were better, this game would be aslam-dunk piece of awesomeness. But, it's not.Call it 2.5 out of 5 stars(average of 0 for administration, and 5 for driving.)TWO parts of Grid 2:-- administer the game, and-- play the simulator.In Grid 2, I count using the steering wheel, brakes, etc.  to drive acourse as Playing, and everything else (getting online, creatingraces, finding a race, quitting, etc.) as Administration.Playing is phenomenal (5/5 stars)! It just about balances out the rest of theproduct, because _everything_ else is a miserable, tedious, annoying,and frustrating experience, one which, had I known before purchase,would have caused me to look elsewhere -- anywhere else (0 stars).Here are a few examples:1. A race could take anywhere from a few seconds to hours (depending   upon settings and the point at which you arrived). A typical race of   a lap or two might take a minute or two to play. But, it takes   almost that long to start the next race. Literally, you are waiting   as much, or more, than you are playing.   Solution - I set longer races, 4 or 5 laps or more - though that   has it's problems, too. How long should a new arrival have to wait?   There should be no waiting for players to do stuff - such as while   looking at/changing cars. If I am joining the race, I should have   made those decisions first. If I am changing to a new car for the   next race, allow me to make a request (e.g., poke the F12 key   during the LOAD process), and THEN delay to give me time (e.g., 20   seconds so I can choose a new car). 20 second countdowns between   races is ridiculous!2. Sound stutters, especially between races when LOADING the next.   Put audio communication on a separate thread!3. User interface - certain things should be changeable on the fly.   I prefer to leave talking on (not Push-To_Talk). But, when the kids   start carrying on, or the TV, etc., I want to change this - worse   yet - when it happens at my buddy's house, I want HIM to change it.   But we don't because it means leaving the simulator, making the   change, then waiting until the next race begins. And that's   tedious!4. When a new race starts, show race characteristics:    Damage is on, Collision is on, etc.   I _want_ people to know race settings. Especially since I leave the   race open so anyone can join. And I want people to know that, if   they play crash derby, their car won't last any longer than the   ones they hit.5. Be consistent about behavior. For example, there should be an Exit   or Back option on EVERY non-race screen.    Much of the behavior looks like each Developer just ""did their own   thing"" when they designed and wrote the component.   For example, if at the Online race board screen, how to Quit /   Back?  Not mentioned (and it's an error in a lot of places, don't   just add it here, add it wherever it isn't!)6. Quitting the game can be a nightmare! I should be able to hit the   ESC key, anyplace in the game - even while racing, and see   appropriate Options, one of which should always be Quit. Sometimes,   I have to leave _now_. I don't want to argue with the computer   about whether I can shutdown now, I don't want to wait while it is   dislaying ""Longest Online Drift"". I want out, now!   There was even a scenario in which I had to finish creating the   race, then race it, just so I could Quit. Bad. Very Bad.7. When I create a game, I should be able to start playing it, even if   there is no one else to race [yet].   Right now, you have a huge problem - people can only Online-Race if   there are two or more people ready to race - me and my buddy. No   buddy? Then no race.   I'm not going to create a [custom] race because I'm not going to   sit there for an indefinite amount of time waiting for someone else   to show up. I can't race without them, and I won't wait for them.   Not a great Online situation.   I should be able to either race myself, or race the AIs, until   others arrive.8. When I am waiting, e.g., as a new arrival to a Race group, for the   current race to finish so I can join the next, I should be able to   Spectate. I want to do _something_ enjoyable while waiting, perhaps   several minutes, for the current race to finish. Right now, I have   to twiddle my thumbs, because the race in progress could take 1   second or several minutes (10+) to finish (no indicator).   If I walk away, I might miss the start of the next race, but, if I   have to wait, I might get so bored I write critiques of Grid 2.   An alternative to ""something to do"" is to allow me, as a new   arrival, to take over an AI vehicle, e.g., the last one.   I'd create a new option for game configuration:       New arrivals must wait for a new race, or       New arrivals may take over the last place AI car.   People should not have to wait!9. In the category of not waiting, At the end of a race, the program   displayes the finish-board, alternating with lap times. Useful.   Then it makes me wait while ""LOADING ..."" twiddles. No, bad!   One thread should be displaying the leader board, the other thread   should be loading the next race. (for the same old reason, Don't.   Make. Me. Wait.) Display the Leader board at least twice, but   otherwise as many times as necessary to allow the LOADING to   finish.10. Settings were at the ""intermediate level"".  I suspect a newcomer   to the gaming world would have some minor grief.  (In this case, I   might not call it ""bad"", just a ""lot of room for improvment"").   It was not always clear what or how to set things. If you have some   experience with this sort of thing, you'll figure it out quickly,   if not, choosing settings may be a bit awkward.   For example: Under Options > Controls, Arrow to the option you want   to change, hit Enter to put in change mode, poke desired button,   switch, or key to set. When all set, hit ESC to return to the   previous panel.   Anyone should be able to install the game, select a Help button,   and get the gist of how to do things, whether trivial like setting   action keys, or much more complex - like what the various options   in Create Race > Tier are.   You support the Logitech G25 - great! But, I can't seem to use what   are called ""Buttons 1-4"", button 4 is considered the default PTT   button, and it does not work (you'll probably want to set that to   button 8 so it's easily accessible while racing - if you like   Push-To-Talk). Why - is there something I must do? (they work in   other apps).In summary, this is a great racing game, from a racing / drivingperspective. And I highly recommend it based on that, but thatalone.EVERYTHING except the driving is an annoying, frustrating hodge podge,apparently designed and built by the lowest bidder; and if I had knownI would have all the problems we had before hand, I would definitelyhave looked elsewhere for a racing simulator.However, note that the problems I described above are the types ofproblems that can be ""easily"" fixed via a patch release. You don'tneed to change the racing process, scope new tracks, design new cars,reconsider the physics of the simulation. That's all done, andincredibly well. It's all the glue that binds the parts together thatneeds a [major] overhaul.Version 2.1, anyone? "

												This is a very good game, different from the origional grid and still excelent. You get put straight into the main race event (unlike grid), there is no money and the cars are given to you as the game goes on. Money is replaced with fans, this is a bit strange but does not have a big impact on gameplay. There are also alot of tracks and cars (more than the origional) and the races are not all lap races, and are generally more interesting. The events available are also different to the origional and the game looks alot nicer on highest settings. On low settings it still looks better than the origional grid (not by much) meaning it will still run on a relative toaster of a PC (such as mine).The issues i have had.1. in the 11h of playing this game i have had it crash twice (crashed the game and steam). This happened right at the end of races each time and i lost the progress for that race (all the other races were saved as the auto-save is excellent).2. as per usual on all codemasters driving games i have owened (Grid, Grid 2 and Dirt 3) the character model in the car you are driving completely dissapears. This does not affect gameplay much in this game as there is no internal cam (unlike the origional grid). I have contacted the devs about this glitch and they were not able to tell me anything about it. IF YOU GET THIS PROBLEM PLEASE REPLY TO THIS (the devs suggested it may be something to do with windows 8).3. The co-driver is the most condisending back seat driver in the world. I have actually rage quit entirely because of him. I was in first and bushed a wall... ""You'll have to make up for lost time"" etc. He is so annoying.Over all an excellent game and i would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a nice, well made, racing game.			"

The guy in the tutorial is really friendly and encourages you to race, and the cars and graphics are stunning, however my car's handling is bad, i'm not sure if it is me (i am a beginner) or the game. Anyways, this game allows you to rewind if you messed up on an area of the track (eg. a turn) , so you can correct the mistake without restarting the race. Be sure to read the game's info log to see if your computer is able to run it. GOOD GAMING EVERYONE!			"

												Cheaters! Speed boost and extra grip - two most common. And the only way to get rid of them is to report steam profile. Codemasters don't give a f**k about this problem. As for Valve I dunno if they ever issued a VAC ban for this game. It's a real shame because the game runs smoothly and it's enjoyable. I have no DLC and frankly I don't care. These RaceNet challenges don't pay too much eighter and it's like a single player extension really. I would give it solid 8/10, but because of cheaters it gets 5/10.			"

But there are times that I feel like playing them and this one is a great one. If you want a great looking racer with a great feel to the cars then you will like this.

												Fun game pretty good deal for $12.49 couldn't pass this Racing genre.  Great Graphics, gameplay, cars, but I still miss GRID 1's original cockpit view as to the 2nd version lacking it :(  Just a way of lazyness on the developers part.  They took it out using a 1% users use cockpit view shouldn't matter it's a racing game all racing games should have this view no questions asked.Multiplayer is a blast especially bringing back Destruction Derby.  Single player would be ok if they didn't make the opponents over powering like when you want to make them wreck they have way too much power over you from making it possible you either have to go 100mph to side swipe them to even get into any collision, other than that good luck trying at any other speed, please make this an option or fix, thank you.

												It's a very enjoyable racing game, but has its ups and downs. I actually got into the original GRID very late, having picked it up on sale a few months before I bought GRID 2. The handling and the gameplay is very similar in both titles, even the drifting, in my opinion. Yes, there is a lack of in-the-seat first-person perspectives, which is a shame (even though there are no-car 1PV and over-the-hood 1PV); though to be honest I have always been a 3PV player when it comes to racing games so it was of no consequence to me.The base price of the game is steep, though, as is the $30+ for the DLC. I picked up both during the Steam Christmas sales for a total of ~$25, which I think it a fantastic deal.The campaign mode is a lot more linear and simplistic than the original GRID, though. You no longer have the ability to hire on an additional driver to your racing team, which is something I miss. Rather, you essentially just beat other racers to gain popularity for Callahan's World Series Racing ... thing. And then beat them again the the actual WSR. The AI in the single player is pretty simplistic as well, and follows very predictable driving lines (and will predictably crash into you without a care in the world), and usually brake far too early. Getting through the campaign on normal difficulty will make you better than a lot of the players you find in multiplayer though >.>The multiplayer is a whole other deal. You buy cars with money you win in races, which is fine, but unfortunately there's also a leveling system applied. And it's VERY much a grind. I've been playing a lot since I got the game ~3 weeks ago, and I'm only at level 12 of 99. You can't even start unlocking Tier4 cars until you hit level 20-something, so prepare to play Tier1 and Tier2 a lot, unless you're happy with crappy loaner cars in T4 (or... buy DLC). It will take you something like 20 races just to get to level 2. Thankfully, there is also an enjoyable Global Challenges system that will give you a needed XP boost, but it only cycles weekly. DLC can give you an edge, but at the same time hosts of custom games can just turn DLC off, so ... yeah.Speaking of DLC: Yes, I picked up the All-In DLC pack while it wa on 66% off, which was a good deal. Here is my general take on the packs:- The Spa Francorchamps pack is worth it for the track alone. Haven't had much time with the cars to make an opinion on 'em.- The Bathurst track pack is kind of meh.- Demo Derby is fun and free.- Peak Performance Pack looks like it's a bad deal, but is actually decent. In the MP, you can upgrade cars to make them perform better. If you upgrade them fully, they get ranked a Tier higher than usual. The Peak Performance cars are all Tier1 cars upgraded into Tier2, BUT these DLC 'performance' cars actually perform a bit better than their counterparts if they get fully upgraded. Thus, a fully upgraded Volkswagen Golf R in Tier2 will be slightly worse than a 'Golf R (Performance)'. Additionally, some of these cars are ones you'd want to have in both tiers anyway.- The Classic Grid pack gives you two very enjoyable Tier4 cars from the original GRID, but I'm not convinced that they're necessarily better. The DLC Koenigsegg CCGT is significantly slower than the Koenigsegg Agera R (which is the fastest GRID2 car in the game). Not bad cars, though.- The IndyCar is pretty nice, but you're not going to find a lot of ppl using it much.- No opinions on the rest.			"

												I have been a huge fan of Grid 1 and in general love racing games, keeping that in mind i have to say I have had a blast and alot of fun playingthis game, yes it might not have cok-pit view and the cars may not drive like a simulator but who cares as long as it gives you a challenge and fun, which a lot of games fail to do. It is a must own and take my word for it you will love it. If you want a sim get forza or gran turismo which arent as fun as blasting down the road at 200mph and drifting past rivals :)			"

												Having also played Grid 1 to death, I'm quite baffled with the negative reviews, as it seems we're playing different games compared to my experience with Grid 2.Firstly I have to say I'm playing with an Xbox360 controller, so I can vary the throttle on the trigger (gas pedal).The cars all handle differently (as they did in Grid 1), but where as in the first game you had to re-adjust your gamepad per car in order to tame it, in Grid 2 you simply learn the car instead.  This makes for a far more consistent experience, and one that gets you playing the game, rather than messing with the right control balance, only to have to change it for the next car. If you play this on easy difficulty, you'll probably not get much out of it.  However, turn it up to medium or higher, with Damage and you're really getting into the fun of things on your way to mastering the game, and enjoying nail biting races!Grid 2 is far more about understanding your car, choosing the right ride for the race, and reacting to the track. There are tight time attack races with blind corners, and slopes that challenge you to rethink your breaking point, as your breaking is lighter due to the car lifting off the track a little more...it's subtle, but genious!  In one race mode the track layout changes per lap, throwing a few surprises here and there! It makes for an exilarating atmosphere with other racers breathing down your back. Some of the drivers are also deliberately aggressive! I generally try to avoid them damaging my precious paintjob! If you're lucky enough that your name is in the audio name files, your car mechanic calls you by it during races, ""That crash looked nasty Jim!"" and so on! It's a little detail that adds a personal touch.Personal Rating: Good racing, especially on medium and higher difficulty! Great control with an xbox360 controller. Amazing Graphics and visible damage! Score Rating: 90% - A solid driving experience!			"

												This game can be fun to play, but overall, I've found it to be a waste of my time. The big gripe I have about GRID 2 surrounds the difficulty settings. NORMAL is too easy for me (I win every race), but when I move it up to HARD, there are races that are virtually impossible to win. 95% of the time, I start in the back third of the grid at the beginning of the race (in 200+ races, I’ve started on the front row ONCE, and I believe it’s the only time I’ve started in the front two rows), and by the time I fight my way through the traffic into 2nd place, the guy in 1st (who almost always started on the front row) is 5-10 seconds ahead of me.  I normally race well enough to gain on him, but that huge lead he gets off the front row (while you are being held up by the rest of the field) is insurmountable, because he never makes a mistake.  This is especially the case in the coastal/mountain races (point-to-point vs. circuit).  I also find a few of the vehicle challenges to be too difficult on HARD.  I wouldn’t have too much of a problem with it if you could fail on one vehicle challenge and move on to the next, but say you have three challenges and you can’t get past the first one – you can’t move on to the other two.  A new vehicle challenge doesn’t become available to run until you’ve passed the one before it.  So you could end up missing out on multiple cars, because you can’t get past one challenge.  If you could choose each challenge individually, that would solve the issue as far as I’m concerned.  I’d miss out on some cars because I couldn’t earn them (or didn’t want to waste two hours trying to get a perfect run in), but at least I wouldn’t be missing out on cars that had nothing to do with the challenge I couldn’t pass.

												Best driving game ever.  Following in the footsteps of GRID and its predecessors.  I was convinced that these guys were making the best racing games on PC (perhaps even better than GT4 on PS) ever since I sat down to play Toca DTM Race Driver 2 back in 2005.  This game doesn't disappoint.  The commentator is a bit annoying but otherwise its a phenomenal game with fantastic balance between fun and simulation and the cars/graphics are unmatched even by GT because let's face it, no console game ever looked better than the same game on PC at 1080p with max AA and Anistropy.

												We have only had this game for a few days, but it keeps us playing it to get to the next round.  At times there is screen problem, even with a 144 hz setup.  The game can be fun once you get used to the controls and start winning the races on Very Easy.  It's a nice game to kill time with and it's not overly complicated.  Graphics are beautifully done, but sometimes they break up during the race.  Courses do provide a welcome break from a circular race track.			"

												It was one of my favorite racing games until I reached the end-game part.Towards the end, it gets very repititive.A complaint I often see with this game is the handling, like how all the cars are so extremely drifty and what not.I was able to deal with this and I for the most part mastered the controls, but near the end all you're given are supercars which are just AWFUL to drive.I get that it's an arcade-y video game, but these cars are just a chore to control.I used to enjoy this game greatly, but nowadays I just can't play it without getting angry at the awful controls the supercars have.

												A pretty solid single player racer with sweet eye candy and a lot of nice and varying tracks. As in every Codemaster racing game there may not be a huge amount of tracks and during the single player campaign it might get a bit repetetive but in a nutshell the game  stands a solid ground. For multiplayer, unfortunately, many of the tracks, especially the ""tube"" ones are very narrow and the game is harsh with punishing small errors or collisions with other drivers, which will ruin the fun, when up to 12 competitors are rallying on the track.If you want to have a nice single player racer, go grab it. If you seek multiplayer >>fun<< you better get another title.			"

I was really looking forward to the online competitive play but I found out that the community has ... DIED ... there are no games online that could be found ... unsure if it's my time zone which is the problem?

												Visually stunning and a nice simulation driving experience.  My two negatives are music options, how hard is it to embed a streaming music service into the engine? Attach to a Pandora, Spotify, or simlar service and it seems we would have a better personally tailored soundtrack. Licensing I think would be the issue but still.. dreams. The 2nd downside is the lack of a cockpit view.  As is the closet I can get is with my face on the hood staring at the ram air scoop. While that is still a nice picture some vehicles it is easy to lose the center causing for some confusion while driving.			"

												Arghhh!  The mandatory career story line at the beginning is tedious.  Is this an RPG or a racing/sim game?  The game appears to be useful as an introductory type game, though.  And, once you get past the opening career races in the crappy Mustang, the races are more fun.  The DLC's improved the playability exponentially.  Haven't tried multi-player yet...  I purchased the game 66% off.  At that price the game is worth getting, but wouldn't recommend at full price.			"

												The graphics are better than Grid1 but the gameplay is pretty similar while driving but with less choice in what sort of races you do.

After restarting you are classed as DNF on the event and have to do the whole thing again.Buy grid 1 instead.

												Many people criticize this game for what they wanted it to be, rather then what the game trys to be. This game is arcady drifty slidy physics. Which aren't bad, I enjoy flinging cars around corners sometimes. GRID 2's physics are RELIABLE, if you start drifting and know how to control it, you can do very well. You have to learn the foreign physics model before you can truely do well.Personally, I like GRID Autosport more since it is a bit more simulatory (?) but I still enjoy a GOOD arcade racer, which GRID 2 delivers.

												Casual racing game is what I expected, but became disappointed and will not play this again. The physics of the game are such that the car takes impossible beatings, fine, that's kind of what we expect in a casual race game. I'm glad I don't completely smash my car when I run into a car beside me or a guard rail on a curve. However, when I run into a simple street sign that stops the car dead in its tracks, it's very frustrating, especially in a limited time race. Very poor insight for a race game. The physics of this genre make it fun, this game isn't fun. I would have refunded but bought it in advance during a sale and played it later on.			"

												Played the crap out of this game on PS3! To me, Grid and Grid 2 are 10x's better than any of the Need For Speed Title. They just bring so much content to racing thats different and how it's delivered is what keeps me coming back for more. I highly recommend Grid and Grid 2. The racing is fun with just the right challenge. Grid Autosport doesn't know if it wants to be an arcade racing or racing simulator. Just stick with 1 and 2.			"

												Short:   Gameplay 6   Story 4   Graphics 8   Sound 6   Replay Value 4   My Score 5 Grid 2 (stylised as GRID 2 and known as Race Driver: Grid 2 in Japan) is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters and is the sequel to 2008's Race Driver: Grid. The game was released for Microsoft Windows on 28 May 2013 in North America, 30 May 2013 in Australia, 31 May 2013 in Europe and 25 July 2013 in Japan. The game includes numerous real world locations and cities such as Paris. It also includes motor vehicles spanning four decades. In addition, it includes a new handling system that developer Codemasters has dubbed 'TrueFeel', which aims to hit a sweet spot between realism and accessibility.This Racing game gave me a nice experience, and the True Feel handling system is good. I don't know actually where should i start, it has a little storyline, the graphics is simple and nice, and the HUD is clear. The cars are nice, the sound of the engine perfect, i only missing the good music, sometimes we get a little adrenaline pumping music but that's it.Tuning is nice, not much but nearly enough, as for me i didn't like the camera when you checking the car at tuning. I'm missing the Engine tuning parttoo. Usually when the car crahsing its nice and good, but sometimes it's just slury rucky... The physics are bad in the game, the crashes are nice but u got a little slow motion video cut when you crash and that's it.There are 60 ahcievements but you can get 50 with the original game, you have to buy DLC to get +10....So you can get nearly 83% ahcievement without DLC's. Once the opponent is retired that was funny so i just had to drive. A Question why did i smashed my new McLAREN MP4-12C car on the Californian track? :(The answer is that, a squarriel was running trough on the road... :DI think the game at the end a little bit annoying with that much point system. Uhm i mean a lot... for everything if u go to the bathroom that count points...The game good. Totally worth!Pros:  -Nice cars, car details.           -Rubber smoke perfect.           -Rims           -Manual shifting (so awsome, do not start with automatic shift! :) )           -Crash system (Mostly good)           -So many race types.           -The view of speed or speeding.            -Exhaust flame.Cons:  -Tuning Camera           -No engine tuning / setup (just in online mode)           -Physics			"

												Was hoping for a good sucessor to GRID. However, GRID 2 disappointed me with drifty and arcadey handling of the cars. So if you like racing sims, this might not be as enjoyable as GRID, if you like arcade type of games Single Player in this game might be your thing. Don't buy it for the Multiplayer part as it riddles with cheaters and trainer bots.			"

												I would recommend this game to all the people that are a fan or racing. Grid 2 has cars from different tiers, so lets say you like classic cars and another likes sports cars. Grid 2 includes all of that, especially the realistic crashing and racing graphics. The details are what make a game popular, and this game shows a potential chance of that happening for first-time players.			"

												GRID 2 is a really good experience for those who like racing games. I really enjoy the flashback feature, because time to time, theres that one race where I keep crashing into a wall, thats something I almost take for granted. And also it doenst have the most up-to-date cars, but for what it is, its very fit into today's sort of design for games. All in all, this game is really enjoyable to anyone who likes racing games.

												First of all, this developer has succeed to manage the storyline, making a racing game more intense with it. Truly beautiful work. Graphic quality isn't bad for a 2013's released game, and the engine sounds is pretty impressive. Hearing how the tires squeaking in the race really forming a race atmosphere. But compared to Dirt series, (which is well known as rally games and the tires rarely to meet asphalt road) Grid 2 really has an oversteering issue, I don't think my skill is questionable in here. I have playing many many of racing games, but this one, I don't know, it just feel weird for me racing above the asphalt road and found my car oversteering excessively. It's like driving over muddy streets, and makes me wondering ""a well made car like Koenigsegg Agera has this bad quality of traction?"" to this point, your realistic racing simulation are really questionable, Codemaster. The last thing what I hate the most is, where the hell is the cockpit perspective? Do u really think you can feel a Pro atmosphere in a racing circuit without a cockpit perspective? That's a shame. I say NO for this one, only for this one.			"

												I am not normally one to write a review on a video game, but seeing as this one is currently on sale i feel it is my duty to warn potential buyers of the product bieng offered. THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE!!!! It is pretty, it is tense and you will want to win, unfortunately you will not. What you will do is hit start, scroll to restart (race) and continue to be humiliated in one of the following fashions.1. You will start in last or next to last in almost every event. you will be blocked by the ""AI"" until the first place car is 7 miles ahead, you will wreck in a frantic attempt to catch up.2. You will manage to be in first, you will wreck.3.You will have some form of idea how to drive your car....this will change due to inconsistant physics several times per race...you will wreck.4. I dont know about four...the first three were frustrating enough.Now for some bad race game staples...... 1. Starting in last place no matter what your current standing is. Check 2. Magnetic walls. Check 3. Penalties for touching AI. Check  3.a  No Penalties to AI for same infractions. Check 4. AI right up your A## no matter how fast you are.. Check 5. RAndom handling physics. Check 6. Annoying generic ""co pilot"". Check There are about 1000 more things I can list but I want to get to my favorite lastly.THERE IS AN ENTIRE SERIES OF EVENTS WHERE YOU DONT EVEN GET TO KNOW WHAT THE RACE CORSE WILL LOOK LIKE. YOU WILL BE FORCED TO DRIVE W NO TRACK KNOWLEDGE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND IF YOU MAKE THE SLIGHTEST MISTAKE YOU WILL LOSE.I hereby suggest to Codemasters to rename this game a more suitable name. Such as  ""Edge of a Playable Game. Start. Die. Restart.0/0 stars, thumbs down, and hell to the Fu#$%in NO!			"

												I played grid 2 as a free acess for 3 days and I absolutley loved it. AUESOME cars, tracks, and graphics. However the crash physics can be a bit unbelivable. The frame bends in ways that look catoonish. Also, there's no way to kill your car. So you can have absolutley destroyed your car cosmetically, but your car will still be able to drive. Also, I played this game hoping to get a simulator, Instead I got a game with NFS type physics. I don't know If they were shooting for an accurate driving simulation game, but that is what the trailers made me think. I sadley have a crap computer but the game still runs at a smooth 30FPS. I have not found any good or bad glitches In the game. Despite the arcade driving physics, and cartoonish crash physics, I HIGHLY recommend this game. I rate this game a 8.5 out of 10			"

												This is an amazingly fun and addicting game, however, it has some major issues that need to be addressed, particularly with it just being able to simply run. I've found that after about 30 minutes of straight play, it starts crashing and rebooting every other race. In the middle of the freaking race. It's ridiculous. I can be almost through with the entire race, then the sound goes out and it totally crashes before automatically rebooting itself. And it obviously doesn't save any data from the race. So if nothing else, that's what would be holding be back from recommending this game. If a fix comes out for it, then I'll be sure to edit the review.Overall: 4/10Fun, but has some major problems.

												There are lots of racing games that are much, much better and fun to play. - Drifting is quite terrible, and there are lots of tracks and cars intended for drifting. This becomes especially irritating when you are forced to race 3 times in a row on the same track.- Physics is total crap.- Menus feel too heavy and slow.- It's too hard to determine which car you should take, their stats all look the same, but handling differs significantly.- Difficulty is not uniform - most challenges are fine, but there are some ridiculously hard ones.- Lots of DLCs.- Maps get too repetitive.- Music? What music?Just pick any other racing game and it will likely be better. Even Grid 1 was better.			"

												So contrary to the negative reviews, I love this game. I picked up this game just yesterday on sale and it's the best 7 bucks I have ever spent. I see a lot of people saying that this game is all about drifting, and it isn't. Yes it's a big pat but you can easily make those turns by simply hitting the break and slowing down and make the turn and keep up with the competition. I love this game because to me it is more arcade like in terms of steering the car. The graphics are amazing. I only have GTX 760 and I can play the game on Ultra. The car selection and customazation is not the greatest but enough to satisfy. Overall this is probably the best 7 bucks I spent on steam.			"

												I've nearly played this game twice through, and I'm still loving it. I wish there were a few more actual racing tracks than street circuits but the game, particularly in the latter stages, is hard enough to keep your interest. There is plenty of DLC available but a bit expensive for my tastes, I did buy the Spa DLC when there was a special offer on and may buy more if that offer comes up again. I'm running this game on low graphic detail but at 1080p on a fairly old PC and it runs fine.For me the game gets a 9 out of 10....but then I do love racing games.			"

												Poor sequel to GRiD bound by last generation technical limitations and focus on the casual market. The handling of cars have been oversimplified to the point of game breaking; the game's determination to make you ""drift"" around each and every corner, no matter how slight, means racing lines and skill go completely out of the window making each race feel very monotonous as very little is required of you to complete each track. The handling mechanics go beyond ""crap"" to ""ludicrous"" in certain cars and it's well worth searching on Youtube for a video of the Honda NSX on Grid 2 to see how ♥♥♥♥ poor the game gets in it's attempt at variation in car physics. The easy, uninvolving handling is complimented on single player with A.I from the playstation 1 era. The other cars will stick rigidly to the same racing line every race and inexplicable slow down near the end of the race to allow you to catch up if you've decided to play the game with your feet and found yourself in second place instead of first. Multiplayer is a mess when collisions are turned on thanks to the aforementioned car handling is coupled with the usual mindset of people playing racing games online where they decide to drive at you instead of turning a corner. When collisions are off, it's slightly better but again, thanks to the car physics, tracks are easily completed and winning comes down to who dribbles the least. The graphics are typical of a Codemasters game: very polished with excellent car models and lighting but very flat backgrounds and atmosphere which takes away from how impressive it could look. The developers admission of removing the cockpit view to allow them to improve the visuals explains the game has been developed with the 360 and PS3 in mind, meaning technical limitations a lot lower than a PC could offer and hindering the visual potential massively. The presentation of menus and loading screens is again typical of Codemaster: They're excellent and very polished but again, detrimental to the game. All the fancy effects and and wooshing about in menu screens means you'll be spending more time navigating for races rather than actually driving which is contradictory to what has obviously been intended to be a quick, pick up and play racer. GRID 2 can be summarised by what a user on the game's forums said: ""...made for the Facebook generation."", it's polished and glitzy but extremely oversimplified and has put so much focus onto ease of use for casual players looking for quick rewards that it's actually detrimental to what could have been a respectable IP if it hadn't strayed so far away from what made GRID 1 good.

												After buying GRID 1, I feel like I should change my opinion about this game.Compared to GRID 1, this feels like the Shortened Version of GRID 1.No cockpit view, the narrator is terribly tedious, less cars, extremely lack of car customisation.AI in both games are stupid, but since GRID 2 is newer, I really expect the AI to be a lot better, nope, not one bit however.This game is not a racing simulator anymore, its just an arcade racing game, unrealistic.The money system is replaced with a fan earning stuffs. It's not really fun you cannot use the fans you earned to do other things like buying vehicle, it's pointless.This game is really good; I really tried to like the game, got all DLCs, but no.It lacks too much thing in the game, and I refused to like the game.Buy it only when it's on a huge sale.

												A well-curated car list, a great sense of speed, and a clever career mode combine in a fun, confident racer. It's not Race Driver: GRID, but it's GRID 2 and it knows how to entertain.

The computer drivers seem to be basically immune to ANY car damage whatsoever, and also do not appear to follow the same crash physics as players. I cant tell you how many times I've pushed the rear end of a computer during a slide, only to have them perfectly counter-steer and be unaffected. Yet, I am like a feather in the wind; during any turn or drift, just about any contact will set you into a tail slide, forcing you to mash backspace over and over and over :(			"

												...Sigh.  So much potential, only to be mediocre, bland, and uninspired.  I'm buttmad about the removal of the helmet cam, and the vehicle physics are extremely odd.  Not to mention the AI seems like it was taken straight out of Twisted Metal or Rogue Trip, as their primary objective seems to be to murder you, instead of finishing first.It's decent, and only decent.  It tries too hard to be two things and it fails at both; it is neither a redline arcade racer, or an intense sim experience.  Everything feels watered down and stripped, including the car roster.  It would be a little more forgivable if they gave you more cars in every class to play with, but as it stands the roster is very ho-hum and forgettable.It's a little sad, because the mobile game Real Racing 3 feels more like a true sequel to GRID than GRID 2 does.

												It is a game about cars wot go faste. It's not special in any way. And that makes me kinda sad. The game suffers from a distinct lack of interesting tracks and worse - that handful of tracks that are in the game are being repeated over and over and over and over again. The controls are kind of twitchy, maybe that's a personal opinion but it's too sensitive to my taste. All in all the game feels a bit too arcadey, the strong focus on drifting your car around corners doesn't help either.All in all a standard racing game.

It takes few risks yet scratches many itches, offering a compelling experience to fans on all sides of the racing spectrum. While some will question a few design decisions, the overall package delivers on many levels. Put simply, Grid 2 deserves your attention			"

												Casual racing game is what I expected, but became disappointed and will not play this again. The physics of the game are such that the car takes impossible beatings, fine, that's kind of what we expect in a casual race game. I'm glad I don't completely smash my car when I run into a car beside me or a guard rail on a curve. However, when I run into a simple street sign that stops the car dead in its tracks, it's very frustrating, especially in a limited time race. Very poor insight for a race game. The physics of this genre make it fun, this game isn't fun. I would have refunded but bought it in advance during a sale and played it later on.			"

												I recommend this game only under two conditions: If it's cheaper than it's current price (at this time, $30,) and if you don't mind a game that is more of an arcade race than one with a story (which a lot of racing games are.)To me, Midnight Club: LA was the best racing game I'd ever played. A full city to race around free roaming with a decent story and actual characters with faces to get behind. You don't get that here. You do get an above average racer though (minus some issues with braking) with a decent selection of cars and a not too shabby customization. Again, not on the level of Midnight Club, but it's decent. There is somewhat of a story here, a young newbie trying to get respect on the streets and clubs. There's no free roaming or actualy people to see in the game though, from what I saw.Again if the game is about half it's price it's a decent game if you need to scratch a racing itch, and since the Deluxe Edition of Midnight Club LA isn't on steam as of this time, I would say this game is an ok racer.

												Great racing game, but not as great as GRID. The cars sound and look prettier compared to similar titles on ps3/360.

												This game is flawed. As someone who plays many racing games, what the devs were thinking, I do not know. Your cars are weak, and the AIs are strong. Any collision won't effect them in the slightest, but will send you flying. The game discourages driving collisions, but has an AI that only focuses on running into you.Lord help you if you don't have a controller. The keyboard controls are very poor.I somehow played half way through the game, thinking that perhaps some issues would be fixed later. They were not.I do not recommend this game.			"

												Arcade racers are always a tough game to review. Sim lovers immediately hate them. Action game lovers wonder why there aren't more guns and blood. Car lovers wonder why everything is exploding and breaking and the cars are swerving purposely all over the road. Arcade racer lovers know how much incredible fun can be had playing a gem title like this though. To date, this is my favorite Arcade racer for PC. The rewind function alone is brilliant. But the graphics cars, silly, yet kinda realist physics are all amazing and still look great on new hardware.			"

												The quality is tip-top, the gameplay is very fun.  I'd say it is on the sim side of arcade.  It includes a ""reverse"" feature, so if you completely crash and burn you can back up time and try the corner again.  There is no open world in single player, you just advance your career by running formal race tracks against AI drivers (I have not tried out multiplayer so i can't comment on that).The game doesn't provide a learning mode for beginners; it won't show you a good line for the turns, nor will it start you in low-end non-racing cars to learn how to drive.  It just throws you right in, in a ""drift"" car which can be hard to control.  For beginners, here is the good news:  1) You don't have to win or even do well on the very first race; if you can get your car over the finish line in one piece they fall all over themselvels about how great you are.2) After that, you can play ""custom events"" all you want, with no impact at all on your career.  They give you access to a huge variety of tracks to race in, and you can try out all your cars there too.  If you are brand new, do this and switch to a ""grip"" car; the handling makes cornering SO much easier, and that will help you get a feel for the game.  Also, you can set the reverse feature to unlimited (normally you are limited to 5 reverses per race).3) A few races in, you unlock the ability to test drive solo on a speedway, for more practice.If you want to race some cars around, I recommend this game.

												I'm not gonna make yet another review of this game... suffice it to say: I like it! It took me quite some time to get used to drifting... I'm more a grip and racing line kinda guy... but I like the variety of cars and the fact that they all take some getting used to. Not so keen on certain tracks, though ( HK... WTF§§) and i deplore the absence of some classic tracks (Silverstone, anyone? or let's dream, Donington, Snetterton...)All in all a good game.. defo a keeper.BUT (there has to be one) The online multiplyer SUCKS! Not technically... cars and tracks are great but as long as the game keeps on rewarding bullies and cheats, there's no way you'll be able to even get a ♥♥♥♥ing podium... no matter how good you get... the tracks are unforgiving enough as it is but if you add all the idiots charlied and modded up to the eyebrows to the point they forgot where the brakes are or even what a brake IS.... well that makes the experience somehow less enjoyable.... still playing, though...

												There’s a couple of things I miss about the first GRID:-I’d rather win money instead of fans, it motivated me more because with the money I could buy cars, plus I’d make you think more about the sponsors that you choose being that because of them you could make so much money out of every race.-I loved the camera in first person from inside the car that the original GRID had, it’s a shame that they eliminated that.-I liked more the original’s GRID campaign, the fact that you had to make your own team to compete in the major leagues, instead of making your own championship.But beside all of that the game is great, it’s one of the best racing games out there (it’s my favorite at least), it doesn’t bore you, there’s always something to do, it has great replayability and the campaign is pretty good, the graphics are gorgeous and it is well optimized, also I loved the fact that they added a split screen mode. 100% recommended.

												This is an amazingly fun and addicting game, however, it has some major issues that need to be addressed, particularly with it just being able to simply run. I've found that after about 30 minutes of straight play, it starts crashing and rebooting every other race. In the middle of the freaking race. It's ridiculous. I can be almost through with the entire race, then the sound goes out and it totally crashes before automatically rebooting itself. And it obviously doesn't save any data from the race. So if nothing else, that's what would be holding be back from recommending this game. If a fix comes out for it, then I'll be sure to edit the review.Overall: 4/10Fun, but has some major problems.

												There are lots of racing games that are much, much better and fun to play. - Drifting is quite terrible, and there are lots of tracks and cars intended for drifting. This becomes especially irritating when you are forced to race 3 times in a row on the same track.- Physics is total crap.- Menus feel too heavy and slow.- It's too hard to determine which car you should take, their stats all look the same, but handling differs significantly.- Difficulty is not uniform - most challenges are fine, but there are some ridiculously hard ones.- Lots of DLCs.- Maps get too repetitive.- Music? What music?Just pick any other racing game and it will likely be better. Even Grid 1 was better.			"

												I'm bittersweet about GRID 2 in particular. I love this game. It's good quality, though I'd still say GRID is much better than GRID 2. Where GRID 2 takes the cake is the lack of limitations for online races. Codemasters didn't take the simulation route like they had done with DiRT 3. There are no driver assists options at all, controls are simple and forgiving. POV cockpit mode was never included and I feel like the developers really messed up with that decision. One thing that put a terrible taste in my mouth is the ridiculous amount of DLC available. And let me warn you; it's ALL or NOTHING with the DLC. If you own any DLC another player doesn't have, they will not be able to join your game. You'll have to host without using ANY DLC, that means the free car add-ons aren't available either. I have absolutely no appreciation for how Codemasters is trying to conduct business using this tactic, and it'll probably keep me from buying another one of their racing games in the future.			"

												I would recommend that you only buy this game when it's on sale, and expect to only play single player unless you have some friends that have this game, then it can be really fun. The multiplayer is pretty much dead because bugs and Codemasters did not have any form of anti cheat in the begining few months of this release.  It got very ugly racing online. It was not fun at all, and our cries for bans and a anti cheat seemed to have fallen on deaf ears. To be honest, the first GRiD was far superior to this game in every aspect. But like I said, buy it when it goes on sale, it's still worth getting.			"

												I've revised this review 3 times now.  I played the single player campaign only.  This game would be a lot more enjoyable if I used a racing wheel.  I used an X360 controller and things were frequently frustrating.  It's not a bad game but due to the style of driving you'll be doing you'll have a lot more fun if you're using a wheel.			"

												Grid 2 had me hooked from start to finish. You start out as a nobody in some random race and get noticed by a billionare due to your driving skills. You become the material to promote a new world series - WSR (World Series Racing). Your fame grows, you get contacted by sponsors who want you to take part in various events, you take on more difficult opponents all across the globe and eventually participate in the WSR Grand Finals over a set of races.It's mad action from start to finish.The graphics are fantastic and the car physics are exceptional. You notice a vast difference from driving a FWD car compared to a RWD or an AWD. Each car handles differently and you really need to be on your toes if you want to master it.The game isn't without faults, however. The most prominent among them being the difficulty level. I consider myself a fairly competent player when it comes to racing games; I was playing on Medium from the start and almost the entire game through. Near the end I had to switch to Easy because the AI was just too fast. No matter what you did, they would always catch up. They would overtake you and then you were screwed.Playing on Easy felt too easy and playing on Medium felt like Hard and sometimes Very Hard. It wasn't an enjoyable experience. I don't mind it being difficult, but it should also be fair. It reminds me a lot about the first Need for Speed: Underground game where in the last five races or so the ""Catch up"" was horrendously broken. No matter how good you drove, the AI would always catch up and overtake you and you had no hope of beating them. Only by downgrading the engine in your car would everything work the way it should.While this game portrays the cars and their handling exceptionally well, some cars are just way too finicky. Cars that are normally glued to the road when it comes to handling in real life are suddenly all over the place here. I don't expect a true representation but when other cars in this game are near identical as their real life counterparts, I do expect some kind of resemblance.The tracks are well made but it's only a select few you race on near the end. Some variety would've been nice. That goes the same for the class of cars you're allowed to choose from. Somewhere in the middle of the game you have plenty of choices in what class and what type of car you want to drive, near the end it is only two classes and a select few cars. I would've liked a better selection.I haven't tried online racing so I'm not going to touch on that aspect.All in all, GRID 2 is a great game that offers plenty of action and challenge.FInal Verdict: 7/10. It's a great game but the difficulty level is kind of messed up and lowers the score a bit.			"

												OLD REVIEW: 2 hours played so far. 1 hour yesterday, came back today and my progress was gone. The second hour of playing was trying some fixes from the internet i shouldn't have to do anyway just to play and driving the first track over and over again.Great thing that you can't check if saving works without driving the first track. Like first making a profile, nooooo, that would be to reasonable.Online racing doesn't work either, i can find races but when they start i get disconnected.I probably will try it in the future, maybe if it works then i'll change my review.NEW REVIEW: Stuff works.

												This game has too many faults to ever be good. Physics are highly inconsistent, npc AI is inconsistent. The AI always take corners wide and which inevitably leads to collisions. No matter how you try you always come out as the loser in any collision which means passing is a huge chore. passing is mandatory since you always start close to last place so you can't just stay out front. To top it off in touge matches collision equals disqualification, but if you are in the lead and the npc hits YOU you get disqualified not your opponent; how does that make sense? One last quip that should scare all race fans away is that the npc cars occasionally get ""power ups"" I've been in an identical car to the npc and watched them blow by me on a straightaway like they have nitrous... How do you win when that happens? Simple you can't. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												I really want to like this game, because I always liked Codemasters (CMR 1 on PS one was my first contact). While it's featuring an okay story and pretty cars, it has some issues*Pro:+ The Career+ Variety of cars+ Variety of Races+ Challenges*Con:- The in other reviews mentioned AI drivers, who are sometimes Enzo Ferrari himself, sometimes 3-year-olds- AI pathing and awarenes, they drive like the Player isn't there, so let him crash into their rear end or ram him at full speed.     - In addition, questionable physics: Any contact with AI drivers will make you lose the duel, even if you PIT them with full speed so that their vehicle should spin like yours always does.- Endgame loses quality- NO online communityI picked it up with a Humble Bundle, wouldn't buy it full price, but if it is and you're into racing: give it a try.

												A very solid racer that's worth the cash. It handles a little more loose and fast than the first but I found it to be very enjoyable and it has maybe the best presentation of any racer I've played. My only complaints are that the game gets a little stale towards the end of the single player mode. You're shown all the tracks and modes within the first few hours of the game so the last couple of seasons are a bit tedious. I also wasn't a fan of how 'drifty' some of the top-end cars felt. Other than that, a very good racing game that I'm glad I bought.			"

												I tried so hard to get this game to work for me. I love racing games and this game had good reviews. The handling in this game is absurd. I can't get past the first race  and I am good with racing games. I watched youtube videos because I figured I was doing something wrong, but it STILL feels like I'm on ice the whole time.....on easy mode. I really wish they had a setting for the sensitivity of the buttons, specifically left and right. Wow...I wish I could have my money back. Or at least have the devs adjust the sensitivity so the game is playable. I truely feel that this game was a waste of time and money.			"

												This may not be the racing game you are looking for, so I'd read up on it before buying.Definitely not anywhere near a simulation game - the handling feels exagerated, there is no in car view, there is far too much drifting in pretty much every car and the story mode seems to be obsessed with social media to an embarasing extent. Apparently the online mode is pretty much dead, but I've not really tried it. The DLC seems poorly implemented too - the (numerous) DLC packs add new tracks and game modes, yet those new tracks are only available in free race, not in the story mode.There is a good reason to own this game though - it has a fantastic split screen mode. I enjoy playing arcade racers against people who are in the room with me, and this is one of the best I've come across on PC. If you're like me and looking for decent PC split screen games, I'd recomend picking the complete package up. It's also a good game to have if you're looking for a casual racing game to play single player.If you're a serious racing gamer this is probably not one you'd want to buy.			"

												Well now that I have gridautosport it seems unlikely i'll play this much again. So: The car handling physics are mental and the career mode is shambolic. However no matter how much codemasters claim this is the ultimate simcade the truth is that this game is a laugh. I've had more fun drifting gorgeous cars ( the graphics are suberb) in the 30 hours I've played on it (I know it says 74 but i accindently left it running for a couple of days) than if I played a solid week of playing dirt. And thats what this game is about- fun. So despite it flaws and the fact it dosn't really work as a racing game this game is what games are meant to be about - Fun. As a game i rate 6/10 as a truly worthy waste of time I rate 10/10.			"

												While I prefer racing games more like Forza Motorsport, this is still a fun game. I enjoy the career mode, as it has you doing different types of racing. Whether it's a normal race grid, a head-to-head race or racing for the most drift points. All racing types are enjoyable. and not hard to get the hang of. If you're into arcade racing games, give this a shot.			"

												Positive stuff: technically the game is very good, the engine works nicely and is also light; it works really well on my pc (which is not that powerful). The online works without too much lag, and there are many tracks and cars to choose from; also, the single player career is long.Negative stuff: DLC to unlock cars online.. yeah, not mandatory and you can spend your time, but it's not good. DLCs adding cars and tracks cannot be used in the normal online mode (only custom games). The game tries to be realistic, but then you notice that you gain more than two seconds per lap by DRIFTING, on every turn. The AI is not good, and is quite mandatory to gain at least 3rd place in the first turns if you want to be ABLE to win, no matter how good you're driving; if you don't it's impossibile to gain first place. There's no official cockpit view, and the career progression feels quite anonymous.Conclusion: this game does NOT suck. It's funny, solid and can keep you busy for hours. The fact is that is GRID sequel, and in my opinion the first game was much better in almost every aspect; this doesn't feel like Grid 2, but more like an anonymous racing game.. well done, but anonymous. If you can get it on sale and like racing games go for it, but if you know (and loved) the first GRID then don't expect the same amount of awesomeness.			"

												After playing the first Grid, This sequel was kind of a let down to me due to one feature the original Grid had. This was the inside view with the steering wheel like Dirt had as well. This game is fun but in my opinon I like the original Grid a lot better. The game is still fun and worth playing if you like playing racing games.			"

												Grid 2 is a mix between arcade and racing simulation, not as good as the first one but you will still have a good time with this sequel. Consider buying it on sale.+ Decent variety of events.+ Over 25hs of singleplayer career. + Acceptable variety of cars. + Cars sound really good.+ Optimized and gorgeous graphics.- No cockpit camera.- Tedious loading screens between everything.- Unskippable and unnecessary videos.- Weak online mode.

												Grid 2 truly is an excellent racing game. Firstly, it is very well optimised, running smoothly whilst still looking pretty good even on my crappy laptop. Handling strikes a nice balance between sim and arcade. It's easy enough to get the hang of but rewards those who are more skillful particularly on braking and turn in. The different handling models feel distinct and from my multiplayer experience there isn't one with a severe advantage over the other.  I also think the seperation of single and multiplayer works in the game's favour since moving from one to the other feels fresher than in other games (though some shared progress would have been appreciated). The multiplayer is the stronger of the two but the single player  does have some very good qualities. The game does a great job at creating a convincing scenario for the campaign to take place in and the first half in particular is a lot of fun. However, I found the last season of WSR to drag on a bit due to some tracks being used considerably more than others (if you prefer street circuits you won't have as big an issue with this) though event variety helped aleviate this. Also the car balancing within the classes was questionable at times and in Tier 3 I experienced one event where I felt I could only win in the Caterham/Ariel Atom group though keep in mind  this may have been down to me prefering a grip based driving style. Multiplayer is where you should spent most of your time as the playlist setup for online events is simple and easy to get addicted to. The learning curve was not as steep as I expected thanks to a decent starting car selection which I see being used by more experienced players quite regularly. As for the lack of cockpit view. Its not a sim game. There's a hood cam. It does the job. Use that and have some fun.			"

												Great driving game, with a weird funny plot and amazing graphics! Not a complete winner though. A bit loose driving with both the Xbox gamepad and Logitech Driving Forge GT. More tight handling when driving balanced cars. But you start with drift cars so you should expect to crash quite many times in the beginning.			"

												I hate grid 2 for a lot of subjects.First of all it hasn't got any new ideas between the first episode.Second mistake is the deadly boring gameplay for 20 hours.The difficulty in the game is a joke. In easy at the last season i dont have to win anything easily. Every track (5-8?) is 1:25s long. Lot of different cars, but why?My favourite is the promo event. For 7 minutes i have to drive circle around. :SAND: the horribe AGGRESSIVE drivers.I cant image that in the real life the drivers hit the rivals at 320km/h.The theory of relativity: the phisics on me are different that on my rival.Driving simulator? Without inner camera?Absolutly not entertaining.			"

												All three Grid games are good and each one has a different career structure paradigm. Grid 2 is based on increasing a fan-base that carries you to higher tiers. It's different and enjoyable, but I prefer the structure of the original career. The graphics are far better than Grid, and the gameplay is tight and compelling.			"

												This is my take on this game. Some things are really good about it, but I have some things that I also really don't like. For instance, I love the handling feel of the cars. The environments are pretty good. I dig the story and WSR thing. Things I don't like about it: Nothing but visual customizations. No qualifying (always in 12 at the rear). No cockpit view. The hood view is best, but if the pain is glossy, it's overly done in a way that massive reflections that make cornering totally confusing. Stupid ""light-up"" arcade style arrows telling me where to turn. Overall, it's fun, but we really need less arcade and more simulation. I want a Forza or GT for PC. 6/10 stars.			"

												Grid 2 is the first racing game in a long time that I thoroughly enjoyed. To me, the driving mechanics (drifting, etc.) are quite fun, and once mastered are very rewarding (I have not played Grid 1, so I'm not sure why people complain that the mechanics in this one are trash).Being a perfectionist in racing games, I played on the hardest setting and aimed to get first for every race, this gave me a proper challenge and something that sometimes took many many attempts to achieve and the feeling that I got after achieving  the challenge was amazing.The graphics also deserve a mention, they are fantastic.

												""Recommend""? Yes. But by the smallest possible margin.(On bad days, ""No""!) If Administration were better, this game would be aslam-dunk piece of awesomeness. But, it's not.Call it 2.5 out of 5 stars(average of 0 for administration, and 5 for driving.)TWO parts of Grid 2:-- administer the game, and-- play the simulator.In Grid 2, I count using the steering wheel, brakes, etc.  to drive acourse as Playing, and everything else (getting online, creatingraces, finding a race, quitting, etc.) as Administration.Playing is phenomenal (5/5 stars)! It just about balances out the rest of theproduct, because _everything_ else is a miserable, tedious, annoying,and frustrating experience, one which, had I known before purchase,would have caused me to look elsewhere -- anywhere else (0 stars).Here are a few examples:1. A race could take anywhere from a few seconds to hours (depending   upon settings and the point at which you arrived). A typical race of   a lap or two might take a minute or two to play. But, it takes   almost that long to start the next race. Literally, you are waiting   as much, or more, than you are playing.   Solution - I set longer races, 4 or 5 laps or more - though that   has it's problems, too. How long should a new arrival have to wait?   There should be no waiting for players to do stuff - such as while   looking at/changing cars. If I am joining the race, I should have   made those decisions first. If I am changing to a new car for the   next race, allow me to make a request (e.g., poke the F12 key   during the LOAD process), and THEN delay to give me time (e.g., 20   seconds so I can choose a new car). 20 second countdowns between   races is ridiculous!2. Sound stutters, especially between races when LOADING the next.   Put audio communication on a separate thread!3. User interface - certain things should be changeable on the fly.   I prefer to leave talking on (not Push-To_Talk). But, when the kids   start carrying on, or the TV, etc., I want to change this - worse   yet - when it happens at my buddy's house, I want HIM to change it.   But we don't because it means leaving the simulator, making the   change, then waiting until the next race begins. And that's   tedious!4. When a new race starts, show race characteristics:    Damage is on, Collision is on, etc.   I _want_ people to know race settings. Especially since I leave the   race open so anyone can join. And I want people to know that, if   they play crash derby, their car won't last any longer than the   ones they hit.5. Be consistent about behavior. For example, there should be an Exit   or Back option on EVERY non-race screen.    Much of the behavior looks like each Developer just ""did their own   thing"" when they designed and wrote the component.   For example, if at the Online race board screen, how to Quit /   Back?  Not mentioned (and it's an error in a lot of places, don't   just add it here, add it wherever it isn't!)6. Quitting the game can be a nightmare! I should be able to hit the   ESC key, anyplace in the game - even while racing, and see   appropriate Options, one of which should always be Quit. Sometimes,   I have to leave _now_. I don't want to argue with the computer   about whether I can shutdown now, I don't want to wait while it is   dislaying ""Longest Online Drift"". I want out, now!   There was even a scenario in which I had to finish creating the   race, then race it, just so I could Quit. Bad. Very Bad.7. When I create a game, I should be able to start playing it, even if   there is no one else to race [yet].   Right now, you have a huge problem - people can only Online-Race if   there are two or more people ready to race - me and my buddy. No   buddy? Then no race.   I'm not going to create a [custom] race because I'm not going to   sit there for an indefinite amount of time waiting for someone else   to show up. I can't race without them, and I won't wait for them.   Not a great Online situation.   I should be able to either race myself, or race the AIs, until   others arrive.8. When I am waiting, e.g., as a new arrival to a Race group, for the   current race to finish so I can join the next, I should be able to   Spectate. I want to do _something_ enjoyable while waiting, perhaps   several minutes, for the current race to finish. Right now, I have   to twiddle my thumbs, because the race in progress could take 1   second or several minutes (10+) to finish (no indicator).   If I walk away, I might miss the start of the next race, but, if I   have to wait, I might get so bored I write critiques of Grid 2.   An alternative to ""something to do"" is to allow me, as a new   arrival, to take over an AI vehicle, e.g., the last one.   I'd create a new option for game configuration:       New arrivals must wait for a new race, or       New arrivals may take over the last place AI car.   People should not have to wait!9. In the category of not waiting, At the end of a race, the program   displayes the finish-board, alternating with lap times. Useful.   Then it makes me wait while ""LOADING ..."" twiddles. No, bad!   One thread should be displaying the leader board, the other thread   should be loading the next race. (for the same old reason, Don't.   Make. Me. Wait.) Display the Leader board at least twice, but   otherwise as many times as necessary to allow the LOADING to   finish.10. Settings were at the ""intermediate level"".  I suspect a newcomer   to the gaming world would have some minor grief.  (In this case, I   might not call it ""bad"", just a ""lot of room for improvment"").   It was not always clear what or how to set things. If you have some   experience with this sort of thing, you'll figure it out quickly,   if not, choosing settings may be a bit awkward.   For example: Under Options > Controls, Arrow to the option you want   to change, hit Enter to put in change mode, poke desired button,   switch, or key to set. When all set, hit ESC to return to the   previous panel.   Anyone should be able to install the game, select a Help button,   and get the gist of how to do things, whether trivial like setting   action keys, or much more complex - like what the various options   in Create Race > Tier are.   You support the Logitech G25 - great! But, I can't seem to use what   are called ""Buttons 1-4"", button 4 is considered the default PTT   button, and it does not work (you'll probably want to set that to   button 8 so it's easily accessible while racing - if you like   Push-To-Talk). Why - is there something I must do? (they work in   other apps).In summary, this is a great racing game, from a racing / drivingperspective. And I highly recommend it based on that, but thatalone.EVERYTHING except the driving is an annoying, frustrating hodge podge,apparently designed and built by the lowest bidder; and if I had knownI would have all the problems we had before hand, I would definitelyhave looked elsewhere for a racing simulator.However, note that the problems I described above are the types ofproblems that can be ""easily"" fixed via a patch release. You don'tneed to change the racing process, scope new tracks, design new cars,reconsider the physics of the simulation. That's all done, andincredibly well. It's all the glue that binds the parts together thatneeds a [major] overhaul.Version 2.1, anyone? "

												Grid 2 is just more goodness of Grid 1. If you enjoy the semi-arcade/semi-simulation style of the Grid series then you will likely enjoy this game. After getting used to the controls of the game in general, then getting accustomed to a certain car, you will find yourself flying through corners and overtaking your opponents without as much as a scratch on your vehicle. While I don't enjoy the general interface of the game (I thoroughly enjoyed the trophie room interface of the first game) it is still usable and while I find it less user friendly, it does play into the realism of the overall game. With multiplayer, Grid 2 comes with a split screen feature, which I find is extremely hard to come by these days, especially on PC versions of games. Online is something I haven't spent much time with, you are required to set up an account to access these features, and at the time that I tried, I was having issues with Steam Big Picture mode, issues that were preventing me from making an account. I will likely revisit this review to add comments on multiplayer.As a huge fan of the original Grid, I can easily recommend Grid 2 as fun, fast paced, ""arcadmulation"" racer.			"

												I've nearly played this game twice through, and I'm still loving it. I wish there were a few more actual racing tracks than street circuits but the game, particularly in the latter stages, is hard enough to keep your interest. There is plenty of DLC available but a bit expensive for my tastes, I did buy the Spa DLC when there was a special offer on and may buy more if that offer comes up again. I'm running this game on low graphic detail but at 1080p on a fairly old PC and it runs fine.For me the game gets a 9 out of 10....but then I do love racing games.			"

												It's hard to say about this game mainly because it's a very good game and the game play, graphics, and cars are great. It's a perfect arcade racer and definitely the game for any driving fan. But here's the problem, Single player is fun and addicting, ask yourself do you like that car?? Guess what you're out of luck because in order to upgrade that car in Single player you need to play online and there's a huge problem with that due to the online is DEAD. No one is online at all so you'll have to play the weekly events if you wish to upgrade the car which if the online was still ALIVE I would recommend buying this game but since it's not. I'll say save your money and buy something else.			"

												I really want to like this game, because I always liked Codemasters (CMR 1 on PS one was my first contact). While it's featuring an okay story and pretty cars, it has some issues*Pro:+ The Career+ Variety of cars+ Variety of Races+ Challenges*Con:- The in other reviews mentioned AI drivers, who are sometimes Enzo Ferrari himself, sometimes 3-year-olds- AI pathing and awarenes, they drive like the Player isn't there, so let him crash into their rear end or ram him at full speed.     - In addition, questionable physics: Any contact with AI drivers will make you lose the duel, even if you PIT them with full speed so that their vehicle should spin like yours always does.- Endgame loses quality- NO online communityI picked it up with a Humble Bundle, wouldn't buy it full price, but if it is and you're into racing: give it a try.

												Absolutely FANTASTIC!! this is the most realistic racing sim i'v ever played (aside from the whole rewind thing). The physics and gameplay are outstanding. However i would not recomend this game for the casual  or amatuer racer. In its realism it is often very dificult. I would call myself an experienced racer and I play it on easy, frequently using the rewind feature (don't feel bad if you have to. I don't know if the game would even be possible without it). Also it MUST BE PLAYED WITH A GAMEPAD OR RACING WHEEL. Its physics are so realistic that to control your car you must be able to regulate the accelerator, not just have it floored all the time as with a keyboard. This game is highly underrated. I don't know why its not as well known as some of the other legit racing sims.The devs were unfalteringly focused on making it as realistic as possible. I think it's even more realistic than some of the more popular games like forza.

												A very solid racer that's worth the cash. It handles a little more loose and fast than the first but I found it to be very enjoyable and it has maybe the best presentation of any racer I've played. My only complaints are that the game gets a little stale towards the end of the single player mode. You're shown all the tracks and modes within the first few hours of the game so the last couple of seasons are a bit tedious. I also wasn't a fan of how 'drifty' some of the top-end cars felt. Other than that, a very good racing game that I'm glad I bought.			"

												Once you realize the only effective way to turn is by drifting, you realize that this game lacks versatility.  I will admit it is fun for the first several hours of playing, though.  If you can get it for very cheap, and you love racing games, this game's worth it.  Overall, however, I'd say don't bother.			"

												Another solid racer from Codemasters.The game is based around startting a new racing code that, this gives the objective some cohegency as you jetset across the globe and build an impressive garage.A mixed range of car styles and classes, race events and locaions keep the game interesting. Classic American muscle right through to GT3 spec race cars. Standard races, time trial, overtake specials, drift challenges and head to head one on ones through Japanese mountain roads give good range of play.A tweaked engine that ran the original GRID still has enough power to offer stunning results. The cars sound appropriately meaty too. Music isn't too present, but there's a a cool track that kicks in on the last lap of important races that goes a good way to increasing the drama of the game.My only criticism would be that the earlier stages are more interesting than the latter, and that there isn't any dynamic weather and time of day options.If you're a fan of the original GRID, codemaster racing games, or racing games in general I'd feel pretty safe in recommending this to you.

												I personally really like this game, and I don't see why so many people are giving it bad reviews. I have played DiRT 2 and DiRT 3, and if you like those series then this game wouldn't be bad to try at all. This game is more fast paced than the DiRT series though, and the AI is tons better. On very hard difficulty it is certainly a challenge, and on hard it's still a bit too easy. The only bad thing I can say is that online racing is dead, and there's no cockpit view. Maybe this game isn't worth the entire 30 bucks, but that's only 'cause I find the DLCs to be kind of pricey. All in all, if this game is on sale and you're a fan of racing games, try GRID 2. I use a controller (too broke for a wheel and too much to set up) and I love the handling and feel of the cars. It is a little bit arcadey, and I do admit DiRT 2 feels better, but I'd say it's still passable as a racing sim.			"

												Well now that I have gridautosport it seems unlikely i'll play this much again. So: The car handling physics are mental and the career mode is shambolic. However no matter how much codemasters claim this is the ultimate simcade the truth is that this game is a laugh. I've had more fun drifting gorgeous cars ( the graphics are suberb) in the 30 hours I've played on it (I know it says 74 but i accindently left it running for a couple of days) than if I played a solid week of playing dirt. And thats what this game is about- fun. So despite it flaws and the fact it dosn't really work as a racing game this game is what games are meant to be about - Fun. As a game i rate 6/10 as a truly worthy waste of time I rate 10/10.			"

												I've found 20 hours of enjoyment in GRID 2, though I am a die-hard fan of any racing game released by Codemasters (Dirt Showdown notwithstanding, nobody likes Dirt Showdown). The base game is fun, good-looking, challenging and satisfying, and there can be a lot of fun had with a couple of friends online. Definite recommendation.One word of warning about this game though - to me NONE of the DLC is worth the money you'll pay, even on sale. Currently, you'll pay £3.50 for the luxury of one extra car and being able to drive around Yas Marina in the daytime. I think not.			"

												8/10Visually pleasing and does what it suggests. Cars don't blow up, neither do the environments.I generally do not play racing games. Why? Because there is a lack of XP and/or explosions, etc. That being said, I don't dislike them. GRID 2 is pretty decent. The graphics are solid (though not amazing), and the audio is also solid.  I play using a Dualshock 3 emulated as an XBOX controller, and it works well. Controls were responsive and intuitive. The AI was interesting, although it could have been due to the individual cars - at one point I was in last, managed to weasel my way to first (blasted past a few of them) then suddenly they are blasting past me. Nos? AI might have it, but I didn't. Either way, the difficulty (on medium) felt balanced enough for a novice racer. My main beef with it? I got up to 160 mph and smashed into a wall, and lost a fender. While the damage effects they do have look amazing, they are limited to visual. In HonkKong I crashed (see the pattern) and was greeted by an epic slowmo of the destruction, but i was limited to plastic looking pieces and what appeared to be a rotor ""flying into the crowd"", which were actually just ""cut-out"" All in all, good racing game for racers who focus on the racing. If youre into visually pleasing consequences for your mishaps, look elsewhere.			"

												Beautiful to look at, stunning models. While the driving experience for the first GRID was more realistic, GRID 2 is a little more arcade-y, probably to make it more accessable.

												It's hard to make a review for GRID 2 , long story short as for my taste and expectations I won't Recommend this. But don't let my review think GRID 2 it's a bad game. Why I won't recommend GRID 2 is , for Im more into Simulation Racing. Compared GRID 1 and GRID 2 , GRID 2 it's more of an Arcade style. What I hate most about GRID 2 is the constant oversteer which is actually aim towards for people who likes to see their car drift throughout the entire game. Which also casues bad experience for me as if you tries to turn bit harder your car will automatically oversteers and into a drift which is so unrealstic. I know cars tend to oversteer but not this freaking sensitive and easily. I would Recommend GRID 2 for those who are Casual Racers while those who are looking for a more realistic or simulation racing games best stay clear of GRID 2			"

												If you played Grid, and want to give this game a try because you loved Grid, I would not bother. Because that was me, and I was pretty disappointed by this game. First of all, if you don't have a steering wheel, this game will essentially require one. Also, this game was really designed for kids. The driving is like Need for Speed: Most Wanted, where every turn is a drift and you will eventually just be moping through the game. There are actually too many cars; there too many cars that noone cares about, if that's better. I spent 11 hours to get to classes that aren't even remotely different from the starting class.The graphics are better, to an extent, but way less detailed as Grid. Grid was also way more satisfying, because they also removed the cockpit veiw. The maps are way less interesting and are a total snooze fest. The maps in Grid were better. Way better. I also hate the guy who does things over the mic. He's annoying. And he sounds like he's talking to a 10 year old.In short, this game is meant for a totally different age group. I wouldn't recommend it to any fellow gamer, but maybe for thier kids.			"

												Poor FPS: runs fine for first few races then for some reasons starts to slow down and down and down...Edit: OK, I have figured why the frame rate drops; it is because I have my logitech wheel attached...which is pretty stupid for a racing game which doesn't run smoothly with a wheel attached. As soon as you disconnect the wheel (i.e. use a controller instead) the game runs really well! Given that this Codemaster game don't expect any fixes as they normally abandon the game after a few months,If you play with controller then this is a good arcade racing game.			"

												Best driving game ever.  Following in the footsteps of GRID and its predecessors.  I was convinced that these guys were making the best racing games on PC (perhaps even better than GT4 on PS) ever since I sat down to play Toca DTM Race Driver 2 back in 2005.  This game doesn't disappoint.  The commentator is a bit annoying but otherwise its a phenomenal game with fantastic balance between fun and simulation and the cars/graphics are unmatched even by GT because let's face it, no console game ever looked better than the same game on PC at 1080p with max AA and Anistropy.

												Don't buy this game if you got a Logitech G110 (Gaming Keyboard) Because like every 5 mins will the keyboard freeze on the latest button you pressed.

												Fun game so far. My only complaint is in the AI. The computer drivers seem to be basically immune to ANY car damage whatsoever, and also do not appear to follow the same crash physics as players. I cant tell you how many times I've pushed the rear end of a computer during a slide, only to have them perfectly counter-steer and be unaffected. Yet, I am like a feather in the wind; during any turn or drift, just about any contact will set you into a tail slide, forcing you to mash backspace over and over and over :(			"

												Well how should i put it...... I've read both the positive and negative reviews and I have to say that both these types of reviews hold true to the facts - its just a matter of inclination from the player's point of view of whether they want to bear the opportunity cost stated in the negatives and (want to) play this game. I personally like this game very much but it does have some issues with plain linear racing - by which I mean this game does have problems with its physics (a certain ""overcompensation""), no matter how minor. And yes like another reviewer stated here Grid 2 developers hve gone mad with drifting! They expect a drift for proper corner handling every time a bend comes up! And frankly I'm not a big fan of drifting either. Then there's the damage reporting - which frankly dosen't exist except for a single indicator in the speedometer, and which when compared to Grid 1 (which had 8 - 4 wheels, 1 engine, 1 transmission, 1 suspension and 1 handling) is certainly a big leap downwards. Some will be put off by the abscence of a cockpit view.  Now people reading this review might be thinking why I've recommended this game with all this negativity - well, I'd now would like to tell you why this game pretty much makes its competitors look drab - the graphics is a monumental achievement (compared to Grid 1 - which was pretty darn excellent), the feel and gravity (literally!) is very realistic (albeit slightly problematic physics) - for example you can really differentiate which cars have better torque and which cars have higher rev ranges, and the (car) damage as realistic as ever. So although Grid 2 might struggle to live up to (and even falls short at some points) the name of its predecessor it sure does put one darn good fight with its rivals.			"

												Literally the most infuriating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game I have ever played in my life. I love racing games, have done lots of simulators, and while most racing games may have really unrealistic mechanics, this still manages to eat the ♥♥♥♥ of them all.  Biggest waste of money I've ever made, and I wish I could have it back.  I despise this game with a passion and recommend it to no one.  Only good things are the graphics.  How the environment affects the movement of your car is beyond unrealistic.  If the side of my car barely touches a barrier on the inside of a turn at 100mph, should the car stop moving and not be able to move forward? How does that make any sense at all? The designers need to get their heads out of their asses and figure out what physics are, because with how inconsistent this game is, it sure as hell doesn't follow any.  The handling is awful too.  I have an easier time drifting and controlling vehicles in real life than in this game.  TLDR; Graphics are beautiful, crashes look pretty, handling and physics are some of the worst I've ever seen.			"

												Grid 2 is a great racing game overall. I believe codemasters games did a really great job on the graphics and car driving mechanics. however, i dont like that every time you go around a corner the seems to want to drift. i mean you have to be better than the stig to keep it from drifting. graphics are visually stunning and the damage mechanics are almost that of a soft body physics engine. i will note one problem is that the koenigsegg agera r likes to be a two wheeler in stead of a four wheeled car. the customization should be a little more like forzas and it lacks a first person view and open world exploration. i personally believe that they could have done better with this game. and at that i leave you all to your own opinion about it.

												GRID 2 is to TOCA what Showdown was to DiRT. An overly-americanised, arcady dude-fest that caters to those with short attention spans. That is not to say GRID 2 isn't fun - it's good fun, until you complete career mode or unless you enjoy racing online; because beyond that, GRID 2 lacks depth.GRID 2's impressive array of cars seems to lull you into a false sense of security, as it makes you imagine that the track content lives up to the same standards. But you'd be disappointed, as the small selection of tracks follows Codemasters more recent trends, and the even smaller selection of actual race circuits is plain rediculous. Put together with the fact that this game considers a 6 minute race to be an endurance event and you begin to see why this game isn't truly a simulation.Car handling further follows the arcade trend of this game, as although fun, a great lack of realism again rears its head. GRID 2 rewards you for drifting; so much so that sliding around the corner in an Ariel Atom is apparently far superior to taking the corner like any normal racing driver would.So ok, will this game produce some spectacular youtube videos? No way.  Codemasters took their rediculous camera angles to a whole new level. Replays show very little of the actual race and more of your car's front wheels (why!?) along with other angles that show relatively nothing (I mean hello, why are we looking directly at a backdrop when there is a race going on?).So my verdict? 6/10. Hugely disappointing arcade game that is indeed great fun but makes you feel cheated as you progress through every moment of gameplay. Recommended? Yes, to those who like this kind of thing; but if you're looking for a sim, you've come to the wrong place.			"

												I've been a fan of Codemaster's games ever since the Colin McRae Rally Racing series.  While the first GRiD was popular along with the DiRT series, GRiD 2 introduces an entirely new racing experience.  The damage physics is slightly downgraded but it still provides an authentic racing experience.  If you hit a tree at 120 MPH, you are going to total your car.

												All arcade racing fans out there that don't own Grid 2 and are contemplating whether or not to purchase it,  at $10 this is truely a bargain.  The DLC's are worth purchasing as well!The graphics are brilliant, the cars and circuits are awesome and you get a great variety of tracks to race on, and there's also a free Demolition Derby DLC that will automatically be downloaded after purchasing the sim.In regards to the vehicles, it has a decent amount of cars to start with, however I strongly recommend purchasing all of the DLC's which aren't that expensive considering how many cars you'll end up in the game!Important note:  When I first purchased this game it was running fantastic with all the settings on high with my Intel Quad Core 2.8 Ghz processor (Overclocked at 3.8Ghz), then suddenly one day I went to play it and it ran like a dogs breakfast!  I spent a good month or so trying to figure out what the issue was, and I finally came across a very helpful person who gave me the immediate remedy to the problem!   Sorry for pointing the finger at you guys at Steam, but someone had at Steam had changed the compatibility settings under properties for the Grid 2 application by adding a tick to run it in Windows 8  compatibility mode! Once I removed the tick as recommended by this helpful gamer, the game was running brilliantly once again.Their are even a few mods on other sites that improve the graphics and make the cars handle more like the cars in a racing sim than an arcade racer.Note -  Overclocking is entirely your choice, just make sure you  understand the risks that are involved, and what is required to overclock your PC!  This is not something I recommend, nor do any of the staff at STEAM!			"

												The original GRID was not a favorite with fans of racing simulators, but in my view it trod the fine line between simulator and arcade very well. The successor has given up and gone with a limp, dull sequel.The driving mechanics of the previous GRID were perhaps a little forgiving, but subtle variations in car choice and the wide range of event types lead to an almost inifinite level of replay value. There was the strong sense of team progression, and a sense of adversity was found in the way that other drivers were named and recognisable, but never so important as to be 'bosses'. Instead, teams took that role.In short GRID was fun, casual gaming that alllowed you to tackle the same track 10 times and end up with ten completely different, intense outcomes without any feel of rubberbanding or jumping through hoops.Now, on to GRID 2. Having played a few hours of the game I have yet to understand exactly what the difference between the first ten cars is. There is an overwhelming focus on 'drift' mechanics. The first five or six cars were all classed as 'drift' even though the circuits are all allegedy street. I was actually quite excited to get the opportunity to try a car with 'balanced' classifications, however on the first hard corner I locked up the wheels and was treated to exactly the same on-rails-feeling drift mechanic as the other cars had provided. In short, this is the first major flaw with GRID 2: the driving mechanic is facile. Apparantly drifting is the way they want you to drive, and their idea of drifting is applying the brake and steering in. Countersteer is frequently unecessary. The clunky driver aids interfere with any attempt at deliberate over/understeer outside of this narrow definition, making all the cars feel samey (at least in my short time with the game).Beyond the fact that this is a racing game with poor driving mechanics, I feel that the rather pointless and restrictive story is another aspect that I rapidly came to dislike. Similarly the irritating focus on a social media-driven prestige system with kudos - I mean fans - as the currency, without any actual finance system or budget, meaning that you mindlessly plonk from race to race. Whilst driving the same car. However, these flaw would be liveable, if only the racing itself wasn't so crap. The 'top notch' AI is as pants as the driving, with very apparant rubberbanding, a heavy brake foot and none of the panache or daring-do of the drivers in the first of the series. Also, the damage system in GRID was regarded as forgiving. You've not seen forgiving until you've played this game.Before the review descends into a complete disappointed rant, I feel I should focus on the positives. Some of the levels are devastatingly pretty. Dashing along the California coastline through wooded clifftop roads in the morning sun was absolutely brilliant. Also, the gameplay mechanics really bring this to the fore as you don't have to watch the road as you drive, allowing you to soak up the glorious vistas. That being said, however, the city levels are bordering on the sterile. There is some sense of place, but very few of the city centre layouts provide the same level of white-knuckle experience and, strangely, do not look as good as the venerable predecessor. Whether it's the layout of the tracks, the less immersive sound design, the feeling that your car is wrapped in cotton wool or the flabby handling, the city racetracks do not deliver. Furthermore, I feel I should add that there is a game mode which involves the track getting switched around as you drive laps, which would be great if it was some kind of add on once you got to know, and presumably love, each track. Howver, being thrown into this mechanic after a few goes, without being given any preview or name for each layout, is bewildering and dull. Put simply, it heightens the feeling of banality introduced by the handling: driving at pace on a racetrack whose layout you do not know should kill you, not be easy.To conclude, do not buy this game unless you want something apocalyptically dull. I would even recommend buying the original GRID, flawed as it is, because it is a much better game. It even still looks good, and the experience of throwing yourself down a head-to-head midnight togué track has to be one of the most fun racing experiences I've ever had.			"

												Grid 2 is a fast paced and exciting racer, a great combination of Simulation and arcade style racing games.  The graphics are beautiful and the audio is life like!There are a lot of challenges the game has to offer such as no car driving assists, no racing line and a difficult AI. However the game does lack in two areas I find important, buying your own cars and then upgrading their performance is non existent in single player, you earn you cars by completing races and you are limited in which cars you are able to drive for each race.As for multi player I have spent a lot of time on this and find it really enjoyable, the race types are a lot of fun and it is easy to join a lobby. Sadly until you hit level 30+ other players often dominate the lobby because you're not able to start upgrading cars until you reach certain levels which can take quite a lot of time, and unless you download the DLC packs to get other cars you will not be very competitive until higher levels but still it provides hours of entertainment.Demolition derby can be hilariously funny and in a full lobby it can prove to be really challenging but also really entertaining. However there is only one car to use, two tracks and it is quite buggy.Rating 4/5+Beautiful Graphics+Great sound effects+Multi-player is Social and a lot of fun!+Career is entertaining and doesn't get boring-There is always 1 or 2 cars in each tier that are much better than the rest-Until you hit level 30 in Multi-player you will not be competitive			"

												Good looking game, but too much of an arcade racer for me. No car tweaking, too much focus on drifting. In some races you HAVE to choose from a preset set of say, 3 cars.. Sometimes all drift cars, and then you see your opponents in ""grip"" cars. That combined with an enoying arcade catch-up system completely destryoed this game for me, It's not fun, only frustratating. Especially when opponents constantly bump you to hell - if they nudge you, your screwed, bad. If you bump into them? You are still the one getting rear-ended.....			"

I haven't played it for to long, but first impresions aren't very good, handling seems to force me to drift on corners :(.

												* Pros ~ This game has great Graphics and Depth. 4K Capable.             The controls are easy to use with Joystick.             Career Mode pushes you to earn new Cars and Sponsors.             Good flow to the game in terms of immersivenes. * Cons ~ Races tracks seem a little too short.               Cars Seem to have the same capaibilites and speeds.              Racing AI can be better.              * Found it a little too Arcady> vehicles bounce into each other and off posts like rubber etc?              * No cabin driver view.             * External view subpar.* The only con that would deter me from this game is its Acrade type gameplay.Interpreted: This game is for a quick fix on the weekend at a party or with others that just have 1hour to shoot with the game.  * I would recomend this game for Ages 12 and under only.* I expected a game for a Mature audience with Driving Realism. Which it does not provide. Note: The game is fun on a Large screen with Surround ~ Very immersive and playable.			"

												-Unbalanced AI-Generally poor car control/drivingDespite blowing away the competition on every single race event, there was one single race event where I literally couldn't catch the first place car whom drove so far away from the rest of the competition it was ridiculous. This happened again doing the WSR where there was a car I absolutely could not catch in the second event so I quit and chose a new car hoping it had the speed. It didn't.I then spent every single corner spinning in circles because this car was so unbelievably undrivable. Easily the most undrivable car I've ever driven in a racing game. While I had thought that the driving had improved for the most part in GRID 2 over the first game, I had just been in generally decent cars. Then, to be able to pick the original car I had to ACTIVELY forfeit the first race in the series, go on to the second race and forfeit that one as well instead of just being able to quit to the menu. For anybody who's curious, you're better off using ALT+F4 to force-quit the game and then choose not to continue the event when you restart it.In my case, after I was forced to alt+f4 to quit, I just proceeded to uninstall the game while I was at it.

												I have really been enjoying GRID 2. It is a hybrid sim/arcade racer. By that I mean you do need to break, and you do need to know how to go around corners, but with a very high incorporation of drifting and forgiveness. There are only two real downsides to this game: There are no online games anymore, rendering half of the game useless, and the AI can often times be infuriating. The AI very clearly has a set idea as to what it wants to do, regardless of where or what the players car is doing. There is very clearly no connection between the AI and where the player is.			"

												This game has so much squandared potential... Great visuals, amazing audio, distinct characteristics for each car (handling feel, acceleration, etc), but fails spectacularly in the campaign. The AI absolutely CANNOT pass. They do not yield to the faster car (race regulations), and when they attempt a pass, instead of going around you they simply press into your rear bumper until the physics engine decides the appropriate action is to have your car spin out into the nearest retaining wall.I'm thankful for the flasbacks, because one thing is for sure, you'll need them.What also drives me insane is your race manager, with such helpful insights as, ""Keep pushing, go for first!"". NO F****** S***!!! Save yourself the heartache of unrealized hopes and dreams, as well as the money. Stay away.			"

												A pretty solid single player racer with sweet eye candy and a lot of nice and varying tracks. As in every Codemaster racing game there may not be a huge amount of tracks and during the single player campaign it might get a bit repetetive but in a nutshell the game  stands a solid ground. For multiplayer, unfortunately, many of the tracks, especially the ""tube"" ones are very narrow and the game is harsh with punishing small errors or collisions with other drivers, which will ruin the fun, when up to 12 competitors are rallying on the track.If you want to have a nice single player racer, go grab it. If you seek multiplayer >>fun<< you better get another title.			"

I was really looking forward to the online competitive play but I found out that the community has ...

												Visually stunning and a nice simulation driving experience.  My two negatives are music options, how hard is it to embed a streaming music service into the engine? Attach to a Pandora, Spotify, or simlar service and it seems we would have a better personally tailored soundtrack. Licensing I think would be the issue but still.. dreams. The 2nd downside is the lack of a cockpit view.  As is the closet I can get is with my face on the hood staring at the ram air scoop. While that is still a nice picture some vehicles it is easy to lose the center causing for some confusion while driving.			"

												It is a game about cars wot go faste. It's not special in any way. And that makes me kinda sad. The game suffers from a distinct lack of interesting tracks and worse - that handful of tracks that are in the game are being repeated over and over and over and over again. The controls are kind of twitchy, maybe that's a personal opinion but it's too sensitive to my taste. All in all the game feels a bit too arcadey, the strong focus on drifting your car around corners doesn't help either.All in all a standard racing game. It's not bad by any means but I would recommend you wait for it to be on sale or somethin'.P.S.: Whoever designed those menus can go rot in hell...			"

												Fun game so far. My only complaint is in the AI. The computer drivers seem to be basically immune to ANY car damage whatsoever, and also do not appear to follow the same crash physics as players. I cant tell you how many times I've pushed the rear end of a computer during a slide, only to have them perfectly counter-steer and be unaffected. Yet, I am like a feather in the wind; during any turn or drift, just about any contact will set you into a tail slide, forcing you to mash backspace over and over and over :(			"

No matter how you try you always come out as the loser in any collision which means passing is a huge chore. passing is mandatory since you always start close to last place so you can't just stay out front. To top it off in touge matches collision equals disqualification, but if you are in the lead and the npc hits YOU you get disqualified not your opponent; how does that make sense? One last quip that should scare all race fans away is that the npc cars occasionally get ""power ups"" I've been in an identical car to the npc and watched them blow by me on a straightaway like they have nitrous... How do you win when that happens? Simple you can't. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.			"

												Well now that I have gridautosport it seems unlikely i'll play this much again. So: The car handling physics are mental and the career mode is shambolic. However no matter how much codemasters claim this is the ultimate simcade the truth is that this game is a laugh. I've had more fun drifting gorgeous cars ( the graphics are suberb) in the 30 hours I've played on it (I know it says 74 but i accindently left it running for a couple of days) than if I played a solid week of playing dirt. And thats what this game is about- fun. So despite it flaws and the fact it dosn't really work as a racing game this game is what games are meant to be about - Fun. As a game i rate 6/10 as a truly worthy waste of time I rate 10/10.			"

												Absolutely FANTASTIC!! this is the most realistic racing sim i'v ever played (aside from the whole rewind thing). The physics and gameplay are outstanding. However i would not recomend this game for the casual  or amatuer racer. In its realism it is often very dificult. I would call myself an experienced racer and I play it on easy, frequently using the rewind feature (don't feel bad if you have to. I don't know if the game would even be possible without it). Also it MUST BE PLAYED WITH A GAMEPAD OR RACING WHEEL. Its physics are so realistic that to control your car you must be able to regulate the accelerator, not just have it floored all the time as with a keyboard. This game is highly underrated. I don't know why its not as well known as some of the other legit racing sims.The devs were unfalteringly focused on making it as realistic as possible. I think it's even more realistic than some of the more popular games like forza.  So anyway, totally will not regret paying the $ for it if you're the kinda guy who lives in the race and isn't out to get a quick speed fix.			"

												Don't bother yourself with a steering wheel, I'm so dissappointed that after 20 hours of racing I have discovered - playing with a keyboard is just easier. The way how cars are acting in Grid 2 is sad, unrealistic, irritating, hard to manage with steering wheel... Ghh, sure, graphics are beautiful, there's plenty of cars, and I had many moments of pure fun. But still, I hate Grid 2 somehow.			"

												Wow, this game --- is actually kinda good.First off: I am normally not a fan of straight up racing games like this, usually I need some free roaming and tuning and cop-destroying in my racing games, a la some of the Need for Speeds. And I like racing games where I feel good without being actually that good at the game. The more arcady the feel, the better.But this game is kinda inbetween those Arcade-Racers I love and those Hard-Core-Racing games I kinda hate and it is fun that way.The driving is more challenging than in a Most Wanted, but you can get the hang of it, even without a real steering wheel, gas pedals and a nice racing seat. And that is good. Because I've only got a keyboard and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ office chair. This way you can actually get BETTER at this game with time instead of acing through every race until the end credits roll.The cars are not moddable in the same way they are in some of those ""Underground""-racers: No fancy new spoilers can be attachede to your hot ride, neither can you replace your seatbelts with some pythons. You can change the colors, thats it. Your dude in the car is even wearing a helmet! What a wuss. We raced through the streets with a freaking hoody on in the early NfS titles. That's a step back. But not a big one.Without the upgrading (and probably the hoody), you actually have to learn your cars, not upgrade them until they are as indestructible as a concrete wall and can turn on a dime. It is also nice that they are destructible like in the Flatout games, with all the performance-impact-shenanigans you might expect, but do not explode/trigger an annoying text-prompt every five seconds (I am looking at you, Criterion games! ♥♥♥♥ you.) That's a nice touch.The race variety is good, it kind of reminds me of Underground 1 which I played to death back then when I actually bought racing games regularly. A standard race here, a 1-vs-1 there, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""drive-by-all-those-♥♥♥♥ING-cars""-thing next to the garbage bin, a time trial with a new car here... It's nice, but the focus is on actual races, and thats good. I didn't even WANT to drive around the city in this one, I liked it being focused on playing against actual opponent, rather then bored cops and 6-pm-traffic.The story... I mean who cares about it anyways, right? It's a racing game. Atleast the guy talking with you over the radio isn't a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and sometimes actually tells you usefull stuff. The races are legal, there are no hot girls, no dumb villain sidekicks gaggling and no feaking RL-footage--- anyways, i was kinda refreshed: For once I was racing against people not because they stole my car and banged my girlfriend, but rather because I wanted to race against them MORE in my own little tournament. Servicable. Good.Anyways, the game is good enough to buy for the low price of what ever you want. 3/5. Buy it in the Humble Bundle or on sale.			"

												I think Grid 2 is a really good racing game with tight corners and epic drifting. However with all racing games rthere are some flaws but there arent't many, one big flaw for me is no incar view because that really makes the game better ion many ways. Also with almost all PC racing games you'll need a controller if you want your steering to be smooth and not spin out on almost every corner.			"

												Codemasters has slowly built themselves a good reputation. They were once an exploitative company that made some sub-par games, but their acquisition of the Colin McCrae license really pushed them to develop some truly awesome racing games.While I'm more partial to off-road and rally racing, I do dabble in standard NASCAR/Le Mans style games, too. Sadly, I can't say that Grid 2 offers anything over other racing games to truly justify a purchase.For starters, the physics are just wack. Sometimes you hit curves and the game will register is as a head-on collision. Other times, you tip a car and go flying through the air. Then there are races where everything works perfectly and you're left wondering why you didn't crash.The course selection is also pretty lacking. While there are variations of each city, I can't recall more than 12 different tracks. The career mode makes you race the same circuits to a nauseating degree. I'm so sick of being in Dubai (which is saying a lot as I love India).The career mode, itself, it also just very lackluster. While I understand that deviating too much from standard racing may make this into an extreme sports title, the lack of variance just grates on you after awhile. Couple that with later seasons being bloated beyond reason and I can't even bring myself to finish season 5.There is no reason why making an event longer should be substituted for actual difficulty. Including different tracks or upgrading cars should be what makes the game harder. Making me do a 7 minute endurance race where the rubber banding AI breaks ahead of me in the last 10 seconds is rubbish.The car selection is okay. The progression system borrows a lot from the Dirt series in that you gradually unlock better cars by winning events. That takes away a lot of the bologna from games like Forza and Gran Turismo where funds were needed, but it also makes a lot of the beginning cars completely worthless in the end game.There is a tiny bit of a car customization system, but it is severely lacking. The ""liveries"" are familiar in execution to how Need For Speed: Underground allowed you to customize a car, but even that game had the option of tweaking performance and tuning. Grid 2 doesn't have much.To cap it all off, there isn't even a dashboard viewpoint. You either have a far too close zoom, a too far away zoom, a first person view of nothing, or just your hood. Codemasters' decision was that Grid 2 was more action based, but I don't buy that for a second.For a racing game to be more action oriented, it should have tight controls. Often times I can't get my car to consistently brake in the same fashion. Other times, I can drift like a master. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to how the game will work.So is there anything good about the game? Well, the beginning few seasons aren't bad. The races are kept short and different event types are sprinkled throughout. You get some Drift action, a gametype called Togue that is similar to face-off, but requires you don't contact with your opponent and even a cool variant of old-school arcade style racing with Checkpoint.After the mid-way point, though, the game just forgets about most of these events. You get stuck with standard races and endurance cups that just keep getting longer and longer. It just becomes monotonous and aggravating.The only way I'd recommend this game is during a Steam sale. At $30, it is far too expensive to just out-right buy. That the DLC is basically just better cars is also garbage, but I guess you could grab those if you want the game to be easier.Still, there are a ton of better racing games on Steam (Grid Autosport being one of them). You can do a lot better than this strange little game.5/10			"

I wish there were a few more actual racing tracks than street circuits but the game, particularly in the latter stages, is hard enough to keep your interest. There is plenty of DLC available but a bit expensive for my tastes, I did buy the Spa DLC when there was a special offer on and may buy more if that offer comes up again. I'm running this game on low graphic detail but at 1080p on a fairly old PC and it runs fine.For me the game gets a 9 out of 10....but then I do love racing games.			"

												Grid was great, Grid 2 is awesome. The inclusion of dynamic routes means that it's less about learning a route and more about responsive driving. Yes, it's a game not a simulator but let's face it, without a full-on rig of some kind it's always going to be a game so let's enjoy the play! Grid was great (although I never managed the full 24-hour Le Mans despite having camped through a real one) and Grid 2 is an interesting progression. The story is just about enough to hang the events together but the progression is challenging and not impossible, that's all I want from a game.			"

												Grid 2 is a great racing game overall. I believe codemasters games did a really great job on the graphics and car driving mechanics. however, i dont like that every time you go around a corner the seems to want to drift. i mean you have to be better than the stig to keep it from drifting. graphics are visually stunning and the damage mechanics are almost that of a soft body physics engine. i will note one problem is that the koenigsegg agera r likes to be a two wheeler in stead of a four wheeled car. the customization should be a little more like forzas and it lacks a first person view and open world exploration. i personally believe that they could have done better with this game. and at that i leave you all to your own opinion about it.

												Grid 2 is just more goodness of Grid 1. If you enjoy the semi-arcade/semi-simulation style of the Grid series then you will likely enjoy this game. After getting used to the controls of the game in general, then getting accustomed to a certain car, you will find yourself flying through corners and overtaking your opponents without as much as a scratch on your vehicle. While I don't enjoy the general interface of the game (I thoroughly enjoyed the trophie room interface of the first game) it is still usable and while I find it less user friendly, it does play into the realism of the overall game. With multiplayer, Grid 2 comes with a split screen feature, which I find is extremely hard to come by these days, especially on PC versions of games. Online is something I haven't spent much time with, you are required to set up an account to access these features, and at the time that I tried, I was having issues with Steam Big Picture mode, issues that were preventing me from making an account. I will likely revisit this review to add comments on multiplayer.As a huge fan of the original Grid, I can easily recommend Grid 2 as fun, fast paced, ""arcadmulation"" racer.			"

That is not to say GRID 2 isn't fun - it's good fun, until you complete career mode or unless you enjoy racing online; because beyond that, GRID 2 lacks depth.GRID 2's impressive array of cars seems to lull you into a false sense of security, as it makes you imagine that the track content lives up to the same standards. But you'd be disappointed, as the small selection of tracks follows Codemasters more recent trends, and the even smaller selection of actual race circuits is plain rediculous. Put together with the fact that this game considers a 6 minute race to be an endurance event and you begin to see why this game isn't truly a simulation.Car handling further follows the arcade trend of this game, as although fun, a great lack of realism again rears its head. GRID 2 rewards you for drifting; so much so that sliding around the corner in an Ariel Atom is apparently far superior to taking the corner like any normal racing driver would.So ok, will this game produce some spectacular youtube videos? No way.  Codemasters took their rediculous camera angles to a whole new level. Replays show very little of the actual race and more of your car's front wheels (why!?) along with other angles that show relatively nothing (I mean hello, why are we looking directly at a backdrop when there is a race going on?).So my verdict? 6/10. Hugely disappointing arcade game that is indeed great fun but makes you feel cheated as you progress through every moment of gameplay. Recommended? Yes, to those who like this kind of thing; but if you're looking for a sim, you've come to the wrong place.			"

												Put simply - It's a really fun arcady sort of race game. Easy to get into and can be played in short sessions or over longer periods.My only gripes are the price of the DLC and the akward navigation of the menu's which aren't exactly intuitive.Using a 360 pad the controls feel great, I haven't tried the keyboard but I'd think it would take away a lot of the feeling of control.Graphics are on a par with DiRT 3 and inlude some nice effects to add to the sensation of speed. It is apparent it's a console port but one thats been done to a satisfying level to please PC gamers.It runs along nicely on my measly 1680x1050 resolution monitor, averaging 63fps on my ageing AMD 5870 and Phenom 2 1100T @ 3.8-4.2Ghz boost. That includes all settings maxed out apart from the nvidia only settings and AA set at 4x. I'm building a new system in a couple months so if I remember, I will come back and update this if it's possible.Update:Ok I'm running it on a i7 4790k and GTX 970 on a 2560x1440 monitor. It's still great fun, the settings are all maxed including AA and it all runs great ! Some games have graphical problems running at 1440p but this one is fine.			"

												For a PC racing game, this game sure does the job.

												Well how should i put it...... I've read both the positive and negative reviews and I have to say that both these types of reviews hold true to the facts - its just a matter of inclination from the player's point of view of whether they want to bear the opportunity cost stated in the negatives and (want to) play this game. I personally like this game very much but it does have some issues with plain linear racing - by which I mean this game does have problems with its physics (a certain ""overcompensation""), no matter how minor. And yes like another reviewer stated here Grid 2 developers hve gone mad with drifting! They expect a drift for proper corner handling every time a bend comes up! And frankly I'm not a big fan of drifting either. Then there's the damage reporting - which frankly dosen't exist except for a single indicator in the speedometer, and which when compared to Grid 1 (which had 8 - 4 wheels, 1 engine, 1 transmission, 1 suspension and 1 handling) is certainly a big leap downwards. Some will be put off by the abscence of a cockpit view.  Now people reading this review might be thinking why I've recommended this game with all this negativity - well, I'd now would like to tell you why this game pretty much makes its competitors look drab - the graphics is a monumental achievement (compared to Grid 1 - which was pretty darn excellent), the feel and gravity (literally!) is very realistic (albeit slightly problematic physics) - for example you can really differentiate which cars have better torque and which cars have higher rev ranges, and the (car) damage as realistic as ever. So although Grid 2 might struggle to live up to (and even falls short at some points) the name of its predecessor it sure does put one darn good fight with its rivals.			"

												Having also played Grid 1 to death, I'm quite baffled with the negative reviews, as it seems we're playing different games compared to my experience with Grid 2.Firstly I have to say I'm playing with an Xbox360 controller, so I can vary the throttle on the trigger (gas pedal).The cars all handle differently (as they did in Grid 1), but where as in the first game you had to re-adjust your gamepad per car in order to tame it, in Grid 2 you simply learn the car instead.  This makes for a far more consistent experience, and one that gets you playing the game, rather than messing with the right control balance, only to have to change it for the next car. If you play this on easy difficulty, you'll probably not get much out of it.  However, turn it up to medium or higher, with Damage and you're really getting into the fun of things on your way to mastering the game, and enjoying nail biting races!Grid 2 is far more about understanding your car, choosing the right ride for the race, and reacting to the track. There are tight time attack races with blind corners, and slopes that challenge you to rethink your breaking point, as your breaking is lighter due to the car lifting off the track a little more...it's subtle, but genious!  In one race mode the track layout changes per lap, throwing a few surprises here and there! It makes for an exilarating atmosphere with other racers breathing down your back. Some of the drivers are also deliberately aggressive! I generally try to avoid them damaging my precious paintjob! If you're lucky enough that your name is in the audio name files, your car mechanic calls you by it during races, ""That crash looked nasty Jim!"" and so on! It's a little detail that adds a personal touch.Personal Rating: Good racing, especially on medium and higher difficulty! Great control with an xbox360 controller. Amazing Graphics and visible damage! Score Rating: 90% - A solid driving experience!			"

												I've enjoyed this game alot. I needed something to play until Driveclub is released. The feel of the game is good. Its the perfect balance of arcade physics. Its the kind of game thats difficult to stop playing. I use the Dual Shock 4 controller with this game and it feels great. I dont typically play alot of racing games. But there are times that I feel like playing them and this one is a great one. If you want a great looking racer with a great feel to the cars then you will like this. If your looking for hyper realism, thats not what this game is going for. Its got basic car stats, but I do find that each car has a unique feel to the controls.			"

												Theres hardly any racing games on PC nowadays so I decided to pick this up. I guess its fine as an arcade racer, but its nothing more to it than that. I was hoping it would be more like a racing sim like Gran Turismo, but its not. The handling of the cars can get really annoying and its like the game wants you to drift all of the time. This can get annoying on tracks where the corners are not as sharp and require slight movements. The visuals of the game are good. The most annoying part of the game is its focus on ""modern"" trends. For example it frequently wants to remind you about camera-phones and social media. I died a little inside when it gave me an acheivment labeled, ""SWAGtastic"". Stuff like this left a sour taste in my mouth. I also think the whole point of the single player campaign to be about gathering ""fans"" is kinda shallow. Is my character some sort of fame hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?All in all, its a good racer if you just want to have a fun arcade style experience. While it wasn't the game I hoped it would be, fun can still be had. If I gave this game a score I'd give it a 7/10.			"

												Poor FPS: runs fine for first few races then for some reasons starts to slow down and down and down...Edit: OK, I have figured why the frame rate drops; it is because I have my logitech wheel attached...which is pretty stupid for a racing game which doesn't run smoothly with a wheel attached. As soon as you disconnect the wheel (i.e. use a controller instead) the game runs really well! Given that this Codemaster game don't expect any fixes as they normally abandon the game after a few months,If you play with controller then this is a good arcade racing game.			"

												If you're a Forza/GT (or any real racing sim) fan, this game is not for you. If Need for Speed is your game, but you want something that tries just a bit harder, you might love this game.Very arcade, terrible physics, gameplay is pretty straight-forward (as you'd expect most racing games to be) yet still feels lacking in some way. You can /feel/ how much this game wants to be a simulator, but it just can't get there.that said, the environments are beautiful, the graphics are almost very well done. However, the cars look terribly plastic, hotwheels-esque. If you're looking for an automotive enthusiast's game, keep looking. If you're looking for a fun arcade style racing game, still, keep looking.			"

												This game was a huge disappointment for a number a reasons, the biggest being the driving experience which focuses almost exclusively on drifting. The graphics are acceptable but for the price you'd expect much better. The use of a story line is obnoxious. The boring, senseless plot serves only to force you to complete challenges in order to unlock new vehicles and tracks. You get the sense the developers where locked in a room with nothing but a case of Red Bull and the entire Fast & Furious DVD collection until they spat out this game. I actually like their Formula 1 games so it's hard to believe this one was so far off the mark.			"

												I love it! It really thrusts you right into career  mode off the bat, which is actually kind of cool. You start with the worst Mustang ever and gradually make your way up through different and more interesting cars. I love being able to customize my paint. All my cars are green, except for my BR-Z, which is pink.Unlike Gran Turismo or something like that, you don't tune your own cars in this game. As someone who usually enjoys this, it's actually nice to not have to. You just get your car and it's good to go. It does a good job of getting you driving as soon as possible. It strikes a great balance between fun and difficulty, always giving you a bit more to go after, but not making it unattainable.The graphics and sound are incredibly engaging as well; it's a fantastically cinematic game. The only better thing is that it performs pretty well on middle-of-the-ground hardware. If you like cars, buy it!			"

												While I really enjoyed the first GRID, GRID 2 leaves me wanting a lot more out of my racing experience.Make no mistake, this is not a simulator, nor should it be reviewed as one. This is an arcade racer with simulator-esque physics. What I mean is this: At the highest levels (Season 5 supercars, etc)Racing a ""GRIP"" car will feel slow, when in comparison to the other cars, you're going fairly fast.Racing a ""Balanced"" car will feel like you should be drifting a lot more than you are, but the car feels like it's on training wheelsRacing a ""DRIFT"" car will feel like your tires are made of ice and no matter what you do the car will not cooperate.I would prefer that my racing games fit into one category or the other when it comes to street racing (not DiRTs. DiRTs are awesome as-is)When a driving game with arcade steering has simulation knife's-edge cornering, I find it much harder to enjoy.TL;DR: The first 4 seasons and 25 hours are fun. Really fun. However, this game is dated enough that multiplayer is dead, so unless you plan on racing with friends in your living room/split screen, I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this game.			"

They should expand on it. Not remove it.* Artificial difficulty. Making the AI cars the equal of a Konigstiger tank while your car is a 2CVGet it for cheap or get the first one.			"

												This may not be the racing game you are looking for, so I'd read up on it before buying.Definitely not anywhere near a simulation game - the handling feels exagerated, there is no in car view, there is far too much drifting in pretty much every car and the story mode seems to be obsessed with social media to an embarasing extent. Apparently the online mode is pretty much dead, but I've not really tried it. The DLC seems poorly implemented too - the (numerous) DLC packs add new tracks and game modes, yet those new tracks are only available in free race, not in the story mode.There is a good reason to own this game though - it has a fantastic split screen mode. I enjoy playing arcade racers against people who are in the room with me, and this is one of the best I've come across on PC. If you're like me and looking for decent PC split screen games, I'd recomend picking the complete package up. It's also a good game to have if you're looking for a casual racing game to play single player.If you're a serious racing gamer this is probably not one you'd want to buy.			"

												A very solid racer that's worth the cash. It handles a little more loose and fast than the first but I found it to be very enjoyable and it has maybe the best presentation of any racer I've played. My only complaints are that the game gets a little stale towards the end of the single player mode. You're shown all the tracks and modes within the first few hours of the game so the last couple of seasons are a bit tedious. I also wasn't a fan of how 'drifty' some of the top-end cars felt. Other than that, a very good racing game that I'm glad I bought.			"

												This is an OK game and worth buying but not a game I am likely to recommend. The difficulty really seems to ramp up at the end and along with increased track lengths the game gets quite tedious. In the end I dialled back the diffculty simply to stop myself becoming too bored. The rubber banding on the longer tracks is very noticable and good driving is not rewarded enough with descent gains.			"

												First of all, I'd like to say, that I've played numerous of racing games like Gran Turismo 2, TDU 1 and 2, classic NFS games and plenty of others. I don't need more-than-real simulators, but I like games where I can enjoy cars and driving.I've been looking for some racing game with nice realism-to-fun ratio for some time now. Also tried Burnout paradise, that I got from some bundle. That game was bad, seriously bad (using brakes was more like enabling some ""Drift mode"").But how about GRID 2 ?Well the game is nice. The graphic is decent, I can run it on i5 with HD4600 quite well. Carlist is good (there is even my beloved Honda S2000), tracks are pretty interesting with a lot of nice details. But with tracks comes the first problem. Most of the corners are designed to be driven with tires squeaking. But the biggest problem is camera. You can choose from close or far 3rd person, bumper cam and hood cam. Somehow, I cannot drive through those tight corners, fighting with oversteering (even with FWD) in 3rd person. The only camera I can work with, is the bumper cam. And that's the thing that I hate the most on this game. I'm playing game with cars, to enjoy the cars and I can't see my own car. But keep in mind, this can be really individual.To buy or not to buy..Test it first. The game is fun. It's great game for someone, who wants more than last NFS titles. For me, the camera was too much, so I had to keep looking.It's worth the try. "

												Online Modelots of kidz killing gameplay: you do a nice race but they ram you in the last  turn before the finish.at every start from the grid you have to pray the lord to not end into a wreckage of cars smashing each other.sometimes i found myself ending 3rd (?) after being 1st and passed at the last turn by only ONE car, maybe the other was flying or in invisible mode (?) (or was I blind tired) apart from that graphics and sound are ok, some lag during race but not too heavy.another thing, you cannot select a favorite car for racing with, since it's the group/room leader who choose the car category. He could change while in the lobby and you found you choosing a car from another category before starting race. This is very annoying.Single Player? Who cares, I have Grid 1 which is yet ok for SP.Thanks for the opportunity to play for free with this, now I'm sure I will not buy it.Bye			"

												Grid 2 truly is an excellent racing game. Firstly, it is very well optimised, running smoothly whilst still looking pretty good even on my crappy laptop. Handling strikes a nice balance between sim and arcade. It's easy enough to get the hang of but rewards those who are more skillful particularly on braking and turn in. The different handling models feel distinct and from my multiplayer experience there isn't one with a severe advantage over the other.  I also think the seperation of single and multiplayer works in the game's favour since moving from one to the other feels fresher than in other games (though some shared progress would have been appreciated). The multiplayer is the stronger of the two but the single player  does have some very good qualities. The game does a great job at creating a convincing scenario for the campaign to take place in and the first half in particular is a lot of fun. However, I found the last season of WSR to drag on a bit due to some tracks being used considerably more than others (if you prefer street circuits you won't have as big an issue with this) though event variety helped aleviate this. Also the car balancing within the classes was questionable at times and in Tier 3 I experienced one event where I felt I could only win in the Caterham/Ariel Atom group though keep in mind  this may have been down to me prefering a grip based driving style. Multiplayer is where you should spent most of your time as the playlist setup for online events is simple and easy to get addicted to. The learning curve was not as steep as I expected thanks to a decent starting car selection which I see being used by more experienced players quite regularly. As for the lack of cockpit view. Its not a sim game. There's a hood cam. It does the job. Use that and have some fun.			"

Cuz your car is made out of Plastic. but your opponents cars are nailed to the ground and wont move an inch if they get hit. Also the 1st person camera is missing whom i loved in 1st grid game.

												Probably the best paced racing game of all time. Most games start out where you either pass licenses, or like this one where you race with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car at first. The difference is most games go on from there as a ""Then do whatever"" after your first race. GRID 2, however, takes you on a journey as a sports car driver. Reminescent of the days of Porsche Unleashed, you're a driver that needs to be competitively aggressive to promote a world racing event. You go out of your way to challenge drivers from all over the world in an attempt to get the most amount of publicity possible, so more and more people go to the racing league, and more fans pay for the show. This game has the BEST racing game mechanic I've ever seen called ""Flashback"". You have the option to reverse time on a limited basis if you royaly screw yourself over. This is very awesome with the race variety where you can't see the map and the road not set in stone, it's different and goes on differently for as long as the timer is up. So you have a pretty good chance of miscalculating a few turns and NEED another option other than ""Restart the Race"". In easier difficulties this can also be used to your racing advantage, Went left and got cut off? Rewind, go right!The cars aren't plenty, but provide enough variety for me to not complain and I'm used to Gran Turismo. The cars handle differently, and weight+power+accel+top speed are the only statistics that matter, and they make an actual impact as each car I've played handles differently. Cutely enough though, they made every car as if top of the line engineers built them, so american cars are in the same playing field as the rest and don't handle/perform like a fat 50 year old with erectile dysfunction as they do in real life. The game also doesn't corner assist as invasively as other games do. You feel like you made the turn in your own right and not just because a turn was coming up and you pressed the turn button. It's hard to describe, but seriously it's a really great cornering system with a lot of variety in turns, almost a strategy system to it.The game provides optional multiplayer, but also compares your times with friends if you're in career mode. It doesn't destroy your privacy like some up-and-coming racing games. The maps are very awesome, from top tracks of the world to awesome highways you may have seen. The roads have been widened though, to accomodate for high speed driving, unlike other games where there is no sense of thrill.Difficulty is handled VERY well in this game. Drivers in 2nd and 1st drive like maniacs so you have to earn the position even in the easiest difficulty it adapts to your playstyle/driving and slows down cars infront to still provide an advantage. (IE crash more, they will go slower, but clever enough so you can't wall ride past everyone). The cars behind you will drive aggressively unless you're in first in easier difficulties, after you achieve first and outmaneuver the competition they will not likely catch up anytime soon unless you REALLY mess up.The variety of events is pretty awesome. Not just a racer. There are drift events, passing events, elimination events(if you're familiar with burnout series), timed trials of course, and pole catching.The only complaint I have is that I thought the story would go dark somewhere in career, but it didn't. It's fine that it didn't, it would have been kinda weird if it did, but would have made it super interesting. That's just personal though and in no means something people would want other than freaks like me, lol. Most people are perfectly fine with racing being the only exciting part. Not saying completing the story wasn't exciting, but it was very predictable, so less exciting than if it took a turn where you had no idea what the crap would happen. Thanks for reading my review!

												You'd be better off getting the original GRID. You know, the one that DID win the awards and sold couple million copies.This one is basically the same as the original, only worse. You do the same thing but are given less options, less real world tracks less cars and shorter races. Seriously. Half the races your career consists of have ONE lap. ONE.Driving assists are always on with no option to disable them makes the game pretty easy for anyone familiar with racing games. It's no longer 'almost a racing sim' where you can still turn assists on and have fun with it. You're only getting the 'arcade' experience. Even on the highest difficulty I had no trouble winning races. Unless it's a one lap race that you start from last place - good luck with that.Only new and interesting mode is the 'Overtake' but it's ruined by the AI obviously being awarded way more points that you can earn yourself unless you have an absolutely perfect run. I understand AI needs to cheat sometimes but at least don't do it in front of my eyes.Other modes have been dumbed down. Drift now consists of you making a SINGLE run down like 3-4 turns on one of the regular tracks, which are completely not meant for that, while your driving assists are still on. No skill is required. It's a joke basically. Also no 24h Le Mans or 20-something car races. 6 cars max, short tracks, 1-2 laps each. "

												So I am playing the game on the free weekend and I think it's ""ok', if you have never played Grid just buy part 1, why?Well part 1 has much more customizable controls and the joystick on the computer controllers or the d-pad is not so sensitive. From the very first race on the Mustang you feel way too sensitive to be driving, it is not realistic. Ok so it's an arcade type racer so where's my sensitivity bar? No slider bar in the options means you're stuck with what you got. Overall it is an ok game but I am dissapointed. The biggest flaw is not being able to tailor the sensitivity on my controller. It is probably better on console anyway. I'll pass on this one. 3 out of 5. Average. p.s.The story is ok and interesting, it's a different game than part 1. Just buy part 1.			"

												Grid 2 is not a step up from the original Grid. It is more like an update. Little graphical improvements, different tracks etc.It is too expensive as a full price stand alone.Apart from that there are a couple of big negative things to say:- Driving mechanics got worse. The original Grid is a favorite of mine, because it has a great balance between simulation and arcade style driving. There's a great feel to the cars. You can almost feel the body, power and motor. Screeking tires in the corners. Somehow in Grid 2 you have to drift in every corner. If you don't drift, you lose. There is no real cornering. If you try to drive your car like a real car you will fail.- Online: This was the reason for me to get this game. I wanted to play Grid online. Sadly the online play is bad. You will be crashed into constantly. The most common strategy in online play seems to be trying to bump and crash other player of track. No driving skills are involved in regualr online play. It's a frustrating experience. You try to drive correctly, get the corner perfectly, only to be crashed into by a driver behind you that then instantly pushes the reset button and will turn out ahead of you, because he reset before you had to to.Online play is broken. And that was supposed to be the reason to upgrade from Grid 1. My verdict is: stick to Grid 1 or get this game if it is heavily discounted. A sad, sad thing. :(			"

												If you can cope with the rage you get by playing this game online, go ahead! I recommend buying this in one of its sales (<10 eu) an get the car unlock pack.+Fun to play with friends-Corner cutting is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on this game- Impact rating system doesn't do its damn job- The online drivers are so bad that it could rather be called demolition derby- Bumping into other players can be so unrealisticAs previously said, the game wants to be an arcade racer, simulator, drifter etc. It doesn't do anything really right.

												Oh my glob - I'm not sure whether it's just because I'm on Very Hard difficulty, but the singleplayer races are completely rigged to make the AI win in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ways.All their cars are magically faster, even if they are using the same car you have and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thing I came accross, in the first promotion race where you need to overtake utility trucks without crashing to score points, even if you race super clean without a collision and overtake the other racer (the AI who I saw crash a number of times before I overtook him), the AI racer still manages to win the race with 32,000 points. It's just stupid.I like to play on the harder difficulties in games, but I hate it when they think making it purely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is the way to go instead of giving the AI better driving skills (or whatever depending on the type of game) to make it a more realistic hardness.It's like when they make a shooter game harder by giving the AI just a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of hp, instead of making them smarter and more skilled.Oh and also in this game, it seems if you try and ram an opponents car it smashes you instead and spins you out, but if they ram you, it smashes you and spins you out...seems fair.I haven't played the multiplayer because I don't think anyone plays it.I wouldn't reccommend this game if you want realism, the driving on its own is good, but the rigged AI ruin it.

												the graphics are really well from the detail of the tires to the fans on side lines.the handling of the cars was a little difficult to get the hang of.online for pc is kind of a bust not having that many people involved and a lot of the players ive raced favor smashing people into walls instead of racing with a concios.it is hard for a true enthusiest to find a game worth playing,especially since nfs fell off.its far from perfect,it could have tuning options like forza.also it could have added a more open approach to liveries instead of fixed ones.the car handling could be a bit more user friendly for less progressive drivers.i see where others opinions are coming from with the dislikes,this game does have shortcomings.ultimately this game is a lot of fun to play,it has its own way of challenging others abilities unlike shift and shift 2 where the physics were so warped i dont see how it could get worse and i grew up to nfs1 2 3 underground 1 n 2 most wanted etc.,by the time carbon came out i lost faith in nfs eventhough i snagged pro street and shifts.i havent been able to push myself to that extra step until i reached grid 2 and its a pain playing with lousy drivers that turn it into halo.i like this game,i recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge,the fell of the cars is tricky at first,it does make sense though,when turning corners if theres too much throttle it ends in a spin out.its worth the money to people that enjoy racing.

												Unskippable ESPN SportsCenter cutscenes.Unskippable tutorial videos and other ""team member narrator"" monologues.First 2 hours of racing limited to American muscle cars and Nissan whatevers.Often given a choice of two identical cars to win. Once you make your choice, they tell you that you can still unlock the other one. What's the point of making a choice if it doesn't matter afterwards?In a field of 12 cars, only 2 of them are ever challenging, not because they are good drivers, but because they started at the front and have built a huge lead.""Rival"" drivers cheat. My rival, Harrison Carter, was able to accelerate faster than any other car on the track. Also, he beat me on the first race, so he gets to start the second at pole position. I came in second, so I get sent to the back of the pack to start the second race. Who's managing these series?Driving feels floaty and disconnected.No sense of progression or a cohesive garage. Apparently, I own 12 cars and didn't even notice.Split screen limited by career progress. You can only drive cars you unlock.Tons of DLC cars in quickrace and split screen. I have 9 cars to choose from but 8 of them cost money.Most customization options locked by level. I can't paint my car blue until I'm level 3.There are many racing games on the market. GRID 2 is one of them. Pick a different one.			"

												I have been playing this game since January 2014 and have to say that I love it. What I don't like so much is that to be competetive in the global events you have to spend more and more money to get competitive cars. I would think it's enough that you have outlayed a hefty price to buy the game but then if you are a serious racer like me you still have to keep spending.			"

												Pretty graphics but that's pretty much the only aspect of the game that doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste. I'm a big fan of the predecessor of the series. However Grid 2 broke ties with the well working concept everyone liked so much. Not just the menues and unskipable cutscenes are a burden to navigate through but the courses as well are mostly generic and repetative. The choice of cars feels limited and too unbalanced and events with no prior info or overview are just a no go. Not to mention the missing cockpit view or that I've played PS1 games with better AI. So in conclusion: If you like racing games... skip this one or at least wait for a huge discount.			"

												Wow, this game --- is actually kinda good.First off: I am normally not a fan of straight up racing games like this, usually I need some free roaming and tuning and cop-destroying in my racing games, a la some of the Need for Speeds. And I like racing games where I feel good without being actually that good at the game. The more arcady the feel, the better.But this game is kinda inbetween those Arcade-Racers I love and those Hard-Core-Racing games I kinda hate and it is fun that way.The driving is more challenging than in a Most Wanted, but you can get the hang of it, even without a real steering wheel, gas pedals and a nice racing seat. And that is good. Because I've only got a keyboard and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ office chair. This way you can actually get BETTER at this game with time instead of acing through every race until the end credits roll.The cars are not moddable in the same way they are in some of those ""Underground""-racers: No fancy new spoilers can be attachede to your hot ride, neither can you replace your seatbelts with some pythons. You can change the colors, thats it. Your dude in the car is even wearing a helmet! What a wuss. We raced through the streets with a freaking hoody on in the early NfS titles. That's a step back. But not a big one.Without the upgrading (and probably the hoody), you actually have to learn your cars, not upgrade them until they are as indestructible as a concrete wall and can turn on a dime. It is also nice that they are destructible like in the Flatout games, with all the performance-impact-shenanigans you might expect, but do not explode/trigger an annoying text-prompt every five seconds (I am looking at you, Criterion games! ♥♥♥♥ you.) That's a nice touch.The race variety is good, it kind of reminds me of Underground 1 which I played to death back then when I actually bought racing games regularly. A standard race here, a 1-vs-1 there, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""drive-by-all-those-♥♥♥♥ING-cars""-thing next to the garbage bin, a time trial with a new car here... It's nice, but the focus is on actual races, and thats good. I didn't even WANT to drive around the city in this one, I liked it being focused on playing against actual opponent, rather then bored cops and 6-pm-traffic.The story... I mean who cares about it anyways, right? It's a racing game. Atleast the guy talking with you over the radio isn't a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and sometimes actually tells you usefull stuff. The races are legal, there are no hot girls, no dumb villain sidekicks gaggling and no feaking RL-footage--- anyways, i was kinda refreshed: For once I was racing against people not because they stole my car and banged my girlfriend, but rather because I wanted to race against them MORE in my own little tournament. Servicable. Good.Anyways, the game is good enough to buy for the low price of what ever you want. 3/5. Buy it in the Humble Bundle or on sale.			"

												10/10This is the best racing game I've ever played. The realistic car controls feel great, making the races much more difficult than Burnout, Forza, or Need for Speed. The campaign is the best of any racing game ever, because it not only feels more realistic, but it offers variety and options of how to do it, with many extra features. The online play is well-made, really the CS:GO of racing. It's quick, punishing, and requires honing your skills. No mouse support does drag this otherwise amazing game down, along with it being a bit of a CPU hog. Don't get me wrong, it runs, and has good graphics, but the graphics to memory ratio isn't great. Overall, I can't recommend this game enough.			"

												Not worth the price... in short: It's just no fun to play.Visuals are great, but then there is this shaky cam that starts to shake more the faster you go. Pretty annoying.The AI is challenging which actually is a good thing... but... it's like you race against tanks. You cannot push them, they are just driving without any impact. Driving physics also can be annoying... when you touch a wall, your car will turn 180 degrees and you have to use the reset.Got it in a sale for 5€ and wouldn't do that again. Also, the racetracks are mostly boring... city race here, city race there. Too many 90 degrees corners, not enough natural race tracks. AI is cheating.No, thanks.			"

												This is an amazingly fun and addicting game, however, it has some major issues that need to be addressed, particularly with it just being able to simply run. I've found that after about 30 minutes of straight play, it starts crashing and rebooting every other race. In the middle of the freaking race. It's ridiculous. I can be almost through with the entire race, then the sound goes out and it totally crashes before automatically rebooting itself. And it obviously doesn't save any data from the race. So if nothing else, that's what would be holding be back from recommending this game. If a fix comes out for it, then I'll be sure to edit the review.Overall: 4/10Fun, but has some major problems.

This becomes especially irritating when you are forced to race 3 times in a row on the same track.- Physics is total crap.- Menus feel too heavy and slow.- It's too hard to determine which car you should take, their stats all look the same, but handling differs significantly.- Difficulty is not uniform - most challenges are fine, but there are some ridiculously hard ones.- Lots of DLCs.- Maps get too repetitive.- Music? What music?Just pick any other racing game and it will likely be better. Even Grid 1 was better.			"

												Grid 2 is the kind of game that achieve to be either good and bad. It's a classic arcade racing game in a world where racing means slidde & drift in everycorner. If you like cars, arcade racing game, being allowed to do mistakes and drift in a corner like a character in ""Initial-D"", this game is for you. Music is cool, audio is not very realistic according to cars' engines but who cares, it works perfectly.			"

												Not recommend it,if you are a hardcore racing gamer who enjoy racing sim before such as pcars,asseto,gran turismo,i racing,raceroom and etc,grid 1 is good as a arcade racer,but this grid 2 is rubbish as a arcade and for its racing experience.CONS:nobody play online,the multiplayer is dead in this game,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ driving physics,where your car will spin like a tornado even if you just make a small contact with wall or opponent cars,drift? wtf is drift in this game?nope no drift mechanism for you,go slide and spin off your car and pretend that you are a drift master instead!!car performance stats system are so stupid with the bar,every car have almost the same statsAI is too easy to win in normal,too hard to win in very hard,in very hard AI is driving like they are in a train rail,passing through every corner like they stick a super gum to the groundno cockpit view PROS:other then that its a ok game for its well optimize lag free graphics even on low end pc it runs pretty well on medium to high settingsingle mode is okcar sound was okso thats it if you are a racing gamer who enjoy sim before,you better not get it not worth the price but if its on sale you can give it a try,or you can just get grid 1 or grid autosport which is better than grid 2,grid 2 driving physics is one of the worst i had experienced.

												Streets are slicker than oil on a sheet of ice. Feels more like controling a curling puck than a car, and the only way to make a corner is to slide around like a cartoon character. Hovercrafts have more traction than these vehicles. Maybe this sliding is a bit more controlable on a gamepad, but with a wheel it's nigh impossible, you just spin like a boomerange in flight.It was also frustrating that the only way to exit the game is to Alt F4, or Ctl Alt Delete. I'm not joking. Acording to the forums, you have to beat the first two races in order to get the option to exit the game, I never made it that far.The game is certainly pretty though, with great damage physics.

												I remember Grid 1 being a lot of fun. This on the other hand feels... very new age tween gamer.Twiddling with the forced intro race, and trying to setup a Simraceway wheel (which was unmanagable), the entire grid finished the small circuit before I even started moving... and yet when I finished I received that annoying poitive reinforcement nonsense that is the reason why kids today are self entitled morons. Horribly late finish = OMG, that was amazing, all eyes were on you, that generated so much interest.Forced, unskippable cutscenes = CheckDecent though generic to Codemasters handling = Check (didn't feel engaging like Grid 1 did at the time)And the visuals... lens flared street lamps during the day? That's just a cheap way out to add bells and whistles to an otherwise overglossed and unbalanced/unrefined art style.All of those things are initial markers of what the game really is.  Disposable and forgettable. I've played more than enough titles over the years to know that feeling of mediocrity at the start of a game that is just going to stay mediocre, at best.... and this is one of them.			"

												    I have to say, after reading the reviews on this game, I wanted to be impressed. However, after about five seconds of playing on the first course I immediately wanted to stop playing. My biggest issue is that it doesn't handle like a car, nor any normal vehicle for that matter. Everything slides around likes it's on ice, regardless of what I do(did). The one feature of the game that genuinely piqued my interest was the Flashback feature, but it didn't help much to compensate for the terrible physics. It may just be me who encountered this (although I don't see how that's possible) for the short amount of time I played. And when I say short, I mean it. I only played for about 15 mins and was not left with a good impression.I was also unsatisfied with the camera in such a tight space. I'm not used to racing games, which made it even more difficult to play. Again being on those lines, there was no tutorial (that I saw) about how to play. Granted, they explained the keys to drive and the flashbacks while playing, but there were no tips for turning, stopping, elaborate roads, etc.    On the flipside, I liked the feeling given by the environment and detail put into certain things, such as the amount of damage and debris that could accumulate on the cars themselves. Again, as I mentioned earlier, I really liked the flashback feature. I haven't seen this in many games, and it gave me the ability to see how to approach specific situations from different angles (...literally). While I may not have played as long as some of the other people posting reviews, I hope anybody reading this would take very into consideration all of the goods and bads very carefully. Personally, I wasn't impressed with the game and I find it hard to see more pros than cons, so I'd say try the demo before you get anywhere near that ""buy"" button.			"

												If there was a ""maybe"" recommend option, I'd use that instead. The game isn't bad. The visuals are amazing. The car handles reasonably well (I don't care about ""realism"", I care about a car I can control). Starting off was tough. I only like the occasional racing game, and I used the ""easy"" difficulty (there's a very easy, a normal, and more beyond that), and there's an option to have damage to your car actually affect its handling or just show up for visual effects. While that's cool, I like easy mode, so visual effects only for me. The game throws you into a ""big race"" to start off with no training; I didn't even know what button was accelerate (it's RT on the controller). It turns out that race isn't terribly important and the following race is a test drive which actually tries to show you how to drive. That was cool. It even lets you continue the test drive after you're done - it doesn't automatically take you out of it until you're ready to leave. This made all the difference.The game is overloaded with unnecessary unskippable cutscenes, and there's a story about getting publicity that doesn't need to be there. I couldn't work out what ""getting more fans"" does.  After the first couple of races, you have to set up an account etc - the whole process made me feel like I was spending more time looking at cutscenes and in the high quality menus than I was actually racing. The racing is satisfying when you actually get to it, especially the ""rewind"" feature when you press Y that lets you fix up any mistakes. This is AMAZING for a player who doesn't race often. You can see what mistakes you made and fix them. It feels like cheating and I love it. There's some sort of limit to how many times you can rewind, or an unseen cooldown or something.The best races I liked were the 1 on 1 short races, and even the tougher ones were great thanks to rewinding. On one particular race the opponent was really beating me over and over, but I just rewound the race a couple of times and I won. The over-the-top voiceover said how good I was and how I beat them at their own game, and I was all ""ya I did"".			"

												Very good racing game. It even has splitscreen feature!In many ways I think this game is better than Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit,even though Need for Speed has some compelling features and charisma.I love the menues in Grid 2, because they are fast so I don't get bored. If there is some information I can always move on as I want. N4S lacked of this.It's a really creative game with social media, humor and fans. You create a fanbasewhile competing in your career.I like the engine sounds in N4S more than in Grid 2, but Grid 2 is really nice anyway.Grid 2 is more up-to-date, with great online features etc.			"

												Single: Annoying gameplay, annoying controls and very-very annoying car behavior/feedback/reaction - you feel sooo outrageously handicapped compared to the AI cars while playing it, no matter how hard you try.Even if I otherwise consider myself a higher-than-the-average-level racer, I just quickly lost interest in playing this game as it quickly set me on fire against the experience this game gave me...Multi: Haven't played multi-player, though - but based on my single-palyer experience, I am not really inclined to even try it out.Luckily, I bought this on a big sale for some very low bucks a while ago - thus I minimized risk and loss of money.

												You'd be better off getting the original GRID. You know, the one that DID win the awards and sold couple million copies.This one is basically the same as the original, only worse. You do the same thing but are given less options, less real world tracks less cars and shorter races. Seriously. Half the races your career consists of have ONE lap. ONE.Driving assists are always on with no option to disable them makes the game pretty easy for anyone familiar with racing games. It's no longer 'almost a racing sim' where you can still turn assists on and have fun with it. You're only getting the 'arcade' experience. Even on the highest difficulty I had no trouble winning races. Unless it's a one lap race that you start from last place - good luck with that.Only new and interesting mode is the 'Overtake' but it's ruined by the AI obviously being awarded way more points that you can earn yourself unless you have an absolutely perfect run. I understand AI needs to cheat sometimes but at least don't do it in front of my eyes.Other modes have been dumbed down. Drift now consists of you making a SINGLE run down like 3-4 turns on one of the regular tracks, which are completely not meant for that, while your driving assists are still on. No skill is required. It's a joke basically. Also no 24h Le Mans or 20-something car races. 6 cars max, short tracks, 1-2 laps each. "

												So I am playing the game on the free weekend and I think it's ""ok', if you have never played Grid just buy part 1, why?Well part 1 has much more customizable controls and the joystick on the computer controllers or the d-pad is not so sensitive. From the very first race on the Mustang you feel way too sensitive to be driving, it is not realistic. Ok so it's an arcade type racer so where's my sensitivity bar? No slider bar in the options means you're stuck with what you got. Overall it is an ok game but I am dissapointed. The biggest flaw is not being able to tailor the sensitivity on my controller. It is probably better on console anyway. I'll pass on this one. 3 out of 5. Average. p.s.The story is ok and interesting, it's a different game than part 1. Just buy part 1.			"

												If you are expecting anything but an arcade racer.. well.. you will be dissappointed. Although not as bad as the later EA games, it is extremely casual. It has a couple of things going for it:The feeling of speed is actually really good. Unfortunately, that is the only good thing about it.On the downside there are several more points to be made:Firstly: Why is there no cockpit view? I have no words for how bad this is.Secondly: The AI. Well, calling them AI would be stretching it a bit. They are as stupid as they can be without imploding the whole known universe.Thirdly: In some events you get disqualified if you so much as touch another car. That would be fine if that rule applied to the AI as well. Without any penalties they can charge into you as a mad elephant on meth.Fourthly: The physics. This is a real problem as you will spin out in a ball of petrol flames if you get hit (or try to hit) by another car. While you ponder over your wreck and where the hell you will get the money to fix it and how you will explain it to your wife, the AI will just continue as if nothing happened. Fifthly: Rubberbanding. This was an annoying feature of GRID and apparently they couldn't keep their greasy fingers of the ""insert rubberbanding""-function. Altough not as apparent and bad as in GRID, it is still very present. Unless you lead by some 5 seconds, expect to be rear-ended by the guy you overtook and you haven't seen the smoke of for minutes. Suddenly he's there again like a bat out of hell.Sixthly: The cars. I have at the moment of writing some 30 cars I've won but they are just a sidenote. You can paint them but that is it. Oh.. change the wheels. Yay! They.. fill.. no.. purpose.. at.. all. Once you have the Golf R there is no need whatsoever for any other. Unless you are forced to use it or you are in a vehicle challange.. which will win you another car you will never use. It makes no sense at all.Seventhly: Car textures and resolution. Seriously? If you for some reason blows the hood of the car (which happens a lot..) you will be surprised by a low-texture engine that looks like it was stolen from Carmageddon. Yep, that is how bad it is. Guys, really?There are probably more stuff that annoys me, but these are the ones that I could think of right now.If you can find this game on a deal for let's say 5 Euros, buy it. Otherwise? No. Save your money and buy a better racing game. There are too many annoying things going on here for me to enjoy it. And I really tried, believe me.			"

												If you have a basic understanding of how to drive a car this game is not for you. I acknowledge that it is an Arcade game and not a simulation. But never have I played a racing game that took itself so seriously as a simulation game, yet was so arcadey. Juiced 2 is more realistic than this game. I cannot possibly beleive that the developers of this game knew in anyway how to drive a car, much less race one. Grid 1 took itself a little more seriously and was a bit more realistic but in whole the series is very arcade-like. And Grid 2 is so unrealistic, and so arcade-like that it's nearly unplayable.That being said, there is fun to be had if you're capable of forgetting how a car operates at a most basic level. The career is great, and it's set up very well and honestly, something I've been wanting out of a racing game. If only the gameplay could match the set up.			"

The physics are absolute crap, they charge you extra for any cars you would really want, and the tracks are porrly designed and way way way too short. Save your money and anger and buy the first GRID.  The drifting in this game (which was heavly advertised) is so damn horrible, i really can't complain enough. Dear lord do not buy this game.

												I compare this game to Mario Kart Wii, Why you ask? Because most people like a game they can master ( Yes you can master Mario Kart Wii), but its pretty hard to master,  but once you do you'll love it even though im sure some people use this game to just goof off in, crash cars, and just flat out have fun! To tell you the truth thats all I did in this game for about a year (Don't worry it wasn't online) and I had a blast! I think Codemasters took out driving assists in Grid 2 to just create a new type of racing game or now that I think about it completely reverse how nearly every other racing game is. For example Forza, Gran Turismo ect. all those game are about hitting the apex of each turn perfectly and making sure to put on the brakes at the exact right time. Well in Grid 2 its just about the oppsosite you still want to to get a good angle on a turn but if you haven't already noticed you are meant to drift around every turn and if you don't like that DO NOT buy this game! because its all you do in it! If you are looking to buy this game. 1. MAKE SURE TO GET THE DEMO FIRST!  2. Get it and its DLC when it goes on sale (Cause it gets pretty cheap)Also playing with the keyboard is pretty good, but a Xbox 360 controller (or somthing like it) is recommended.			"

Amazing graphics, great performance, many cars to choose and win, plenty of tracks, plenty of different events to keep it fresh and exciting, good paint and sponsor features. Much gameplay and tons of racing fun to be made. The way cars drive, the way speed feels, the drifting...this game does a stupendous job at executing good racing with some fun destruction and a competitive touch by giving it a DGAF attitude with smashing cars and beating your way to first!

												This is one of the best ARCADE racing games I have ever played in my life like NFS underground. The physics are better than NFS games. Online & Career modes are really enough. If you want an ARCADE racing game, this is the best. If you are looking for a real racing simulation game just get F1 series such as F1 2013. Thanks to codemasters for building these games!MAC OS X NOTE: If you buy GRID 2 Reloaded version you could face a problem during game such as ""damaged downloadable content"". The solution is easy. Close your steam application. Clean caches in your SAFARI via develop menu in SAFARI. After then, open steam and right click to GRID 2. Click properties and open local file tab. Click verify cache. Finally, restart your computer and it's done!Have Fun!			"

As it was free to try for the weekend and a reduced price too i thought i would try it for the weekend.That's where my excitement ended though.I felt the handling of the cars in game was so bad that it was unplayable.On the note of it being unplayable, it also crashed straight out to the desktop several times, then the final straw was when my steering wheel went hard right all on it's own and my pc totally locked up with nothing but a mouse pointer on a black screen. The only way of getting out of it was the reset button.If you want a game that you can play then DO NOT bother getting this one.			"

													I haven't logged many hours kn this game but you get hooked very early on. There are many reviews claiming that you're forced to drift on every turn. That is not at all true. GRID 2 does require some prior knowledge to driving to successfully race without crashing, spinning out, etc. The mechanics as well as physics in this title are on point. I've only came upon one issue but aftree researching, it's not very common and the support team is currently working with me to fix the issue. All in all, GRID 2 is a great addition to anybodys library. Great gameplay + great support, what's better? Whether you get it for the discounted price of $7.49 or the full price of $29.99, you will not regret a single penny.Rating: 9.5/10			"

												The number of pros in the game outweighs the cons. The severity however is another story.The way I see it, there is a huge flaw with the handling. It is unreliable and unpredictable, often failing you when you need precision. It is too responsive and sensitive and makes timetrials and powerlaps a pain. Regular races are fine as the AI on normal and below are dumbed down way too much. Driving in this game is like flying a jet fighter, You'll do fine at high speeds but when you try to move around at low speeds or need to stop, the whole thing shakes apart.			"

												I have been playing this game for a while and I am on Season5 now, and I am giving off to play it further.. The npc drivers's cars have an unlimited amount of momentum, when they hit you, you are a leaf and they continue their path with no problem,thus they usuall smash you and continue their way. So you usually try to race IN ADDITION  you have to avoid the ones coming from behind, especially at the corners. This is not AI, this is unfair, the graphics are nice, but this is a racing game, that you can not race fairly? really?			"

												A big disappointment.I enjoyed GRID a lot, so naturally thought its sequel would bring me joy too. Unfortunately and after giving it much of a chance, I really don't enjoy GRID 2. The fact everything is about 'drifting', even the non-drifting events. The handling is pretty off compared to realistic racers, and is pretty stupid compared to other arcade racers so I'm not sure where it's supposed to fit in. Obviously all the dull 'city' tracks are not realistic, and some of the modes such as 'Endurance' which basically changes the layout of the track as you drive around (to try and prevent you learning it, but the AI know exactly what to expect) are unrealistic, as well as the whole WSR concept.The only real positive I had from the game was that the multiplayer was entertaining in the beginning, and compared to other CM games such as DiRT and the F1 series, as least you weren't forced as much to watch useless scenes/forced into a race before you'd even set up your controls/graphics etc..I'd try GRID Autosport as apparently that is the resolution to this poor game, but the series has left me with a bitter taste.

												Grid 2 is an alright game. The career is fun, the handling is not too bad, and AI's are fairly even to you. I know it may not be as good as Grid and does not have a cockpit mode, but it still stands as decent in my opinion.The handling is pretty good, but the problem may be collisions. Sometimes, hitting a rock cliff throws you way into the air, and hitting another car from behind makes you spin out uncontrollably.The missions are decently entertaining, but do get old, and they slowly get annoyingly longer distances, allowing for fewer mistakes. I find this painfully annoying.The graphics are good, even on low, and the world is well made. Although it is a bit demanding PC wise if you want to play without everything on ""off"" or ""low"".Overall decent, good details, and not too bad on handling or world design. Probably a solid 7.5/10.			"

GET GRID (original) INSTEAD2/5 stars. The first game GRID, is a 5/5! This is a obvious downgrade in the fun factor.To my friend who bought me this game, thank you ever so much. To the developers of this game, WTF!!!!? It's a racing game. You get cool cars and you race. But its the game play that made this great franchise fall. I'll explain that in a second. First the big talking points.Graphics: Very cool, and always have been. Have they been upgraded from the last game? Hard to tell, probably not.Are there more cars? SO MANY CARS!!!!1New tracks? New tracks and new race types!Then why don't you love it like the first GRID?They changed the game play. Two key things that gave the first game soul that are missing from this corpse. Driving featuresYou can still drive fast but not furiously! What i LOVED about GRID was I could be a bully! I could be more ruthless then tony stewart and not actually kill someone (too soon?) Really though, I could push the main competitors car into a barrier and they would be out of the race. I LOVED THAT! Every one of my races would start with 12 cars or so and it would end with 7. This game does not have that, in fact it's the exact opposite! A heavy american muscle car (driven by you) can and will be bullied and pushed around by a light weight nissan in this game. Even if you fight back? Especially if you fight back.Its a sad sight. *shaking my head* Crew/HUD featuresThe first game had a really nice feature as I drove and my car got damaged. It would tell me what was damaged (left front wheel, or whatever else) This game just simply tells you your car has sustained damage. . . well i just ran into a wall. So, yeah!!!WTF is damaged and how badly is it damaged!!! You could tell me in the first game, why not the second!? "

												Well, i have seen so many bad and good reviews about this game. But only one thing i see bad about this game... IS that it doesn't have the same realistic feeling like GRID. GRID 2 is more arcade but still a lots of fun. Multiplayer is great too.. But i have purchased it recently thanks to 75% Sale. With all ""DLC's"" (forgot to say this is a bit funny, dont know if its good or bad) But there is a lot of people putting low levels to T5 races disabling DLC so you can choose only one car (Mercedes McLaren) and they pick something like ccx. And thats not fair...+1) Lots of fun and Hours of gameplay2) Well optimized so even low wooden computer like mine can take it.. (Please take a note that i have HP ProBook 4540s with AMD HD 7650m and Intel core I5. So I'd say something like limit but you can go lower is as mentioned AMD HD 7650m or nVidia GT HD 550m wich have nearly the same performance.) .. On low graphics3) If you are lucky you can even enjoy Multiplayer ;)-1) Isn't simulator like Prequal and doesn't have Cockpit camera2) Multiplayer isn't balanced3) Graphics didn't move so far from GRID but thats good for people like us who still have bad computerAnd that's it :D I think that if you're not interested in this game but you are looking for good Racing Simulator, go for GRID..But when you want action, arcade, adrenalin. Give it a go and buy GRID 2And if you are bit dissapointed with this Sequal to GRID, then give it atleast a try when its in huge sale and buy it :D Its fun anywway.Thanks for reading and good gaming ;)			"

												Over the last few hours of playing this game I have seesaw-ed over if this game is worth buying and putting hours into, and to that I have to say no. Now the reasons behind that are not so clear, I have been playing racing games on PC for at least 15+ years and this one game stands out in its mediocrity.The physics for many cars are decent enough but drifting is over used and on some cars leads to out right loss of control, also at least in my experience using the handbrake is ill-advised. Unless you drive very carefully you can expect to hit the wall often usually due to the fact that if you brake you drift and if you drift you are not bleeding speed fast enough thus sending you off of your line and into the wall.I can say that some of my impacts were actually quite entertaining from various spin outs only to face the right direction to my favorite 100ft+ barrel roll and landing on all 4 wheels will little loss of speed, in true James Bond style.With the nuts and bolts of the cars there is no customization beyond the paint job which will leave anyone more used to the last handful of Need for Speed games of the last 10 years with a sense of ""Why bother?"". With no upgrades or even basic tuning you loose the sense of accomplishment of pushing your old Mach 1 Mustang to the limit to beat out the newest BMW M3's though perfect knowledge of both tuning your car to the track and driving style.Now so far in this review I have bashed the game fairly hard in all the same places that many reviews here do, but there are a few things that this game has that I can only wish could be used in other games and other things that the game just plain does well.The idea of building bit by bit a fanbase and bouncing from sponsor to sponsor as they demand things that you know won't happen is very appealing and I believe adds a LOT to the emersion of the game. The other side of this is you put in your name and see IT in the cutscenes and hear the nickname that you selected instead of hearing ""Ryan Cooper"" a billion times, it really is refreshing to hear and again lends greater emersion of the driver.Another thing often overlooked is how the menus behave especially in the middle of the race. What I am talking about is probably the best done race restart sequence I have ever seen. In most games you hit Esc>Restart>*Scroll up/down*>Restart/Yes and then it restarts the race. Now having to do this process everytime you need to restart a close race because you caught the last turn wrong or the like that extra step of scolling and often the extra second or two of time needed to load that menu even on a powerful computer, can mean the difference between quiting the game for a while or pushing through one more time.Grid 2 you hit restart and even before the menu is fully loaded you hit restart again and it restarts the race in a fraction of the time of other titles.The above is really all that can be squeezed out of this game because its not bad and it is NOT an ugly game but it is lacking in the places that these games need most. If this game where $0.99 to no more than $4.99 on the upper most end then I would consider buying the game maybe.			"

												I'm not the type of person to write reviews even if I dislike something but I felt compelled to write a review about this game specifically because it was such a big disappointment.  The graphics have not improved since the first game and there were any I did not notice them.  I played GRID 1 right after GRID 2 and had a much better time with the first installment.  The handling of the cars felt more real.  I just couldn't get into GRID 2 no matter how hard I tried.  There's just something about it that lacks the true essence of a racing game and it feels like I'm playing a game made for  a 10 year old on a console system.  If you want a great racing game, this isn't it.  I'd rather spend more money on the FIRST one than dump money on this game even when its on sale.Total disappointment coming from somebody who's played PC racing games for 20 years...			"

												First of all, I'd like to say, that I've played numerous of racing games like Gran Turismo 2, TDU 1 and 2, classic NFS games and plenty of others. I don't need more-than-real simulators, but I like games where I can enjoy cars and driving.I've been looking for some racing game with nice realism-to-fun ratio for some time now. Also tried Burnout paradise, that I got from some bundle. That game was bad, seriously bad (using brakes was more like enabling some ""Drift mode"").But how about GRID 2 ?Well the game is nice. The graphic is decent, I can run it on i5 with HD4600 quite well. Carlist is good (there is even my beloved Honda S2000), tracks are pretty interesting with a lot of nice details. But with tracks comes the first problem. Most of the corners are designed to be driven with tires squeaking. But the biggest problem is camera. You can choose from close or far 3rd person, bumper cam and hood cam. Somehow, I cannot drive through those tight corners, fighting with oversteering (even with FWD) in 3rd person. The only camera I can work with, is the bumper cam. And that's the thing that I hate the most on this game. I'm playing game with cars, to enjoy the cars and I can't see my own car. But keep in mind, this can be really individual.To buy or not to buy..Test it first. The game is fun. It's great game for someone, who wants more than last NFS titles. For me, the camera was too much, so I had to keep looking.It's worth the try. "

												Online Modelots of kidz killing gameplay: you do a nice race but they ram you in the last  turn before the finish.at every start from the grid you have to pray the lord to not end into a wreckage of cars smashing each other.sometimes i found myself ending 3rd (?) after being 1st and passed at the last turn by only ONE car, maybe the other was flying or in invisible mode (?) (or was I blind tired) apart from that graphics and sound are ok, some lag during race but not too heavy.another thing, you cannot select a favorite car for racing with, since it's the group/room leader who choose the car category. He could change while in the lobby and you found you choosing a car from another category before starting race. This is very annoying.Single Player? Who cares, I have Grid 1 which is yet ok for SP.Thanks for the opportunity to play for free with this, now I'm sure I will not buy it.Bye			"

												i never played the first game. Handling is nice in this, I enjoyed the challenge,  some say the tyres felt like they were sliding on butter, but I think it's fine, more realistic..only problem I had was, because I use a g27 steering wheel, the gear shifting can be a little off, I play WRC and that involves quick speed shifts and they are a lot smoother.. Not sure whats wrong but Grid doesn't seem to read the shifts that well..I'm useto doing quick shifts but the game just puts it into neutral most of the time making me slow down and when I try to re-adjust the gear it just sticks in neutral, which can be frustrating..though can always go back to using the keyboard but thats no fun.However I did only play like 1 hour of this so..im not completely hating.Oh and whatever happened to cockpit view..?

												I got the game for free to play on my PC for the entire weekend I that this was posted during,I had it on ps3, and the game was hard and frustrating, even with my G27 wheel.So I installed this, in hope that it would be better and worth getting.But it isn't.It is hard and frustrating, with hard to master handling combined with realistic AI that goes the same speed you are going   that are hard to catch up with, which is good, but combined with absolutely awful handling, even on VERY EASY the game is still incredibly hard to master, or at least become somewhat good at it and be able to easily beat your first race in first place every time you race.The game has an entire damage engine that works well, and an absolutely BEAUTIFUL graphics engine, and everything is simply amazing in this game.However, the handling ruined it all for me and a LOT of others too.Anyway, giving more detail, the game is focused on drifting,But the horrible handling, comes when you try to drift.You are more than likely to lose control, so you'll most likely lose any race.It really is sad that the handling ruined this masterpiece, it really is.I'm going to give it a 7/10, for the amazing game it is, except 3 points off for that handling.Some might disagree with me, so if you are one of them, don't comment on the post complaining that I just suck, because a whole bunch of other people hate the handling too.

												GRID 2 has some very nice graphics, it can also be a lot of fun in multiplayer when you have some good players to go up against (alas, next to no online players in my region). I do not see that it is an improvement on the original GRID, just different. Some features that made the original game great are missing or are not as good, however there are new aspects which make up for some of the losses. Watch out for the computer players they are not subject to the same rules as players (at this time) for example in Touge when you the player overtake, you can be disqualified for touching the opponent, however you also get disqualified if the PC crashes into you when it is overtaking, a little unfair!To summarise, this is a good game with some nice graphics, it would be a great game if you could connect to more servers for multiplayer and if the game rules were better balanced.

												First let me start with the basics, the graphics look amazing. Secondly the driving is very fun but note that the handling is not as realistic as previous CM titles, it pulls more towards arcade than simulation and I personally enjoy it much more this way as you have more freedom with your cars. You stll have realistic chassis and engine damage that can make crashes fantastic to watch in replays but still best avoided at all costs when you're racing!!Overall the driving is more arcade fun than simuation-like realism.

												pros:  * graphics... in my opinion it is the peak of what a racing game needs... now they should focus in making it fun * beautiful cars ...cons:  * sometimes cars handle like a train.. keeps on going like corners are straight lines... no problems at all * when in contact the slightest of touches will not allow you to move anywhere (most annoying) * how do you gain a specific number of fans by wining races and completing objectives... makes no sense, grid one was                 better ... money my  friend... that is what you won * too much spectacle in the background, huge crowds... fireworks (while racing) - stupid, dangerous and pointless * you always start from the back of the grid and have to fight the exact same people which are at the other end * when using flashback, on the radio you get the same message, even though your flashback made that message useless, as the event he talks about on the radio is undoneverdit:  *grab it on a sale... other than that it is not worth the money... seems like an imature racing game grid 1 was far better			"

												GRID 2 is a fun racing with a lot of customization and possibilities. Instead of running a never ending campaign, GRID 2 allows you to choose what you want to do. The game is very user-friendly and it is easy to run on computers lacking ""hardcore"" hardware. Definetly worth the price.			"

												Sadly this sequel to what I consider to be the best racing title of the recent era has been horribly americanised (dear god I want to stab the stupid ""companion character"") and has had all of the lovely freedom to pick your races from the original butchered up with a frankly dull story about some billionaire playboy fellow. I am glad I picked this up in a Humble Bundle instead of having forked out full price for this, because my contribution to charity there is probably the only good this about this game!			"

												I tried to like this game, really, but then I got the first Grid through Humble Bundle and I'm uninstalling this game. It just doesn't even come close to comparing to how much better the first Grid is.  My biggiest issue with this game is how the cars feel when you're driving - its like driving on ice. I hate it.  It took me close to 40 minutes to get to the point where I could go through a race without sliding all over the track.  I've spent less than that in Grid and I've already got a good feel for it and I'm having way more fun. Just don't bother with 2.			"

												Pretty graphics but that's pretty much the only aspect of the game that doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste. I'm a big fan of the predecessor of the series. However Grid 2 broke ties with the well working concept everyone liked so much. Not just the menues and unskipable cutscenes are a burden to navigate through but the courses as well are mostly generic and repetative. The choice of cars feels limited and too unbalanced and events with no prior info or overview are just a no go. Not to mention the missing cockpit view or that I've played PS1 games with better AI. So in conclusion: If you like racing games... skip this one or at least wait for a huge discount.			"

												Oh my glob - I'm not sure whether it's just because I'm on Very Hard difficulty, but the singleplayer races are completely rigged to make the AI win in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ways.All their cars are magically faster, even if they are using the same car you have and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thing I came accross, in the first promotion race where you need to overtake utility trucks without crashing to score points, even if you race super clean without a collision and overtake the other racer (the AI who I saw crash a number of times before I overtook him), the AI racer still manages to win the race with 32,000 points. It's just stupid.I like to play on the harder difficulties in games, but I hate it when they think making it purely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is the way to go instead of giving the AI better driving skills (or whatever depending on the type of game) to make it a more realistic hardness.It's like when they make a shooter game harder by giving the AI just a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of hp, instead of making them smarter and more skilled.Oh and also in this game, it seems if you try and ram an opponents car it smashes you instead and spins you out, but if they ram you, it smashes you and spins you out...seems fair.I haven't played the multiplayer because I don't think anyone plays it.I wouldn't reccommend this game if you want realism, the driving on its own is good, but the rigged AI ruin it.

Much gameplay and tons of racing fun to be made.

												 I pre ordered this and my excitement soon turned into frustration as I began loosing online races to the dirtiest racing lines and approaches to driving I could imagine. I would have liked a heads up as I like drifing and am quite good in previous games at that ""style"" of driving. It's as if the handbrake turns into a combo button of nitro-boost and weightlessness that you HAVE to use to win. There is absolutely no connection or feel to driving in this game. You are not in control.Need for speed already exists...why codemasters.....why!? I feel tricked out of my money.			"

												A good game, but somehow not as good as Grid 1. It's hard to say why - apart from more of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ drift levels, why is it I can powerslide around corners in every race with perfect car control, but in the drift levels the car just spins or massively understeers when I try to do the same thing? I thought it would be nice to drive a lot of different cars in this game, but there's no cockpit view, and since you have to use the hood cam to get a sense of speed and immediacy, you just end up staring at slightly different paintjobs.

												I have been a huge fan of Grid 1 and in general love racing games, keeping that in mind i have to say I have had a blast and alot of fun playingthis game, yes it might not have cok-pit view and the cars may not drive like a simulator but who cares as long as it gives you a challenge and fun, which a lot of games fail to do. It is a must own and take my word for it you will love it. If you want a sim get forza or gran turismo which arent as fun as blasting down the road at 200mph and drifting past rivals :)			"

												Grid 2 is not a step up from the original Grid. It is more like an update. Little graphical improvements, different tracks etc.It is too expensive as a full price stand alone.Apart from that there are a couple of big negative things to say:- Driving mechanics got worse. The original Grid is a favorite of mine, because it has a great balance between simulation and arcade style driving. There's a great feel to the cars. You can almost feel the body, power and motor. Screeking tires in the corners. Somehow in Grid 2 you have to drift in every corner. If you don't drift, you lose. There is no real cornering. If you try to drive your car like a real car you will fail.- Online: This was the reason for me to get this game. I wanted to play Grid online. Sadly the online play is bad. You will be crashed into constantly. The most common strategy in online play seems to be trying to bump and crash other player of track. No driving skills are involved in regualr online play. It's a frustrating experience. You try to drive correctly, get the corner perfectly, only to be crashed into by a driver behind you that then instantly pushes the reset button and will turn out ahead of you, because he reset before you had to to.Online play is broken. And that was supposed to be the reason to upgrade from Grid 1. My verdict is: stick to Grid 1 or get this game if it is heavily discounted. A sad, sad thing. :(			"

												Played a bit during free weekend. Only redeeming thing I can really say about the game is at least you get to start with a Mustang and not the other embarassing cars in the game. This game should come with a disclaimer that it is almost unplayable without a controller. The handling of the cars is so wallowy and numb that you'd think you were on a boat. You have to sit through a lot of garbage that you can't skip and the voice acting/story component is poorly executed and probably even more poorly thought out. A racing game should be about racing and driving well. The idea of rewinding is pathetic and is out of place. So you cooked a corner? Okay rewind until you get to a point where you were going straight long enough to jump back in and retake the wheel. I wasted too much time writing this. If you are looking at this game and get to the end of this review you too have spent too long considering if this is worth any more of your time.			"

												GRID 2 is a beautiful looking racing game with a lot of different racestyles. Some are very cool, some aren't. There are a lot of different cars. Each car has it's own driveability.

												I am not normally one to write a review on a video game, but seeing as this one is currently on sale i feel it is my duty to warn potential buyers of the product bieng offered. THIS GAME IS UNPLAYABLE!!!! It is pretty, it is tense and you will want to win, unfortunately you will not. What you will do is hit start, scroll to restart (race) and continue to be humiliated in one of the following fashions.1. You will start in last or next to last in almost every event. you will be blocked by the ""AI"" until the first place car is 7 miles ahead, you will wreck in a frantic attempt to catch up.2. You will manage to be in first, you will wreck.3.You will have some form of idea how to drive your car....this will change due to inconsistant physics several times per race...you will wreck.4. I dont know about four...the first three were frustrating enough.Now for some bad race game staples...... 1. Starting in last place no matter what your current standing is. Check 2. Magnetic walls. Check 3. Penalties for touching AI. Check  3.a  No Penalties to AI for same infractions. Check 4. AI right up your A## no matter how fast you are.. Check 5. RAndom handling physics. Check 6. Annoying generic ""co pilot"". Check There are about 1000 more things I can list but I want to get to my favorite lastly.THERE IS AN ENTIRE SERIES OF EVENTS WHERE YOU DONT EVEN GET TO KNOW WHAT THE RACE CORSE WILL LOOK LIKE. YOU WILL BE FORCED TO DRIVE W NO TRACK KNOWLEDGE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND IF YOU MAKE THE SLIGHTEST MISTAKE YOU WILL LOSE.I hereby suggest to Codemasters to rename this game a more suitable name. Such as  ""Edge of a Playable Game. Start. Die. Restart.0/0 stars, thumbs down, and hell to the Fu#$%in NO!			"

												Codemasters, how you have fallen from great heights. Grid 1 was great, it struck the perfect balance between between babby's arcade racer and a super sim like their F1 series. It was accessible to all but was difficult to be good at and it was actually a real feeling of accomplishment to win a race on the hardest difficulties.You dropped the ball with Grid 2. You took a great series and watered it down into homogenized irrelevancy. That perfect balance between sim and arcade is now weighted heavily as an arcade racer. As a longtime fan of Grid 1, putting probably 100 hours collectively into the PC and Xbox 360 versions, I am insulted.Well lets start with why its bad, shall we? Every car handles like it has weights in the trunk. You could drift any car by just tapping on the brakes lightly, regardless of what the car is. I can drift an old comaro just the same as a Nissan Silvia. Every car handles the same. You licensed all these cars so you can make them all handle badly or sell them off as DLC.The whole experience just seems to have bumped its head a few times. Sleek, easy to navigate menus are replaced by ugly menus that try too hard to look like a youtube page. On these menus there is unoriginal ""taunts"" by your rivals that are more annoying than intimidating. After each event, your team leader will make some stupid comment and you will be forced to watch a cutscene with licensed ESPN logos and real ♥♥♥♥ing ESPN commentators. Yes, they spent the majority of their budget on unskippable ESPN branding.In the first Grid, there were many disciplines spanning over three regions. Across the US, EU, and JP regions there was some diversity. Each region had its own identity and unique experiences. In the second grid, every place feels the same and every discipline feels the same. Demolition derby was added as an afterthought.I really did give this game a try. I wanted to stick it out and believe it was good. I couldn't make it past 8 hours though. In that 8 hours, I drove samey cars around samey tracks in unmemorable disciplines. When is the fun going to kick in? When is this game going to give itself a reason to carry the Grid name? "

												Boy am I glad I did not buy this game when it was first released, I bought it today and only paid around $7.50 for the damn thing and as far as I am concerned I wish I had not even spent this amount on it.  I am new to racing games and this one was a very poor choice for me even at the 7 dollars spent for it.  The reason? There are no tutorials or practice sections in the game.  When you first start the game you are put right in a race, no time to even figure out how to drive the damn car etc.  It is probably ok for an experienced gamer who has played a lot of these race games but stay away if you are new to race games.  Even though I paid for this I am going to uninstall the local content so it does not take up storage space, I only wish there was a way to permanently remove the game entry in my game library and if I thought I stood a chance of getting a refund I wold ask for one.

												Grid 2 is fun in its own way but its nothing like the first one.  The first one was more driving sim with several racing styles, but 2 is more arcadey and all styles of racing are very similar.  Instead of taking what they had with the first one and improving it, they just made a whole different game using resorces from the first one.  The worst part is the handling on some of the super fast cars.  The stearing is incredibly sketchy and the slightest turn at high speeds will send you spinning.  After playing 2, I just went back to one.			"

												Despite the negative changes that Codemasters has made to the game, this is certainly worth a look if you're a fan of the original GRiD. GRiD 2 lacks the accuracy of physics the first GRiD had, and the AI's skill level leaves a bit to be desired for, however the amazingly impressive graphics, excellent sound and top racing pace style all still make for an excellent game. If you do not own the original GRiD and wish to try out the series, I strongly recommend purchasing the original GRiD before getting GRiD 2. It's the better of the two.			"

												On the positive side, the graphics, choice of cars and tracks are great. The thing that really ruins it for me is the steering and handling of the cars. Virtually all of the cars are geared towards drifting. The upshot of this is that it leaves little room for different driving styles and ensures that your car goes wildly out control for no apparent reason. Completely ruins the gameplay.If you were considering a purchase of GRID 2, I would strongly suggest checking out the first GRID, as the gameplay in the latter is far superior.			"

The physics are absolute crap, they charge you extra for any cars you would really want, and the tracks are porrly designed and way way way too short. Save your money and anger and buy the first GRID.  The drifting in this game (which was heavly advertised) is so damn horrible, i really can't complain enough. Dear lord do not buy this game.

												Well I know some people are complaining about ""realism"" for racing games, but for me, I started enjoying racing games at the arcade and PS2 (Like F1 and NFS), I feel like their could be some more cars in the game as standard (I looked through and saw how many add-on cars there were) but I cant complain, my 2 favorite cars we're near enough handed to me on a silver plate at the start (The Nissan Fairlady and Silvia). The only thing I can honestly complain about is the damage/control aspect (I.E In a muscle you get tapped by an import, you spin out) but its an arcade game its what expected.I dont have many hours on GRID 2 for PC since I only re-purchased it recently (I completed it on PS3), but I have always played games like F1, Colin Mcrae Rally and other codemaster games, I honestly think for such an old company to be putting out games of such quailty is pretty outstanding in my opinion!

												A big step backwards compared with the first Grid.* All those city tracks are just not interesting.* Too much DLC and the base game is too little.* Handling just took a step backwards* Lacking the ""managing team"" feeling from the first game. They should expand on it. Not remove it.* Artificial difficulty. Making the AI cars the equal of a Konigstiger tank while your car is a 2CVGet it for cheap or get the first one.			"

												Definitely a let-down after the high standard the original GRID set. They made some neat features like tracks that change as you move through them, AI that doesn't rubberband back to you, and larger cities, but it was in vain since the game was not as fun. I think the original GRID was a little more arcady but it added some character. As I played GRID 2, I felt it was lacking something; I couldn't race how I wanted to. Also, the story was overdone and a little too cheesy. In GRID 1, the player was a low ranking driver hired to compete against Ravenwood. Slowly, they got better until they were racing in global races as opposed to small local events. In GRID 2, you start out street racing, get ""recorded,"" and then get ""famous"" through internet videos and social media. To me, it was a bit of a stretch and I prefer the simpler, more generic racing story.TL;DR: Overall, GRID 2 was fun but it did not live up to the original's standard. It didn't feel right and I thought it was too restrictive. Wait and see about Autosport.			"

												8/10Visually pleasing and does what it suggests. Cars don't blow up, neither do the environments.I generally do not play racing games. Why? Because there is a lack of XP and/or explosions, etc. That being said, I don't dislike them. GRID 2 is pretty decent. The graphics are solid (though not amazing), and the audio is also solid.  I play using a Dualshock 3 emulated as an XBOX controller, and it works well. Controls were responsive and intuitive. The AI was interesting, although it could have been due to the individual cars - at one point I was in last, managed to weasel my way to first (blasted past a few of them) then suddenly they are blasting past me. Nos? AI might have it, but I didn't. Either way, the difficulty (on medium) felt balanced enough for a novice racer. My main beef with it? I got up to 160 mph and smashed into a wall, and lost a fender. While the damage effects they do have look amazing, they are limited to visual. In HonkKong I crashed (see the pattern) and was greeted by an epic slowmo of the destruction, but i was limited to plastic looking pieces and what appeared to be a rotor ""flying into the crowd"", which were actually just ""cut-out"" All in all, good racing game for racers who focus on the racing. If youre into visually pleasing consequences for your mishaps, look elsewhere.			"

												I will be honest, I do not like this game but I would still recommend it.I'm not a realist when it comes to my racing games. I like my racing games with a little more give than Grid 2 provides.With that being said lets get into the meat and potatoes of my review.The game is very beautiful. Sound and frame rate seems solid enough.The Gimic ""flashback"" feels just right and helpful. It takes a lot of the punch out of how real the cars handle.Cars in career  look very well for being tuned for racing.I almost lost it when I saw the name ""Fairlady Z."" Sadly it was more modern version and not the S30.Races are not impossible and with flashback you could win most if not all of them.I just felt like I was driving more than racing.  Realism is strong and can pull you out of the speed-buzz you get.If you are look for realist style racing game then I would recommend Grid 2.I however will not be adding it to my personal collection.I hope this help fill in any thoughts you have. If I can answer any questions, just comment on my review!			"

												You'd be better off getting the original GRID. You know, the one that DID win the awards and sold couple million copies.This one is basically the same as the original, only worse. You do the same thing but are given less options, less real world tracks less cars and shorter races. Seriously. Half the races your career consists of have ONE lap. ONE.Driving assists are always on with no option to disable them makes the game pretty easy for anyone familiar with racing games. It's no longer 'almost a racing sim' where you can still turn assists on and have fun with it. You're only getting the 'arcade' experience. Even on the highest difficulty I had no trouble winning races. Unless it's a one lap race that you start from last place - good luck with that.Only new and interesting mode is the 'Overtake' but it's ruined by the AI obviously being awarded way more points that you can earn yourself unless you have an absolutely perfect run. I understand AI needs to cheat sometimes but at least don't do it in front of my eyes.Other modes have been dumbed down. Drift now consists of you making a SINGLE run down like 3-4 turns on one of the regular tracks, which are completely not meant for that, while your driving assists are still on. No skill is required. It's a joke basically. Also no 24h Le Mans or 20-something car races. 6 cars max, short tracks, 1-2 laps each. "

												So I am playing the game on the free weekend and I think it's ""ok', if you have never played Grid just buy part 1, why?Well part 1 has much more customizable controls and the joystick on the computer controllers or the d-pad is not so sensitive. From the very first race on the Mustang you feel way too sensitive to be driving, it is not realistic. Ok so it's an arcade type racer so where's my sensitivity bar? No slider bar in the options means you're stuck with what you got. Overall it is an ok game but I am dissapointed. The biggest flaw is not being able to tailor the sensitivity on my controller. It is probably better on console anyway. I'll pass on this one. 3 out of 5. Average. p.s.The story is ok and interesting, it's a different game than part 1. Just buy part 1.			"

												i never played the first game. Handling is nice in this, I enjoyed the challenge,  some say the tyres felt like they were sliding on butter, but I think it's fine, more realistic..only problem I had was, because I use a g27 steering wheel, the gear shifting can be a little off, I play WRC and that involves quick speed shifts and they are a lot smoother.. Not sure whats wrong but Grid doesn't seem to read the shifts that well..I'm useto doing quick shifts but the game just puts it into neutral most of the time making me slow down and when I try to re-adjust the gear it just sticks in neutral, which can be frustrating..though can always go back to using the keyboard but thats no fun.However I did only play like 1 hour of this so..im not completely hating.Oh and whatever happened to cockpit view..?

												Probably the best paced racing game of all time. Most games start out where you either pass licenses, or like this one where you race with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car at first. The difference is most games go on from there as a ""Then do whatever"" after your first race. GRID 2, however, takes you on a journey as a sports car driver. Reminescent of the days of Porsche Unleashed, you're a driver that needs to be competitively aggressive to promote a world racing event. You go out of your way to challenge drivers from all over the world in an attempt to get the most amount of publicity possible, so more and more people go to the racing league, and more fans pay for the show. This game has the BEST racing game mechanic I've ever seen called ""Flashback"". You have the option to reverse time on a limited basis if you royaly screw yourself over. This is very awesome with the race variety where you can't see the map and the road not set in stone, it's different and goes on differently for as long as the timer is up. So you have a pretty good chance of miscalculating a few turns and NEED another option other than ""Restart the Race"". In easier difficulties this can also be used to your racing advantage, Went left and got cut off? Rewind, go right!The cars aren't plenty, but provide enough variety for me to not complain and I'm used to Gran Turismo. The cars handle differently, and weight+power+accel+top speed are the only statistics that matter, and they make an actual impact as each car I've played handles differently. Cutely enough though, they made every car as if top of the line engineers built them, so american cars are in the same playing field as the rest and don't handle/perform like a fat 50 year old with erectile dysfunction as they do in real life. The game also doesn't corner assist as invasively as other games do. You feel like you made the turn in your own right and not just because a turn was coming up and you pressed the turn button. It's hard to describe, but seriously it's a really great cornering system with a lot of variety in turns, almost a strategy system to it.The game provides optional multiplayer, but also compares your times with friends if you're in career mode. It doesn't destroy your privacy like some up-and-coming racing games. The maps are very awesome, from top tracks of the world to awesome highways you may have seen. The roads have been widened though, to accomodate for high speed driving, unlike other games where there is no sense of thrill.Difficulty is handled VERY well in this game. Drivers in 2nd and 1st drive like maniacs so you have to earn the position even in the easiest difficulty it adapts to your playstyle/driving and slows down cars infront to still provide an advantage. (IE crash more, they will go slower, but clever enough so you can't wall ride past everyone). The cars behind you will drive aggressively unless you're in first in easier difficulties, after you achieve first and outmaneuver the competition they will not likely catch up anytime soon unless you REALLY mess up.The variety of events is pretty awesome. Not just a racer. There are drift events, passing events, elimination events(if you're familiar with burnout series), timed trials of course, and pole catching.The only complaint I have is that I thought the story would go dark somewhere in career, but it didn't. It's fine that it didn't, it would have been kinda weird if it did, but would have made it super interesting. That's just personal though and in no means something people would want other than freaks like me, lol. Most people are perfectly fine with racing being the only exciting part. Not saying completing the story wasn't exciting, but it was very predictable, so less exciting than if it took a turn where you had no idea what the crap would happen. Thanks for reading my review!

												Even after placing first in the qualifying races and being number 1 in tournament points, you still start towards the back of the pack just to force increased difficulty instead of making it a hard fought race, it just ends up being you weaving the bad drivers to catch up to the ""featured driver"" who always starts frist on the grid. Not only is this frustrating(lowering the difficulty makes it much too easy) it distracts you from the game and takes you out of the world it so desperately tries to emerge you in.			"

												If you liked the first, you'll like this one! But...if you already have the first, there's no need to get this one either, haha. They take away a lot from the first one. You don't buy cars any more. You just kind of...all of a sudden have the one you need for the race you're entering. It makes the cars not really feel like your own cars.Everything else is at least as good as the first. Same awesome graphics. I think there's a few more driving assists enabled by default.... but still a very good game.			"

												I have spent many years playing racing games from the arcade style Need for Speed series to the in depth Gran Turismo series, which is by far my favorite. I no longer play console games, I'm strictly PC. That means I'm searching for a game which can satisfy my Gran Turismo need. I own several racing games for PC such as Grid 1, Shift 2, Dirt series, Need for Speed, and I only use an Xbox One controller. Grid 2 has become my goto racing game when I have time to sit down and spin some tires.I have heard that Shift 2 is better, but so far I have not been able to get into it. After work and time with my family, I don't have a lot of time for gaming. So when I finally have a moment to race, Grid 2 is where I turn. Gamepad control works well, it is challenging enough to keep me engaged while not being so realistic that I get frustrated since I don't have a wheel. The visuals are excellent and that includes vehicle damage. Plenty good enough to please my tastes.			"

												A lot of fun for any fans of racing games. I'm a relatively casual fan of racing games and enjoyed this game very much, until ""season four"" of the single player mode. I was playing on medium difficulty. I was consistently getting first in all my races in seasons 1-3, then in season 4 the difficulty ramped up for some reason and it became tedious. You literally have to race perfect in order to win the races, and the cars are much faster so they are less forgiving. I had to do races over and over to get them right and it just became not fun. I set the game to easy to finish out season 4 because I thought that was the end of the game, turns out there is a season 5 and at that point, things had become so monotonous that I uninstalled. Still, the game is worth it for the first 15-20 hrs overall.			"

												Don't bother yourself with a steering wheel, I'm so dissappointed that after 20 hours of racing I have discovered - playing with a keyboard is just easier. The way how cars are acting in Grid 2 is sad, unrealistic, irritating, hard to manage with steering wheel...

												Graphics? it's above Dirt 3 but not by much... in places I spotted god aweful textures (for example if you lose the bonnet the engine texture is like gameboy grade stuff... WTF?) but most of the other stuff is about what you would expect from a last gen console port, PC looks glorious but could be vastly improved with some HD texture updates... 1gb GPU ram useage is not exactly top end textures when you factor 16x AA is being used on mine with Ultra settings which would be expected to be best served by GPU's running 2+gb RAM these days... 1gb stuff should be low-midrange gpus only.Handling? well the cars are once again quite arcadey in the feedback, but the controls are very tight and very responsive indeed...more so with some car perks added. Overall its a good job all round there.Sounds? Nothing to shout about... bland music, okay sound fx, meaty engine fx on the muscle cars, plus a few random crowds shout out stuff as you whizz past.Multiplayer and Single player? Multiplayer has the most to boast about here, all the unlock systems for perks and paint jobs all require cash from winning races, in solo campaign it's merely handed ona plate for little effort, not to mention there is no perks for solo mode either, so assume cars fully modded as default.Overall? well I have to say is most positives... the multiplayer is fantastic as always, but some thing spoilt it for me... such as day zero DLC bullcrap, and no cockpit view.

												This is a really good, solid racing game. GRID 2 is fast-pased, speedy and exiting driving experience. I never imagine that passing someone would be so much fun! The driving is thrilling and racing makes you sit on the edge of your seat. The graphics are a big plus too, beautiful landscapes and lens flares look really astonishing.Unlike getting more exp you get more fans, which is pretty unique and fun thing to have. The whole athmosphere of the game is so uplifting and, in a sertain way, relaxing that it had to be mentioned. If there would be any bad thing to say about this, it would defintelty be the difficulty of this game. This is a quite hard racing game even in a most easiest settings, especially for those with no racing game experience. Other than that, GRID 2 is easily above average racing game, with fantastic graphics and athmosphere.3/5 The scenery was so beautifull that i accidentaly drove of the cliff			"

												Casual racing game is what I expected, but became disappointed and will not play this again. The physics of the game are such that the car takes impossible beatings, fine, that's kind of what we expect in a casual race game. I'm glad I don't completely smash my car when I run into a car beside me or a guard rail on a curve. However, when I run into a simple street sign that stops the car dead in its tracks, it's very frustrating, especially in a limited time race. Very poor insight for a race game. The physics of this genre make it fun, this game isn't fun. I would have refunded but bought it in advance during a sale and played it later on.			"

												I recommend this game only under two conditions: If it's cheaper than it's current price (at this time, $30,) and if you don't mind a game that is more of an arcade race than one with a story (which a lot of racing games are.)To me, Midnight Club: LA was the best racing game I'd ever played. A full city to race around free roaming with a decent story and actual characters with faces to get behind. You don't get that here. You do get an above average racer though (minus some issues with braking) with a decent selection of cars and a not too shabby customization. Again, not on the level of Midnight Club, but it's decent. There is somewhat of a story here, a young newbie trying to get respect on the streets and clubs. There's no free roaming or actualy people to see in the game though, from what I saw.Again if the game is about half it's price it's a decent game if you need to scratch a racing itch, and since the Deluxe Edition of Midnight Club LA isn't on steam as of this time, I would say this game is an ok racer.

												I simply cannot understand why this game can be this uncontroable. Code Master had made so many good racing games. All kind of racing simulator. Formula one, WTCC, and. In this game there is no grip in all the car. You will see indy car slid and drift through corner. What the front wing is just a displacement, and does not do anything. Because of this, you will see all the AI gonna crash into in almost all the corner all the time.			"

												Graphics and physics are a significant improvement over the original GRID, including new race event modes that can be selected during the single-player campaign.The downside to this game is that most races are only 1-lap so you either have to drive really good, or make extensive use of the flashback feature.  Due to that the game starts to feel repetitive early on in gameplay.  The other downside is the fact that you have to pay for additional vehicles despite the hefty cost of this game.  The theme these days seems to be to make the game cheap or free to compensate for having to purchase so many additional vehicles.			"

												Streets are slicker than oil on a sheet of ice. Feels more like controling a curling puck than a car, and the only way to make a corner is to slide around like a cartoon character. Hovercrafts have more traction than these vehicles. Maybe this sliding is a bit more controlable on a gamepad, but with a wheel it's nigh impossible, you just spin like a boomerange in flight.It was also frustrating that the only way to exit the game is to Alt F4, or Ctl Alt Delete. I'm not joking. Acording to the forums, you have to beat the first two races in order to get the option to exit the game, I never made it that far.The game is certainly pretty though, with great damage physics.

												This game was much better than I anticipated.  I wasn't sure what to expect having played very little of the Grid Series.  I was pleasantly surprised with a visually great game with excellent handling and a fluid, more importantly fun, campaign.  As a fan of driving games I was interested in the handling and control of the cars (Xbox Controller).  The game has the feel of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (one of my all time favs) but a little tighter on the drifts.  Not as touchy as Forza 2 but certainly not as demanding as the Gran Turismo series.  Well worth whatever I bought it for on a Steam sale.  My only complaint is a lack of a soundtrack or radio options but I usually run background players anyway.			"

												GRID 2 feels awfully patronizing. It's full of talky people who drone on and on about your next event. Hey, Mr. Sponsor guy, or whoever you are? I get it. It's a racing game. I need to race the other people and get first place. Codemasters (the developers) tries to space all of the talky bits out so that you're doing things in between some dingus blabbing in your earpiece, but then, Codemasters also included a tutorial that feels the need to break down the very concept of a race, as if you were going to play this game having never understood what the goal of racing was. I was halfway expecting to get a tutorial on what an accelerator is supposed to do, to be honest. If you can get past all of that waste of breath, this is your standard Codemasters racing game: beautiful visuals, not-quite-simulation-but-good-enough driving physics, and some pretty dang intense racing with great damage modeling. As of writing this review, I've only played it for a little under an hour, but I can already tell exactly what kind of game this is, because I've played three others just like it, and I am definitely in for this one. If only everyone in the single player mode would stop trying to chat my ear off about this ""World Series of Racing"" nonsense. Stop talking about driving and just let me drive!			"

												Welcome to GRID 2, the GRID game that doesn't have a cockpit view, and the land of Train-racers. The A.I. are so dedicated to their line that they might as well be trains on a track, just sliding through, perfect braking, perfect cornering, perfect everything. Though playing with a friend makes this game much better, playing it alone is just tough. Also, if you think I just suck at the game, yes I do. I am terrible at this because I do not have a decent controller to play on this game, only my keyboard which I am not used to. Regardless, this game is still fun with friends even if the A.I. is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. TL;DR, A.I. are trains, fun with friends. Play if you enjoy arcade-y racing.			"

												GRID 2 is a racing game where your car is made to drift every corner, does that appeal to you? Then play it, for me it completely killed the game, it was a huge disappointment after the first GRID, which was a great arcade game. I wasn't expecting any great simulator for what its worth, but please, don't make me drift at every corner, simple as that.This game had a lot of potential but the terrible gameplay is not worth it, just play GRID Autosport instead which is a FAAAAR better game.

												GRID series are like Dragon Age series of racing games.GRID was made by company that is famous for amazing racing games (TOCA, CMR) since late 90s.Dragon Age was made by company that is famous for amazing RPG games (BG, KOTOR) since late 90s.Both GRID and Dragon Age are pretty much considered as successors of previous games made by these companies.And, well... both GRID 2 and Dragon Age 2 aren't worthy of being part of their franchises. Would they be received better if they weren't using these famous names? Most definitely. Neither of them is straight up bad, it's just that neither is up to the ultimate benchmark that first games in the series set years before.The parallel doesn't end there. In both scenarios developers of each game tried to redeem themselves with third title that oddly doesn't have the number in the title. And both of them kinda succeeded. Neither Autosport or Inquisition is considered to be as good as original game, but it's still miles better than first sequel.There's one important difference though. With Dragon Age it's good to know the story of second game before playing third one, so it still is slightly recommended to play through it anyways. GRID series aren't story based games, so there's my verdict - avoid this if you liked original TOCA series and first GRID. Go buy Autosport instead... it might have some issues, but it's still miles better than this.I can only recommend this game to people who aren't really into franchise as a whole. If you like Burnout or Need For Speed, but you're tired of chasing with police, over the top crashing and racing on highways... then and only then this might be the game for you.Probably the biggest disappointment Codemasters ever delivered, and that's counting in feature-poor F1 2015 or Colin McRae Rally port from mobile phones to PC (nobody really expected anything from that, right?). Thanksfully it seems like they are on the right path again with Dirt Rally and F1 2016. Here's hoping that another GRID game will deliver as well.			"

												Cheaters! Speed boost and extra grip - two most common. And the only way to get rid of them is to report steam profile. Codemasters don't give a f**k about this problem. As for Valve I dunno if they ever issued a VAC ban for this game. It's a real shame because the game runs smoothly and it's enjoyable. I have no DLC and frankly I don't care. These RaceNet challenges don't pay too much eighter and it's like a single player extension really. I would give it solid 8/10, but because of cheaters it gets 5/10.			"

												Grid 2... there's some fun to be had with this game, some... but 90% of the time it's frustration that you will get. You want to finish 1st? then be prepared to restart a race HEAPS of times! Your car scrapes the side, you lose. Your car makes contact with anothe car, you lose. You start to drift where you're not supposed to, you lose. Only buy this game if you have the patience to slug it out and repeat a race a whole lot of times, and when the price is dirt cheap. :)			"

												First off i haven't played  a whole lot of grid 2 but i've played quite a bit of Dirt , Dirt 2 , Dirt 3, and Grid. All of which were great. (Dirt 3 was ok but still pretty good) But Grid 2? IT's so sad... Playing grid you can tell it's made to be realistic and the hud and cameras (1st person) are there. Grid 2 physics are gross and a greasy as a fat mans sweaty back. AND THERE IS NO 1ST PERSON/DRIVERS VIEW! WHAT THE ACTUAL ****!  This is a nightmare compared to grid 1. Grid 2 is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ racing game overall sadly. only impovments are the graphics which aren't seriously good but better than grid 1. but that's it.... why did they make this game it's soo bad. A kid rased by addicts as parents has more to offer than this. ( Reason i mentioned Dirt is becasue codemasters produced it. And by god wtf happend with grid 2.			"

												When purchasing grid 2, I had expected a serious racing game, like how grid 1 had the sponsoring, lemans, and all the official racing events, and when I walked into grid 2, all I got was an arcade-like drift racer. I'm very dissatisfied with the game, nor can I get a refund because I spent an hour and a half trying to get it to run on my computer, then another hour trying to find the more serious events. I recommend only for someone looking for a drift racing game. It's excellent in that regard, but not for a simulation game.			"

												This game looks quite gorgeous.  The graphics have had a real step up, there's some really good paint options available, reflections look amazing.  This would be a great game as long as all you ever do is look at it.As soon as you start to actually play it, that is where the game begins to fall apart.  The key to GRID 2 is simple:  Drift.  The first tier of cars you obtain in career mode, every single car in season one - even with DLC - is a Drift car.  And there's a reason for this.  Once you finally do work your way up the ladder, you do tart unlocking other cars.  But even with other control schemes, ""balance"", ""grip"", there is only one way to take corners with any speed:  Drifting.And even this wouldn't be as bad if it had the same more realistic drifting controls as the previous game.  But this game doesn't.  Not by a long shot.  While it may be better than the infamously bad Ridge Racer series, Codemasters has decided to throw away all pretense of a ""racing simulator"" and give us crappy arcade drifting physics.  Every car will under-steer unless you hit the breaks to throw the back end out.  Every.  Single.  Car.  Every track is made for drifting around sharp bends.  Every race expect you to drift if you want any sort of reasonable time.  Simply put, if you aren't drifting, you aren't winning.On top of that, the career tournament, sponsor, money/reputation system of the previous game is gone.  Replaced with a ""social media"" story, complete with ESPN interludes (who've proven they will do anything for a pay check whether it has any sense of reality or not).  You win races to earn ""fans"" (reputation).  Cars are just given to you, you choose between usually two - which are either virtually identical in stats or one will be a clear advantage - and you can unlock the other in a time trial.  The goal of the game is to impress drivers from other racing circuits to join your racing circuit by beating them in races.  Let me put that another way:  The goal is to impress enough fans that your brand new, all-styles racing circuit is totally for realsies by attracting drivers that you, personally, have bested in their own circuits, on their own tracks, against their own specialties.  And now you want to race them off type, off class, and against each other to give credibility for your fantasy league.  Yea, this is so much better than just, you know, trying to earn trophies from existing events.On top of that, the AI has taken a huge step back from the previous game.  Whereas in previous game, drivers had skill sets, they had favorite types, and - most importantly - they made mistakes, here we are back to AI that was laughable twenty years ago.  They follow their racing line.  They drive a little slower if they're out front, so that you can catch up, and a little faster if they're behind you (rubber band AI).  They don't care if they hit a wall, they don't care if you're in the way, they don't care if you try to spin them.  They will stick to their racing line and that is it.But wait, there's more.  In their infinite wisdom, Codemasters has added a few new race types, and of course removed some old favorites.  One of the new events, Live Routes, is a race track that is dynamically altered as you race.  In other words, you have to picture that there are people who, once a few cars go buy, run out and reset the direction of the track.  Constantly.  In a game filled with unrealistic, idiotic choices, this one takes the cake.Edit:  There is also the dreaded, obsolete, should not be seen in any video game post 2000 checkpoint racing.  This was a mechanic invented for arcade machines back when you had to continually put quarters in them every 90 seconds in order for them to earn money.  You have a time limit, and each checkpoint adds a little bit to it - not enough to get to the next point on its own, so that you will eventually run out.  It has absolutely no place in home games.  This mechanic needs to die.  Even though it is used here slightly differently than in the old arcade games, here it's set up as an actual competetion - which is probably the best use you can make out of it - checkpoint racing has left such a dirty taste in my mouth from so many games that I just cannot respect any racing game that includes it anymore.  This isn't the only thing either.  Elimination, the way they have the ""5 second rule"" to Togue.  This game has completely forgone ""simulation"" for ""arcade"".  While some players may like that, having race styles that can only really be done IN a video game... After the first GRID game, this is not at all what I wanted to see in the sequel.  I have no problem if that's the game that they wanted to make... but it should not be titled GRID 2.There are better racing games out there.  If you haven't already played the first GRID, go give that one a shot.  The cars there feel good, the game looks good, the races make sense, the AI is competitive, and most importantly, that game is far more FUN.  But hey, at least you can have pearlescent paint if you buy this one instead - though you can never remove your sponsors.			"

												I had a brief experience with Grid 2This negative review I want to preface is for the attention of people not regular to the racing genre whom may want to get a rare fix and are thinking of this game to get that doneDon't.There's better out there for our kindSo the asshat narrator is useless for a start - ""catch your back end"", ""balance your speed"" that's all he's got for me - how about tell me what button combinations to press at which speedsThis was after the first warning flag had reared its ugly head though, the first achievement pops and it’s titled “Here’s my number, Call me maybe?” I don’t have any problems with that scene, it’s not mine, there’s a good chance that if the racing genre isn’t part of your regular sensibilities then a game that makes those kinds of references may just annoy you tooFinally I am having a mess around the test track and I decide I’m done for my first session (at this point fairly sure I’ll at least play it one more time) when the game throws me into an unskippable cutscene like somehow their video of their schmuck stock racing character is so good that it demands my time with no option of me bypassing itIt was at this point that I decided Grid 2 is a game that is not meant for me, which means there’s a chance that it might be a game that's not meant for you either			"

												Pros - Good plot/story line - Easy to get in to, still challenging - Sweet graphics, nice foliage and trees - One of the better livery/decal systems I've seen - Drifting is easy/fun - Special events like overtake are really fun and a nice change of pace - Road/coastal/highway courses add a nice variety Cons - User interface is clunky at times, loses my settings, making it frustrating to use the game - No tuning options/suspension tweaking except in multiplayer - Fewer cars and choices for cars than in some other gamesSome people complain that there is no cockpit view. While this is true, it's also something I don't mind as there is bonnet and bumper cam, which effectively do pretty close to the same thing.OverviewThis is a drifer's dream game. The handling is true to each car's unique tendencies but various effects have been put in place so you don't slide out as much as you would in real life. I quite enjoy the handling, it feels very responsive in general and I love the ease with which I can slam a Camaro into a drift at full speed and still recover. Probably not realistic, but tons of fun pulling massive drifts with ease, and I like that the feeling of each car still represents the general feel of that car in real life.The custom game setup doesn't remember any of the choices I've made and it's easy to wipe out my selections and have to start over or not realize I'm not in the right race until I get to a track I didn't expect. Having to constantly swipe through tons of tracks to find the one I want every time is annoying. I like that there are lots of tracks, I don't like that the UI doesn't' remember the one I was on and doesn't have a better way to search for the tracks. This last bit is something that should change, but I put up with it because the game itself is so fun.I've heard people complain that there aren't enough tracks but I have been plenty sastisfied with the variety of tracks. I'm sure if you play a game for long enough, any game can become boring, but people who like football don't think football is boring just because it's played on the same type of field each time. I don't think racing is boring just because I'm racing the same track. With a different car, it's practically a new course to learn anyway, and lap times can probably always be improved. So far, I'm quite satisfied with the variety of tracks in this game.That brings me to the cars. There are plenty of cars, but not as many as in some other titles, for sure. I don't feel particularly lacking in car varieties, but it does seem like the car choice is a bit limited, even after unlocking lots of cars via the challenges. Overall, I don't find this to be that bad, but I would have liked more car varieties.			"

												For starters, I'm not really sure if I really like this game or if it's starting to get really annoying.As someone who really liked the first GRID, GRID 2 starts off nicely. The somewhat familiar handling and feel to the cars is there, the atmosphere is nice and especially the tracks feel nice. The UI is straightforward and easy to use, but maybe a bit on the slow side when it comes to the garage and customizing liveries for your car.So far, I'm having fun. I'm getting a good feel with the cars and handling, I get to know most of the tracks and all seems fun and games. But once you start progressing in the game, the infamous bots start to get annoying really fast. The back of the pack brakes really, really early into corners, cuts you off intentionally from overtaking and you literally have to sit there and watch as the top 3 bots get further and further away. You literally have to plow your way into the top 3, no bumbers spared, at which point the leading cars have gotten way too far away to catch up. So you restart. Over and over and over again until the AI screws up and you get a run where you get to the head of the pack early and have a decent chance.That's when I started to realize that there really hasn't been any feel of being the better driver in this game. Sure, your cornering improves over time and you get to know the tracks but most of the time youre just fighting the same AI that literally feels scripted with the head of the pack always pulling really far ahead and the rest of the bots are there just to ♥♥♥♥ you in the ♥♥♥.There is, however, some difference to the types of race youre attending. Regular races and time trials give you the most pain with bots, elimination and face-offs feel decent enough and enduraces are ridiculously easy even on the hardest difficulty. Still, on my first playthrough few years back after GRID 2 was released, I remember having tons of fun and maybe I'll get that feeling again once I finish the game a second time. I heard online-play is decent but with quirks of its own but I haven't tried it for myself.TL,DR; Recommended but with reservations, decent arcade racing to enjoy on your own or with friends. Steam Controller recommended. Race Restarters' GRID  "

												This is a very good game, different from the origional grid and still excelent. You get put straight into the main race event (unlike grid), there is no money and the cars are given to you as the game goes on. Money is replaced with fans, this is a bit strange but does not have a big impact on gameplay. There are also alot of tracks and cars (more than the origional) and the races are not all lap races, and are generally more interesting. The events available are also different to the origional and the game looks alot nicer on highest settings. On low settings it still looks better than the origional grid (not by much) meaning it will still run on a relative toaster of a PC (such as mine).The issues i have had.1. in the 11h of playing this game i have had it crash twice (crashed the game and steam). This happened right at the end of races each time and i lost the progress for that race (all the other races were saved as the auto-save is excellent).2. as per usual on all codemasters driving games i have owened (Grid, Grid 2 and Dirt 3) the character model in the car you are driving completely dissapears. This does not affect gameplay much in this game as there is no internal cam (unlike the origional grid). I have contacted the devs about this glitch and they were not able to tell me anything about it. IF YOU GET THIS PROBLEM PLEASE REPLY TO THIS (the devs suggested it may be something to do with windows 8).3. The co-driver is the most condisending back seat driver in the world. I have actually rage quit entirely because of him. I was in first and bushed a wall... ""You'll have to make up for lost time"" etc. He is so annoying.Over all an excellent game and i would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a nice, well made, racing game.			"

												First off, this game has decent graphics, and is very easy to run. Gameplay wise it's just like any other racing game and not much differentiates it from other games, the physics, customisation and overall immersion are all quite good, nothing quite stands out about it but I would still recommend the game to anyone who's a fan of racing games in general. 8/10			"

												Welcome to GRID 2, the GRID game that doesn't have a cockpit view, and the land of Train-racers. The A.I. are so dedicated to their line that they might as well be trains on a track, just sliding through, perfect braking, perfect cornering, perfect everything. Though playing with a friend makes this game much better, playing it alone is just tough. Also, if you think I just suck at the game, yes I do. I am terrible at this because I do not have a decent controller to play on this game, only my keyboard which I am not used to. Regardless, this game is still fun with friends even if the A.I. is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. TL;DR, A.I. are trains, fun with friends. Play if you enjoy arcade-y racing.			"

												I recommend this game only under two conditions: If it's cheaper than it's current price (at this time, $30,) and if you don't mind a game that is more of an arcade race than one with a story (which a lot of racing games are.)To me, Midnight Club: LA was the best racing game I'd ever played. A full city to race around free roaming with a decent story and actual characters with faces to get behind. You don't get that here. You do get an above average racer though (minus some issues with braking) with a decent selection of cars and a not too shabby customization. Again, not on the level of Midnight Club, but it's decent. There is somewhat of a story here, a young newbie trying to get respect on the streets and clubs. There's no free roaming or actualy people to see in the game though, from what I saw.Again if the game is about half it's price it's a decent game if you need to scratch a racing itch, and since the Deluxe Edition of Midnight Club LA isn't on steam as of this time, I would say this game is an ok racer.

In this game there is no grip in all the car. You will see indy car slid and drift through corner. What the front wing is just a displacement, and does not do anything. Because of this, you will see all the AI gonna crash into in almost all the corner all the time.			"

												I had a brief experience with Grid 2This negative review I want to preface is for the attention of people not regular to the racing genre whom may want to get a rare fix and are thinking of this game to get that doneDon't.There's better out there for our kindSo the asshat narrator is useless for a start - ""catch your back end"", ""balance your speed"" that's all he's got for me - how about tell me what button combinations to press at which speedsThis was after the first warning flag had reared its ugly head though, the first achievement pops and it’s titled “Here’s my number, Call me maybe?” I don’t have any problems with that scene, it’s not mine, there’s a good chance that if the racing genre isn’t part of your regular sensibilities then a game that makes those kinds of references may just annoy you tooFinally I am having a mess around the test track and I decide I’m done for my first session (at this point fairly sure I’ll at least play it one more time) when the game throws me into an unskippable cutscene like somehow their video of their schmuck stock racing character is so good that it demands my time with no option of me bypassing itIt was at this point that I decided Grid 2 is a game that is not meant for me, which means there’s a chance that it might be a game that's not meant for you either			"

												Awesome game. This is not a simulator, but also not  an arcade. Grid found that thin line inbetween, and that is what makes it so good. Lot of cars available that are separated in different tiers. The balance is pretty good in between, if you are a good friver you will be able to win with a less powerfull car too. Online there are some minor problems, many people are rammig and often you get penaly despite the fact you got rammed.			"

												I played grid 2 as a free acess for 3 days and I absolutley loved it. AUESOME cars, tracks, and graphics. However the crash physics can be a bit unbelivable. The frame bends in ways that look catoonish. Also, there's no way to kill your car. So you can have absolutley destroyed your car cosmetically, but your car will still be able to drive. Also, I played this game hoping to get a simulator, Instead I got a game with NFS type physics. I don't know If they were shooting for an accurate driving simulation game, but that is what the trailers made me think. I sadley have a crap computer but the game still runs at a smooth 30FPS. I have not found any good or bad glitches In the game. Despite the arcade driving physics, and cartoonish crash physics, I HIGHLY recommend this game. I rate this game a 8.5 out of 10			"

												The pros:- Great game for you if you like racing games with no open world.- It's easy to control. My 5yo learned fast and loved it. I bought for him.- It has a flashback feature which feels totally like cheating but well... it's in the game so...- Graphics are awesome.The cons:- Price is high for what it delivers.- No car mods.- The base game gets you so few cars. They removed like 90% of the cars of the main game and put them on DLCs for sale.- Won't let you skip cutscenes. I hate games who do that. The impression is that the game thinks its cutscenes are SO AMAZING that you should see them. Not only cutscenes but you also can't skip little transitions in the game, which is annoying.- On windows 7, alt tab will mess up video resolution and sometimes not even get input anymore, only after restarting the game.- No real ""first person"" view with handle bar and everything. Also no handbrake controls, you'll have to drift with your regular brakes. Also no mirrors, but you do see a little arrow when cars are close to you.			"

												For starters, I'm not really sure if I really like this game or if it's starting to get really annoying.As someone who really liked the first GRID, GRID 2 starts off nicely. The somewhat familiar handling and feel to the cars is there, the atmosphere is nice and especially the tracks feel nice. The UI is straightforward and easy to use, but maybe a bit on the slow side when it comes to the garage and customizing liveries for your car.So far, I'm having fun. I'm getting a good feel with the cars and handling, I get to know most of the tracks and all seems fun and games. But once you start progressing in the game, the infamous bots start to get annoying really fast. The back of the pack brakes really, really early into corners, cuts you off intentionally from overtaking and you literally have to sit there and watch as the top 3 bots get further and further away. You literally have to plow your way into the top 3, no bumbers spared, at which point the leading cars have gotten way too far away to catch up. So you restart. Over and over and over again until the AI screws up and you get a run where you get to the head of the pack early and have a decent chance.That's when I started to realize that there really hasn't been any feel of being the better driver in this game. Sure, your cornering improves over time and you get to know the tracks but most of the time youre just fighting the same AI that literally feels scripted with the head of the pack always pulling really far ahead and the rest of the bots are there just to ♥♥♥♥ you in the ♥♥♥.There is, however, some difference to the types of race youre attending. Regular races and time trials give you the most pain with bots, elimination and face-offs feel decent enough and enduraces are ridiculously easy even on the hardest difficulty. Still, on my first playthrough few years back after GRID 2 was released, I remember having tons of fun and maybe I'll get that feeling again once I finish the game a second time. I heard online-play is decent but with quirks of its own but I haven't tried it for myself.TL,DR; Recommended but with reservations, decent arcade racing to enjoy on your own or with friends. Steam Controller recommended. Race Restarters' GRID  "

												Not worth the price... in short: It's just no fun to play.Visuals are great, but then there is this shaky cam that starts to shake more the faster you go. Pretty annoying.The AI is challenging which actually is a good thing... but... it's like you race against tanks. You cannot push them, they are just driving without any impact. Driving physics also can be annoying... when you touch a wall, your car will turn 180 degrees and you have to use the reset.Got it in a sale for 5€ and wouldn't do that again. Also, the racetracks are mostly boring... city race here, city race there. Too many 90 degrees corners, not enough natural race tracks. AI is cheating.No, thanks.			"

												I've found 20 hours of enjoyment in GRID 2, though I am a die-hard fan of any racing game released by Codemasters (Dirt Showdown notwithstanding, nobody likes Dirt Showdown). The base game is fun, good-looking, challenging and satisfying, and there can be a lot of fun had with a couple of friends online. Definite recommendation.One word of warning about this game though - to me NONE of the DLC is worth the money you'll pay, even on sale. Currently, you'll pay £3.50 for the luxury of one extra car and being able to drive around Yas Marina in the daytime. I think not.			"

												The graphics are better than Grid1 but the gameplay is pretty similar while driving but with less choice in what sort of races you do. Grid gives a alrge choice in the events to do next, grid 2 makes the choice very limited.Also it keep crashing for me. I win a 3 stage event then the game crashes on the results page. After restarting you are classed as DNF on the event and have to do the whole thing again.Buy grid 1 instead. The graphics are not quite as good but it's cheaper, is a great game and it doesn't crash all the time and cause frustration.			"

												We have only had this game for a few days, but it keeps us playing it to get to the next round.  At times there is screen problem, even with a 144 hz setup.  The game can be fun once you get used to the controls and start winning the races on Very Easy.  It's a nice game to kill time with and it's not overly complicated.  Graphics are beautifully done, but sometimes they break up during the race.  Courses do provide a welcome break from a circular race track.			"

												On the whole there is much to recommend this game, but I think it is not in any way a racing game for the novice or hobby racing aficianado.  Tracks are beautiful, the sound is fantastic, race modes are surprisingly diverse and engaging, course layout is well-balanced and challenging, but there are a few significant shortcomings that easily-frustrated racers will struggle with.  AI is atrocious and will run you over in the pursuit of their racing line, any collision with AI vehicles will remove all steering capacity from your car until you disengage (meaning you will have to brake as the AI won't do so to disentangle itself), and the game's inexplicable career decision to constantly shift you between disciplines and vehicle classes will rapidly grow weary.  It is almost impossible to develop any kind of racing groove when you are boomeranged between track toys, drift cars, and heavy upper class vehicles that steer like couches.  And then the shuddering camera - evidently set that way to give the sensation of car vibration and sway - will give you fits if you suffer from any kind of motion sickness.  In the chase view, and especially racing at night, the sway becomes infuriating and actively impedes developing skill and consistency.  The handling can be an issue, too, but with practice you will get a solid handle on how cars respond to steering inputs, and indeed the (unalterable) steering sensitivity comes to make sense with time.  In the end, the game is excellent, but is perhaps not suitable (re: fun) for gamers not familiar with its quirks and oft-puzzling handling/viewing designs.  The difficulty slider can only help with the competitiveness and timing of the AI and cannot help with those issues that are most likely to cause the greatest frustrations: camera shudder, collision detections, and erratic career arc.Mac-specific notes: the game performed fine - and indeed better than most Codemasters titles have for me! - crashing to desktop only 1 time.  Menus are easy to negotiate and understand, although there is no slider to adjust steering sensitivity and linearity.  On just a few races there was significant screen-tearing as well as general hiccups on loading screens, but for the most part these did not influence the game negatively.EDIT: after further time with the game, new issues which have resulted in its removal from my installed library - without finishing the game campaign - have popped up.  The WSR in Asia section offers a mix of race types with restricted car selection; many of these vehicles are ""grip"" RWD which behave in unpredictable ways.  The light track toys, for example, will sometimes drift as instructed and on other sweeping turns will not.  Combining unpredictable handling response with downhill driving at high speeds and ridiculous amounts of camera shake ended with me terminating the game.  Speeds that would result in my car being unable to steer were met by the AI with no issue at all, in fact the AI gained speed on some corners!  The difficulty spike is understandable, but I have zero desire to grind seconds off of long, twisting races where I cannot guarantee that handling will remain the same upon application of braking and throttle.  And elimination races with drift cars became simply tedious; starting in 9th with a drift car that you can not drift with - because contact with any other racer causes you to lose all steering regardless of contact point - makes it less a race and more a demo derby.  The game is still recommended, but only to racers of sufficient patience and understanding to deal with the game's plethora of puzzling design schemes.			"

												Hi, I found a solution to the constant crashing !!!! The one where it kicks you out, gives a steam intallation window,then an error 42 (or something like that).The problem is with Windows 10, search ""services"" then look for ""Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service"" and stop the service.I acually found it in a steam forum of all places (after googling it). People are very quick to accept that a problem will always be there and blame it on the devs. But if you look hard enough and not give up, you'll find a solution. This is a great game, fell in love with Grid. There are very few proper racing games where everything just works. Grid 2 is a good game for casual and very easy to get into and thats what I love about it. "

												The graphics are great, the sound is fantastic, the driving physics are very nice, and it's easy to play even with keyboard controls. Buy this game for the single-player or playing rounds with your friends, *not* multiplayer with random people. You will find that there are not always people playing online, and if you pop into a session, then you may wait for the current race to finish just to be kicked from the lobby once the host returns to the lobby, and if you do manage to get into a race and then do well in it, you may get kicked at the end of a race. That just happened to me twice: I won but I guess the lobby host was angry so I got a message saying I was kicked from lobby, did not even receive any EXP or Cash -- the grinding is slow in multiplayer, which makes this even more frustrating. The first time, it was in a lobby doing 5-race demolition derby mode, 10 laps per race, and so I'd spent something like half an hour, so when the thing ended and I had won, I was very annoyed that I had just spent so much time just to receive nothing because the lobby host was acting like a small child. The second time, I played against 2 people who both had much better cars (they were higher level) and since they kept crashing and going off-track I got past them, but when one caught up to me because his car was faster he tried several times to ram me off of the track. I don't mind that, it's part of the game. Anyway, he failed miserably and I still won, but unfortunately it seems Codemasters has given the power to lobby hosts to kick players mid-race. Clearly, that's easy to abuse, and although it would be great if they'd patch the game to at least give EXP/Cash when you're kicked, I seriously doubt that will ever happen because this game has been around for a while already.

												This is a very good game, different from the origional grid and still excelent. You get put straight into the main race event (unlike grid), there is no money and the cars are given to you as the game goes on. Money is replaced with fans, this is a bit strange but does not have a big impact on gameplay. There are also alot of tracks and cars (more than the origional) and the races are not all lap races, and are generally more interesting. The events available are also different to the origional and the game looks alot nicer on highest settings. On low settings it still looks better than the origional grid (not by much) meaning it will still run on a relative toaster of a PC (such as mine).The issues i have had.1. in the 11h of playing this game i have had it crash twice (crashed the game and steam). This happened right at the end of races each time and i lost the progress for that race (all the other races were saved as the auto-save is excellent).2. as per usual on all codemasters driving games i have owened (Grid, Grid 2 and Dirt 3) the character model in the car you are driving completely dissapears. This does not affect gameplay much in this game as there is no internal cam (unlike the origional grid). I have contacted the devs about this glitch and they were not able to tell me anything about it. IF YOU GET THIS PROBLEM PLEASE REPLY TO THIS (the devs suggested it may be something to do with windows 8).3. The co-driver is the most condisending back seat driver in the world. I have actually rage quit entirely because of him. I was in first and bushed a wall... ""You'll have to make up for lost time"" etc. He is so annoying.Over all an excellent game and i would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a nice, well made, racing game.			"

												GRID 2 feels awfully patronizing. It's full of talky people who drone on and on about your next event. Hey, Mr. Sponsor guy, or whoever you are? I get it. It's a racing game. I need to race the other people and get first place. Codemasters (the developers) tries to space all of the talky bits out so that you're doing things in between some dingus blabbing in your earpiece, but then, Codemasters also included a tutorial that feels the need to break down the very concept of a race, as if you were going to play this game having never understood what the goal of racing was. I was halfway expecting to get a tutorial on what an accelerator is supposed to do, to be honest. If you can get past all of that waste of breath, this is your standard Codemasters racing game: beautiful visuals, not-quite-simulation-but-good-enough driving physics, and some pretty dang intense racing with great damage modeling. As of writing this review, I've only played it for a little under an hour, but I can already tell exactly what kind of game this is, because I've played three others just like it, and I am definitely in for this one. If only everyone in the single player mode would stop trying to chat my ear off about this ""World Series of Racing"" nonsense. Stop talking about driving and just let me drive!			"

												Grid 2... there's some fun to be had with this game, some... but 90% of the time it's frustration that you will get. You want to finish 1st? then be prepared to restart a race HEAPS of times! Your car scrapes the side, you lose. Your car makes contact with anothe car, you lose. You start to drift where you're not supposed to, you lose. Only buy this game if you have the patience to slug it out and repeat a race a whole lot of times, and when the price is dirt cheap. :)			"

												Ok, lets start with the physics, this is actually like the worst physics in a racing game that i have played and i mean it. Drifting is very nice and smooth but in normal races, the drift events feel really really weird and its annoying to drift there or maybe its just me. The graphics are just great ! This game is from 2013 and in my opinion you could still compare the graphics to a new game (if you are playing with everything on MAX!) Overall this game is really fun to play only if the physics and AI was much better it would be a fantastic game ! Right now i would rate this game 7,5/10 and i really recommend everyone to atleast try this game---- THX for taking your time and reading my review.			"

												Bought it on sale, with all the DLC, and I must say... I rather enjoy it. Personal opinion.Its all well and fine to have a good, challenging sim (like Assetto Corsa) but you need something to compare it to, a nice arcade game. Grid 2 is beautifully presented, with large variety of cars, playing styles and is difficult enough without being a daunting prospect. The livery editor adds to the beauty of the cars, and the environment you're racing through. I ADORED the Project Gotham games growing up. I've been looking for a similar game since Microsoft killed it in 2007 (nearly ten years ago, I feel old now) and this, is close as I've gotten. My only real irk is the jagoff that keeps yapping at you whilst you're racing. If I wanted a wife, I'd download one.			"

												After spending nearly twice as much time in Forza Horizon 3 I can say without shadow of a doubt this is a better racing game. The cars each have a learning curve and driving itself is a challenge where the reward is better handling. It doesn't have an open world map, it doesn't have a giant selection of cars, and it doesn't have Toyota ( :(((( ) but what Grid 2 does have is incredible sound design, damage models, handling, aesthetic (to a degree) and an overall better feel. It takes me back to the early 2000s sense of wonder and challenge that I felt playing the first four Gran Turismo games on the Playstation and Playstation 2. I can't say the same for Codemasters' newest title Dirt Rally since it's almost impossible to play with a controller, but if Dirt Rally's sound design, graphical fidelity and damage models are any signal of how the next Grid will be my wallet is already prying itself apart to shell out the proper amount of shekels. Get Grid 2 for a fun racing game and especially for the Touge element. Get the next Grid that ever comes out if you want to nut harder than you've ever nutted before.			"

												GRID 2 feels awfully patronizing. It's full of talky people who drone on and on about your next event. Hey, Mr. Sponsor guy, or whoever you are? I get it. It's a racing game. I need to race the other people and get first place. Codemasters (the developers) tries to space all of the talky bits out so that you're doing things in between some dingus blabbing in your earpiece, but then, Codemasters also included a tutorial that feels the need to break down the very concept of a race, as if you were going to play this game having never understood what the goal of racing was. I was halfway expecting to get a tutorial on what an accelerator is supposed to do, to be honest. If you can get past all of that waste of breath, this is your standard Codemasters racing game: beautiful visuals, not-quite-simulation-but-good-enough driving physics, and some pretty dang intense racing with great damage modeling. As of writing this review, I've only played it for a little under an hour, but I can already tell exactly what kind of game this is, because I've played three others just like it, and I am definitely in for this one. If only everyone in the single player mode would stop trying to chat my ear off about this ""World Series of Racing"" nonsense. Stop talking about driving and just let me drive!			"

												A good, very arcade-y racing game which has aged gracefully, looks decent and runs smoothly on a computer that was medium performance (or less) when I purchased it 3 years ago.It has some fun race modes (such as Overtake). The announcer is annoying as hell (I've set his volume to zero).For me it became suddenly ridiculously difficult in season 4 and I've stopped playing, not interesting enough to be worth the frustration.

												GRID 2: UPDATE FROM MY LAST REVIEW(TAKEN DOWN) Okay so i love this game and everything about it! i have a few hours in but i stopped playing for a bit..wll i don't know what happened but this game is unplayable on my system i am on a lower end pc rightnow but still the lag and fps drops the freeze at the main menus.. its bad i ran the Grid2 exe the secondary exe it runs the same still same BS problems..WE NEED A FIX. It's a amazing of course its a great challenge and worth the cash and codemasters i like more then EA :D but im going toward Dirt 3 Complete Edition and possibly GRID 1. Sorry GRID 2 you will be missed :( (Until Patch!!)			"

												I played the demo for Grid (1) on Xbox 360 and I loved it, but I found it too difficult. When I bought my gaming PC, I bought it and finished the game in about 27 hours of playtime total, and then bought Grid 2. Now I have over 100 hours into this game! Changed a bit but is still amazing. I'd love to see a Grid 3 beside Grid Autosport. I don't think I'd enjoy this game as much on a console, but I love playing it on PC with music playing in the background. Favorite racing game of all time!			"

												The gameplay isn't bad, but I as well as many others have had problems with microstuttering fps that affects the controlability of the cars during a race. I have tried everything I could find online to get it working, and the best thing I can come up with is that the game wasn't optimized for NVIDIA cards and some owners of them are the crowd that cannot enjoy this game.EDIT: Update as of February 26, 2015, the fps stutter still hasn't been fixed. This is the last game I'm buying from codemasters, as there has been no support or feedback from the issue and I can't imagine they would continue to fix bugs when they can just make new games. /sEDIT 2: Fast forward 2 years, much upgraded system (i5 6600k, 16gb ram, gtx 1070) the game still has absolutely terrible fps hitching. I cannot believe in the awful support for your games and stand by my statement that I will no longer purchase any of your future titles.			"

												It’s rare I can say about any game that it was a pure joy to play but that’s just the case with GRID 2.Sure, the selection of locations could be bigger and I heard that they tried to fix this with GRID Autosport. Apart from that this game is almost perfect.Seventy six (!) hugely varied vehicles providing different handling feel, even when playing with a keyboard. Several difficulty levels. Famous Codemasters’ flashback functionality for correcting (almost) all your driving mistakes. Great sound production, both when it comes to music and environment. As always with Codies, beautiful in-game menu. Overall, 20+ hours of great driving fun.What's not so good about GRID 2? There is no cockpit view. As I've already mentioned, number of locations could definitely go up since it starts to feel a little bit boring and repetitive near the end. However, there are many career disciplines to fully make up for that.This is a beautiful and well optimized game. Despite minor flaws GRID 2 is a proper successor to the original GRID. Highly recommend. 8/10			"

												Really nice game- much more improvements over GRID. Polished very neatly and runs and looks great.			"
