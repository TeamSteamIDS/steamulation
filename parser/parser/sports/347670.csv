												Old school Karate action done right in the 2D world drawing on influences of some of the most challenging competition games ever made from Karate Champ to Street Fighter.  No crazy complex combos, the simple controls allow for strategic planning of your moves precisely when used in this competitive fighter.  Many games people buy because their cheap then never play one hour of them, this game is to awesome to not play.   This game does the hardest thing in gaming, taking a simple concept and making it fun to play with working controls.  The competition style of the game uses a variety of moves that force the player NOT to just mash the buttons but plan each move to become a black belt master of their own.  The game is riddled with spelling errors and sentences that make no sense, but all that anyone needs to understand is ""Karate is life!!!!""  At first many will think the strange phrasing of sentences is some kind of retro feel, though after checking their website, it seems to just be the way they write in general for whatever reason.   Either way it is awesome and fits the game perfectly.  This game has the most important aspect working flawlessly, the ai opponents are challenging and its never the same fight twice.  The music in the game is just as hardcore as the visuals.  Sick of boring drawn out realistic hipster type games from the last few years?  If so then karate Master 2 is your cure!   As the game says, get ready to ""get covered in glory.""  How often does anyone get to say that?  Imagine someone asking you how your day is, now finally you can reply saying you are covered in glory. What a good day to be you!Rating:  10/10  Value:  $9.99 *for those who want the awesomesauce of Karate Master 1, its free from the developer and can be downloaded on their official website:  http://www.criansoft.com/eng/Karate%20Master%20KDB.html "

  Introduction            	Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is fighting/arcade game. It gives everyone nostalgia with the great retro feel. The gameplay is very fun, from the fighting to the minigames. Some opponents have different fighting styles and this makes the game a lot more varied, but the grindy nature of this game is a huge turn-off for me. The cheesy 90s take on this game makes it very funny and interesting to play and with mash of game genres, Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is tons of fun. The only real issues anyone will have with game is the fact that it’s grindy at times and the repetitive music.   Pros               
Retro style  Comedy Cool fighting mechanics  Good price Free mode to practice  Fun minigames    Cons              
Repetitive at times  Bad keyboard support Repetitive music     Conclusion                 	Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is a retro fighting/rpg/karate/arcade game that has great minigames, brutal fighting, retro style, and cheesy 90s gameplay. With a 9.99 USD price tag, Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is tons of fun and if you like cheesy retro fighting games this is a must have for you. -HiPFiRED   If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												I am really digging this game.It kinda has an SNK fighting game feel to it, but there is a skill progression that really adds depth and playthrough time to the game.  As you progress further in your stats, you unlock new training minigames that really help keep them from feeling stale.As for the controls, they're pretty tight for being an indie title.  However, the game assumes you have an Xbox 360 controller, as the on-screen button prompts are of the A+B+X+Y variety, makes it confusing if you're using a keyboard.  Personally, I'm using a USB-connected SNES controller and it works beautifully with this game.The graphics really capture the feel of the transitional period between the 16-bit and 32-bit console eras (think NEO-GEO), and they are of much higher quality than your average indie fare.The sound effects and music really make this game shine, once again perfectly capturing that bygone era that a lot of us spent middle school listening to as we played our games.If I were to criticize anything, it would probably be the rough translation job, but it's a minor slight that doesn't take away from the game much at all.The devs have some real talent, and this game is well worth the $10.  I'd like to see where they go from here.			"

												In Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow you take up the quest of a visionary man (Player 1) on his quest to open up his own karate school.  The reason why Player 1 wants to open up a karate school is so that he can pass down his style of karate (which is identical to the style used by every other karateka in the game).  Being that his city only has 10 karate dojos (other than the one he wants to buy and open) and 4 dedicated karate tournaments, there is obviously a vast untapped market for Player 1's tutelage.  There are two main ways to fufill Player 1's dream: putting boxes on a truck with a forklift and getting famous enough to participate in the advanced karate tournaments that actually have monetary prizes and don't cost money to do.  In practice, even if you opt for the second way of raising the necessary funds, you will have to do the forklift minigame every few attempts at the tournament.  Much like the path of a real karateka the game is very grindy and repetitive, but you'll have some fun if you buy it on sale.			"

												I had absolutely no expectations for this game but I'm having a lot of fun with it at the moment! It's an amusing Fighting/RPG hybrid with charming retro graphics so if that sounds like your kind of game then do pick it up!Pros: + Nice graphics+ Good combat system+ Good impact on the blows, landing an axe kick which cracks the opponent's skull is very satisfying+ Some opponents have different fighting-styles which makes the game a bit more varied.Cons:- Very grindy, may get repetitive- Lack of tutorial and very shallow explanation on how to perform certain moves- Some spelling mistakes here and thereFinal rating: 8/10.

												I must say I love this game. So retro, yet so good. Great graphics with superb animation, fun minigames. Can be kind of a grind, but a decent challenge.One thing I would like to see is more knockdown animations, appropriate to where the hit connects. For some people, the lack of MP might turn them out, but it doesn't prevent this from being a great game.			"

												Nineteen eighty five called, it would like to have a word with you about cheesy Karate games. Specifically, I would like you to cast your mind back to the spectrum era. Long loading times, terribad graphics, but a blank canvas where game creativity was about pushing boundaries and exploring what games could be. One of those many explorations was a title called IK+ (International Karate +), a glorious bit of code involving some pixellated men in pyjamas whacking each other in the goal of changing their belt colours. The controls were tight, the fighting was good, and the feeling was very much that of a cheesy b-movie. Hell, the Amiga version had Stephen Segal (or a very good likeness)[www.atarimania.com] on the cover along with what looks to be Chuck Norris delivering a trademark kick to some poor sod. Fighting games have wavered in and out of vogue, travelling between the more realistic and the more fantastical over the generations, but the pure, basic Karate game sortof vanished into the ether...... UNTIL NOW...... KAHATAE MASTAH. NOCKA DOON BALOO. OSU!It's gloriously throwback, the graphics are retro Amiga era, the script has more chinglish than a motherboard manual, you get to Karate Fight a bull and a bear (yes, you get the opportunity to punch a bear), and you get to do a jump kick over a car to promote your dojo. It's that kind of finely matured cheese. Jackie Chan would be -proud- to feature in such a script. It has so much terribleness (like the fact you can exit without saving very easily and the game does a TERRIBLE job of warning you) that it has no right to be as good as it is. Yet, it is. It's good, it's good in the way finely matured cheese is good.The game features a mix of tournaments, one shot fights against various opponents (who if you beat, will then appear in the said same tournaments), special encounters such as the aforementioned ""DO A FLYING KICK OVER A CAR!"", and occasional expositions of horribly written story, with english so badly written even google translate looks at me and throws it's arms up in despair. You can read it, and you'll laugh, it's that wonderfully bad. In between the fighting and the b-reel script you get to train your fighter in a fantastically diverse set of mini-games (some are genius, others... not so much), and there's a limited RPG style progression system where you'll tinker with the stats of your fighter, and can even suffer injuries and get to participate in a mini game where you have to recover from those (and the first time that happens, you get some cringeworthy story for that too).The fighting however is -good-, really good, it uses the tekken style approach of mapping left and right legs and arms to seperate buttons, and then you can apply ""low"" or ""high"" using down or up on the controller to give you a wide variety of punches and kicks. There's a good set of combos and a fairly fluid system tucked away in here, as well as a solid blocking and countering system, and button mashing is punished frequently with the AI giving you a damn good spanking in the later stages, so it pays to learn the intricacies. In effect, this is IK+ put on steroids, and then given a serious training regimen, the Karate is pretty full featured (at least that an outside layperson can figure) and has a much more realistic, crunchy feel to it, as opposed to the more fantasy based fighters that you tend to run into.Training focusses on the various stats, or training you in new moves, the stat training can range from simple button mashing (for body conditioning, which will give you hand cramp, well, they did say it was toughness training - BEAR THE PAIN), to attempting to hit a tennis ball suspended by a piece of string, which feels a bit like the human version of a cat playing with a feather. Generally speaking some minigames work really well (the concrete bag, the strength tests, some of the toughness tests) and there's only a few real duds (the water droplet test can die in a fire). There's even a minigame where you work to build up funds to enter the starter tournaments, which... can go horribly wrong if you decide to fiddle about with your forklift (there's safety videos for that you know!).With all this said, would one recommend it? At the price point it's pitched at? Absolutely. It's a -steal-. There's a lot to do in this game, and it'll keep you busy easily for a good few evenings or a solid weekend, and you may well return to it every so often for a theraputic bit of Karate fighting in the later tournaments, even after you master the game. It's excellent value, and as a b-movie, modernised IK+, it's an easy sell. If you're into fighting games and fancy a change of pace, grab this and give it a whirl.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game!...But it's a ♥♥♥♥ing insult that this was released in the state that it is for the price. It is one of the buggiest, crytpic, unpolished games I have ever played. I'm convinced the team spent more time making the trailer than bug testing.Map screen audio settings independant from the rest of the game? Check.The game alt-tabbing itself on KOs? Check.Losing a match to an opponent you KOd? Check.Randomly losing training points? Check.Manual with very little info and no documentation? Check.Awful Engrish? Czech. (Though a bit charming.)Poor menus and general user interface? Check.And random crashes? You bet!It's a real shame because I still enjoyed it and there is great combat beneath the abrasive buggy exterior but this feels like an unfinished flash game, I guess there's no quality control on products released on steam!

												Knock Down Blow is largely a martial arts sports game, sharing more in common with Budoken (1989) and the like than most other fighting games. It does not feature magic attacks, energy blasts, or even flips; but rather fists, feet, blood, sweat, tears, karate, forklifts and a bear. This provides for a more realistic, restrained, visceral and violent experience that defies the game’s appearance and feels quite unique to the genre.With liver injuries, skull fractures, brain damage and more all lovingly recreated, this game delivers a real sensation of beating the crap out of someone else, which will appeal to many Steam users. However, Karate Master also delivers a sensation of having the crap beat out of you, which many Steam users will relate to.Some of the training exercises depicted are tedious, some are momentarily fun. And while there is a cheese strategy or two for the actual fighting, timing and technique are rewarded and the results are most satisfying.			"

												I'm definitely positive about this one, but with a couple of reservations.The first is, I was hoping for something that felt a lot more like Princess Maker or one of those games where you pick and develop a career. The second was, I was hoping for more meaningful specializations - developing an overpowered kick at the expense of punches, say. Neither of these elements, or anything like them, really, are in the game.But what we do have is an absolute beauty of a retro-styled martial arts fighter with RPG elements. It is very, very grindy, but the fights and occasional training minigames are, for the most part, a fun way to blow through a few minutes here and there. The translation isn't quite right, which, honestly, adds to the flavour. It feels SO much like a game from the 90s or 80s it's insane. If it's on special, this game is a no-brainer. If it's not, and you're willing to support devs, go for it.			"

												OSU!In short; this game is a mixture of a classic arcade title like Karate Champs, IK+, or the obscure Chatan Yarakuu Shanku - The Karate Tournament, with Art of Fighting's visuals and the recent UFC titles' attention to detail, with a touch of RPG and simulation.If you look at the screenshots and expect Karate Master 2: Knock Down Blow to be a typical Street Fighter II clone straight from the 90s you'll be in for a surprise.  In this game you play as forklift truck driver and karate novice Ken during his young adult years in 1980s Japan as he hones his skills, tempers his body and soul, breaks his bones, and fights every rival in order to achieve his goal of becoming a karate master and open his own school.To accomplish this you will be tasked with taking on the various dojos of this harbour town, most of which are variations of karate, but you will also fight boxing, wrestling, Muay Thai, and Taikwondo practitioners, as well as the odd bull or car, and defeating their students to make a name for yourself.However, these dojos don't except a new face.  You need to earn fame by winning two types of tournaments, one with protective gear and one without.  The difference supposedly is face hitting is against the rules of the latter tournament, however there isn't any in game punishment for this so just go wild.  I did find it the tougher tournament of the two, but otherwise they're very similar.However, you will also need to earn money in order to enter these, and other tournaments, which is earned with a rather simple yet satisfying forklift minigame that brings back memories of the similarly themed Shenmue.Winning the tournaments and defeating dojos will earn you training days, which are used to increase your Stength, Speed, Toughness, Ki (stamina), and Tai Kitae (described as increasing the roughness of your skin, effectively it increases your chance of critical blows) which are handled via various mini games that are unlocked as you progress in each stat.  Unfortunately a lot of these are rather hit and miss, but they're short enough that they likely won't be too off putting, but you will be playing them a lot.As for the combat itself you have the d-pad and four face buttons, which for reference I will be using the X-Box pad layout for further descriptions.  Much like Tekken or UFC titles the face buttons represent Kens left and right punches and kicks, and the d-pad is used to aim for high, mid, or low strikes, combinations of the buttons are used for various techniques, and pressing the two punches together, plus a direction, will perform one of your defensive katas.Instead of a health metre, your body, as well as your opponent's, is represented by a small green silhouette which indicates damage to your head, legs, arms, or torso by changing to light green, yellow, orange, and finally red.  This increases the chance of being knocked out, but fortunately does recover slightly.  I'm not certain what governs recovery as such, but you'll sometimes be very grateful for a Yame, where the fight pauses due to either one of the combatants falling to te mat or going out of bounds, after which the combatants return to their starting positions.  This gives you a moment for recovery of both your health and Ki, though be warns, if you've taken too much of a beating you won't heal at all.Fights are tense at first, as a single strike can end a match due to the opponent being too strong, or them breaking your bones with a critical.  When this happens you end up in hospital and must engage in a mini game to heal.  Fortunately this action goes both ways, meaning you can score a luck strike as well.The game feels both technical and arcadey, I don't want to say I had to use a lot of skill beyond targeting a certain area, and some fights can feel like they're just a war of attrition, but at the same time are very enjoyable.  Hitting a heavy blow or dazing an opponent by getting in a Brainshock or similar feels great, and having to back off and rethink your game due to getting pulverised in the first few seconds and make a very tense moment or two, leading to a more brutal feel than the more famous fighters out there.The visuals and sound really help there, seeing a realistic amount of blood splattering the fighters and the floor, heay blows sounding like an explosion as the game momentarily shudders as the screen is framed with a red haze, and the aforementioned Brain/Livershock, being left breathless, or a receiving muscle injury causes a dizzying, wobbly effect as the fighter starts staggering as they try to fight, all of it leads to a real sense of risk and struggle.The graphics aren't superb sadly, the sprite work, while effective, does look very rough, especially on some of the fighters, and some of the backgrounds are poorly rendered polygon work, though it has some of the better audiences I've seen in a game.  The music is pretty good, if not very memorable.  It has the feel of an old Tokusatsu show, as well as a classic beat 'em up, and fits the game very well.Unfortunately the game does have some issues, occasionally the controls would become unresponsive, and the game can be rather repetitive, as grinding is necessary to max out your stats, and get enough money to get through the game.  It also hurts that there's a distinct lack of multiplayer, which would be great in a game this dedicated to an authentic feeling fighting game RPG.I spent around 6 hours in order to get to the credits, which considering the price is very good.  I can honestly say I had a huge amount of fun in that time, and would love to play more.  Hopefully there will be a sequel some day, with multiplayer included.			"

												This game is pretty fun. The graphics might not be much but they don't really need to be much when the game is fun. Starting out as a nobody karate fighter and working your way up the ranks to eventually be the best is always a great story even if there isn't too much in the way of dialogue that doesn't matter, what matters is busting faces and bones in great karate matches. I went into this game not expecting much at all but after I learned the controls and mechanics I found this game to be pretty good in it's own merit.

												Brilliant game!Like many have already said, Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is a game for any Martial Arts aficionado, especially of Karate (a couple of other styles can be fought as well - Muay Thai, Boxing, Taekwondo, Wrestling.), but also for enthusiasts of good old fighting games based on -realism- and great 2D graphics. The RPG elements and the training sessions are a nice touch, imho, reminds me of Chambers of Shaolin which I had decades ago on my Amiga 500. Btw, there are references to classic movies such as Bloodsport, The Kickboxer and the Kyokushin karate style founder Mas Oyama.A couple of bugs are included, nothing game breaking, though, sometimes it's even hilarious. It's pretty hard at the begining as your character needs to learn at least some of the special attacks and increase his strength, speed etc. to fight properly.But even after having it played through twice, I still can't get enough of beating the s**t out of others. The correct use of timing, special moves and speedy combos still make it challenging when facing some of the good fighters at the Kumite, Budokan, or Boxing Stadium, even when having everything leveled up to the max, because the risk of losing by getting a fracture is still present then. Ofc dealing fractures yourself is always most satisfying (especially when cracking a Muay Thai Fighter's bones - take that Nacho!).Oh, and always remember the Master's wise words and live by them: ""Beating everyone up is good for your body."" ;)OSU!Nominated for the ""The “Just 5 More Minutes” Award"", because today those 5 minutes became like 2 hours. Beating up people, bulls and bears is kind of addictive.			"

												I love this game. The forklift truck part is absolutely the most indepth use of forklift trucks I've ever seen in a game. I remember games like Deus Ex Revolutions having forklift trucks in certain scenes. But you couldn't drive those ones - hell you couldn't even blow them up. Best you could do was bang your head on them. But these fork lift trucks are drivable. In fact, they are an integral part of this game, for without them you cannot earn your daily bread in order to go to those tournaments.I also love the way strength is spelled in the game. So much attention to detail in trying to emulate some 90s SNES Japanese import aka ""ALL OUR BASE BELONG TO US"".All joking aside, this game is a really good blast. It can be a bit of a button basher and probably is played best with a controller. I'm using a PC Xbox controller so I have no problems personally.I recommend this game completely. I think the price tag could be a couple of quid less but it's probably worth it if you like your beat-em ups with a bit of a character improvement RPG element to it.I would have liked to see an option to turn off the bloody music though. It's not bad and extremely SNES, Playstation sound to it, but I'd rather be able to turn it off and play my own music.Also, a free mode where you can test out your moves without a timer would have been welcomed.Yep, recommended. Especially the forklift truck part. "

												If you've ever wanted to be Van Damme in Bloodsport, this game is for you. You willl train your way to the top through a series of mini games! You will be lost for the first hour or two. The game doesn't explain much, but that's part of its charm. You'll figure it out eventually. It took me a few hours before I realized I could learn new moves. Soak in the horribly translated dialouge and fantastic soundtrack. Once you get tired of the in game music, I suggest you mute it and turn on some blood pumping montage music. I personally love the Blood Bros mix tapes. https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/blood-bros-first-bloodI beat the game in about 5 hours. I didn't get all the achievements but definitely got my $10 bucks worth. I hope they release another game or DLC.			"

												If you're looking for the greatest karate simulator ever to grace this plane of existence then look no further! Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is a simple, yet immensly fun fighting game that comes with a set of mini-games. Despite having a bunch of bugs at the moment of writing this review it still delivers as a game and I would recommend all fans of karate and beat 'em ups to go give it a shot!			"

												Great old-school fighting game with real martial art elements. All though the fun didn't last long as the game is a bit too short, I can say that I really enjoyed playing it.In my opinion, for the price of 10€, it should have been longer. I'd also would have liked to see more authentic techniques. Otherwise the RPG elements were nice, some might say that leveling is bit repetitive but I think it was done well. I don't regret paying 10€ for it, but I'd say because it's short and I don't think I'm going to play it through again, it should be more around 5-7€.Also I would have liked the game to be a bit more challanging. After you get your skills up, you literally run through even everyone cracking skulls while doing it. Even the hardest tournaments are like 5-10 seconds and KO. There are many dojos to beat, even different styles and it looks like much at the start, but you only have to beat one guy per dojo and that's it (and if your stats are up most challange fights are under 15secs, though Hombu is a tad harder).Still it's a very good game, I just finished it after started playing yesterday. Addicting, yes.All I can do is recommend this game for all friends of the genre out there, but there are TWO MAJOR cons I must adress, which was the only thing I'm giving this game 7/10 instead of 9/10. Major reduction also from this because it is not mentioned in the requirements. I also understood that the developer has no intentions of fixing it (link below).Quote from the developer that made me also somewhat ♥♥♥♥♥♥:""we are sorry but is not our fault if your keyboard doesn't support more than 4 buttons pushed together."" -and ""Unfortunately, the only solution is that you must purchase a better keyboard that does not have this limitation"".(Link to keyboard problem discussion)It is NOT a common property in PC keyboards to have 4+ key pressed support, the developers attitude on that is totally wrong if they don't either plan to fix the issue, or at least add a text to the requirements that controller or keyboard with 4 key ghosting is required.The lack of those 2 techniques didn't limit the gameplay that much but If you play with keyboard and don't have the 4 key ghosting ability, you can't learn all the moves. There are only 6 special moves you can learn, and two of those require 4 buttos pressed simultaniously.Second major con is the absence of any kind of tutorial to the techniques, and the fact that buttons that flash in the screen are shown always in console format. as ""X-Y-A-B"". Even if you're using keyboard. Also the technique names are called in japanese, so many times you're just guessing until you got them right. It wouldn't have been a big task to add button images from keybindings to replace the console/controller images.So, for that reason, 7/10. (If they would fix these, I'd give this one a 9/10)			"

												Oh man what a fun little ride this was.I had no idea what I was geting when I picked this game up, but felt very intrigued by the bright colors and music of the trailer. Bears, cars and bulls? Boxers? Wrestlers? No way the game had all of this. But oh yes my friends, it certainly does.First off a big nod has to go to the presentation of this game. The graphics are large, detailed, very nice looking and overall just make the game very fun to watch. You definately get an old school SNES Final Fight/Street Fighter vibe from them. As well, all of the music is good, whether its the main menu or the bloody end of a fight, it fits and its damn good. Now the game was obviously translated from japanese and it isn't perfect, but this leads to some hilarious lines, one of my favorites being ""I""ll break your idiot face, you sucker!"" But it's like one of those badly dubbed japanese films, you can't help but smile at it.There is a story to the game, sort of. You can tell there is supposed to be large overall narrative but the actual story scenes are so few and far between you kind of just get some randomness. Basically your character wants to become a great karate master and open his own school. You do this by training, learning new moves, and beating the crap out of the other dojo leaders in the city and competing in tournaments. Along the way you get cutscenes asking you to do the crazy stuff like fighting bears and bulls, and all of this gets you more and more fame. The more famous you are the more dojo leaders you can confront and more tournaments you can earn until you get to the end of the game.But really, the gameplay is where it's at. Even after over ten hours there are still some nuances like proper counters, etc, that I didn't pick up on. For me it was mostly back away and then attack, but you might do better then I did. You essentially have two kick buttons, two punch buttons, and a jump. You also get what is called a Ki bar and if you let it fill before you attack you do more damage. Like some of the best wrestling games, you also have body damage, so you can do damage to legs, torso, or head, and by doing enough damage to one part you can knock your opponent out and win the match. Also at random you can end up losing your breath, taking damage to your liver or getting 'brain shock' which disables you a There is a fair bit of depth here and it's a shame the engine they came up with is single-player only as this would make an excellent competitive fighter.In terms of the progression, it oddly enough, has a difficulty drop rather then a spike. At first it is tricky, as you are weak, have to earn all of your money working as a dock worker via a mini-game, and fight in tournaments and probably lose. But whenever you lose you get some experience towards your skills. Eventually you'll win a tournament and be able to train up a bit more. Once you get some training under your belt and raise your stats a bit, you'll end up breezing through most of the tournaments and can start to challenge the dojos, which are FAR easier. You can actually challenge the same dojo over and over again, getting experience, and fame each time, along with training points to use towards upgrading your skills and learning new moves. As a tip, be sure to learn the new moves, or WAZA,  as soon as possible; they make the game easier and more interesting. I screwed up and I didn't learn them until near the end of the game. With these moves, and your upgraded stats, in some cases you might end up conquering the dojos in less then a minute. But some of the tournaments and special events hold enough of a challenge to keep you going. Plus, due to a feature called 'Ichegaki Hissatsu' there is always a chance for you to lose (or win) randomly, as one lucky strke can fracture a leg or even your skill and end the match immediately so you never feel totally invincible or unstoppable, and thus the game never quite hits the point of getting boring.Overall the game is extremely fun to play, holds a great challenge, along with providing some very funny to read dialogue at some points. I encourage you to go master your karate as this game is a knock out blow of a recommendation. And more thing, for those of you with Steam controllers, I've exported a controller configuration for you to use that works marveiously, so go get it once you have picked up this excellent game.

												Great throw back game. It is a lot of fun. I find myself working to get the knock with my favorite kick or punch. The little mini games make me very nostalgic for 80s and 90s movies and fighters. It is a satire, so the translation mistakes are intentional. All it all fun game, worth the money. That is if you have a game pad. If you don't have a controller you probably will not like this game.			"

												CHECK OUT MORE REVIEWS AT https://ethnographix.squarespace.com/ In a world where rehashed fighters have become all too common, sometimes a turd in the punch bowl is just what the party needs most. Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is a martial arts sim/fighter with an emphasis on precision and coordinated attacks. The mechanics rely heavily on effective blocking, footwork, and precisely timed strikes that reflect the reality of competitive martial arts in that for every attack made, an opening for counter-attack is similarly created. The button-masher in me had his ♥♥♥ handed to him early in the game before realizing this was not your mama's typical fighter.Real life knowledge of your opponent's school of attack will also factor in i.e. Tae Kwon Do's emphasis on footwork and kicks differs greatly from American boxing's heavy punches and speedy footwork. Visually, KM2 resembles early Art of Fighting Neo-Geo hits with a close up view of the combatants that provides an isolated view of combat while eschewing any emphasis on overly detailed backgrounds. It's you and one other warrior face to face; that's it.  The sound effects, in juxtaposition to the realism placed on combat, are meaty and sonic-boomy in their slapping power while most attacks are chalked full of  whoosh  that will make you exhale deeply as a roundhouse kick misses your grill by mere inches. There is a distinct emphasis on training as well as a surface-level understanding of the various elements of real life Karate and those with a background in the actual martial arts will find themselves rather pleased by the integration of the rules & etiquette expected from combatants. These rules will vary and the degree of padding (or lack thereof) required adds an element of risk as bone-breaking attacks during more informal bouts can lead to a significant amount of time out of the dojo spent on the mend as you channel the ♥♥♥♥ out of your spirit animal. All in all, KM2's the kind of game you'll probably do a bender through in a day or two but, for the price, it's well worth the nostalgic beat 'em up feel along with solid mechanics and sweet training sequences in the rain while you look determined as a mother.

												Oldschool fun, at least until the game refuses to load anymore.I was having a blast with this game, it reminded me of games like Best of the Best and IK+ from way back in the day but wit the graphics of the classic SNK fighting game Art of Fighting. Then after two hours or so of play the game then refused to work. First I got a black screen with a couple of white boxes where you could hear the game music playing but could do nothing else except ALT/TAB out and close it. Then the game stopped operating at all. This is a very common problem and gathering by the Community posts I\'m lucky I had the game run properly for as long as I did as some have been unable to run the game at all. I\'ve tried every fix imaginable but this game is now dead and refusing to work at all and there is no developer support, the game has not been updated since last September.This is another sad case of the appalling quality control that exists on Steam. If developers and publishers aren\'t going to commit to making their software work for their customers they should not be allowed to sell it on Steam. This issue will not go away until Steam finally starts caring about what goes on their store front. Very disappointing.			"

												If you are into full contact karate , get this right now! If you used to like Super Nes fighting games , get it now! But the most important feature of this game that I believe a lot of people miss is the fact that it portraits some of the Kyokushin Karate Golden Era most important fighters! Those who lived or know the Kyokushin Karate history will definively love this game just for this feature. The gameplay for a 2d fighting game is awesome - good timing and distance will get you the wins , not button mashing or insane combos ( this also capture the atmosphere of the 80's good fighting games ) Still on the karate side: the moves are realistic , the damage, the training sessions, everything is exaclty what it was like to be a karate fighter in the 80's. There is very little fantasy / unrealistic situations represented in this game. If you have no ties to Karate at all , the game inevitably looses a lot of appeal, but I would still recommend it purely as a 2D fighting game.			"

												MISSABLE TROPHY !!! (short review below)There is a missable trophy if you think you are going to 100% the game. The achievement is the one about the encounter with Oboro. Google to know how to properly trigger the fight.------------------------The game has a wonderful retro style that brings to memory the old arcade games (coin op). I am not a karate fan (in fact, I don't think I know the slightest rule about karate) but I liked the game nevertheless. When I was a kid, I used to play a game called budokan (have no idea if that was the original name). Other than that, my relationship with karate or any kind of fighting (in real life) is equal to 0.The game has a good learning curve, but when you master it, it will be quite hard to lose any fight....it is definitely worth a shot. 10 euros is really too much, but when it goes down or on sale for about 2 - 3 euros, you won't regret it.It requires about 5 hours (or 6) to do everything there is to do in the game.

(ex. no-face punch on taekwondo, i find that really easy.)2.Add a character customization! (c'mon, u only play as a male?)3. Add some more stuff to do after owning ur dojo.

												It's got promise, but also a massive heap of issues. If you think you can put up with the negatives below and the game appeals to you, then it's probably worth buying when on sale.1) Really bad to play on keyboard. 6-key-rollover (or full N-Key) really will become necessary for some complex moves.2) Terrible joystick/pad support - although you'd think an Xbox fight stick (for street fighter) would work (Windows sees it ok), this game can't use that. I had to use JoyToKey to map it to keyboard keys.3) Really poor instructions. It needs a full proper manual with a full move-list and explanation of the Training system (get more training points by winning the entry-level tournaments - get money to enter those by doing the day-job minigame).4) Buggy menus. Sometimes I end up with a stuck-input and the cursor keeps moving left or right and I have to alt+F4 out and reload. Save often!I suggest checking the Steam Forum for this game before buying, to get a sense of other problems I haven't covered.On the plus side the save game file is REALLY hackable, so you can mess around, unlock progress-things without grinding through, etc. (Devs, please don't fix that.)

												Sold some dorky foil card for $5, got this. I'm hooked, I thought I'd just play it a few minutes between GTA V or Fallout sessions but I don't think that's how it's gonna go down.The game is a mess. Ugly menus, grindy, not everything is as explained as it perhaps should be. Then the fights happen, and they're incredibly awesome. The pacing is great, the psychology of the fight is more important than dexterous fingers. Then something happens like you get taken down in one hit and a cutscene of you in the hospital follows. In its best moments it feels very much like Bushido Blade. In its worst moments it feels like a crappy phone game. Highly reccomended.			"

												OK, KM2KDB ... long name, is really an odd one.  It has all these great elements, but still needs to be polished a bit more.They claimed to have controller support where it did, It took me nearly 30mins getting it to work, and for somereason the controls can go unresponsive right before a match, but kick in a sec in.  But by far the worst thing is my AnitVirus freaks out on the data.exe file.  I'm pretty sure its a false positive but still, having a game you purchase on steam that does that is a bit unsettling.  It just feels slitly sluggish during menus and small moments.  Now the Fighting amazing, I have a great time ever fight sometimes I get a but confused on i get 1 shot but still the fighting can and is very enjoyable.Besides the bugs etc, the only thing i feel is a bit meh.  Is how the level and training system is.  You get 3 training options at the start of the game, and that is great. Once you use those 3 you wont get to see another til after you beat a event ( which sounds alright but) This is where it gets to the grind, they are op for a good 2 3 trys, and you do gain some ablity after but doesn't feel fun in that way.  And until you get money and fame your kinda stuck doing the same stuff... and omg please get rid of the work mini game ...... worst mini game ever.  I hate it...

												This game pits you as a up-and-coming karate champion. You must work your way through various arena's and dojo's in order to gain fame and prize money.Every fight earns you amounts of xp depending on win or loss. The xp goes to your stats-  and a win in a fight will give you training points - which you spend on either bolstering your stats via mini-game training sessions, or unlocking new moves. I'm not going to talk more about the stats or moves as they are fairly standard for this genre.Your fame decides which dojo's unlock, which are part of the progression of your character. Fame is best gained via Tournaments which cost money and require certain fame levels to enter. You can visit your workplace and fork-lift cargo onto trucks for money, which is boring ill admit.The graphics are 80's retro, and they work very well in this style. Nice clean, hi-res 80's pixels lol.The audio is fine, decent sfx make for satisfying fights - especially critical hits! Music track is suitable and retro.The controls are simple and easy to pick up, but as with most good fighting games, competent use comes with practice.I use a Logitech F710 xbox compatible controller, but it also plays well on keyboard & mouse.I highly reccommend this little gem of a game to any martial arts enthusiast or fighting enthusiasts in general.

												Remember the good old days? I'm thinking of the game Budokan from 1989. If you do, then this is much the same. It's a well throught through karate game. 1 button per limb, and with proper karate techniques. It lacks a bit of the serene Budokan charm, but it adds some new training methods and a lvling system instead.All in all, this is a good fighting game, but it might be a bit too slow for people that play games like Tekken or DoA, since your strikes become more powerful after gathering Ki (which is generated by resting or doing nothing) it lowers the tempo a bit. All in all, I really like this game :)			"

												I waited for this to go on sale to buy it. Honestly, if I'd known it were this good, I would have paid full price. Karate Master 2 is a very unique fighter. It feels like something from the Neo Geo era. Train in different mini games to increase stats and then hit the road for fighting action against varied opponents. Control is simple but smooth and intuitive. The graphic style is pretty cool as well; artificial scan lines on the screen give it a 90s look. The music is straight out of 80s and 90s martial arts movies. The leveling and progression keeps you coming back for more. There are a bunch of spelling and grammatical errors peppered throughout but I feel like it's too much not to be intentional. Would have liked some more customization options but that's a small gripe. This is a hidden gem that really needs to be checked out.			"

												Oh man, that nostalgia. The electronic music, the city map, the cheesy 80's kung fu movie plot, and sprites that look like they come straight out of an SNK game. And that was the entire purpose: to relive the glory days of 16-bit fighting games.Karate Master 2 does a great job of running you through the karate journey as you'd expect from pop culture. There's not much backstory - your character is a maverick karateka who works at the docks for money, fights in tournaments to gain fame, goes through harsh training, beats up other dojos, gets invite to the secret kumite tournament and dreams of opening a school. And surprisingly, through all the generic archetypes of martial arts films and games, it's still satisfying to play this one through.The fighting system is actually quite good. No flash combos or special moves; just the straighforward punches and kicks that you can expect from a real karate tournament. Fighting rewards getting into the right range and using the right attack for maximum effect. Hits don't necessarily cancel each other out - one can still connect a punch or a kick after being struck. Rapid button mashing reduces the power of attacks. Training strength and hardness allows you to randomly perform critical hits that can stun the opponent or bring an instantaneous end through broken bones. And the same can happen to you.The pacing feels right for a 80's fighting game and is executed well. The campaign does become grindy after a while as you have to earn fame and money to complete the story. After training up your stats, fights become too easy, only requiring several punches to end, and the story doesn't introduce more challenging tasks or complex events, making the replay value effectively zero. You'll be done with the game in a day or two.But it was worth it.

												I just paid $10 for 5 hours of gameplay.  It was worth every penny.  Well, it was worth most of the pennies.This is a game that is very approachable despite its lack of tutorial or even an opportunity to get your bearings.  It throws you right into the action with no explaination.  However, it's easy enough to figure out.  The first challenge is the bad translation.  I'm not sure how this game happened, but I'm pretty sure it's a japanese indie.  Level up your strenght and perform the ching chong toyota weeaboo dahg suup.  After the translation comes the glitches.  I've only had to close it and reopen it twice, but it froze several times.  Have patience, and this won't be a problem.  There's also some funny glitches.  Tournament brackets will sometimes claim you've been eliminated when you haven't, and then the two contestants next to you have both beat each other.  It works itself out on its own.  There's also the boxing ring, where you can knock each other out at the same time but have to wait ten seconds before you crumple over and fall.  The final flaw is the grinding.  You have to go to work as a forklift operator to get money to enter tournaments, at least until you unlock the matches that give you money when you win.  There's also training minigames, which are actually really fun at first.  As soon as you get tired of doing them, you can just stop and let your stats level up on their own.  The button mashing will hurt your thumbs, but it doesn't go without reward.  The fighting itself consists of high kicks, mid kicks, low kicks, high punches, mid punches, and specials,  You can't throw fireballs, but you can do roundhouse kicks and high flying nose kicks.  You unlock those by pressing the ""waza"" button in the training menu.  Don't bother with the frontflip kick, spinning backfist, axe kick (leg goes straight up), or anything but the roundhouse and the spinning jump kick.  The fighting is really visceral, and you know when you land a good hit.  The game rewards you for having the skill to properly land a blow.  Don't be afraid to hit the body or the leg.  The head isn't the only way to win.  Working your opponent's leg is actually very effective.  Out of the three targets, head is the best - but not by much.  Don't worry about the story, it's ♥♥♥♥ and it doesn't get in the way.  Just kick someone's face in.  Story can wait.  When doing a tournament in the early game, I had a very intense second round that involved a lot of leg sweeping and face kicking.  It ended in me and my opponent punching each other in the stomach as fast as we possibly could, and then he fell over.  The third round consisted of the match starting, me closing in, one boot to the head, and it fractured his cranium.  The game will seem easy after a while, until you unlock the secret tournament.  I won't tell you what that is.  Just be prepared and have fun.  You'll end this game feeling proud of yourself.  You might even want to go again.  Personally, I would absolutely love to see the potential this game holds fleshed out a bit more.  Not many games need sequels, but this one does.  I want to see what else this developement team can do.  I see a lot of creativity in these people.			"

												Since I was 5, I've always wanted to be a karate master. Now my life long dream has come true with the release of Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow. You start out as an aspiring young karate student trying to make his way to the top of the karate championships. You participate in various dojos and other sporting arenas fighting different opponent with different fighting styles. On the side you work a day job as a forklift operator at a warehouse in order to scrap by enough shekels to pay the admission fee in order to participate in these tournaments. As you win each tournament you gain fame and enough points to improve your skills through various mini-games. It's a great game to play after a hard day of getting yelled at by your boss because you spilled hot coffee all over his ♥♥♥♥ and he gets all upset when you try to clean it up. If you are a fan of the old school 80's revenge movies and love beating the crumbs out of your opponent in a fight club setting, then this is the game for your. Nothing ruffles my jimmies when I slug some retard in the gut round house kick in the ♥♥♥♥ to become the next reigning champion, but that's just me. Definitely pick up this game if it's on sale next time as it is a good pick up and play game, especially if you are high functioning aspie such as myself.			"

												Great potential, after nearly obtaining all achievements, the Oboro seems glitched and quite annoying to get.  Very glitchy, laggy, and slow game.  Stats, Money and Fame often doesn't get awarded properly.  Frequent Hard Crashes, many instances where you think, wtf is the point of this?  Story is terrible, art work is bad, the way the interface and level selection/story progression is time consuming and dumb, luck seems to be a factor.  Whether I'm level 2 in all skills or level 10 i can still get ONE SHOTTED critical KO bs happens.  Parry seems to be useless because it doesn't offer too much of an advantage.  Skill doesn't seem to be a rewarding experience.  Skilled or not, win/lose, button mashing, win/lose.  It has decent music and a focus on moves from Karate, however the overall experience is a miss and it's fairly generic.  Unless the game gets patched, updated, reworked, and optimized to keep up with modern games, or at least to make it enjoyable, i wouldn't recommend getting this.			"

												After winning the Kumite I still needed some cash to complete the game so I returned to the earlier tournaments with the idea of breezing through these non-champion scrubs only briefly pausing to pick up the prize pot, this dream was cancelled in the 2nd round of the beginners tourney when the afro guy broke my jaw.Overall I found this to be a good game but there is little replay value once you've finished the story and got a perfect game/100% achievements. The price point wasn't an issue I got my £1 per hour of fun for sure. The only thing that disappointed me was the hidden bear boss fight as it was quite hard to tell if I was winning the fight against it or not.			"

The GoodThe most impressive thing about this game is the amount of passion for the subject matter that comes through. It's very apparent that the developer has at least spent a lot of time learning about Karate (if not havign actual experience). Many of the mini games are where this really shows. The meditation mini-game is very acurate on an intuitive level (trying to keep the  cursor centered while it is shifting back and forth across a bar). The fighting itself is pretty fun and from the perspective of real real Karate competition it's actually very realistic very realistic (you even have to go through mini-game to recover when you receive a broken bone).The BadThe roughest part of the game is the Engrish English translation (the correct team would be ""Beaten"" not ""Beated"" when you've beaten a rival dojo). As well I can't seem to get the last couple of achievements (Bear Fighter and You're the Best) even though I've beaten all of the available events. There seem to be a few other minor inconsistencies with controls and menu navigation when using a joystick, but nothing you can't figure out how to get through. The playthrough time wasn't very long (I beat it in a single sitting of ~4hrs).The UglyI think some of the character graphics could use some refinement, but other than that there isn't anything I can call ugly about this game.

												I've played alot and I really like this game.It kind of reminds me of Karate Champ mixed with pretty much any 80's beat em up.It has sim/RPG elements and the minigames aren't too much of a pain. Some of them are fun and some have exploits.Some negatives are that the game can be kind of short and soon you will run out of things to do, but nothing lasts forever. Also, some parts of the game feels like a grind. Another issue I have is you can just sit and poke with a kick for wins. In the Kumite, you feel like that is all you want to do to guarentee victory.I think the game is worth 10 bucks. I have had a lot of fun and I am sure I wont be burnt out for a few more hours.7/10 "

												Karate Master 2 is a 2D single-player only fighting game well worth its price-tag, offering a roughly 6-8 hour SINGLE-PLAYER ONLY experience. For those wondering, it also offers controller and arcade stick support (for PC-compatible sticks).The in-game graphics and music are well-made and truly represent the developer's vision in giving the game a late 80's/early 90's feel. Characters all either reference 70's/80's/90's era martial arts movies and famous figures (Most of which being 'Mas' Oyama) and cutscene artwork is well-made, however the art style for character portraits can at times look slightly off. That being said, the dialogue (in English, at least) is hilariously inconsistent - Whether or not the developers intended to give the game that ""B-grade action movie"" dialogue - and is entertaining at many times, to say the least.The gameplay offers only a single-player story mode that plays as a 2D-fighter with RPG levelling mechanics, all of which are delivered through various minigames. These minigames range from timing to mashing, and while some may appear tedious at first they are easy to pick-up and never too jarring as the game allows you to reap the rewards from excelling at a certain mini-game over another, offering 4 options for each in-game stat.The core gameplay is entertaining though at times inconsistent. Using a standard LP, RP, LK, RK setup without any set combos or movelists, the player already has all the tools they need to win. Therefore apart from the statistics [mechanic], the player has to rely on movement, spacing, counter-attacks and timing to win their fights. FGC enthusiasts could say that the game is heavily-'footsie' based, if that means anything.The defensive system is where the game is most interesting: The player will always be guarding at the middle of three heights, and must hold up or down to shift this guard. In addition to this are parries, which may also be performed at three heights using both punch buttons. Unfortunately and having played KM1, I can say that it is much more difficult than its predecessor to predict/anticipate/read enemy movements, making parries heavily luck-based. Also available to the player are standard dashing mechanics and a ducking mechanic (which I find much better than attempting to parry or guard high attacks).The enemy AI also seems to be completely random in terms of attack patterns and damage, where an enemy fought at the beginning of the game, at later stages, can randomly and instantly throw a match-ending attack. This is another aspect of the core gameplay - ""Ikken Hissatsu"" or instant-kill moves: Rather than being as they would be in other 2D fighters such as Guilty Gear/Blazblue, the instant-kills can be any move in KM2, so long as your 'timing' is perfect.Instant kills are difficult to describe as the only explanation offered behind gaining one is that an average of the character's strength and damage stats must exceed the opponent's toughness. As none of these stats are given for opponents it genuinely does happen almost randomly, although timing a counter-attack at where the opponent isn't guarding tends to yield them more often.In closing, KM2 is neither a fighting-game player's dream nor will it keep you coming back for more for too long over its short length, however it will scratch an itch for martial arts [and obviously, Karate] enthusiasts that other fighting games might not.The game will not convert players who don't like fighters, however if you're looking for a solid, serious-yet-tongue-in-cheek action game that throws back to the days before Street Fighter 2, KM2KDB is a good place to be.

												I must say, that was a rewarding experience.From the google translated hilarity of the captions, to the 80s fight music and 70s disco funk city music. To fighting a bear bear-handed (LOL). To front kicking a Bull like a bamf, after becoming certified on the forklift. Kickboxer inpsired training, and 'Road House' boss Obora. And yet, there is still much more to learn with counter-parry system and some close quarter moves that I had no idea existed....I must say, I want more! I'm already sold on DLC, expansion pack, or a sequel! SPOILER ALERTI was kind of disappointed when the game ended when it did. I was hoping I could explore the idea of getting students! This game was nostalgic and it was worth every dollar of my $10.SPOILER ALERT ENDBeing a TKD student myself, the combat system was a breath of relief from the crazy shenanigans of Street Fighter, DBZ, etc. Granted I still love those series, it's just cool to see the principles/mechanics of what actual sparring is like in a video game context.

												The games worth it, just make sure your using a 360 controller as your gamepad. I treid using a PS4 controller but the main buttons actually inverted themselves. For example, the button on the bottom that would normally be the (A) button was actualley the left one. The buttons also felt like they had input delay. Thankfully, everthing was fine when I switched back to a 360 gamepad. Other than that, the game's worth it, especially if your into fighting games or want to experince a solid martail arts simulator. Also the italian ching-lish is amazing.			"

And boy did it not disappoint :) i really gotta hand it to the creators who created challenging in depth easy to control RP`em up, i literally played through it in one sitting.

												Great game for those who reminisce about the 16bit era.  A lot of button mashing in this game, and repetition but it is fun.  This game is quite educational, using japanese  names for the techniques.  I love the reference to Mas Oyama(quite an interesting story about Mas check wikipedia) of Kyokushin Karate, for those of you who don't know Mas really fought a bull.  The bull might have been sedated, but non the less it was a bull he fought you tube it!  I also love the inclusion of Sanchin kata (body mind and spirt).  There are hints dropped within the dojo fights that point at Karate and 80's Karate movie history, but only those who are familiar with the history of karate will catch them.There were a few issues I found with this game which are minor1.) Some of the english translations are terrible like STRENGTH being spelt wrong.  The ending story clip is a bad translation, but I'm used to it from the NES era.2.) Small thing I noticed about the Boxing stadium fights, were the glitches where your character would be frozen while the CPU would be moving and barely beating you up!  Every match in the boxing stadium lasts 3 rounds, and never ends in a count out.  Is this the spirit of the karate ka?Conclusion:  I've put about six hours or more into this game and enjoyed it.  The reason for this could be that I am a karate practitioner, and I grew up playing games like this. I hope that if they release another game that they include specific information on the characters you engage in.  This way people playing can learn more about Karate and the origins of the styles. I think people will still enjoy this game, if you are skeptical you can always wait until it drops in price			"

												The game was very fun, especially once I learned that you can cause and suffer injuries in it, the first being at the very first tournament I went to and the guy snapped my femur with a leg kick. Good times. The fighting system is very tight but also free-form, with no set combos but no real limitations in what you can chain together. The training segments have a definite old school feel to them and are fun the first few times you do them, but I still think the focus mitts, while not offering a ton of reward are very well done. There are few things as satisfying as punching someone and then seeing that you broke their jaw and the fight is over.The fact that you can cause muscle injuries, knock the wind out of your opponents and they have trouble defending afterwards, and break bones to end the fight is a big selling point to the fighting system which is already very well done.Yes, there are mistranslations some being quite humorous, but the spirit of the game is there and the subtle and not so subtle nods to martial arts culture, both mainstream and not are a treat.I just wish there was an endless battle mode.

Blood leaked from their heads as they lay there motionless - they seemed dead.Then the third kicked my character in the ribs so hard over and over, he crumpled. It looked like a heart attack.Later, I would combo a poor junior so many times in the face, he went down twitching.My wife on her first try, murdered her way through all opposition and won a tournament.It is an unusually fun and exciting game.

												So far I really like this game, it has a lot to it. But I feel like there needs to be a little more guidance for new players, for instance there are some training sessions I have no idea what to do other than endurance since it tells me to mash buttons like crazy. But a lot of other ones do not tell me anything. A really big issue is that you can only turn down the music yet the actual sound effects are ear splitting unless you go back and turn down your volume.			"

												The first review I write, and most of it is due to just being disappointed. The game overall seems like an interesting and different idea. A Karate RPG-ish game, how bad can it be? In my opinion, quite.It starts well, giving the oportunity to train twice and increase your stats and then it just puts you out there in the world. There all these dojos and different styles, require fame, and tournaments you can enter, after paying.At this time, you sort of get the gist of it. Go to work, get money, enter tournaments. Pretty straightforward. You enter your first tournament and you'll probably lose at the first round and learn that your character even evolves like this. This when you decide to grind your way into better things.From now on is when the game will annoy you with his janky controls and glitching hitboxes. The more you play, the more you'll see that the input is not always perfectly read, that some moves are too hard to perform on a consistent basis, and that your opponents present a more variety of moves than you. Althoug you could also attain a bigger variety it all comes down to fame, which is only obtained by winning tournaments. Easier than said. Let's just say my breaking point was when after much improvement I lost to 3 grabs in a final and on the next tournament whilst trying to master those grabs, I got wrecked on the first round, which at the time was seen as almost impossible and on this match 3 or 4 kicks went right through my opponent.All in all, it is a pretty good idea and how the game is structured is not bad, but the flaws can sometime be rage inducing. If you are looking for a time sink, just for the heck of it, it's a decent game. Other than that, not much to write home about.Overall: 2/10 "

												The game has a lot of problems, and I am going to list a few of them. Character facing the wrong side. ( This is probably a bug ) No tutorial. Difficulties playing with keyboard. ( Some of the movements that you may want to learn ( located in WAZA ),   requires a controller to execute but fret not, there is a way to learn all the movements ) If you double tap your d key, it will dash forward. However, tapping excessively may cause it to continuously dash. Occasionally, whenever I am in the menu ( in game menu, not the title screen menu ), my game may go into spasm mode, denying me from saving the game to selecting what I am going to train next.Is there a saving grace for this game? Yes there is, make such amendments to the file, kmslot1 ( not going to go into full detail since there is guide for this ), and max out your stats. However, there is still a low - moderate probability of you getting your ♥♥♥ beat by the AI.			"

												I just paid $10 for 5 hours of gameplay.  It was worth every penny.  Well, it was worth most of the pennies.This is a game that is very approachable despite its lack of tutorial or even an opportunity to get your bearings.  It throws you right into the action with no explaination.  However, it's easy enough to figure out.  The first challenge is the bad translation.  I'm not sure how this game happened, but I'm pretty sure it's a japanese indie.  Level up your strenght and perform the ching chong toyota weeaboo dahg suup.  After the translation comes the glitches.  I've only had to close it and reopen it twice, but it froze several times.  Have patience, and this won't be a problem.  There's also some funny glitches.  Tournament brackets will sometimes claim you've been eliminated when you haven't, and then the two contestants next to you have both beat each other.  It works itself out on its own.  There's also the boxing ring, where you can knock each other out at the same time but have to wait ten seconds before you crumple over and fall.  The final flaw is the grinding.  You have to go to work as a forklift operator to get money to enter tournaments, at least until you unlock the matches that give you money when you win.  There's also training minigames, which are actually really fun at first.  As soon as you get tired of doing them, you can just stop and let your stats level up on their own.  The button mashing will hurt your thumbs, but it doesn't go without reward.  The fighting itself consists of high kicks, mid kicks, low kicks, high punches, mid punches, and specials,  You can't throw fireballs, but you can do roundhouse kicks and high flying nose kicks.  You unlock those by pressing the ""waza"" button in the training menu.  Don't bother with the frontflip kick, spinning backfist, axe kick (leg goes straight up), or anything but the roundhouse and the spinning jump kick.  The fighting is really visceral, and you know when you land a good hit.  The game rewards you for having the skill to properly land a blow.  Don't be afraid to hit the body or the leg.  The head isn't the only way to win.  Working your opponent's leg is actually very effective.  Out of the three targets, head is the best - but not by much.  Don't worry about the story, it's ♥♥♥♥ and it doesn't get in the way.  Just kick someone's face in.  Story can wait.  When doing a tournament in the early game, I had a very intense second round that involved a lot of leg sweeping and face kicking.  It ended in me and my opponent punching each other in the stomach as fast as we possibly could, and then he fell over.  The third round consisted of the match starting, me closing in, one boot to the head, and it fractured his cranium.  The game will seem easy after a while, until you unlock the secret tournament.  I won't tell you what that is.  Just be prepared and have fun.  You'll end this game feeling proud of yourself.  You might even want to go again.  Personally, I would absolutely love to see the potential this game holds fleshed out a bit more.  Not many games need sequels, but this one does.  I want to see what else this developement team can do.  I see a lot of creativity in these people.			"

The GoodThe most impressive thing about this game is the amount of passion for the subject matter that comes through. It's very apparent that the developer has at least spent a lot of time learning about Karate (if not havign actual experience). Many of the mini games are where this really shows. The meditation mini-game is very acurate on an intuitive level (trying to keep the  cursor centered while it is shifting back and forth across a bar). The fighting itself is pretty fun and from the perspective of real real Karate competition it's actually very realistic very realistic (you even have to go through mini-game to recover when you receive a broken bone).The BadThe roughest part of the game is the Engrish English translation (the correct team would be ""Beaten"" not ""Beated"" when you've beaten a rival dojo). As well I can't seem to get the last couple of achievements (Bear Fighter and You're the Best) even though I've beaten all of the available events. There seem to be a few other minor inconsistencies with controls and menu navigation when using a joystick, but nothing you can't figure out how to get through. The playthrough time wasn't very long (I beat it in a single sitting of ~4hrs).The UglyI think some of the character graphics could use some refinement, but other than that there isn't anything I can call ugly about this game.

												Wish I could recommend this- as it has a good premise, but the poor controls and inability to hit all 4 buttons at once make this impossible to recommend.If this got patched it would be pretty good on a sale, but as it is now, it's a $2.50 game at best.			"

												This game....C'mon, could someone find me a better example of classic 80's karate film based game?No, because this one is a masterpiece.I love when you can broke some bones during the fight.I love soundrack.I love narrator.I love how hard main character works to get some money.I love to get beaten everytime.I love the way main character loses in 1 on 1 fights.Graphics are ok, better than minecraft.Definitely the most accurate way to spend your 6 euros. You should buy it.P.S When i will finish this game, i will wait for Karate master 3, if not, i'll kill myself			"

												Basically, this game is Garouden Break Blow in 2d if you could only pick Karate. Which is to say its a very competant, decently technical Karate 'sim' while being easy enough to pick up and play yet sufficiently challenging, The underlying mechanics are very solid and make for enjoyable technical battles where button mashing generally gets you killed.That's the good part.The bad? Grind, and MAXIMUM WEEABOO. Come on guys, the over-usage of romanized Japanese in the game is totally utterly unnecessary, especially when you can't even spell 'strength' correctly. While in reality, Karate dojos do use all the Japanese terms used in this game while in training... its totally unnecessary in a game. Put all the terms in a Glossary and stop being such maximum weeaboo tryhard. The quality of the English used in dialog is of an exceptionally POOR quality as well. That's the bad part.Fortunately the game isn't about picking on a bunch of Italian developers' English skills (or lack thereof), its about being a very solid and fun Karate sim, which the game does deliver and deliver strongly. A bit more polish however would have sufficed, and 100% less weeaboo. 7/10			"

												It's a button masher. I stopped even bothering with raising my skills. Just make sure you have high strength and agility and press the button fast. Training skills is tedious. Strength luckily was easy, but the other skills you either get almost nothing for the training or how you are suppose to train is unknown. I even looked on Youtube and other people were getting as little exp as I was in training. Don't exect to fully understand what is going on, the English is badly broken. If you want a good management type of game, get Punch Club. If you want a button masher with bad English, get this thing.			"

												Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow is in a game in which starts you off on the path of every 80's american martial arts movie ever. Where you start from the very bottom, get your ♥♥♥ whooped multiple times before becoming an unstoppable ♥♥♥ kicking machine through hard work and dedicated training and eventually running your own dojo. The game is a good for picking up and playing but my biggest problem with it is that after a while the challenge wears off. Even the face off with the big bad guy in the Kumite was very anti-climatic as I cracked his jaw with two blows and the fight was over. The Karate Masters of each dojo don't feel like masters just punching bags with arms and legs. Granted they did give the wrestling school master grappling however I don't think the AI prioritizes the grappling as the wrestler. This is a game that looks like it has a lot of promise behind it but feels horribly limited. Plus I'm not sure who thought the word BEATED was actually a word but apparently it is. The game tries to have some kind of plot as you climb your way to the top but fizzles out eventually and wasn't even that interesting to begin with. Sure each fight has a risk of you getting your skull cracked or leg broken but after toughness level 7 it hardly happens. I can't really complain at getting the game 40% off but there's an SNES Taekwon-do game  you can download the ROM for that's a lot more replayable than this is. There are some challenging side missions like fighting a bull or a bear or jumping over a car but those are too few inbetween the copy paste dojos. Even the Muay Thai dojo just felt like you were fighting one of the earlier Karate dojos. That's really my main gripe is that the masters of each dojo could've been so much more. The Kumite which is the last unlockable tournament could've been much harder than what it was. The move system is relatively easy to follow even to someone like me who gets easily turned away from most fighting games since I can't remember the super autistic combos. Overall if you ignore the thin story line the game is at least solid enough to play. It's easy to get lost on some of the training sessions due to lack of instruction on them but after a bit of trial and error it'll come to you. Really challenging as you start but fights stop going the distance once you start to level off everything at 8-9. Hell you can end most fights in 3-5 blows at that point. If you're curious about it pick it up on sale I wouldn't reccommend it at full price. Not a bad game at all there's just a lot of missed opportunities that are really blatant.			"

												This is a fun game but with many issues, firstly the long kick (button B) is just so over powered, you can keep an opponent back with ease with this one kick,infact you could complete this game with just the button B alone and movement...However! it's a charming game, the graphics are nice, the translation is terrible, so terrible I think it was done on purpose for comdey effect, if so, well done, I had a real good chuckle.No multiplayer I'm afraid which to me is a huge let down.The single player is fun for a while but it really drags on, infact there is a certain area where you really grind for a long time and this should have been avoided.I know I'm listing lots of bad things, but the game despite these, is fun! And it does take me back to playing on the mega drive, you still need some skill, it has great rpg elements and one of the few fighting games with training that isn't compeltely and utter crap, infact it's pretty good and it switches it up well!I recommend this game overall with a score of 7.5/10			"

												This is THE worst game I have ever played. Nothing in this game is designed well. The combat system mostly relies on luck. The menu system makes no sense whatsoever. The game starts you on the stats screen for some reason, rather than the training screen which is basically the root of the screen directory system. The items on the menus are mislabeled. The dialogue is translated horribly, or written by someone who learned English as a second language. Appently whoever designed this game did not even bother to use spellcheck. Strength is as ""Strenght"" everywhere. The art is absolutely horendous. To beat this game and get the actual ending, you have to spend SEVERAL hours loading boxes and barrels onto a truck. NOTHING TO DO WITH ACTUAL KARATE and a grueling chore for a crappy thirty second ending. Any screen prompts you get for pressing buttons are basically Xbox controls, but it does not tell you what they mapped to on a keyboard. This makes you basically waste your first two training attempts firguring out what the controls are. You cannot get any more training attempts until you beat a tournament, which is hard to do without training. It is not intuitive at all disrgard any reviews that say so. DO NOT WASTE YOUR FOUR DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												This is a really odd game, but I still get a kick out of playing it.Basically you are karate man and you beat up other karate mans (the game literally refers to most individuals as ""karate guy"")Before you become the strongest karate man, you must first train at your dojoTraining is for the most part fun, as it's essentially a bunch of mini-games like ""chop the bricks"" and ""punch the water droplets"", but there are a few games that seem slow and less rewarding than simpler challenges (ex. a minute of punching a tennis ball gets you fewer points than 10 seconds of breaking ice blocks)You need to pay to be a karate manBefore you can enter tournaments, you must earn money. This can be done through a few means later in the game, though new players will find themselves playing the same silly forklift game a dozen or so times throughout the course of this game.After working, you must fight other karate guysThe goal of this game is to win matches so that you can earn fame, which will let you fight against tougher foes. I think this is an interesting progression system, but it's flawed in that once you get the hang of this game's fighting system, you can knock out just about anyone with a few blows to the head. It's actually pretty funny to visit a guy who the game tells you has devoted their entire life to karate, only to be the newbie who beats the ♥♥♥♥ out of this grizzled veteran in a matter of seconds.Karate Master 2 is really strange in that it seems that Criansoft has genuine respect for those who devote themselves to karate, though this devotion is told of through a game with a strange art style and a hilariously bad translation.(ex.Characters in this game start conversations with ""thank you"" and end them with ""good evening"")All and all I'll still recommend this game, as it's still simple fun, and at the end of the day that's all that should matter.

Mind there are a couple of glitches here and there that can affect the gameplay of the game, the appearance that these glitches will make are not common unless you are almost done with the game. I wouldn't recommend buying this game at full price, but if this game is on sale, you should buy it because aside from the glitches, you truly feel like you're putting some level of effort into the game, and that made this game really fun for me.

												This game is amazingly enjoyable. I have broken many legs, ribs and skulls. I have had mine broken. But my will? My will is strong, and I will stop at nothing to spread the non-violent code of martial honour... by, huh, well breaking bones. But I guess I do it nicely?			"

												This game is freaking awesome. If you've ever wanted a realistic fighter without jumping and crazy powers, this is the game. Very tactical figher, I'm more consicous of what I'm doing opposed to button mashing in Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. Soundtrack is awesome, it's as if I'm playing a karate game based off an 80s movie. I enjoy the graphics, they are charming in their own way. The variety of different looking fighters is impressive. Even AAA games like Ryse have the same few character models, but this game has a nice diversity with its art assets. The grind is long just as it is in real life, and I have totally bought into the idea of progressing my character through training. Will be playing a lot more of this game, favorite obscure indie game for sure.			"

												As a practitioner of Karate and a gamer this game really appealed to me.  The training sequiences were fun and a cool thowback to traditional Karate training.  Also this is the most realistic fighting game I have ever played, there are no real special moves, just strategy.   Definitely an enjoyable game !			"

												This game is for dudes. Those negative reviews don't make any sense. It's Street Fighter 1 meets Evander Holyfield Boxing for the Sega Genesis. This was my first legit Steam purchase and by far my greatest. If you have an ""Adult Swim"" sense of humor and you like karate then get the game bruh. Any game where you can fight a bear is a game you should have on your account.			"

												Crain Soft has updated this game to fix various problems (problems which never affected me personally).  I have to say it's great to see a small developer put a little care into their game.  It's a great game that is like Street Fighter 2 without any magic users.  The game does well to teach the player that combat is dangerous, and that any single strike has the potential to destroy the player - or your opponent!  IKKEN HISSATSU!!!OSU			"

												Pretty fun and interesting game. Quite the button masher though; get ready to have the strongest fingers in the world. There are a few bugs still in the game: 1) Sometimes it says that you have 2 training exercises left but then it disappears after doing one. 2) After maxing out any category after a while, it displays it as 0 instead of 10. 3) Misspelled ""strength"" in the experience game screen.

												A pretty good game!Now while the job mini game is boring and the training minigames can be a bit confusing. The actual fighting in this game is very satifying. The fast paced combat, sound effects, and the randomness of injuries during combat make you (the player) feel always on edge. I also felt that the games combat was never unfair if you take combat slow and watch your opponent move you can usually get around their defense or doge/counter your opponets attack in a way that feels very satisfying. It it hard to describe but when you do perform what was explained you feel like at that moment now you have control of the fight. I never truly felt that way in any other fighting game before this one.I do like how the in game sprite look and move! It is not the best looking but it has a nice style. The training environments are nice remind me of  old kung fu movies training under a water fall and having the other students beat you up so you get tougher,  that is great to see and help reinforce the whole karate lifestyle. But the game character portaits contrast with the in game sprite style. I think it would have been better off tweeking the in game spites for the character portaits during dialogue as oppose to what we got. There isn't that much dialogue but when there is you are reminded in how bad the character portrait contrast with the rest of the game.The sound track is a bit weird for me the overworld track I love. It has the take on the world feeling to it, thats great! The other songs are either forgettable of bland.  No other song is more bland to me that when you start a fight. Interesting enough when either you or your oppenent take a serious blow the music starts to kick up and get good.Now the game is a little rough around the edges (at the time posting this review). some glitches may happen when fighting And text may get flipped around. And if I am correct in saying I do not think the developer CRIAN SOFT native language is english cause at time the dialogue is off when characters are interacting with one another.But with all that said I highly recommend this game to any body that likes martial arts stlye genre and fighting games!

												One mini-game involves spinning your stick to fill a meter from body to mind within a given time.I filled three quarters of the bar and am now missing the top layer of skin in the center of my palm. This game has brought me one step closer to enlightenment.∞/10			"

												The legend of Ken and the Step-Kick:The game is pretty fun and a decent single fightin game but a lot of it boils down to levelling up stats/grinding money and mashing the ""step-kick"" the strongest and safest move in the game or also known as the B button if you are playing with an Xbox pad.Overall the game is a nice waste of time, you should get it if you like Karate or simple fighting games/beat em ups.

												The game is an arcade 80's, you'll have to endure and try to beat it again and again, but if know something from martial arts, you can see that are some techiniques that are more effectivilly, you can find the correct distance, and you can beat the opponents.Try, lose, endure, try again. Thats it.This game is not a master-piece in graphics, gameplay or history, but it's true to Karate. You can see and feel the love from developers and the're devotion to Karate.As a developer too I'd like to thank you very much for making this game.			"

												This game is pretty fun! It's got an old school fighting game feel, although it is more about realistic martial arts(mostly karate). There is no jumping, no fireballs but instead more realistic punches and kicks. Repeated kicks and punches to a body part can damage it and eventually cause a win (legs, torso,head). There are occasionally one hit injury causing blows (kind of like what was seen in mortal kombat). There are different matches that are unlocked with fame and money. Money can be at first obtained from work and you can only build fame from fights and challanges. You also can earn money from fighting especially in the later parts of the game. There are several martial arts demonstrated here, different styles of karate, wrestling, boxing, etc. Even a fight like the last fight during the kumate from bloodsport.There is an experience system and training to upgrade your skills.Sometimes the grinding in this game is really annoying but still enjoy the game over-allThings I'd like to see:-No face punches in tae-kwon-do match, makes it way too easy-More challanges (bruce lee jeet kun do type, steven segal aikido type, jackie chan, drunken kung fu type, krav maga, sambo, etc.)-the ability to choose punches and kicks (not just special moves) so you can customize your own fighter more (more     attacks)-more difficult and rewarding fights, more money and fame but harder to beat fighters -A time limit by allowing so many days to complete the game (365 ""days?)-A Cage fight match/MMA ring (with cage infront of players as well as behind) Overall: This game was worth my money, plus there was cards so I felt like it was a worthwhile purchase. I bought it on sale for 50% off and felt like I got a bargain. If you like karate and old school fighting then check out Karate Master 2 Knock Down Blow			"

												A surprisingly realistic fighting/lifesimulator game with intuitive control and painful looking injuries. Seriously, ouch. Could do without the need to forklift crates to get money though. Hey, at least there's no need to eat.			"

												Going into this game, I was pretty sure I'd like it, given the gameplay footage I'd seen.  I definitely am enjoying the ride so far, and I only hope that the issues get ironed out to make this game perfect.First, the things they got right.  Speaking as a former karateka myself, these guys really know their stuff.  Furthermore, while it may look like mashing will get you places, it's a lot more tactical than it appears, and lining up your shots, varying your angles of attack, and knowing when to risk the big fancy techniques will get you far.  The AI is good, providing a tough challenge without making it feel impossible.  The training minigames are interesting and while repetitive, the ways they simulate what they represent make a lot of sense.  The look and sound are perfect for this kind of game, and the translation is actually part of what makes it so charming.  I really hope they leave in at least one mention of STRENGHT.EDIT: After having fixed the gamepad support and added keyboard macros for multi-button presses, I recommend this game even more highly to anyone looking for a fun single-player fighter.  It may seem like a normal game, but it's a really...A SPECIAL GAME!			"
