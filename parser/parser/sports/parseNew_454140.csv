								First let me provide some background on me - I'm a high level trennis player - I played competitvely at the college level and one of my reasons for buying HTC was to explore tennis in VR. The bottomline: This is a good game, better in many respects than I expected, but it can certainly be improved. I highlight the improvements that can make this game better:1. Probably the best thing about the game is that it accuarately reflects the players attempt to hit down the line versus crosscourt - this was very impressive. However, it does not reflect the players attemp to hit high over the net versus low over the net - ie, lobbing is not possible. This results in not being able to hit the ball out by hitting it long. You can miss wide and miss in the net, but I wasn't able to miss by hitting the ball too deep - past the baseline. 2. The angle of the racquet is mostly accurate - however, the game overrides really bad angles. For instance if I attempt to hit the ball on the ground by angling the head down, the ball can still go over the net. I assume this is set up to help people who aren't really tennis players. I understand this, but I feel making the game more realistic is worth it. 3. The player is able to teleport from backhand to forehand instead of running from side to side - again I understand why, but I think there should be a no-teleport option for players that have the space and want a more realistic experience.4. I like that serving is difficult, but I feel topspin serves aren't reflected accurately.Again, this is a really really good game. If you play tennis I would 100% buy this game without hesitation. If you don't play tennis seriously, this game is also worth it as the realism is better than I was originally expecting.			"

								I bought the game an hour ago and here are some initial impressionsPros :1. Visuals are pretty good.2. Controls work very well. It was very sensitive to my real life movements.3. Lots of tournaments .4. The crowd applause and the commentary is a nice touch.5. AI looks like its pretty good.6. Training mode is really fun for practice.7. Makes really good use of room scale.Personal Gripes :Very hard to play. The ball comes at you really fast and is very realistic. I have had a lot of issues with timing and am just not really good at it.For those of you who are looking for a realistic simultor, it works very well.I wish there was like an beginner settings where you could slow down the ball just a little. Also the training only lets you hit, it will be good if the player can also practice serves.The game description says  ""Put the target on court to hit the ball whereever you like"" . I couldn't find a way to do that.Cons :1. Menu button does not work in most cases. The game asks you to use the menu button to exit but it ended up freezing the game in 90% of the cases.2. When starting a tournament, the game just went into an infinite loading screen. Had to force exit the app and start again.3. If you lose a tournament, the game takes you to a locker room but you cannot restart or exit. Pressing menu locks up the game. Had to force exit.4. Also many times when playing against the AI, the ball comes outside my chaperone bounds. Don't see a way to reset the view or move the player using any form of controller movement.Unless someone has a really big play area, many will run into issues with see the AI hitting the ball just outside the chaperone bounds. The camera angle makes it really hard to adjust in these cases. Note : I meet the minimum roomscale requirements.To summerize, a really good effort. Looks like the team wanted to make a realtistic tennis simulator and they have succeeded for the most part. Biggest issue right now are the crashes, difficulty curve and the lack of a proper tutorial. Based on my observation, none of the vive controller buttons are used for playing and the menu button for exiting.To all the tennis fans out thre - try it out, you might like it.			"

								Played first time for about an hour and reached the Wimbledon Quarterfinals against L. Hewitt..I played tennis all my life but have never experienced stadium tennis...when I started the game I was overwhelmed with the environment, of stading in the middle of the action..I can slice the ball and also lob it over the opponents head..Pricing seems reasonable..but of course that depends on where you live......for those of you who are fat and overweight its time to pick up your motion controller and give this game a try...I was all sweaty after playing for just an hour.My fastest serve according to the stats was over 500km/hr...that was kinda wierd though...

								In a word, fantastic. I'm pretty terrible, only won a single game but just played about an hour so far and I'm feeling like I'm slowly improving; I'm not a tennis player.You need a decent space around you and feel confident to move in it, as you aren't always placed in the perfect spot to return the ball so a step or so adjustment is required. I'm certain the game provides some assistance in your shots. It's not that obvious, the balance feels very well balanced in this respect.  I feel in control including when I hit the ball out of court, I know it was my error.As an early access title it's really well put together, definately worth getting if you're interested in tennis, the immerision superb. It's a decent workout too making it a worthwhile fitness title.			"

								The direction the ball is heading feels unatural and off, there's an options that makes it slightly better now though. Needs lots of improvement and could become an okay game in the future. Untill then i would not recommend this game.			"

								  Add a tennis court to my ping pong and pool table that fits into my computer. What an amazing time to be gamer right?  VR has arrived. This game will be one of my favorites I can already tell. I play on the Oculus Riftwith touch controllers, and I can confirm it works very well. Already worth the price, but I can't wait to see what they do with this in the future!10/10			"

								A pleasant surprise find, thought I had looked at every VR game available since purchasing a Rift late last year but just came across this. It works surprisingly well and will be a show piece for my VR. Note to Rift users, racquet is right hand only so if you have to use your left hand you will have to switch left and right controllers......for now.			"

								This game is everything i dreamed of i was nervous about purchasing it because i was afraid it would suck, it doeesnt i cant play it on simulation because its a little to tough to serve but in arcade mode i just did a 25 minute set it was awesome the mechanics are pretty darn good. There are flaws however sometimes my racket would just disappear and id miss the ball on a long rally which was frustrating, sometimes the ball would go right through the racket. even with these bugs the game is still amazing its probably my new favorite game. i watch tennis all the time and i want to play so bad but have no one to play with this game just answered my prayers,update: having played for a while now the game gets better as you get better; however i have few complaints,1. The racket dissapearing needs to be fixed it happens at the worst times, set point, break point, match point its aggrivating to lose a match because your racket dissapears,2, add a diagnol option to the run so it puts you on a side of the center line when you rush the net, i rarely want to be centered when i rush the net3. dont exit the game when you hit the menu button ive several times accidentlly hit the button then had to start a match over4.Leave the statistics up longer you only get like 5 seconds to look at themthese are just minor complaints i love this game keep up the good work			"

								I played this game from the first day in VR, and what started with some bugs and limited gameplay has meanwhile progressed into a real tennis simulation, although development is still going on. It really feels like being back on the court and there is enough variability to allow for exciting matches. It is already one of the great sport simulations for the Vive and a must have for tennis players and fans. What should not be overlooked is the locomotion system which has been implemented for the net attacks. Just use the left touchpad and running in place in order to control direction of movement and speed. This enables much more realistic gameplay than the more easy teleportation method which is also available. And what this game also urgently needs is a wireless connection for the headset!			"

								It's fair to say there are  still some bugs in the game, but its also fair to say this game has loads of potential to be a great VR experience. I've had my share of issues with crashes  and emailed Michele direct,(got a swift response and was assured that  the fixes were on the way) .One issue was fixed an hour before writing this and i  have just played a full 60 mins without any hitches (apart from the a.i winning finals by hitting the net cord every point!).  The Dev is fully aware of our concerns and will in time address the suggestions given by us. Price? .. high yes , but if the A.I is improved , the  ball dynamics improved ,and by that i mean  the ability to perform different arrays of shots, and spin imparted on the ball then this will be the go-to Tennis sim for VR and in time with the hours spent playing tennis 'in there', it will be worth it.

								The developers quickerly responded to my comment and send out an update address the problem I described. Now the game plays quite well. I didn't like the run simulation as what it is now. The speed could be a little faster. The run simulation also stops/slows down in between the points even if I kept pressing the left navigate button. I didn't like that. Most of time I couldn't get to the net in time with run simulation, so that I'd like to keep running until I reach my position. Stopping or slowing down in between points made it almost impossible to reach the optimal volley position. Please look into that and find a better solution.			"

								This is a Very interesting game.  it is the first real , serious attempt of a Tennis Simulator.I am a regular tennis player , competing at regional level so i got it to practice the movements & foot work rather than actually compete with the computer. The ball control is fair, so well done to the dev. There is room for improvement of course in different steps of the gameplay - i cant wait for the called expert mode. So I defenetly recommend it - it can only get better. Now the one big thing is DOUBLE BACKHAND. To be a real simulator the game needs to enable the possibility of a double backhand (which is currently the dominant form of backhand). Because the game uses the 2nd control to launch the ball on the seve it makes it not feasible to do the double backhand when you are serving (because you have the 2nd controller on the other hand). In fact i was serving and then putting down the 2nd controller everytime so i could grab my main controller with both hands when doing a backhand- not good. The game could release the serve ball with a minor wrist movement of the main hand because at the serving start positon the ball overlaps the raquet in the middle (not the most realistic of course but far , far better than killing the double back hand shot - which is 50% of the gameplay).PS - i played only 1 hr.. i broke the light fixture on my room. 1st game does this to me. It is emmersive , well done. PS2 - The dev. seems to genuinly listen to feedback and often replies to the posts which is great. enjoy!!!			"

								Here is the review to end all reviews:Pro side"" This game is fun, but unfinished. Here's what I mean. It's a difficult yet realistic game with different levels. Unlike in the trailer, it is first person. It is just tennis. You can customize your person to have different strengths/weaknesses. But like I said the game is extremely difficult. There is a training are that helps a bunch, though.; Overall, fun but hard game.Con side: Here is a list of the bugs I've encountered *which happen alot* - When you leave the game with the menu button then come back to a game, you can't pick up a ball to serve (Closing the game then restarting the game always fixes)-When you hit a shot that's way off, the other player will sometimes just go still sometimes not even on the court. You have to restart the game.-This one isn't as much a glitch as it is just a downside, but it happens alot where a ball goes too far off and you end up hitting something trying to get it (However there is a feature that auto-runs you to the ball) -Hitting can be off with balls that go high.-When you miss a serve the announcer sometimes says it's an easy shot which pisses me off l_l  OVERALL, IT'S A FUN GAME IN EARLY STAGES OF RELEASE. i 100 PERCENT RECCOMEND BUYING IT.

								Ive bought and refunded this twice now.  I cant get passed the second match it just freezes on me.  I love the gameplay, but I hate the gamekilling bugs and animations of the AI.  If you put the ball infront of the AI he will just walk very awkwardly though it.  Doesnt even look at the ball or seem to notice its there.  Please fix this.  Even with all that, the actual VR is supurb.  It could still use some work but it feels now like the tennis ball goes mostly where you want it to and feels good hitting it.  Some odd hits on net that i wouldnt have expected sometimes but it feels good.   There is training (get rid of all the cones please) and real torney modes with real players and world rankings.  That is what impressed me most.  Real names and everything.  The hub area between matches is nicely made too.  I obviously cant tell as the game freezes on me before I can proceed any further, but I would like to ask the dev if you can actually eventually rank up to 1 now and play the top players?  Also will there be real added animations?   Im marking this as positive as I reallly want this to do well and I will buy again as soon as these issues are actually addressed.			"
