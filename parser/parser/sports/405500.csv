												This game requires a controller. This game is also really cool. A pure party arcade game where your goal is to smash up a room in various ways. There are secrets in... well basically every level I have played so far, and there are lots of levels to play.In short... if you liked crash mode from the burnout games, and want a different take on that idea, than this might be for you.

												Normally I don't write reviews, but the hate on this has gone WAY too far. As someone with a not so great back/neck, I tend to lean back and play games with a controller whenever possible, so it just so happens I have a controller. And since I can read, I noticed the giant ""this game requires a controller"" warning when I bought the game, which for me makes it easier to play.As far as gameplay? Its a little on the simple side, and I do wish I could hit it one or two more times per hole, or have a longer smashbreaker. I supposed it would have no challenge if you could keep going, but I just want to destroy more stuff! This brings me to the main point of this review. This is a fun little physics destruction style puzzle game, just like it was advertized to be. The holes and objectives are creative, and the shot styles are a fun way to mix up your attempts. It is worth the ~20 bucks I spent on it, and would be even more worthwhile if on sale. Compare this to the cost of going to a 2 hour movie and getting a drink, and even getting 2 or 3 hours out of it makes the investment viable.I have already gotten those hours of enjoyment, and will probably complete it, which looks like it will take another 2 or 3 hours easily.As a side note, I saw people complaining about the framerate being locked at 30fps, but you can set it to 60FPS. Maybe they just added it? And I also saw some complaining about technical problems. I can report that on my homebuilt Win 7 64bit i5/Nvidia 960 rig I have had no problems.			"

												Note: This game was reviewed with a code provided by the developer this doesn't change my opinion on the game.Dangerous Golf is the game developed by ex developers of Burnout. It provides golf and adds the crash mode from Burnout to provide a fun destruction game, but this falls flat within minutes of you starting playing it.I was looking forward to playing this game and at first I enjoyed my time with it, but the more I played, the more my experience became a pain rather than enjoyment. Dangerous Golf is a simple game. You are thrown into an environment and you are forced to destroy almost everything in sight and then sink in the put. This is pretty simple even later stages. After enough destruction you are given a smashbreaker bar which lights your golf ball on fire and you explode everything you touch. It brings in more strategy in this game, but however this isn't wanted and you just want to cause as much destruction as possible.The events stay regularly the same and there's an event at the end of each tour which is there to test your skills, but it's probably the easiest event out of all of them and the most relaxing as well. Graphically the game looks stunning. The UNREAL 4 engine lighting and destruction look glorious and it's just amazing. One of my favorite features is the game letting you do a flyby of the level and then after you are finished with the level you have a flyby of the level after you destroyed the hell out of it. The game is also quite buggy. The golf ball glitches through walls, smashbreaker balls get stuck in walls and furniture models clipping with each other when you destroy them. The golf ball going through walls happened frequently on my playthrough and I really hope this issue is fixed.The game is also too long for it's own good. There are around 100 courses to go through and all of them are the same, by the time you unlock World Tour 4 you have pretty much seen everything. It get's insanely boring by the end of it. I had to take long breaks after playing for a while cause I was incredibly bored while playing it.The game took me 5 hours to finish everything. There is also a Co Op mode and you can try acing every level, but it's insanely hard, so I doubt it's worth trying to achieve that.The game also has abysmal keyboard and mouse controls so only play if you have a controller cause otherwise there's no point.Overall Dangerous Golf is a rough game, for the price you can get your moneys worth, if you absolutely loved Burnouts Crash Mode, but Burnout had a full game attached to it, but in my opinion this game is kind of boring and only worth getting on sale, but I still suggest skipping it.Pros:+ Amazing Visuals Cons:- Too Boring- Glitches- Keyboard Controls are horrible4/10			"

												I understand the anger over the controller issue but I won't comment on it since it didn't affect me.This game might as well be Burnout 3 Takedown's crash mode and Burnout Crash mashed together with a golf ball and furninture instead of a car. If you did not like the mode or the game you will not like this. There are 4 regions but there are multiiple locations with a single map and those locations can have upto a dozen or more levels so there is a lot of content. You have a room, a goal and a few set way to start. Once you get a smashbreaker you have real control over the ball and this is essentially the aftertouch from the burnout series. There are secrets galore on each level as well the requisite signature smashes (remember burnout) and secret smashes (hello burnout). This game is aimed at a very specific audience with some overlap with other groups. If you've been waitiing for a 3d crash mode since Burnout 3 this is most definitely the game for you.			"

												Did you love Burnout’s Crash Mode? Do you have an Xbox 360/One controller? Do you have a decent graphics card? Do you like smashing things? If so, I'd recommend this.I've had a great time with this game so far. If you go into it expecting an actual golf game I can see why you'd be disappointed. But if you just want to play a game that is literally Crash Mode with a golf ball, that's what this is. From the mechanics to the fonts to the music, I've had non-stop flashbacks to Burnout 3. Overall, I have very little complaints. I notice that the sound cuts off on some stages. And sometimes my laptop has trouble keeping up, but most of the time it runs fine with lower settings. But other than that I appreciate the variety in missions, my wife enjoys co-op mode and I have yet to try the party mode. Getting platinum involves a bit of strategy, which is nice and has lead to a few retry loops. Some of the criticisms this game's received are valid, but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying it. No regrets.			"

												This is Burnout 3's crash mode turned into a golf game. The first stages made me think ""what on earth am I doing but I won"" but once you figure it out it's both cool and (if you know Burnout 3's crash mode) familiar. Chaos all over the place! :)			"

												As a non-Early Access title this game is a mess. I was OK with what seemed to be a limited amount of content (4 areas) but was pleased when I found there were multiple areas and holes within each area, each with it's own challenges. Apart from that, however, this feels much like an alpha Early Access release title.1) You can only play this game with an Xbox controller. I'm not sure why they thought this was a good idea. I could see if there was an intricate control scheme much like maneuvering on your skateboard in the Skate franchise, but there isn't.2) Speaking of the controls, the only time you can even see them is during the loading screen which (Although great) goes by so fast you can only make out 1 or 2 buttons before you're back in the game. On top of this, it seems most of the controls don't even work. The basic scheme is A) Press the left stick forward to hit the ball. B) Press the B button during the special ""Smashbreaker"" mode and somehow use the left or right analog stick to steer the ball. None of the other controls I read seemed to do anthing.3) The game basically plays itself. Ready to go for the hole? Hit the stick and the ball magically flys in, ricocheting off of walls and objects as necessary to make a fancier end to the round. Granted, I only played 3 holes before I requested a refund, it seems there's no way to miss the hole. There is no aiming or planning or thinking required.4) The menu system is very wierd, in case you're looking for the Options screen, you need to go to Clubhouse first, then you'll find the settings for the game.Overall, I am very dissapointed with this game. I'm not really sure what the devs were going for here other than EXPLOSIONS, and, IT'S RUNNING ON THE UNREAL 4 ENGINE! Save your money for now and if they decide to drastically overhaul this game later down the line it may be worth it.			"

												Dangerous Golf is great. The controls work fine (not sure why so many reviews mention that, maybe they sucked and got fixed later), exactly like the original burnout crash mode. There is something pure cathartic in just smashing tons of stuff in a physics sandbox. Yeah if you're not still continuinely entertained on the third level you're not going to like this game because that's all it is over and over. Some people don't like that, I get it! But I can play this for hours. It does one thing, but it does it hella well.			"

												So here's the thing. I've been seeing two main complaints, so far. The first being that the game offers no form of guide or tutorial, and only the briefest of explanations as to what the controls are. The other being that the game ONLY supports an xBox controller.Here's the thing about all that: a lot of the problem there is that they couldn't be bothered to read up on what they were buying. They may have thought ""Ooo, Burnout! But with Golf!"" and just bought it outright. (Full disclosure: I was going to as well.) This is my solution: read. Do research. It took one (1) click once I got to the store page to find out that it needed a controler (if you don't count looking through the reviews, where it's plastered with negative comments about it). And as for the controls, it's in the options. A complete breakdown of how to play. It's conveniently listed under ""How to Play"". Now, some people want to be able to just jump right in and play with no delay, and I get that. But frankly, sometimes that just isn't the case. Don't get me wrong, this game isn't perfect by any means. There's room for improvement all over the place. Better camera controls, more accurate movement, less resource intensive, there's definitely room to grow. As it stands right now, however, it's a good game that's fun to play, as long as you don't go into it already bitter (and have an xbox controller handy).			"

PROS+ The general idea of this game is great. You get to ""play golf"" in a very unique way, which is to destroy has much as you can.+ The graphics look awesome. The environment is very well done.+ Great effects.+ World tours and unlockable stuff.+ Great game to play in Big picture mode, with a controller.+ Co-op!CONS- Bugs and glitches. Inumerous times the ball got ""out of the map"", or got inside something it is not supposed to, in the map.- The ""control the ball"" thingy... You are warned that it is tricky to manage it, but hell, it got me on the edge of my nerves sometimes. It has some flaws, the controls are not very.. responsive. Sometimes.OVERALL 6.4/10Nice idea of a game, looks beautiful, but you'll run into glitches, certainly. "

Although the game could use a quick tutorial for all the mechanics, it's a deep and overall rewarding game to play.There are some issues, don't get me wrong, but once you get a few holes in, and get some nice scores, you'll be having a good time.

												I got this game in a Humble Bundle and gave it a try. The game idea has got potential, but that's it. Several off-putting facts about the game:- It has nothing to do with golf. That is okay, I don't really like golf, but the goal is to get a ball in a hole and you just get three different stages to do so. Not an unlimited amount of shots and subtraction for over par.- Gameplay is weird, little explanation about what to do and unclear what the objectives are.- Ball speed is way too high, it is completely unclear what it is doing.- Apparently the game helps putting the ball, making it even less of a game.Fun game for like... 10 minutes.

												Great concept let down by poor and repetitive level design. Also there is a heavy luck factor in scoring, which encourages you to blindy shoot and bounce off as many walls before sinking the ball. If you miss your score is halved making retries of randomly aiming necessary. All the targets I saw were static, unlike Burnout which had moving targets making you feel skillful when timing and causing a collision.I played until I unlocked an Australia level/course and it was a gas station with a USPS mail box. What could have been an interesting game of skill and level exploration is reduced to small rooms of luck based trial and error.			"

												I love Burnout games.  They're some of the best car racing games in my opinion, very arcadey, but when you mess up it turns into beautiful beautiful destruction porn. Dangerous Golf looks to be the same game, in fact I've been tracking this game for awhile, ever since the first beautiful destruction video came out.  The entire world getting destroyed in beautiful slow mo, and I was in love.  I wanted this game.  I bought the humble bundle with this game in to finally get this game, and ... well the love affair is over.   The destruction porn idea is still here in some extent, the problem is it's trying to be burnout without the game behind it.  In dangerous golf you hit your ball into an object filled room to try to destroy as much as you can.  This sounds good.  The downside is the golf game is awful.  I'm a fan of Mario Golf and hot shots golf.  Arcadey golf is acceptable. So that's not the problemThe issue is when you start playing the game, you don't get to see where the ball might go.  Where you aim the ball with the camera does matter, but there's no guideline and you just hit up on the joystick to hit the ball.  Disappointing.  Once you do enough damage (counted in objects, not money) you can go into ""Smashbreaker"" mode where you bounce around and can do more damage.  There's a set amount of time (or movement), and no bonus time awarded, but you can go around smashing things to your heart's content.     Then you land the ball (you can decide when to stop or when ever you run out of time/momentum).  And you can use a smash shockwave (I forget the name).  Then after all of that, you put the ball into the hole.  Again it seems like it works, but the first time you get to a putting challenge the whole experience falls apart for me.   You realize that putting is a rather shallow point and click experience, point at the whole and put it in.  The puts are so strong, that you can pretty much put anywhere in the general direction and it seems to go in.    The same is true for the tee off.  You basically don't know where the ball will go, because there's no arrow, instead you give it a vague direction and hope it'll smash into enough stuff.  The entire problem of the game is that the player agency is heavily lacking.  The player gets to see amazing destruction, but barely causes the destruction.  There's not even a golf club to hit the ball, the game just fires the ball forward as if out of a cannon.  Granted there's some agency in how the player bounces around the room in a smashbreaker, but overall the experience isn't an orgy of destruction as you'd hope, but the only part of the game that's really interesting.  It's violence and destruction, but rather than being a reward for a particularly good shot, it's the only thing in the game, if you don't get a smashbreaker, you might as well just restart.  ""But stuff gets blown up, right?""  Well yeah, that IS what happens.  But the images above are not representative of the game as most of the time, you're so focused on the ball and moving it, the destruction is only there to distract you instead of let you revel in it.   Where every piece of destruction of your car in Burnout Paradise is glorious because you can't do anything but watch, in this game, if you watch you are losing valuable time, and the fact is you camera is so close to the ball you barely can watch anything. The game is built off a scoring system where you can destroy certain objects for a bonus, usually having to destroy between 3-6 at least early on.  And there's a little sparks of interest there.  There's very little strategy to the destruction.  You might hit bucket 1 first instead of bucket 3 but you're still going to hit a ball in a random direction and hope for the best.The thing is everything in this game is trying to be ""To the max"" this is ""EXTREME!"" and ""Totally awesome"".  Everything seems to be trying to be an 11 (the graphics the sound the UI) But this game doesn't earn that. When everything is an 11, everything really is a 5.  If you had three strokes to do a lot of damage and maximize the destruction and if you hit a level THEN you get smashbreaker, they would be a hell of a lot more strategy to this game.  Instead what you get is a single stroke, and then a smashbreaker, and a single putt.  It's a shame because there's a good destruction engine in this game, but that's about all this game is.  There's not an amazing game wrapped around the destruction engine, and from past experience programming games, I have a feeling the destruction engine limited the room size, which is why the game doesn't allow multiple strokes and so on. It's a shame because I LOVED looking at this game and dived in lustfully, but then I hit my head on the bottom of the shallow pool, and chipped a tooth.  Some of the images from the game are glorious, but overall the game doesn't live up to those hopes and dreams of the best parts of Burnout, the destruction.  I might be able to recommend it as part of the humble bundle, but there's no way I could recommend it for even 10 dollars.  A fun diversion, but not much else.			"

												Dangerous Golf has some of the best destruction physics in video games ever. Smashing up a kitchen full of plates and food and pots and whatnot in slomotion never gets old. Together with the nicely rendered, super detailed graphics, the clear cut game concept and some inventive level design, this is one of the most fun gaming experiences I've had this year (so far).Sure, the gameplay relies somewhat on luck and coincidence, but not everything needs to be a dark-gritty skill-heavy online-yelly souls-moba obsession-fest.

												For all the harsh judgement gamers are capable of, it baffles me how this 'game' isn't swimming in thumbs down.CONS: locations are small and square, click to shoot, putts guide the ball to the hole if even remotely possible (golf auto-aim), camera is horrible (cant see what youre smashing or where youre going), random explosions and destruction occur to make you say oooh and ahhh but you honestly have zero clue what the hell you just did, console-itis, horrible mouse/keyboard control, tutorials in the worng place, retry takes no less than 5 'accept' inputs, environments are static and boring (but oooh lighting).  Yes, this is Burnout crash mode, but the awful pointless one from Burnout Paradise, not the good one from Takedown.  MORE CONS: full price is a overinflated, replayability is zero, goals are often hidden, putt challeneg is a snooze fest, game designed with too much flash to appeal to mobile gaming mentalities, music is abrasive, feels like a UE4 pet project (because it is), it takes up more hard drive space than reasonable for such a dinky game.PROS: ooohs and aaaahhhs until you realize you're just yawning.Please do yourself a favor and only bother with this game if you get it free, in a bundle, or for less than a buck or two.  It's not a solid, feature-filled, or satisfying game in the least.  Unless you like exclamation points, spinning logos, overhyped sensationalism, and glitz plastered all over a regular old bologna sandwich (without mustard)....  it's a brief distraction.  Honestly, I'd rather have spent the time having a nap.			"

There's at least 100 different levels to destroy, a good variety of gameplay between all the levels, it looks and sounds really good, and the gameplay is top notch. The devs have listened to fans and have patched the game, fixing bugs while also adding features most frequently requested. While a bit pricey for what it is, the amount of content you get and the visual fidelity goes a long way.If you played it back at launch and were off-put by things like the long restart load times and awkward controls, these things, amongst others, have been FIXED, so definitely give it another look.

												Easily my favourite game. Needs tweaking here and there but stick with it and its very rewarding. Use the slow motion to give you more time to manoeuvre the ball. If like me you love the concept of destroying everything for points and enjoyed the Burnout series I would wholeheartedly recommend this. Ok you do need a controller but I play all games with one and they are relatively cheap on ebay. Video link to me getting a high score.

												""So what are you waiting for?""....this unskippable f**king tutorial video to end!!!Instead of following the normal pattern of most games these days of telling you what you need to know as you go or just reading it when you want to, you are instead forced into this tutorial video which dragged on explaining everything about the game not all of which you will remember as some things explained are not in the first level...but you will always remember that you don't want to watch the video twice, especually the voiceover from what is supposed to be a cool American chart countdown type DJ who just comes across as an annoying tw*t. This POS agravated me so much that I didn't want to play the game after the first level which was then incumbered by poor menu design by not contuning with the next level but making you go through back through two level select screens again; this is my only Steam game review after 12 years and 950+ games in my library, thats how much I was annoyed by this...maybe I was just having a bad day but it seems I wasnt the only one looking at other reviews.

												The game is a bleh at best(which isn't really good). Controls are really bad. No excitement when ""hitting"" a ball which I'm not even hitting at all. It just fires itself and breaks stuff. Eventually it slows down and I can do other sorts of creap which don't give me a satisfactory feeling at all.EDIT:I accidently Community Searched this on Steam and it made Steam crash. This game only gets worse and worse after you stop playing. Jeez.			"

												I'm enjoying the game, luckily I have a HTPC type setup where I run my PC into my TV and have a wireless 360 controller. The audio works for me and sounds good, controls are good once I figured it out and I even have it running in 4K which looks great.It runs pretty smooth mostly but then certain explosions and ball getting a bit stuck cause massive slowdown so hopefully that can be further optimised.Im up to the 'Australian' service station level, being australian myself I have to say it doesnt look like an aussie servo it looks like an older american gas station.If you like crash junctions from burnout and trying to cause as much chaos and destruction as you can this game is for you. Be sure to use the slow mo function a lot too as thats where this game really shines as they have so many objects breaking apart at once.Recommended!			"

												Update:﻿﻿ ﻿The game has now recieved an update and is offically version 1.2. The patch adressed pretty much all of my issues I had while writing my review. Since they have been fixed I will recommend this game for interested people at least when it's on sale. If you dig the concept you should get it regardless. You can still read my original review below.Dangerous Golf seems like a fun little title at first but sadly it comes with a plethora of problems. Until they are fixed I would recommend to stay away from this title.Read my full review here:https://thegoodbadgaming.com/2016/06/08/review-dangerous-golf/ "

												Mildly disappointing compared with the trailers. They should have given more hits per hole and allowed more control with a swing meter or something similar. Right now you just smash the ball and hope for the best.This game has a lot of potential and I really hope they're not done developing it because right now it feels like early access. Can't recommend right now but i'll change my opinion as and when updates are releasedUpdate: after the comment on my review I tried the game again. Spent a bit more time with it and came to the conclusion that PGA tour on the Genesis was a far more acomplished game with better controls and superior game mechanics. This game needs a huge overhaul before i'll even consider installing it again.			"

												If you liked burnout 3 takedowns crash mode then you may like this.  Well I do not think it is worth 20$, 10$ would be a more reasonable price.  The devs have already talked about in the news that they will make the tutorial in the begining skipable.  The camera is a bit ehh but you could get used to it.  But if you got this for 1$ in a bundle(like I did) Then it was well worth it for me atleast.  It does require a pretty decent PC to run from all the destruction.Its pretty ok so far, worth 20$? No.  10$?  Yes, it owuld be a better price.			"

EDIT!There was nothing stating that it only supported controller and that it was only a select number/brands of controllers, at the time of purchase. Stop whining about it clearly being stated now - It wasn't at the time - not even in the ""Additional Notes"" at the system requirements. The developer had to get contacted (Email, tweets and forum posts) in order for them to actually do this, so future buyers didn't run into this.EDIT!You NEED a controller to play this. Not just any controller. A Xbox 360/One-controller (or third party software to make a PS3/PS4 controller work). So make sure you have one!Can't play this with mouse and keyboard, which isn't stated anywhere - I actually had to ask, to get this info..Besides that point; the games runs at 30fps per default (you can apparently change that, but I didn't think that ""Clubhouse"" would be their term for ""Options"", so I didn't see this) and (for me at least) the ball movement seems ""slowed down"" (almost like slow-motion-like, of sorts) and kinda jittery. Can't see this being a thing of not meeting the requirements either (PC Specs on my profile). Sound tends to cut out as well, when smashing something, until you pause and unpause the game (which doesn't ""fix"" it all the time).Would I recommend this RIGHT NOW? - Nope. Not at all.Might this be a thing that's fixable? - Yup. Can't see how it's not. Nobody want's their game looking and performing, less than they want it to.TL:DR-ish:Not recommending it now.Despite only playing it for a mere 20-30 minutes.Bad performance (read: can't see them aiming for what I noticed above), sound issues and the actual need for a controller (lucky I had a few around), despite not mentioning this.

												What's not to like?Simply putt (see what I did there), it's a game where you smack a ready-to-explode-at-any-second, remote controlled golf ball around a variety of courses, ranging from kitchens to gas stations, castles to expensively decorated mansions. If you're familiar with Burnouts 'Crash Mode', then this game will feel right at home with you, as scoring big and creating as much destruction as possible is what it's all about.But take note of what's around you. Out of bounds & hazards can ruin your game in an instant, so make sure you take advantage of the fly by at the start of each hole. But they're not the only things to look out for. You need to go BIG if you want to get the Platinum medals, so shoot for any bonus cash holes to earn extra dosh or aim for the Smashdown targets littered around each course. Finding and hitting the 'secret' in each course will also give you a nice amount of cash.However, there's a catch. None of that matters if you can't sink the ball, so make sure you give yourself the room to make  that final putt, otherwise it'll all be for nothing.Overall, this really is a solid game and was quite a surprise. It's one of those games you come back to every once and a while, just make sure you've got a controller handy, cause it's best suited if you use one.Also turn Flex all the way up if your PC can handle it. You won't regret it.			"

												Got it for 79p on a bundle and well worth it, although overpriced at £14.99. Don't pay anymore than £2.99 in my view. Make a cuppa when the tutorial video starts as this is unskippable. The main game is fun in the same vein as Burnout crash, by destroying everything possible. No issues to report although the controls are not responsive enough.			"

This game is all about doing loads of destruction and getting crazy trickshots - right up my street and its a lot of fun.

(Recieved game as part of the Humble Unreal Engine Bundle) Aside from an annoyingly long tutorial video and complicated controls at first, Dangerous Golf is a blast that looks fantastic and has satisfying destruction. I'd say that it isn't a game for sinking hours into, but if you have friends over, or if you only have a few minutes and want a quick fix of destruction, it's great! Definitely worth it when on sale.			"

The end of this video so I can play.Finished the hole the first time in about 20 seconds, takes next to no skill.  Really, just rocket the ball forward and as long as it crosses the hole, it goes in?Got it with a humble bundle. It does have high production values and neat physics, but it just wasn't fun to play.  i'd rather play the old Microsoft golf games from Windows 98 where some modicum of skill is required.Sorry, but I'm uninstalling it now.

												I would love to recommend this game, if it weren't because the ball is bugging heavily in the wall before bouncing back... It looks like someone took a Physics gun from Garrysmod and scraped the ball across the wall before finally letting go a few meters later...Great visuals, but horrible ball physics... and the controls is nothing groundbreaking too. Get it cheap if you don't care and just want to wreck stuf... it does that very well.. haha.. but nonetheless, it was VERY satisfying to see all that stuff break apart exactly as you expected; Violently and brutal without mercy.But those ball physics killed all that joy for me... ;_;			"

												No, this isnt an amazing alternate version of Crash Mode from Burnout 3 we were expecting. -$20. Seriously??? -Aim, push Up on the left stick to shoot, destroy some stuff, wait for Smashbreaker to appear, hit B smash a few more things. Then mash A a ton of times to skip each and every bonus you received as well as other information that should be displayed all in one screen. Rinse and repeat over and over. All while fighting the camera to see whats around you to smash. -World Tour is great for racing. For golf though?? Who cares if im in USA, France, or England? ----Theres multiple sub menus inside of each country menu each with different scenarios. Why cant there just be a simple list to go down to select from instead???-Music is generic happy go lucky rock. Good thing it only plays in the menus. -On top of this there are numerous ""BONUS"" prompts that get right in the way of trying to see what else to hit-Camera is zoomed in way to close to the ball. An option to have a static camera/multiple angles would be nice so I could see the destruction while keeping track of the ball and watching what else i can destroy. -DJ Styker is annoying. Always has been. Why they brought him back, who knows. Then again...why they didnt make a spiritual successor to Burnout 3 instead is also a good question. -Almost 6 months later to patch in the ability to skip the overly long and mind numbing tutorial. Devs really seem to care about the game and they try to improve it from community input though so i will give them credit. However there's just not any meat to this game. Hit the ball, see what happens, do it again somewhere else. It feels very unrewarding and empty. 3/10			"

It reminds me of Pain on the PS3, it's a pity there's not an instant restart (hopefully this can be addressed or loading times at least reduced)  Not the deepest game in the world, but pretty good, if occasionally frustrating.

												Clearly made with a lot of love and care, and it looks beautiful. Unfortunately the gameplay feels a little too random, with no real skill or technique involved.Bought this to play with a big group of friends but multiplayer is a complete waste of time - it's basically singleplayer with a leaderboard at the end of each match, no way of seeing what anyone else is doing. Worse, you have to unlock courses in singleplayer, which meant we had a grand total of THREE maps available for our first group game. People were bored within 5 minutes and most of them uninstalled immediately. Real shame because the concept is great and a lot of work has gone into making a slick, polished game, that just fails to deliver any real fun after the initial 'woo physics!' of your first go.			"

												This is one of those games that you play with your friends not because it's fun, but because it's so comically bad.I bought several Humble Bundles so my friends and I could all play.  Here's how it went:* Download 8 gigabyte game* Start an online game.  Most of us join, only to learn the game has always-on voice chat that can't be turned off.  We all get medical help because our ears are now bleeding.* Game starts on its own before the rest of us can join* Restart the game, figure out how to mute each other.  Everyone finally joins and we start* Wait literally three minutes for game to load* Discover game is not actually ""golf""; it's just ""destroy as much as you can in 30 seconds with a bouncy ball""* Discover game is not actually ""multiplayer""; we all individually play single-player games, and then compare scores at the end* Several of us don't even get to play the first hole because we were figuring out the controls* After finishing all TWO of the holes, we quit the game and uninstall0/10 I paid $0.33 for the game and still feel ripped off.

												I won't mention the KB/M situation as I believe that's been done to death already. What I will say is that this isn't a golf game. It has a golf ball and a hole to hit it into but thats about it. You have little to no control over power of the shot and directionality. The aim is to smash as much stuff in one shot (and extra time with fiery ball mode of doom) then you putt the ball. No skill is required in the slightest to putt the ball unless its behind scenery or suchlike. Otherwise, you can smash it like a drive right into the hole with no worrying. As it is, I wouldn't recommend the game. It would have been interesting if it required more input from the user. The most input that is required is LEFT and RIGHT, no UP and DOWN.A decent looking game but with too many flaws to overlook. The lack of genuine control is a deal breaker.			"

												This in not Golf, you fire a bouncy ball around a room smashing things then fire it in a hole. The control issues people talk about isn't like there is an issue with controls being bad, it's that there is no real control. No power meter or anything, you just shoot the ball like a bullet and move your camera to poorly direct it into things then fire it at the hole on the next shot and even though it is flying across the floor it goes in the hole if you aimed at it. It is the type of game you would see as a flash game for kids, or a free app. This game is a waste, I wasted my money on it then my data, I have to use cellular internet and have a limited data cap and it is an 8GB download which is way too massive for a game this crappy. To boot, I can't even give it another chance because it just had a 5GB update and I know it's crap so I'm not wasting more to prove that (and the update barely did anything but it's over half of the total game) Don't waste your time and money on this crap, it is not worth it			"

												Three Fields Entertainment has taken BurnOut's Crash Party mode from the streets and put it in your house. It makes for an entertaining game, but only for as long as you find it fun to destroy stuff.

												Dangerous Golf is an interesting study in game design. It clearly demonstrates that piling on mechanics doesn't fix a flawed core concept. The tutorial fails to explain what's going on, the devs are just as lost as you.As a red-blooded American I never thought I'd say this - it makes explosions boring.			"

												As with most games, there's the good and the bad, but thankfully not the ugly in this case...The game is quite literally a blast. If I had to compare it to something, I'd say it feels a lot like the old Burnout crash mode. You're thrown into a room and told to wreck ♥♥♥♥.  You generally get a normal swing first, and if you wrack up a decent score, you're given the ability to turn your ball into a bouncing bringer of boom.  Your ball will bounce around, delivering little explosions to anything it touches and further racking up your score.  In some cases you get additional explosions depending on what you hit.  You also have the ability to slow down time to better help you send your destructive little ball where you want it to go.  There is a fair bit of game here, and it keeps things relatively fresh by adding new mechanics and challenges.  I've already clocked 15 hours in it, and the game still feels fairly fresh.  It's a good game to drop into for just a few levels if you just want to kill a half hour or so.As for the bad, I'd have to say it would be the staggering amount of invisible walls within the levels.  This becomes very apparent when given the sticky ball ability.  You'll try to launch your ball through what looks like pure air, only to run into and stick to an invisible object.  Doing this will of course steal one of your limited launches, and ultimately kill your score and hamper your progress.But all in all, it's a rather good dollar to fun ratio.  I grabbed this for all of $1 on humble bundle, but I don't think I would have been terribly disappointed shelling out the full price of $20 for this game.Also, join me in nominating this game for the ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" award.

												I just got this game off humble bundle and I am loving the simplicity of it. I've saw all the reviews saying an unskipable tutorial and bad controls, yet somehow, my gf who doesn't play games simply picked up the controller and was getting platinums after 5 minutes of figuring it out how to play. I haven't witnessed the tutorial so maybe it's fixed now or I'm not doing something everyone else is... All in all a quite fun and theraputic game if you're into the old burnout destruction style game. The menus aren't great and there are a few too many times you have to press next after having loaded a level but still, nothing that actually is infurating, just a mild inconvinience. 8/10 just for the sheer joy of the game and the fact my gf can pick it up and play.

												If you like clicking randomly and watching the ball fly through like a bullet with no possibility of controlling power or any other aspect, then you may like this game until the novelty of things breaking wears off (about two minutes). The hole is five feet away? Click to putt and no matter what the ball flies at 200MPH across the entire map and back. No way to actually enjoy a game, and useless ""power-ups"" that are as confusing as the rest.			"

												Explosion Simulator 2016 :)Immediately, Dangerous Golf feels more like directing a movie than playing a game. There is no sense of What Will Happen when I push da buttan, but it inarguably stands to look cool and often make you feel cool. The camera steering is dodgy and sometimes wall clipping is unkind in the smaller environments.Quickly you may begin to wish each stage was more than a Par 2, but adapting to the concept of MANY repeatable stages that are 30 seconds of high octane, is what hearkens back the most to the Crash Mode of yesteryear.

												Dangerous Golf is awesome, the recent update fixes all of the complaints and annoyances that existed at launch.The physics in this game, while requiring a strong nVidia GPU to function as their most beautiful/explosive/squirty/floppy, are flipping amazing to look at and behold! Its so satisfying to bounce the golf ball around smashing the the crapola out of everything. Things explode with amazing detail and force and there are even simulated liquids! Which is a something I haven't seen outside tech demos until now.Great fun as a solo/co-op or party game! Getting Platinum is the name of the game, its possible to get insane scores on the levels - doubling, tripling or even in one case of mine, nearly QUINTUPLING the platinum target score - its so bloody fun when you do this and one level can become a game unto itself, challenging yourself or your rivals to beat an ever increasing score.AND THERE ARE 100 LEVELS.If you need more convincing tweet the developer Alex Ward on twitter, the company is great and listens and responds to the community			"

												Instead of hitting around obstacles you aim at them in this mini golf game. The scenery consists of pantries, dining halls, and storage rooms instead of traditional courses.The updates for this game fixed a lot of professional reviewer complaints found on metacritic, with the exception of little map theme diversity. The biggest complaint fixed is the reduction of the ""reset time,"" or time loading a restart of a map to try for a higher score.I play this game during TV commercials as a time killer. The repetitive theme cycling of the maps does not bother me since a map is only one to two minutes long. Definitely not a pro-golf game. Great game for anyone that ever got frustrated at mini golf obstacles and loved the burnout mini game / insurance fraud in saints row.			"

												If you liked Crash Mode from Burnout you should enjoy Dangerous Golf. It is kind of hard to explain why but it is fun creating as much destruction as possible.Dangerous Golf currently has a mixed rating on Steam and I don't think it is justified. Dangerous Golf is not a perfect game but it is a good game. The game is not particularly deep but it is fun. I agree with some players' complaints but I don't agree with all of them.I agree that the game could be a little more challenging. The putting is too easy. There is some skill in the game though as you need to do a good job guiding the ball to maximize your score. The biggest complaint I have with Dangerous Golf is that the game doesn't have a lot of depth. The game is fun but even with the different modes of playing the game, basically you are just destroying things with a golf ball. The game is fun but is not the type of game that I would play for hours at a time. I would probably only play for 30 minutes to an hour at a time and then come back to the game another day.If the concept of using a golf ball to destroy a bunch of things sounds interesting to you or you liked the Crash Mode in Burnout you should like Dangerous Golf.For my full review check out  Geeky Hobbies [www.geekyhobbies.com].

The game does not play like golf instead it is basically ""launch a ball at an object."" The problem is you don't control the ball at all, there is no ""swing"" or ""putting."" There is a button on the controller and you either choose max strength for a hit or hit the ball softly. Extremely dissapointing.

												This game has the potential to be one of those time-wasting, mindless destruction games. However, it needs a lot of work before it's worth paying for. It's buggy as hell, choppy even with a great pc AND the settings turned down.The camera angles are abysmal, either from some obscure angle across the other side of the room, or so far up the ♥♥♥ of the ball, that you can't make out what's actually happening until it's all over and you see the recap of your destruction.They also need to include control over how hard you hit the ball, like they have in pretty much every other golf game ever made. You can choose the direction, but not the force. I find it confusing that they would leave that out.Besides all that, it can be satisfying to smash every piece of china and sculpture in some rich ♥♥♥♥'s mansion... if the game doesn't crash and you actually get to see it...Ultimately, I say to the developers: Put in the hours to make this a legitimately finished product and I think people will actually like it.

												If you were to take Smash Mode from Burnout 3 and mix that with both Golf and Pinball, you would have this game. Pros: Brings back all the memories from Burnout 3 but this time with a golf ball instead of cars. It looks pretty in the Unreal Engine 4It is fun and has plenty of challanges and unlocks, as well as achivements and trading cards. Cons:While there are dozens upon dozens of challanges, there still is only 4 ""stages""Price. This game, while fun, is not worth more then $10 untill they add more stages.There is one annoying and long tutorial video you can not skip. (but they know this and said they will patch it)If I could reccomend new stages I would suggest:A ToystoreAn airportA Funeral HomeAn Arcadeor a MallConclusion: I do like this game.

												An excellent physics based destruction game. If you've played the Burnout series and wasted several hours of your life (as I have) mangling cars and imagining the carnage and death you've caused...this game is for you!!! The objects of your wrath are anything and everything, ranging from priceless paintings to an entire gas station. The game looks beautiful, but beware, it is demanding and will require a higher-end PC to fully appreciate. A simple game for those who like to destroy s*** and it was made by a small team, so you get the added pleasure of supporting a new non-AAA studio.			"

First thing is that the game requires to much for my PC, as in I can't run it without getting about 12 frames. I lowerd everything and only got up to about 20 frames. It was very hard to play like that. Besides the frames problem I loved the game, the idea of the game was amazing and it was unlike many golf games I have played before. If I could have played this game with high frames I woulf of bought it for its full price! If you have a nice computer and your looking for a good game I seriously recommend this!			"

												""Yeah, screw you all, we won't ever gonna make the tutorial videos skippable. Because reasons.""You can't change video settings when you are in a level, you have to exit it and change them from the main menu. And you've guessed it, you have to watch the tutorial video again if you did this in the first level. Apparently all these years of making Burnout games (which also have idiotic unskippable tutorial videos starting from the third one) haven't taught them. And now you've found out that all of the three video settings available don't change the performance much.The game feels really gimmicky. There's not much skill in controlling the ball, you just select the direction a press a key and it shoots straight. But the smashbreaker ball shoots in a curve for some reason. Camera is bad, it's bugging out when the ball gets close to any wall and it's really bad when it's in the corner. Well, I hope that Shadow Complex thing from the bundle will be better.			"

												Simple concept - and looks on the surface polished, but actually the gameplay is rough dispite it's simple aims. First, I can't use my gamepad - it seems to be Xbox only even though Steam now regonises PS4 pad fine on big picture and supports remapping for it. I then have to wait minutes while every single concept of the game, and every single tip, is delivered to me via the worse feature of Burnout games - the announcer. Nothing is left to me to figure out as a player and is VERY patronizing. No crosshair makes me just guessing where the ball is going to end up, so no skill.Effectivly a mobile game in terms of gameplay - very shallow, repeative, patronizing over the top rewards/bonus/UI which makes you never feel like you done anythign of worth, and worse when you fail.  It's a shame that the glasses etc. rarely smash. Just makes it rather unsatisfying, and werid when I can crash into a bottle and it lives, while the wooden trolly it was on blows up. Even auto homing to the hole, but only sometimes!11 a 'small' indie team? I dream of that day of having that large of a team helping.If you were interested in this because of crash junctions, you will be disapointed.			"

ThoughtsI cant recommend this game to anyone really, the premise is to push forward on your controller to hit a golf ball into random items in a room, items then crash into other items and things explode for no reason like a Micheal Bay film.  The ball finally stops however with the push of a button the golf ball explodes and you can move it about again and hit more stuff with it.   The ball finally comes to a stop again and you can press another button to set of a nuke kind of explosion and then you can attempt to putt the ball which just means you need to press forward again in generally any direction and the ball goes in the hole.There is zero skill required and its just a big waste of time, i dont leave negative reviews often but seriously dont waste your money on this.A terrible game that requires you to just press forward on your controller and sometimes a button or two to extend the terribleness. Steam ControllerYeah works but you only have to use 2 buttons and an analogue stick.Steam LinkWorks fine, no input lag.			"

Can only be played with a controller, really only consists of messing up random rooms and acquiring points like one would acquire them in Burnout, the game plays itself, it requires little attention, and this isn't something I'd even tell my friends about, let alone play with them. I will be getting my money back. I won't be playing this game again.			"

												What a noisy, obnoxious, lame game. As soon as you start, you're treated to a boring training video that they (seemingly) try to make exciting by having a noisy extreme sports guy voicing over it, shouting things that are supposed to sound cool. Once you get through that consciousness-sapping dull video, you play the game. You press a button or click your mouse to send the ball flying at stuff with the intention of breaking it. The more stuff you break, the better your score. There are little bonus things the game has for you to do which can improve your score, but if you miss getting the ball in the hole, you lose HALF your points.The ball is difficult to control, and you can make it fall straight down, ending one of your two hits  to the ball. If you're unfortuante enough to be more than 1-2 feet away from the hole, you're pretty much screwed and will knock the ball across the entire room, even though the game tells you that you're ""putting"" at this point. So to reiterate, I found this game to be loud, obnoxious, and boring, in the short time that I could be bothered to play it.			"

												Golf game 1%, destruction game 99%. If you like breaking things this is for you. if you want good puzzle or golf game look elsewhere. Only 2 power options for hitting ball. slow or fast =) so this game is really simple and fun destruction fest. nothing more but nothing less either. My kind of game.			"

												I just checked out Dangerous Golf, so this is no review, but a first impression. I think the idea of a 'smah stuff to bits' golf game is neat and there is a lot of things to break in every stage. It looks good, sounds good and smashing things into pieces promises some anarchic fun. The problem I have with this game at the moment is that it doesn't feel like golfing,  I don't even know how much influence I have on the trajectory of the ball apart from the starting angle and the initiation of the putting move. I made some medals by just aiming at some profitable looking targets and than hitting the 'put' buttons to complete the level.I somehow like, therefore I give it a thumbs up. But it is no golf game, it's like the crashing part of the Burnout series. I will update this review as my gaming experience changes with more time in the game.			"

												Very fun game. As others have said it is light on the options menu and requires a controller so if those are really deal breakers for you stay away (I imagine with time those things will be fixed). However it's damn fun and seems very replayable if you get in the multiplayer (seems like it's built for offline play, so if party games are you're thing I'd give it try) or want to climb the score leaderboards. I had to make myself quit for a bit becuase I kept repeating the same level trying to up my score for a platinum trophy. It's totally the kind of game that you can go to play a few minutes and realize you've lost a couple of hours. If you like crash mode in Burnout get this game, you won't regret it.			"

												There are very few problems I have with this game one of them being the poor tutorial, all you get are some panels telling you what to do, I would much prefer it if the game would hold my hand and show me and guide me through what to do rather than explain how everything should work with some pictures and words but the controls really aren't that hard to figure out on your own. other that the game is really good and a lot of fun, the grapichs and attention to detail is on point the ball even chips and burns up the floor and walls when it is on fire, the liquids look very realistic, the physics are great and I would expect it to be alot more fun when you have group of friends and and play together and against each other. So overall this is a fantasic game, i'm having alot of fun with and i'm not even a golf fan.			"

												REALLY fun, but I see why people are complaining. It should have keyboard/mouse support. However it does also support my cheap logitech F310 (in xbox mode). Some odd choices: putting level is dumb, for some reason settings is called clubhouse which confused everyone, and some of the kitchen levels in america are relaly bare and hard to actually get any points (i'm thiking a design mistake.) However, most of the levels are like ""WOW THIS IS AMAIZNG"" so in the end it's a recocomend.			"

												I'm a huge PC Gamer. Console not so much. However I have played several Golf games on PS3. When I heard this game was coming to a PS; I asked if there would be a PS3 but nope then i found it was coming to Windows. Having already owned a PS4 controller I thought ""heck ya"" great compability!Personally I am loving it. Why? I have played Tiger Woods. I have played Hot Shots Golf. I have even played Planet Mini Golf and to be honest I'm really loving this game. It comes with challenges. Break this much in money to earn a Bronze Title. Break this much in money to earn a Silver Title etc,  In addition to the other unique challenges within the game. For example breaking all 4 gas stations will award you big bucks. Dropping your ball in the Money Flags will get you bonus $$ too. Breaking items in sets will help as well. Trick Shots; longer the ball goes away from target but into the Flag...huge payout!Admist my 117minutes of gameplay I have managed to complete 6% of the game, and get 3 Platinum awards; which btw is above Gold (and isnt shown for the amt to earn it).  There have been times where i'm having to redo a course several times in a row just to get what i want but thats all good I enjoy it!I tend to say ""ok 10minutes on this course then I'll give up""; but I manage to sink the ball and more courses become unlocked wanting me to play more and more lol			"

												CONTROLLER ONLY GAME RIGHT NOW BE AWARE.If you have an Xinput controller or ds4windows lets move on, The game is a physics based ""golfing"" game where you aim a ball at A LOT of physics objects in a room, you get a few swings and the goal is to get as much points as you can not get the ball in the hole in as little swings as possible. Hell on the putt shot there is very generous sweet spot where the ball will go in the hole, It took me 6 games to miss a shot, until then i thought it just auto went into the hole. It definitely has the feeling of Showtime mode from Burnout Paradise. The game runs great on a 980 Ti over 100 fps at 1440p Maxed out with all nvidia gameworks features enabled. . It is pretty dumb though that you cant use keyboard and mouse. But I garuntee its going to be in the first content update. There is also a bunch of levels, and in them you go back to the room and there will be different layouts too. I havent tried multiplayer yet because i havent been matched with someone so i cant report on that. But for $20 as long as you have a controller this game is a great value and its a really nice showpiece technical demo for unreal 4. Now all we need next is for three fields to work with epic and fix the mess that is the driving mechanics in unreal 4, and make a spiritual successor to burnout paradise, my favorite driving game EVER.

												So, played for the past 15 minutes....it's pretty fun! Price isn't bad for some crashbreaking fun.If you have a mid-range computer you probably can't enjoy this game in full glory. My video settings are all turned down load, but the textures are set to High. You can cap the framerate to 60Hz, which means there is actually 60 fps support.I think this would play better on a beefy computer, since it's Unreal Engine 4.However, having no keyboard or mouse support is kind of a loss. You do need an Xbox 360/One controller, or in my case, a Wii U Pro controller.Crashing the golf ball into a wine shelf distorts the audio, which could mean it's my laptop trying to process all the glass sound effects. Again, it's not a beefy computer. It needs more beef.Overall, until some performance patches are released I would recommend waiting until it's fully developed or if it goes on sale. Or just get it on PS4 then!EDIT: A 3.9 gig patch was just yesterday, didn't change much. Now downloading yet ANOTHER 3.9 gig patch. Kind of a messy launch going on...			"

YES it isI love chaos and destruction , break this, break that, hit this, hit that, it's like messing up my bed room :3 so much funthe only thing I don't like is..... come on dev, how could you give me 1 smashbreaker O_o , I want more than 1 so I could make every room total mess XDand it's sad there is no free roam mode, a mode that you have unlimited stock of smashbreaker, and every objects can respawn after you break them, it will be a good mode to try out the trick shots and for tutorial thingyow, it's sometimes frustate me when try to putt the ball, camera movement limitation (only left and right), no guide line, that makes me miss the hole TT^TTfor the game that only cost me 115599 IDR = maybe 8 USD , it's a good and fun game			"

												So i wrote a review back when this game didnt support pc controls they fixed that and im still underwhlemed.The game had potential but no one seems to care enough to give it a life after release.  This had so much potential but it needed so much love and they just dont seem  to care.They couldnt even be bothered to release it with pc controls and the best they managed was 2 updates and not a word since july.  There is a good game here but we will never be able to see that game because they moved onto other stuff.I expected far better from you guys but thats what i get for trusting a new company please dont ever stain the name of burnout again in the future.

It's a cool game!You basically get one tee off to cause as much destruction as possible (in slo mo if you want) and then you get a very simple 'hit or miss' put scenario to finish the hole.I really like it.

												So, Dangerous Golf.Got my eye on this ever since i saw it on Kotaku.Been waiting for it ever since, and now i have it.And it's very good!But it's not perfect either.Let's start with the good:* Physics is top notch, Nvidia flex combined with tons of riggid bodies flying everwhere. it's awesome!And that's about it. It's the heart of the game. Destruction. Make a mess. Destroy rich people's houses.Now for the bad:*No official Controlls for the Keyboard and Mouse:Granted this game is originally meant for consoles, this was made clear when they clearly choose to leave the keyboard/mouse out of this game, i have a 360 controller so i had no problems, but for people who would love to try the game but do not have a 360 controller with will be in for a dissapoinment.* Hard goals.The Controlls are slow, and that's okay... unless you're on a timer that's ticking down fast. The amount of time it takes to turn the momentum of the ball takes way to long to be able to destroy the next object. It's a bit unforgiving.The game is fun, and if you love physics then this is the game for you.Verdict:Gameplay: 7/10Music: 0/10 Annoying as ♥♥♥♥!Physics: 10/10 would break again.Controlls: 3/10 (requires a 360 controller)Graphics: 10/10I hope the devs rais enough money to keep their company a flot.I read that the game director was scared out of his mind about the sales.Support them!

												I was excited to play this, having spent so many hours in burnouts crash modes.  Unfortunately, although the game looks great, clearly it has *never* been tested on a pc:1.  No keyboard/mouse at all, not bad keyboard/mouse --none.  I'm not sure how they even managed to do that, it's like they wrote code specifically to anger PC gamers :(2.  Won't go into fullscreen if desktop scaling is on.  It renders a weird 1/2 screen view that is totally unusable.  Turn scaling off and its fine.  Desktop scaling is 15+ year old feature on PC :(3.  It will break your audio *system wide* again, no idea how they even did that.  If you run this game, your audio will break across all apps until you next reboot.  Kind of amazed about this. Either the devs are trolling us or just don't own a pc (how did they build this?) -- needless to say don't buy until there is some kind of update.			"

Then the controls are god damn awful, like seriously, not a clue how to actually make the ball go further than 5m.THEN, the intro video's & other videos show Xbox buttons to select options, if they didn't bother to record some footage the PC version it explains how bad the controls are on a KB + Mouse.Plus, the Narrator on the intro is trying way to hard, just wanted to murder him 2 minutes in, him and the whole game are trying way to hard.

												It's the old burnout crash mode with but with golf.  I, personally, love it.  Haven't played a ton yet, but the controls are just fine for me.  I use a couple xbox controllers with my kids.  Smashing everything and being able to just smash the pin to put it in is great fun.  Not a realistic golf game in any way, which makes it great in my book.The haters about the voice acting probably never played the old burnout games.  It seriously is burnout but with golf balls and obstacles instead of cars.  It's good, clean fun.  Easy to pick up and put down.

												It's a fun time, but I wish they’d offer an “unlock all” feature because I bought it primarily for my five-year-old son who doesn’t always want to putt around a supply closet. It’s also a lazy but stable Xbox port. It’s fun for fun’s sake. Probably a little pricey.			"

												Being a huge classic Burnout fan, I got this in a Humble Bundle to check it out. It is exactly what you think it would be based on the videos... it's fun for a couple of hours, the multiplayer is pass the controller, and it works as expected with the One controller. I don't see myself going back to it very often, the scores are somewhat arbitary and a bit random. Graphics and sound are pretty great, it runs well. I think the asking price is a bit much, but if on sale or in a bundle why not?			"

												I was really hoping this would recapture at least some of the glory of the old Burnout Crash mode.  Unfortunately it seems to completely miss the point.  The old Crash mode took skill and clever setup to maximize what was almost a puzzle of destruction.  This seems largely to just be trying to sell chaos based on destruction tech.  Things definitely explode, but it's not fun in the least.As other reviewers have said the controls kinda suck, the game moves too fast to even know what is happening, it seems largely luck based, and on and on.

												Certainly not worth $20 but as part of a $1 bundle it's worth a play. Go take a nap during the intro video, you have time, then read the brief and far more helpful ""how to play"" instructions. Gameplay isn't really golf-like: you point and shoot, there's no swing meter or anything. It's not about strokes either. You get a tee-off shot, then a bonus shot (if you did well enough on the tee-off), and then a single putt to get in the hole. Pro: + Great graphics + Fun to smash expensive-looking things + Easy/casual, simple controlsCon: - Not really any gameplay to speak of - Way, way too expensive - Holy crap that intro videoIf you like a shooting gallery, or playing with friends and drinking, it'd be lots of fun.

												The game isn't a great golf game, and it isn't the old Burnout crash mode experience I was hoping for.  Dangerous Golf is closer to that ruined Burnout Paradise version of crash mode (the one that isn't very fun).  I do actually like that the tee off is simplified (no hassle power meters or spin or anything).  But my problem is that everything else in the game is simplified too.  You have so much ball control when bouncing around that the strategy and finesse of the Burnout crash mode can't happen (like using your explosion to baarrrely nudge your car right where ya need it).  And the golf side of the game isn't very satisfying either because there is a strong auto aim when the ball bounces.  The game also has minor annoyances like . . .  -Menu buttons that are finicky w/ mouse-An unskippable, overlong, and unneeded tutorial video-A ton of animation when levels end so the flow is really badIf I was the dev and looking to improve Dangerous Golf, I would personally:-Streamline all of the stuff at the end of levels-Add a ""hardcore mode"" with a more interesting rule set.  For example: Little to no ball control while moving, allow pause/slo-mo on bounces and let the player spend smash meter to change the bounce angle, reduced auto aimI don't think Dangerous Golf is a terrible game, I just don't recommend it unless it's on sale.  The most fun I had was watching nice CG rooms blow up.  That enjoyment only lasts so long.			"

												I'm a huge fan of Burnout Revenge so when I first heard of this game, I was really pumped for it. After actually playing it (albeit, only two holes) I don't like it much at all. The game is buggy and the graphics aren't great. In Burnout, half the fun was watching the slow-cam show you your destruction, but in this game, it lags so much that I can barely steer the ball, let alone see everything I'm destroying. The controls also don't make much sense, in that you don't feel like you have much control. It's more like just watching a golf ball randomly go around a room and not accomplish anything. Maybe I'll give it another chance in a few weeks, but either way, I would NEVER recommend paying full price for this game. I got it for $1 on Humble bundle, and I still kinda feel it was a waste...

The trick is to dip in and out rather than play for long periods and burnout on it (oh the pun!).I ended up playing a couple of rounds every few hours during some rather dull revision and found smashing a room to pieces to be quite cathartic. Also I didn’t use a controller and didn’t have any trouble - although that’s probably down to personal preferenceIf you want a little coffee break stress reliever give this ago. Well worth the price when in the sale.			"

												I have no idea how this game wound up in my steam library but I'm not complaining. So, its literally just the crash gamemode from the Burnout series but instead of cars its a golf ball and random valuable items. While it's not original in anyway (again its the exact same formula as the crash game mode) it gets a pass because EA refuses to bring back the Burnout series so if anything, it's EA's loss. My only complaints with the game are that it could use a guide of some sort, I don't really know where I am aiming at all, and its annoying when you go and putt. Speaking of putting, I realized a few levels in you really don't need to aim, as long as the ball is headed in the general area you will sink the shot. It unfortunately takes some skill and challenge out ofthe game. Other than that its really fun and mindless. Can't fully say to purchase it at 20 bucks but anything lower is a solid price.			"

												Fun for a while,  but then you notice things like these:- You miss a straight shot very close to a pole even if aiming straight and there are too many obstacles to ricochet your shot towards the goal- Your ball ends up behind an obstacle and you can't really aim it at a pole- Doors dont open up with a smashbreaker - only every now and then- Ball doesn't turn properly- You need to hold middle click to stay in slow mode- Ctrl drops the ball instead of controlling the height- Some controls are not explained for keyboard + mouseI would only suggest it as a party game.7.5/10			"

												I received this game in a bundle some time last year, and it's sat in my library gathering dust since then (as a lot of bundled games do).Last night however I decided to give it a try;  and I was surprised with how fun this game is.As someone who had literally NO prior knowledge to what this game was going to be while it was loading, the first thing that hit me was...isn't this the announcer from Burnout Paradise?  I looked into that after and yes, these are ex-members of  Criterion Games!!!  Awesome - I can only hope Three Fields continue on with more and more amazing and unique games in the future.Anyway, what IS Dangerous Golf?  It's hard to describe...but the game plays like Burnout's Crash mode...but it's golf...and the aim is to smash as much stuff as possible.Seriously, does that not just sound awesome already?  No?  Hmmm, you ARE difficult!!!When you deal with score based games like this, I always enjoy the inclusion of incentives / taunting of scores from other people on your friends list...""Only 5,000 points to go to beat Jeff Jefftyjeff"" it'll say, or ""You have taken the lead over Jeff Jefftyjeff by 1,000 points"".  That adds a bit of motivation to keep playing...""must...beat...high...score....""Perhaps that appeals more to someone like myself, a child of yesteryear who grew up playing Amstrad games and everything there after, but that notion of ""Just one more try..."" is certainly strong with this game.All in all, I'm not sure what kind of lasting appeal this game will hold, but I would honestly say that if you can grab this game for under £10, you won't regret it.Finally, I give this game:Flaming Fireball out of 10!

												It's amazing if you're looking for pure destruction. It deserves far better than it's current mixed rating.Personally, I don't think a controller's necessary; helpful, but not necessary.			"

												This game could be good if there was an actual game in there. The graphics are nice, it's cool to smash everything up in these environments, but there isn't really a game mechanic, at least not any that are satisfying or in any way golf related. You get three shots, one is a smash of sorts, then one you can control the ball in flight for a period to hit as much stuff as you can,  then the last is just a putt. There is no real control (or what you would expect from a golf game) over this shot. And that's about it. The score is just for hitting different things, perhaps smash all the statues in the room for example.  There could be more rules but it doesn't  really explain anything. This is more of a tech demo than a game really. I picked it up in a humble bundle and happy I didn't buy it full price to be frank.			"

												I recommend this game on sale for anyone with full recommended specs who really loved the crash mode from Burnout, or liked it and has friends to play with/against.  Easy to pickup and difficult to master most stages, which didn't start feeling samey until 9 hours in.Pros:-Visuals: They made object desctruction and environments as pretty as possible. Physics are top notch here.-Variety of mechanics: Although not endless, the game as it progress does include more and more ways to get crashbreakers, extend play, warp, earn cash, etc.-Seamless switching between keyboard & controller - Truly full controller support.Neutral:-Ricochet angles: Most of the time they're what I expect after hitting a wall, but there's been a few times where ricochets were janky and one time where the ball clipped through a wall.-Leaderboards: Definitely extends the single player game for me, but its only global, friends, or local boards. No regional boards.Cons:-CPU intensive: I have the minimum CPU but close to recommended GPU (GTX680), and FPS sometimes dips regardless of texture quality during big chaos to 20-30 even at 1366x768 res recommended by NVIDIA.-Environments variety: Although they really try to mix up the items in different environments, they still had a samey feeling to them after 9 hours.-No online players available for matchmaking.

												I just. I don't understand. It's almost there? But the stuff that makes it challenging make it not fun. The controlls are bad, but seemingly for no reason. Neat premise, underwhelming execution.			"

												I got the game part of a Unreal Engine bundle and thought WTF?! but it is actually a very cool game if you wanna relax and destroy stuff.I had a great time with the game so far.			"

												If they fix the bug that causes the golf ball to roll around on the WALL as if it were the floor, wasting your entire turn. Then I'll recommend it, because this game is REALLY FUN when the physics are working properly.However, this bug occurred far too frequently for me. Felt like 1 in 3 turns. Really ruins the entire thing...pity.			"

												ok the only way i can explain this game is they used the concept of aftertouch from burnout 3 to make a destrution game and golf at he same time! 7/10 can get repetitive but its allways fun to come back to :D			"
