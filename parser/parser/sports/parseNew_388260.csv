Early Access Review
								Super Slam Dunk Touchdown harkens back to the roots of arcade sports fun.  I would describe it as a combination between Ice Hockey for the NES and NBA Jam.  For anyone who has played either or both of those, you can probably stop reading now and just buy it.  If you haven't played those, imagine a 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3 arcade sports mashup (of just about every sport) where you can pick different types of athletes with various strengths (e.g., speed, power, and shot types).  There are multiple ways to score, and you can attack opponents and use a short burst of turbo to break for the basket/goal/goal posts.  The matches are quick and frantic and there are plenty of wild distractions like banana peals and even streakers.The sprites are well done and the game is funny in the way that Ice Hockey was.  There's just something about watching goofy sprites pummel one another while dribbling, kicking, and running with an ice hockey puck, and then bouncing the puck off the rim in a botched dunk.  The game doesn't resort to references memes or anything like that - it's just fun and humorous, particularly with a group of friends.I suggest picking the game up and enjoying it with friends (or even alone - the AI is pretty competent) and hop on the forums to encourage the developers to continue to improve the game.  That's what early access is all about, and this game has great potential to be one of the better games to come out of the program. "

												Originally this was a negative review, not because the game was bad, but because I saw a huge potential that was ruined by a couple small issues, and it was frustrating as I really loved the concept of this game.First I'd like to put the emphasis on the professionalism of the dev team, after the bad review they tried to reach out and understand. They also gave fair arguements and explanation. And eventually the recent updates of the game tackled most of those ""'small issues"".The game is not yet perfect of course but I can see a huge improvement, and I respect a lot the work that has been put by the team to fix the game.The AI is now way better does encourage team play. I found myself thinking about very exiting team strategies that would have never worked before because of the dumb (sometimes too aggressive) AI. It gives so much more depth and replayability to the game.It's not part of the update log but I have the feeling either the player stats, or the ball weight/physics has changed and it makes the game more enjoyable.The multiplayer games are still pretty epic and fun and the game has become a no brainer when I have friends over.I can't wait to see the future updates, I really hope the team brings more gameplay options, powerups ? special moves ? new way to shoot the ball ? :)It's worth the $15, it's packed with fun, good ideas, and a carring dev team willing to enhance the game for the community.

								This is a fun little game that plays exactly as you'd expect from its appearance: like a crazy version of the old Nintendo ice hockey games. The controls take a bit of getting used to, but the variety of characters are fun. Amusing to play around with.Keyboard controls don't appear to be listed anywhere, so I had to keep hitting buttons to figure out how to play:Directional arrows: MoveSpace bar: EnterEscape: Menu,(comma): Shoot.(period): Pass/(slash): Turbo boostRight Shift: Switch players			"

								As any good compettetive game this is easy to pick up. And even with some button smashing you can quickly have some cheap thrills. But underneath all of that button smashing you got several different ways of score and playstyles depending on characters and balls being dropped. I highly recommend checking out the online manual to get most out of the game.Pro:Good graphicsGood soundEasy to pick upHard to master GREAT controller supportEarly Access Cons: Early AccessNo ingame manual (leaves you guessing to a lot of things)			"

												At first I thought this game was going to be a just a silly party game, with just chaos and luck reigning above skill. But what I found was that this games mechanics are FAR deeper than just the surface. Shooting, for example, has 3 levels of charge, and each character does different things based on the charge level. The Football player will just throw the ball on the first 2 levels, but he'll punt it on the third. Soccer will shoot on the ground on the first charge, but the second, he'll kick it above his oppents heads, and on the third, he'll aim for the field goals. Most mechanics are like this, where at first it seems simple, but in reality, the devs were thoughtful and creative to create a game that's simple to understand, but hard to master			"

												Alright, this is my review for SSDT! As previous reviews said, if you like arcade, fast-paced action sports games, this one is for you! Choose your favorite athlete and you're ready to go!You can customize about everything about the match; Time per period, number of periods, arena size, what kind of ball appears, events that can occur right in the middle of the match, the number of points given depending on how the goal was scored, etc. You can also select from 4 different colors for your team.Different kind of sports means different kinds of goals to be scored. You can shoot in the net (with or without a keeper), shoot in the hoop or aim for a long toss between american football posts. Each athlete has different kind of shots, try them all to find your favorite one!The AI can be harsh sometimes but you can edit its skill as well.Couple downsides though. There is no online multiplayer mode (I secretly hope for one in the future) and the price may seem a bit out of reach for some people. TL;DRBought it yesterday, quick matches, fun game, worth its price IMO. Good job Tipping Goat!			"

												The dev has worked hard with the community to improve communcation about this product, and I think this game is pretty good.  Now, mind you, its not online, at all. We all still want that, and this would be an amazing indy hit if it had online.  But even without online the game is good.EDIT to Add:  I have a Let's Play up of this one.  Please note this game is really early in development, and I have seen a lot of growth from the developer.  So while I don't give it an A+ review at this time, keep an eye on this one as it grows.

												This game is pretty awesome!  Great fun if you have a few people to come over and play it with you.  Controls are smooth and all around its a pretty fun rediculous game.  My only real complaint is that the shots can take a bit too long to charge up with how easy it is to defend.  Personally I think just a bit faster charge and the game would be perfect.  Has a good oldschool feel to it and all the different players seems fairly well balanced except for the baseball player feels a bit weak as his shot is even slower to get off than all the rest.  I also feel the price is a bit high, $10 is about where I feel would be good value for the game. Overall I would give this game 8/10.			"

								This is a nice arcade party game. I think in the future, it would be helpful to make the courts wider, as the play can degrade into literal clouds of dust too often.and as with an Alpha, there are moments where you just need to shut things down. All in all though, this is a fun concept that's executed fairly well.			"

								Entertaining idea of reviving classic NES sports titles, in spirit of games like Ice Hockey. Chaotic sportsball with random events upsetting play. Tackle opponents, pass and shoot the ball in a number of goal varieties, such as a hoop, post or net.Currently definitely has balancing issues, however.			"

								For people like me who do not care for teamwork and refer to football as soccer, turn off the goalies in the Options before starting a match. It makes for some ridiculous games. Combining all the sports into one game is ridiculous and is the reason why I bought this game.			"
