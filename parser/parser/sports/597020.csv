Early Access Review
								Only played it for a short amount of time. I could not play it for long because its a leg workout and i got tired quickly(Just got home from work). I like the idea of the game and hope to see more features and modes within the game. Sometimes there will be fly balls and some will bounce and roll towards you. This makes you crouch and stand up a lot to reach the baseball coming at you in different directions. Price is a tad high for the content you get at the moment, but i believe this game at some point will add more content and will make up for the price. right now i would say it is a 6/10.			"
