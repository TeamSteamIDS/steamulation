												Cue Club 2: Pool and Snooker is the sequel to the original Cue Club game which was released in 2000 by Bulldog Interactive. It’s a game which features many game modes related to pool and snooker. This game improves almost everything from the first game but on the other hand also skips on somethings that were available in the first Cue Club. Now, for me it was one of the best childhood memories. playing those Cue Club virtual tournaments and trying to beat the AI in the game and virtual chatting with the AI. Such nostalgia. Graphics:The game looks absolutely beautiful. The graphics are clean and detailed.  It’s a top down snooker/pool game and this type of art-style looks very good for it. The art-style is very similar to the first game but in this one is HD and it’s much more polished and has more eye candy. Some of the effect that were included in the first game seem to be missing, namely the strobing disco light effect. The game is locked at 60 FPS and I did not get any dips in performance throughout my gameplay.Sound:Cue Club 2 features very awesome soundtracks. These soundtracks, I can listen to them all day long. It’s sort of like club music but a bit slower paced. The sound of the cues, balls hitting other balls, even chalking your cue are good. Just listen to the music in the video posted below.Gameplay:The gameplay is pretty simple and straight forward. The good part is the variety of things you can do. You can play 8 ball pool, 9 ball pool, 6 ball pool, killer pool, full snooker or 10 and 6 balls snookers. You can play against the AI or play 2 players locally taking turns each. The physics of the table cloth can be adjusted and the size of the balls can also be changed. The game’s physics is one of the best pool physics in a pool game I have seen. The AI opponents will say stuff like “nice shot” if you manage a good shot, which can be pretty entertaining. Another thing missing is the virtual chat option. That was one of the prominent features of the game and highly entertaining. As you could get in chats with the AI players and mess around.There are tons of design choices you can select for almost everything in the game. You can change the table cloth color, the finish of the wood, the pattern on the table cloth. The balls size can be adjusted and plenty of different types of balls can be selected. You can even choose the color of your chalk. Many different types of cues are available as well. Even some match rules can be changed. All of these are unlocked and ready to use, so no more grinding to unlock these cosmetic items.You can play different modes such as a tournament mode where you and several other virtual AI opponents will enter and there are fixtures just like a real snooker/pool tournament. Other than that there’s also bar mode where you start off in the lowest basement level bar and make your way up to a more expensive penthouse bar. The difficulty will increase as you progress to higher level bars. You can play solo as well. You can also play quick mode where you can just go and play any type of game with AI opponent. Another mode is solo mode. This has a game type called “Slam”. In this you can drag the cue ball with your mouse as if it were attached with a string and play that way. This mode was pretty fun. Other solo game types include speed pool mode where you have to clear the table as fast as you can and that time is recorded so you can come back and try to beat your own time. A short gameplay video of a bar challenge game can be found below:

1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playConclusion:If you have played the original Cue Club back in the day, you’re in for a pleasant surprise with this game. Even if you haven’t played it, this game is so amazing. One of the best pool/snooker games I have ever played. Super addicting, gorgeous with an amazing sound track. If you like pool/snooker in real life or in games media, then this is the game for you. The game has some nice achievements too.			"

												This really is a great pool sim, but I suck at it. So if you are great at pool, you should love this. Very simple yet has a lot of modes and challenges.			"

												Best pool and snooker game I've played. Realistic table + ball physics, tons of game modes and customisation of cues, ball sets, table cloths. Coupled with chill out jazz. I was really impressed at the developers who are active on the steam forums and even implemented a suggest I made! If you're looking for a pool or snooker game on steam definitely check this one out.			"

												I own the original Cue Club, and I once thought it was the best pool game ever made. I dunno whether it still is, perhaps it's tied with it's sequel.The original Cue Club had plenty of games including Killer Pool and a few other fun options for party play. I'm glad they're all here in Cue Club 2. I also love the fact that you have every aesthetic option available from the beginning, unlike the original in which you had to unlock things mighty slowly.There were several features now missing in Cue Club 2. Some were quite fun, such as disco lights, strobe, and ""dynamic"" cue play. Of all of these I miss it's the ""dynamic"" cue play, as it made the mouse become the friggin' cue. No such feature here. A feature that some might miss from the original is the ""chat"" feature, but that had too many flaws for me to work it out. I'm glad it's refined so the computer actually feels more human. Pretty cool.OK, now that I've gotten an old vet's fit out of the way, it's time to put the olive branch where it belongs. Cue Club 2 is well worth your money if you're looking for a pool game. The music makes you feel like you're in a club, which is awesome. The physics are as equivalent to real life as humanly possible, and the visuals can fool you into thinking you're playing the real thing. You actually click the chalk block in order to chalk your cue, in contrast to a command in the original. In my opinion, Cue Club 2 is the very closest you can get to playing a real pool game on a computer.Would I recommend this over the original? No, I wouldn't. But does that mean I want you to have the original instead? You're silly if you didn't see the fact that I think this game's worth it!			"

												ONE OF THE GREAT GAMES!I first discovered ‘Cue Club’ about twenty years, by pure chance when I was wandering about the net, looking for a good game to play – any sort of game, just something to pass a bit of time. Well, as luck would have it, one of the apps I found was this snooker game, called Cue Club, which looked mildly interesting, so I downloaded it, just to give it a go. My thoughts were, (as a regular league snooker player myself), something like, ‘I suppose this will be a bit crass and totally unlike the real game, but it might be a bit of fun for a few minutes’. How wrong I was! Right from the very first I was impressed with the graphics employed, very realistic and with accurate reactions between the cue and the balls, just as had been claimed in the ‘splurge’ supplied; something to do with quantum math or something – it was so long ago I can’t recall the actual details. I also had complete control over things like colour of table top, type of cues and even the games themselves, because it wasn’t just snooker, but a whole list of other pool games as well. That first attempt provided me with more fun on the computer than I had enjoyed for a very long time.As I said at the start, this all happened about twenty years ago, and I have been a ‘hooked’ player ever since, indulging several times a week, usually against the computer, but also occasionally against friends of mine, (because that’s one of the things you CAN do with this game!).I’d always been impressed at the accuracy and realism of the game, and thought it had just about reached the limit, as far as that was concerned – until, that is Bulldog Interactive brought out the next generation, just a few months ago. This has had several improvements and alterations made to it, such as being designed to fit modern wide computer screens and better layout of game information, etc.And so, the fun starts all over again – it’s just like having been promoted into a higher league! I would recommend anyone who enjoys snooker on the real tables, to give this game a go; I don’t think you’ll be disappointed! I should add that I have nothing whatsoever to do with Bulldog, I’m just a very happy customer who wanted to let the world know that there is fun to be had, and at a very reasonable price!Brian Lee			"

												A game of strategy and skill. The top down persepective is what makes it, with a simple interface that allows you to control every aspect of the shot without any hassle. It is relaxing and fun.A first-person camera would be too involved and needlessly complicate the control scheme and take-away from the most enjoyable elements. Yet this game has a nice crisp and elegant presentation, with many options for the appearance of the table etc.I have played this more than any other pool game I have for these reasons; simple to put on some music or a podcast and play this game. Certainly the best Pool Game I know of by far.			"

												This game oozes polish, from the beautiful presentation to the fine detail in gameplay.  I haven't played multiplayer yet, but can vouch for the single player game. The AI difficulty - often a complaint of mine in other pool/snooker games - scales perfectly in Cue Club 2, and each opponent has a unique character that brings life to the game with comments such as ""Unlucky!"" and ""Cool shot!"". The game is jam packed with modes, too,... heck, I'm 13 hours in and have still only played 6-red snooker. And the music, oh wow, the music is really, really good. Having played similar games, I think Cue Club 2 stands out as one of the better pool/snooker games on Steam. It's definitely a must have for fans of the sport.			"

												I used to play the original Cue Club, but it suffered from a horrendous mouse lag problem on newer OS. I didn't think I see the likes of that pool game again..Finally, we have a much needed up to date, second game on Steam (even though it was released 2014, retail) It's much more polished and refined this time around. There are plenty of modes and custom content to keep you busy. Another welcome relief are the Devs. Always on hand to help and open to suggestions (They have added a few of mine, yay) however trivial you may think they are. What a great bunch :DCue Club 2 is one of those games where you can relax and just get on with what you want to do..play pool. No drab, static, lifeless 3D rooms, with as much life in them as a graveyard, just top down, cue out and down to business.			"

												Well there are many gimics when it comes to pool and snooker games and it is safe to say that this game is not one of them, everything from the way you can control how much spin or curve you have to the look of the balls and table feels very well refined. if you are thinking of getting a game like this i would without question go for this one.

												I owned better pool games 15 yrs ago.  However this does look very good from a top down view only.  The physics are great and the mechanics are great.  But the only top down does put a damper on it.			"

												This game is visually stunning and wanted to like this game however due to it's lack of Steam Controller support I was unable to play it.Please be aware that this game states ""Full Controller Support"" however here is what is listed about controller support from Bulldog:Cue Club 2 now has gamepad support for up to 2 players. Currently they must be XInput compatible controllers, although Steam controller support is under consideration (please feed back to us on this). Refer to the 'Input Methods' page from the 'Reference' menu for instructions. Also please note that controller support requires Windows 8 or above.If you are mouse and keyboard player then you should have no issues.Overall I think this has the potential to be a great game once full controller support (including steam( has been added) "

												This game is worth it alone for the soundtrack! I love it!I remember playing the first game many years ago as a kid, sharing a computer with friends and taking turns. It was incredibly  addictive. I'm pleased to say that this game captures that same feeling, the gameplay is solid and I would recommened the game to anybody who enjoys pool/snooker. There are lots of customization options (rules, cue sticks, tables, balls, even the chalk color!) There is also a replay feature which allows you to see your moves in slow motion; I think that's so cool. The physics are accurate and the AI is pretty decent too with quirky characters that add to the games overall style and charm.			"

												As a kid I loved the original Cue Club. I was searching steam for the original and was excited to see a 2016 sequel. Who woulda thought? My only problem with the game itself so far is the lack of the smoke and lights. They were absolutely stunning in the original cue club, and would love for it to be added into this game.			"
