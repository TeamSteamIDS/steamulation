IntroductionSafety First! is developed by JCO and published by Headup Games. Dev team’s first game release onto Steam, but I think they’re off on the right foot. The title in question is a parody of sorts, but one which doesn’t feel forced and can be quite a challenge to unsuspecting players. For its current price, I consider it a great deal. GameplayPhysics-based puzzle platformers aren’t new neither on Steam nor before it. And yet, very few of them mix humor with nerve bending digital acrobatics. You will fail Safety First! a lot, in fact. But you will still laugh at the outcome of your less than stellar results. The humor in this game, considered crude by some players perhaps, is still offering a new perspective upon a genre I frankly felt that I’ve seen enough of it already. The not-so-subtle Magical Yellow Repair Liquid or MYRL for short, is not central to the game’s “plot”. As long as you keep an open mind about it and have plenty of pacience at first, the title will entertain you for quite a few hours. Just do your best to play it with a controller. The keyboard layout only adds unnecessary issues to an already hard game. With several game modes to choose from that are unlocked as you progress through the initial levels, I find it a perfect incentive to be finally able to play the Drunk mode and fail in even funnier ways than you did before. Not much can be said against or in favor of Safety Fist!’ looks. It could have been more lively, but then again, it acomplishes its purpose even with only a handful of colors. The soundtrack on the modes unlocked later in-game fits the mood and never felt repetitive. Pros+ Humorous approach to platforming+ Level and obstacle diversity with several game modes+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements+ Decently pricedCons- Tutorial or not, still a fairly difficult game- Lacks chromatic variation- Keyboard controls while responsive, not idealResult / Final thoughtsDon’t get fooled by its apparent simple looks and goals. Safety First! Is one of the few platformers in recent years that amused me, beyond the regular feelings of frustration that most platform games offer on a regular basis. It’s not to be taken lightly, any game that no matter how difficult instead of rage quitting, puts a smile on your face. You can even skip levels (“cheating”) so stop hitting that keyboard, will you? Use a gamepad and relax. MYRL fixes almost everything.Rating 8/10 This review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles. "

												Safety First:~~~~~~~~~ Well, isn’t it a bugger to become an old fart (I am definitely heading that way); your bones ache at every angle, your vision is blurred even with your quadruple glasses. Thank God your hearing aid is working perfectly when you remember to turn it on! You would not believe what happened to my grandma! She forgot to turn on her hearing aid one day (the day of her favourite radio show); she turned up the volume so high on her antique radio and managed to damage stacks of power cables from the nearest power plant. Don’t worry grandma, I am the greatest electrician around and I can repair anything that comes my way. . .  But I think we should put “Safety First!”   Safety First is a puzzle/simulation game where you control an electrician who fixes damaged cables with a substance called MYRL (Magical Yellow Repair Liquid) which comes out of his appendage - Sparky Willy! At the start of the game, you will be able to choose between three campaigns: Classic, Advanced and Space. You also have to ability to change the mode of play, from normal to faster and even tipsy with un-orthodox German words! All up, you will have to clear sixty-nine levels. Let’s write about our electrician for a bit. First, he has a hidden talent; he is an outstanding dancer, with plenty of smooth criminal and moonwalk moves in his repertoire. However, he has a frail body and his limbs have a tendency to detach themselves easily. How do you control the greater dancer that you have ever seen? You will handle his feet either by using the keyboard or a gamepad. You will need plenty of dexterity in this game and you will laugh a fair bit too. So, how do you fix the cables and move onto the next level? You will notice one or several gaps on one line and you have to position our smooth operator so that his appendage is above the gap, and let go the MYRL (I am giggling as I am writing this review). Easy right?! Or not, especially if the gap is on a horizontal line. Also, you will have obstacles to either move or use to your advantage to reach gaps. If you become stuck at any stage, you can forfeit any level and move to the next one.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Fun gameplay with good physics -	Challenging and well-designed levels-	Plenty of laughs-	Great price point-	Achievements and trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	Frustrating at timesLet’s fix all these gaps, so grandma can listen to her favourite tunes!8/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												I guess you could you say that I came at Safety First with a bit of cynicism. At first glance one will think this is just YouTuber scream bait, QWOP style game that is more about pee jokes and arms being ripped off more then about a fun game. For the most part my cynicism was not incorrectly misplaced, it is all those things but despite that this game still actually manages to be kind of addicting, fun, and rather challenging in clever ways. I was pleasantly surprised to find myself not just chuckling at my ""Magical Yellow Repair Liquid, (MYRL)"" but also impressed with some clever level design and moments where I felt like I had actually accomplished something.To be clear, the game itself graphically, sound, extras etc, are all almost equivalent to a flash/java game but at a whooping 2 bucks I can't really fault it there. So whats the basic gist? You control your feet and that's it. The game prompts and suggests you to use a controller and make it easier on yourself but I found this to be very deceptive. The game actually is easier to play with the keyboard especially during the space levels, more on that later. Where games like QWOP are about terrible controls, Safety First actually follows your exact commands to a fault. If you move your leg to far to the right it rips off, you need to be consciously aware of what the other foot is doing and make sure it matches suit. Easier said then done, trust me. You will need to use your limited supply of MYRL to fix circuits and move about a wide variety of physics based challenges ranging from stairs to riding on the roof a car. The game does rather a good job of teaching you as you move along in the levels, not once did I ever feel like the level was too hard or that I didn't know what to do. So after playing a couple of levels, I found myself wanting to beat the next puzzle and so on and so forth until I suddenly found myself beating the whole game. What surprised me is that underneath the potty humor and German foul language mode there was a very balanced, well thought out puzzle game. Could the game be flashier or more aesthetically pleasing? Yes, again though the game is $2 bucks. I wish there was more levels and maybe a couple of more physics mechanics thrown in but you pay for what you get. Now the game does have one major thing that drove me almost to insanity, my STUPID ARMS rip off like paper. Seriously, I hate those arms, they almost feel like the game is cheating you at times as you have no control over them and if they barely scrape against the walls, game over most of the time. This is most apparent in the later space levels where if your arm flies over your head for some reason it just decides to detach and give you the bird while it does. Ultimately, that is part of the challenge and charm of the game, keeping track of your entire body but there was times where they just came off for no reason. So like I said before, as someone  who came at this expecting a rage game I was happy to be proven wrong. You will have fun and you will rage but its cause the levels can be challenging. You will become so focused on your feet that everything else disappears. Just don't forget your arms or head and enjoy.			"

												(If you 'd rather not read this review, you at least owe it to youself to watch the trailer on the Safety First! Store Page.)Safety First! is a surprisingly clever and well-designed twin stick physics game, as much a puzzle game as one based on dexterity. The premise is that the gamer must control a stick-figure character to fix electrical problems by using Magical Yellow Repair Liquid (MYRL) directed toward the damaged area through a tool hanging from the character’s waist. (In simple language, urinating onto sparking electrical wires to fix them. WARNING!! Do NOT try this at home! It does not work, and may get you arrested if done outdoors!) Certainly, the most obvious aspect of Safety First! is humorous irreverence. But beyond that is a genuinely fun game with 69 levels (yeah, right) and 34 achievements (enough based on failure to make gamers of all levels happy.) There are three game modes, two of which need to be unlocked by successful gameplay. Included for an additional challenge is “DRNK” mode, or drunk play plus German profanity. The best part of Safety First!; failure triggers bloody separation (or crushing, etc.) of various body parts. While it’s a difficult game, the learning curve is reasonable, and some quantity of really hard levels can be skipped. (All these statements are based on completion of only twenty plus levels in the basic mode.)Safety First! is a clever and surprisingly nuanced game in which a controller is strongly suggested. It’s a very inexpensive game (on sale for $2USD), and the first seventeen reviews give it a perfect score. Highly recommended, but seemingly with no great surprises either way if you like this type of game as much as this player does. Thank you.			"

+ Hilarious concept. You essentially have to move your character to various gaps or ""broken cables"" and then aim your donger and shoot some♥♥♥♥♥♥to amazingly fix them. + The gameplay is a lot of fun. You control the left and right leg with the analog sticks of a controller. If they spread too far apart they will break off, so you have to carefully navigate around each level.+ The physics are ridiculous in relation to your character. They remind me a lot of ""Mount Your Friends"" although in this game you can't control your upper body as it flops around and gets dismembered.+ Challenging stages that really test your patience+ Quite a lot of content with 69 challenging levels+ If you have trouble with a stage after a few fails you are given the option to skip. (I feel like this feature shold be added to mroe puzzle games) "

												This game is simply amazing! :DI started playing this game with a lot of curiosity as to how it would work and how smoothly the character would move.After playing this game for a little over two hours I can say that this game is a great amount of fun, there are no silly bugs for as far as I've seen and the gameplay is simple enough to understand yet very refreshing.This game really sets itself apart from other games, it's a unique idea, kudos to the developer! :D(now let's see how far I can come with the rest of the game :3)			"

												Have to say, this took me by surprise. At first glance it comes across as one of those fairly hollow, youtube vid fuel, barely playable mess games. Buy it if you want a quick giggle... but it isnt. Despite being very silly the control of it is actually really tight. Yes the stick man can flail somewhat but how out of control it is is mainly in your hands. There are two or three levels that really push it as far as frustration goes, but much of the time it gets the difficulty about right and again, it controls well enough that many of the losses are clearly down to you. Whats more it gets you back in to the game, and is genuinely funny enough that a lot of your fails are easy to shrug off.The different game modes are interesting, there is a surprising number of well designed levels to get through, and it is really really cheap for what you are getting. A funny, polished, and challenging twin stick puzzle game, well worth the entry fee.			"

												Difficult physics based puzzler. It's a twin stick game so make sure you have a controller handy. Each stick controls your character's left and right foot individually. The feet themselves don't care about gravity when you move them but the rest of your body does as you flail a limp body around trying not to tangle your limbs and body on the obstacles or tear it apart. The object of each of the levels is to♥♥♥♥♥♥on the 2-3 holes. Seriously. Your stick figure character has a stick figure♥♥♥♥♥♥and it spits out yellow liquid. There's also a bunch of geek/pop culture references in the level titles which is a nice touch. Although it gets very difficult, you get an option to ""cheat"" and skip the level. Not sure if there are an infinite amount of them or not (I've only skipped two so far). Fun game if you're into these kinda things and worth the buck I spent on it from Humble			"

												I saw the early version of this game released at Revision 2015 as part of the games compo, and it captivated the entire audience. The whole hall was erupting with laughter as players attempted to solve the puzzles. The next day I couldn't walk anywhere without seeing someone playing it, whether in the main hall, down in the tunnel, or anywhere else.In this game your task is to urinate ""magic fixing fluid"" into electric wires. Your controls are something akin to QWOP, with individual control of the separate legs. Each level requires progressively more and more precision and speed. Feel like you want a bigger challenge than the traditional modes? Try speedy mode! Still not satisfied? Try DRNK mode, where your controls are drunk and German swear words are randomly shouted at you.This game is hilarious fun. It's simple, well polished, and silly. My only minor complaint is that without an Xbox controller the UI is a little awkward, since the control hints aren't translated for keyboard. Once you work them out (WASD for left leg, up/down/left/right for right leg, space = A, escape = B, C = cheat/Y) it still plays great on the keyboard though.If you like puzzle games that don't take themselves too seriously, or just want a laugh, buy it. At the listed price it's worth every penny and more.			"

Be prepared to flip between fits of laughter and rage as you attempt to manage this goofy ragdoll maintenance man. Imagine a mashup of a game with wacky controls like Octodad, and the absurdity of Shower With Your Dad Simulator. If that sounds like your thing, then you'll enjoy this game!If you're interested, check out a video I put together of myself testing the game out. Cheers!
