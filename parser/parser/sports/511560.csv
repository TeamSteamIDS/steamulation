Early Access Review
								Room-scale VR golf is something I've been anxiously waiting for since the Vive was announced. I'm an avid golfer and golf is particularly well suited for VR simulation, and I can't wait to see how many great golf games will produced over the coming years. Now, this is the first real golfing simulator to be released as far as I am aware, and so I bought this fully understanding that there will be a certain lack of polish to it. That being said, this game is a good first step, and gives a nice glimpse into what is possible when you look into the future of VR. At the moment, however, it's just not fully fleshed out enough to cross the boundary from ""fun curiosity"" into ""enjoyable game"".The most important quality to a VR golf game is always going to be the swing physics. The player HAS to believe that their swing is 100% responsible for the resulting actions of the golf ball. That's where the fulfillment and enjoyment of real golf comes from, being able to tinker with the mechanics of your swing over and over again, and the gratification that comes with really nailing a shot and knowing that your swing was the reason why. The moment that the player feels the suspicion that there are ""behind the scenes"" forces producing the resultant shot, beyond his swing, is the moment that the magic is gone. The moment I realized that my shots in this game were not making sense with my swing changes is the moment I slumped my shoulders and didn't really feel like playing anymore. Don't get me wrong, there's a broad sense of control, but you just can't fine tune your swing like you would in real life. I understand it's a hard thing to program, but it's going to be crucial for the future of VR golf.Other points: Number one, the game NEEDS (repeat NEEDS) to have the sound of the ball falling into the cup when you're putting. That small sound is the payoff when you're playing golf. It's one of the sweetest sounds in sports, and it's incredibly depressing to hear nothing as the ball drops into the hole. There is also no sound when contact is made between the putter and ball. That also contributes to the hollow feeling when putting.Secondly, the colors and/or textures need to be tweeked. I'm not talking about the low-poly objects necessarily, because I like the general philosophy of the art direction in this game, but there at least need to be some texture modifications to give a better sense of depth to the holes. The neon green color of the greens are actually physically uncomfortable to look at for too long. A contributing factor to this may be that the holes are just not well designed, and are simply uninteresting. Possibly look into replicating a real course? Also, the way that the bunkers blend into the fairway is really unappealing. Bunkers need to be well defined.It might sound like I'm being rough on the game, but that's only because I know those tiny details are the difference between a great golf game and a frustrating one. One day a well made golfing game will find tremendous success and I'm glad this game exists just to take the first step. I hope everyone enjoys it for what it is, and we can all look forward to some real top notch golfing games in the near future.			"

								This definitely screams of ""Early Access"" but certainly there is potential here:What is good:- I like the ""Virtua Fighter/Racing type of graphics, this should help it stand out from the upcoming competition- There is decent feeling of scale- more options than I expected from what I had read, such as:  there is slope, enough clubs, wind (though not sure if it affects the ball), grid on green- I have no problem with the sale price though I think at this stage of EA, that should be the regular priceWhat needs work:- Lack of sounds:  No sound when putting, no sound effect for the ball falling in the cup, needs more variety with the ambient sounds- Lack of environment effects:  IE: keep going with the Virtua Graphics stuff, but add basic birds, squirrels, anything to make the course feel more alive.  That volcano should be spewing out something, IMHO animation is king when using basic graphics- Its nice you have the arrow wind indicator, but basic cloud movement would be a better tell- I don't have too much issues with the golf club swing (though I have a nasty bloody slice to the right!) but the putting feels off, feels better in Cloudlands minigolf.  Now it's not all bad, I found that part of the issue was I wasn't standing enough over the ball but still, it feels like it needs some tweaking- a tad smaller cup size would be better ;)- graphics are decent but I would up the color content since in VR they tend to look a little too bland- the putting grid needs to be smaller so we can tell slope better- I don't think your super sampling option worked? (could be wrong) - presently only 1 course, would love to see more- Continuing with the tradition of the Virua Series, why not add a mirror option for the courses?  Instant double up!- multiplayer and tournament or season would be nice (it's coming!)I played the entire 18 holes and I had fun and I do like the plan the dev has laid out for future content.  Fun is king, soft recommendation at this stage but still recommended			"

								This is expensive for an Early Release in this state. The foundations are there for something half decent in the future, but current the physics are way too simple. Of course you can flick your wrist etc to make a shot, that will always be the case, but you as the player should be making a full swing. However the game doesn't do a good job of translating the swing to ball flight. Now I don't expect the realism of an expensive simulator, but whether I do a decent swing, or literally smack the ball in to the ground with the driver, the ball will basically always fly with the same loft, you have no control on how high you hit the ball. Other niggles... could maybe do with more nature background noise as an option, and adding a tee to the driving range, plus picking a club could be fiddly, but these are to be expected for an early release. All in all it's by no means terrible, but over priced for sure, and the store page over sells the physics involved.			"

												UPDATE - Looks like this was abandoned by the Devs so I cannot recommend anymore and would spend the extra money on Golf Club VR instead. Another reason to think twice about supporting an EA game but I get the reasoning behind it.I've played lots of Tiger Woods golf in the past and this game is a lot of fun. Sure it's got physics issues and it's very much early access but it's still a lot of fun and that's most important. I like its straightforward style. It's not arcade golf. A few things to help:- Putting green color way too saturated. Would be better off using same color as tee box green.- Move teleport to left side of ball instead of directly over.- Some holes don't allow teleport towards ball while it's in the air, would like to follow it somehow.- Flag on first hole is gigantic.- Clubs are too short for someone who is 6'5""- Grabbing the putter in bag is difficultI like this game a lot and I'm excited for what's to come.

								Check out the full review @ https://vivereport.com/2016/10/10/world-of-golf-gets-you-on-the-green/What I like most about this game, is that I was able to just open the game and start having fun. Plain and simple, fun. I cannot speak to the details of the physics in comparison to real world physics, but again as an arcade golf game, World of Golf is where it needs to be.			"

								Too many issues with physics and bugs.  Great start but really not value for money.  Scenery cartoon not realistic.  Ended up inside tree trunks.  The list goes on.  Am sure it will improve quickly but sadly I paid early - stupid me!			"

								Are you guys kidding me, . When you are teleported to the ball, you stands on top of the ball, who golf like that. The UI is a joke.  Graphics is horrendous.....I want a refund.			"

								This works very well with the Vive controller.   I have a nasty slice in real life AND in the game.  But if I control my swing, I can reduce the slice (just like in real life).  I'm looking forward to future updates and eventual online multiplayer.  Right now there is just a driving range (with many targets at varying depth) and an 18 hole course with leaderboards.  Overall, it's a very enjoyable experience.			"

								I enjoy hitting the ball around. Really fun so far even though my slice is as bad in game as in real life.Hell I can just have fun at the shooting range.			"

								Weather was rough today so I took a punt on this game and had a bit of a hitout.I'm still learning and it was a bit amusing to see my slice in VR!Don't go in expecting GC2 data in VR and you'll be okay. It's like to golf what Thrill of the Fight is to fighting and I mean that in the nicest possible way - a fun facsimile.Chipping around the green is surprisingly satisfying and I love the protracer style trails. The holes on the green are... forgivingly large. I had a bit of a chuckle.Price is pretty fair with the launch discount. If you're on the fence, have a knock while the weather is too poor for a real game and you might be pleasantly surprised.			"

								World of Golf is a fun insight to the potential of Golf in Virtual Reality. Strangely realistic physics, in as much as my real life slice is replicated perfectly in the game. There is a mechanic where you need to pull the trigger to 'activate your club' to stop you hitting the ball accidently and it took me a couple of holes to get in to the habit. However, once there I was picking different clubs and reading distances quite happily.You definitely miss the weight of the club on the controller but you can't really blame the game for that. All in all it’s a really good effort at a golf game in a brand new world and I look forward to actually getting good at it!

												WARNING this game has been abandoned by its devolpers.This game is quite good, unfortunatly the devs have said they are not going to devolope it anymore. so there is no online play. its a shame and im giving it a positive review due to the fact it is quite enjoyable, if a little difficult. Hopefully the devs might come back to it 1 day and finish.			"

												 This is a viable golf game for the price . It has a few physics issues now and then but for most part pretty good.Shame they are no longer developing it and game as is . This game is not a golf game to perfect your on course swing but is great for a golf gamer who doesnt actually play golf. For the price its a fun golf game not a simulator . "
