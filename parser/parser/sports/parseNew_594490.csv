Early Access Review
								Deadly Hunter VR was a big surprise for me, I admit. I never tested the demo but decided to jump on the full version as I was excited but without any big expectations. But during the first minutes of gameplay, I realised this VR game is something different compared to most VR-archery and defense action games. Hands down, Im impressed - and if you want to know why, please read below or check out my first gameplay video of Deadly Hunter VR in Mixed Reality view:

			Join my Deadly Hunter VR Mixed Reality Gameplay on HTC Vive and have a first look at this intense, beautiful and immersive archery-defense VR experience!		

My thoughts and short review:Deadly Hunter VR was a blast from the start. First thing you see is how beautiful and polished the graphics are. Its crisply sharp, colorful and detailed. While jumping into the first level I was not even aware of what this game actually was about, so I started off and found myself in an intense action battle using a bow and arrows against evil Orcs and creatures. ""Wow, that immersion"" was the first thing that crossed my mind. The environment is really atmospheric, the in-game music and soundtracks adds to the presence and I can admit that it was quite a challenging gameplay from the first beginning. The gameplay:Well, firstly - no this was NOT a wave-based ""standing-still shooter"" that I was expecting it to be judging from the Steam trailer. You can actually freely teleport around in most battle sequences and levels, especially from level 3 where it all starts to get really fun and challenging. You use a bow with arrows (that you later on can upgrade) and the Vive controller mechanics just feels simple but great compared to many other similar games. The bow is easy to handle, aiming is spot on and you master the technique to shoot very fast in no-time.Besides the bow, you progressively get upgraded with different traps to set out. All have their own strengths and weakness. The traps can also be upgraded further on with various combinations. Great idea for a game like this.Main menu:Really good looking and informative main menu-area with a miniature-map of the area and all levels. You can check out all existing opponents, all unlocked skills and traps etc. The main menu also contains descriptions of all features, including books and cool animations, which are just priceless i think - love this in VR!The Graphics:Beautiful, just beautiful! Polished, detailed and various environments really adds a lot to this game, and the VR immersion really is present. Considering this is a Unity engine game, Im truly impressed about how good it looks. No graphical glitches as far as I could find, and the game feels not too demanding on the computer (more on that later).The Sounds/music:Atmospheric music in the backgrounds is very important in my opinion, and Deadly Hunter had just about the right music that adds a lot to the battles and the feeling. Sounds effects are good, well really nothing to complain about.Difficulty:There is no difficulty level adjustment as far as I know, but playing only the first 5 levels I think it was challenging enough. Already on level 3 I died once and it gets much more intense further on. I think this difficulty should fit most VR gamers, but I also hope the devs will add difficulty-option in some update soon. Price/value:Well, considering the price-tag this is a no-brainer! Approx 4 hours of gameplay, in more than 20 levels and loads of challenging and intense gameplay for around 18 Euro (not sure how much it is in USD) is worth it all the way! Finally a game that really gives you long enough gameplay-time for the money - thank you developers, we need more of that! Also, there is a free demo, so of course you can try-before-you-buy.Performance:I had no performance issues or dropped frames playing this on my GTX 1080 Ti - bare in mind I was actually recording 2 instances of OBS software-captures for mixed reality view, VR view and green screen capture at the same time. Doing this is really demanding on your GPU in most VR games, but in Deadly Hunter I had no problems whatsoever. Perfect 90fps all the way!Well, all in all, I really recommend this game to everyone - do doubt. I will probably update this review as soon as I have played more and when new content gets added. Really hope multiplayer will be available soon!Thumbs up!CheersSweViver			"

Deadly Hunter VR - Armed with a bow, arrows and a good amount of traps you fiend of a monster invasion, no do not stop reading there, i know what you are thinking…. “Dave wave based arrow shooters are done so much” and while you may be right, this one does it right! The mechanics for the bow feel perfect, i got some darn satisfying shots in :) the trap system is well thought out and lends the game a tower defense aspect. The variety in monsters is far from just cosmetic...all in all this is a rare gem in the vr game list.ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT Let us start with the main menu, or lobby, it is very common for vr games to have an area you can walk around and interact with as opposed to “flat screen” games boring old menus….. It is just the nature of vr, however i have rarely seen one as beautifully made as Deadly Hunters, it is just superb in both design and functionality. At the time of this review i have half an hour in the game (these reviews i do are based on first impressions, and then updated as time goes on), and the levels i have seen have all been well made and thought out, no real issues with the environments at all, in fact they are some of the nicest (in a blood splattered monster strewn kinda way) level designs i have seen in awhile.GRAPHICS They are very good, from the way each monster has its own animation set right down to the cool way the trap menu unfolds. It is very clear that the developers have clearly made a lot of time and energy into making the graphics look awesome. Enemies react to where you hit them (and a head shot will reward you with a satisfying spray of blood) and as already mentioned the levels have a very nicely done atmosphere to them. This is a cut above the rest graphicallyPERFORMANCE / ISSUES Now although it ran perfectly fine i did hit an issue where on an escort mission (oh escort missions how you have haunted my game playing life, with your insistence i protect npc’s with the survival instinct that would make a lemming look like most sensible survivor of the year, it is safe to say i do not like escort missions…. Do not get me wrong, in this game they are not too bad...as escort missions go) the ball i was escorting dropped under the walkway and got stuck, since there was no way to restart the level that i could see, i was forced to quit and reload the game. This is a legitimate case of Early Access issue though so should be largely discounted, the second run through and all was well again. Other than my ball dropping out of the path, i did not experience any real issues.Well one issue, i could not rotate my screen so for the most part i was facing my pc, this is not ideal for cable management, again an easy fix for the developers.INTUITIVENESS The bow shooting is spot on, you know exactly what to do, once you figure out how to open the trap menu (you press the menu button) dealing with the traps is intuitive….It did take me a while to figure out there was a trap menu however and that could've been fixed with a prompt, equally i did not really understand straight away what the machine i was dragging shapes onto was doing (it starts the next wave) Nothing too majorly off in terms of intuitiveness and certainly nothing that the developer can not fix with a few well placed tool tips :)MULTIPLAYER: None as yet but it is a feature listed as a future goal :).PROS:  Enemies react to where you hit them Different enemies are not just a different model, but different weaknesses, strengths, animations and movement speeds (ie you actually need to use tactics to decide which you take down and how) One of the best archery setups i have used in a while (if you have played the labs longbow game then this archery set up will feel perfect to you) Traps can be upgraded (in my test time i did not experience that but there is over 100 combinations of upgrades according to steam, i look forward to delving into that) Leaderboards (ok i admit it i am somewhat competitive, seeing my name on the top 10 of a board brings a smile to my face, and score systems adds to replayability) That main menu and map is just too well made to not be included in this list! Plenty of value for money, this is not a short experience (they quote 4 hours and i would say that is pretty accurate for a first playthrough though with the scoring system and leaderboards i plan to get way more than 4 hours out of it :) ) Fair price, i have seen games with way less for way more, it is certainly worth the price.CONS:  Does include escort missions (this may not be a bad thing for some) No ability to rotate the view.The first try video:

			This is a first try video of Deadly hunter, An early access archery game (archery done right!) with traps and a high level of asthetics and really satisfying head shots :) Full review :...		

VERDICT Is this game worth your hard earned pennies? Oh yes, most assuredly. Even in its present form it is a damn good vr title and it is clear the developer plans to continue to expand the game further (I am looking forward to some multiplayer on this).In short it is just so much fun to play. Proof is in the pudding, I plan to do some live-streams of the game with luck as early as tonight, i am looking forward to loading the game up again once work is done for the day! "

 Gameplay video Legolas is happy. Lots of traps, some kinds of arrows, escort missions where you can walk through all map, headshots, two types upgrades for each 5 traps. May be tire is too common genre, but this game is well done and worth it's price what cannot be said about most other VR games.			"
