												I was very skeptical due to the mixed reviews so i tried it myself - so heres my review. +Simplistic 2 click swing system (relies on timing for power and accuracy - game is harder for power types)+Nice models/designs - -Pay to win clearly (BUT CAN BE PLAYED OTHERWISE - dont let that throw you off i have not p2w and still enjoy)-Servers mostly full+Driving and short game practice (getting the timing down does take practice)-Laggy (Prob due to the servers at times)-Weirdos lurking (kept saying weird things about my female character choice - really creepy and disturbing)+RPG quest-like system to gaining exp+gold-Customerising characters pretty requires P2W - Well till late game and im not even close after 6 hours X'D)+Lovely course design, graphics not too shabby. -Power or Accuracy first choice - nothing inbetween when choosing for the first time.Overall - Worth Playing? Yeah i would give it a solid 7/10 for a F2P P2W? - Yes but not required, only speeds up process... How much would you buy this for in the shops? $3-7.99? Well its free but yeah I would for this MMOSkill? - It takes some practice for perfect timing but theres driving ranges and short game practice. Thanks for reading - thumbs up or down - show some support. Peace!  "

												The game is very polished, with all the bells and whistles.  If you are a veteran digital golfer, you will hate this game.1.  no wind... apparently until you level up2.  no lie effect... apparently until you level up3.  standard driver is 160 yards off the tee... which apparently gets longer as you level upThis game is made for young kids... the animations are all young.  There is a meeting area outside the proshop called the square where you move around with WASD and interact and find games... but this wasn't implemented very well.  It is a CASH GRAB... if you want to play tournament professional golf, you will have to level up or it will cost you.Thank you for reading and have a wonderful gaming day!			"

												I would not reccomend this game for the simple fact that multiple applications that have not existed on my pc prior popped up in the background when using this product and were using an absurd amount of memory and network resources leading to the product not functioning as intended. more over the applications I feel were a direct breach of steam policies and were   in violation of ethical standards. simply put the product it's self is untrustworthy and came with additional applications that were not mentioned and are highly suspicious. overall the product requires a credit card for additional features and it would seem that there is a potential for fraudulant or illegal practices. I have since reported the product for what I have determined to be an unsafe and untrustworthy use of my computer's resources.  "

												I want to like this game, but I can't. I will likely play on and off, but my commitment to the game is degrading, and I suspect this will happen to the already small user base as time goes on as well.They have made a cute, and initally fun game, if you wish to stay at level 15 and below semi-pro. Starting at level 15+ you will notice just how skewed the game is, that feeling of improvement will fade as your scores increase quite sharply compared to the previous level. If for some reason you do not see this, you will come level 22, this is where the game starts getting greedy. It is ok to make money in a game, charge for cosmetics, charge for clubs *reasonablly* people WILL buy them. Charging real money for comsumables is bad enough, skewing your game to make them REQUIRED in just greedy and should not be defended or supported. This game is headed for the grave, unless they reevaluate their business strat. I honestly hope they do.			"

												Really nice game. Played it since the very start of beta... sure its had its ups and downs early on, but thats in the past and the game is now a really enjoyable golf game with the addictive MMO elements of levelling and gearing.unlike other golf games this one has a realistic gameplay, not doing 500 yard shots curling around rocks etc like some other golf game.the community is great, the competitions are great, the ranking play is great, and it has a place for both the casual gamer who love to play with people from all around the world, and the hardcore competitive player.not pay to win, although the cash shop gives advantages, its not game breaking and skill will always win.

												So, RECOMMENDED. Let's just get that strait right away.TL/DR at the bottom for those who find reading painful.Do you like golf? Well, that's what this is.Do you like boobs? Well, there's more bouncing boobs than golf in this game.Do you like games you can just download and play for free? Well, game's f2p.Do you like p2w games? Well, this game's got you covered.Do you like MMOs? Well, I never thought I'd see such a thing but this is a golf game that feels just like an MMO.The graphics are good enough. They look nice, but it's not brilliant. I like them but I don't love them. I have no complaints though.The performance is okay, but not great. It has some jitters and stutters, and fps is sorta mediocre. Nothing game breaking though. It runs decent on my Alienware i-7 GeForce GTX  650 ti 6G RAM, but could run a bit better.About p2w, it's not bad, but it's kinda there. You can beef up quite a bit with real money, but it doesn't mean you can't win without spending $. The game really is more about skill than buying the Winning Putt (see what I did there?).About the Store, you can buy a lot of things with in-game gold, and other things with cash-money. Most decent clothes are buy-only.About the community, um...well, naked. The community tends to be naked...so be ready for that. :pOverall the people are nice, and we always laugh about how naked everyone is. Just a bunch of hot chicks jumping around in their bra n' panties. Sometimes you'll see guys jumping around in their whitey-tighties (yep, the game gave them whitey-tighties)...(priceless).The golf itself is about what you'd expect from a good golf game. A classic 3-click system for swining, 2-click for putting, and general aiming with the mouse to decide the ball's destination. You have weather, which adds wind or rain.You can play at night. There are days and nights, so you don't have to wait until morning to go golfing, you just golf in the  lights.Friendly matches, Ranked matches, 4-way tourneys, challenges from NPCs like simply playing a quick 3-hole on a new course or getting a good score on a 9-hole, and other ways to play and quotas to meet.You get something of a Q-school challenge, and take a test to graduate to higher levels so you can go pro.You can play on Steam or not. You don't need Steam (game has its own site), but it's an option.About bugs, currenly you'll occasionally get a frozen screen and need to restart. Not too bad, but still a thing you might deal with at some point.Customization is actually better than I expected. No boob slider though! <--There's a Chest slider that sort kinda adjusts boob size...a bit. No worries though, females get an automatic D-cup. Guys will be ripped with like 5% body fat, but you should fully expect only boy-band options. That's what your guy will look like, either a boy-band or Abercrombie type. You can't really be old n' wrinkly, so you won't be seeing anyone like that. You'll basically be in a fashion show with 1 too many people wearing the same thing. For example, you'll see a ton of girls in a pink mini-skirt with long strait hair, and all ladies get the same standard black bra n' panties.The NPCs are annoying. You need to repair your clubs a lot, and you normally do so by walking over to Evan, the repair guy who will fix your clubs, but not before flirting with your girl hard and basically suggesting...stuff. Every time. He is a♥♥♥♥♥♥And the girl at the Academy talks to you like she is a 2nd-grade English teacher (assuming you play in English). I don't have a problem with proper grammer, but jeez...you don't need to try so hard. When you first turn the game on and choose your girl, she sounds even worse. Cracks some cheesy pun and laughs like an idiot. It's like how they talk in a kid's show.Example: Remeber the hot blonde teacher from Billy Madison? Remember her pattern of speech when talking to her students? Like that, only more playful. You'll notice this the most at the beginning when going through the tutorial at the Academy.The way people talk sounds like a kid's show or 2nd-grade English class, yet everywhere you look you see girls in their undies bouncing around for no reason other than to bounce around in undies. These 2 things make for an odd combination.Winning Putt is generally a really fun golf game with tons of challenges. The mechanics and physics are pretty good. The ball basically does what you'd expect it to. The courses are nice, and the game is not too easy/not too hard, though you will have a hell of a hard time trying to get a birdie on any hole of certain courses until you level way up and get much better clubs. The way courses get harder in this game is they simply get longer and longer, making you raise your swing power up exponentially, or you simply won't get the distance to get to the green before the stroke quota has been reached for par (let alone birdie). Like an early course may have par 4's that span about 300 yards, and the next course you unlock will have par 4's at around 350 yards, and so on until low-level characters have no chance.I have plenty of fun playing, and it's a relaxing game. The AI is pretty good too. They don't really make a lot of super-stupid mistakes, nor are they totally perfect at everything. Don't underestimate a human opponent though. This game has power-up potions of sorts. Like if you got Halloween candy, eating a piece will give you +30 swing accuracy. That is quite an advantage. some things wil give you a major advantage like +80 accuracy or +40 power. The AI doesn't seem to use items like these, but human opponents will. Some of these cost Platinum, the game's equivalent of real money.TL/DRThis game has boob physics and you can play in your undies, download it.			"

												A free game always gets a thumbs up from me so... But to the golf.The good:1. Nice leveling system.2. Gives you leveling up clubs as apposed to having to buy them (at least till lvl 12)3. You can 'win' stuff you can only buy with real money by playing - but it's random.4. Graphics are kinda nice... but options are really limited. This looks like a conversion so graphic tearing occurs, no anti aliasing or vsync and the power bar flickers when a shot begins - mine's stable after that but...5. Nice atmosphere to the game.6. The options to play others or by yourself are varied and so good.7. As a free golf game you can't really go wrong if you want to play it casual.8. Loads of quests to keep you busy - you can finish several in one round.The bad:1. P2W. Two ideas, either you get x amount of shots or the effect is timed. Things which will help you play better basically work this way and are really expensive considering what you get.2. Arcade golf. The ball's run never ceases to amaze me - a driver can stop in 2 meters when hitting the green while a sand wedge can get a good twenty meter roll... go figure.3. Wind seems to affect randomly.4. Height of landing area effect (if your shooting up hill, your ball won't go as far) is random.5. If it's raining your ball acts as if it's hitting mud.6. You must stay online or the game closes - like your internet drops for a second? Bye, bye... if you log back in the round you were playing is lost, even if you were playing it alone.7. Think the recognition of you hitting your space bar/mouse for your aim (when the bar's coming down and you have to hit the sweet spot to hit it straight) is linked to your internet... so feels a little random to me.8. If there's something to your right and you slice your ball? Your going to hit the object in question - even if it means your ball has to shoot wildly to the right, it will.9. The lay of the ball, expecially on slants, doesn't really seem to work properly.10. Slightly slicing or hooking the ball, if your playing close to the rough, in the direction of rough will put you in the rough - meaning your ball will slice or hook alot more than it should to hit the rough.11. The putting is waaaaay more affected by slope than other golf games. Against tiger woods (which is what I'm used too) I have to change direction to what I feel is right then add half that again to putt in this game.So arcadie golf rather than realistic (played a 4 player match - one guy was in full scuba gear, the other looked like a power ranger) but if you can get your head around that it's not bad - I played 'Everybody's golf' on the ps vita and plays alot like that... as if the AI is actively trying to make the game more dramatic - be it putting you in the rough, bunker or hitting something.I can see the arguments for and against. It is what it is. If your ok with this you'll enjoy it. If not, you'll want to throw your pc outta the window in fustration.			"

												I played lots of other golf games like shot online, golf star or the golf club and I like winning putt the most. The graphic looks quite great and gameplay is just like typical golf game. There are some unique features like time-attack and lots of quests. It's all fun. There are some issues I had to struggle in the beginning and would like to tell you how to make it better.  - Nvidia graphic card setting: open NVIDIA control panel --> Manage 3D settings --> Program Settings --> Add winning putt and select the preferred graphics processor as ""High-Performance NVIDIA processor""- Screen Resolution issue: if you're using 4k monitor, you should make sure if your monitor resolution is using the recommended setting. Once this is done, go to in-game graphic setting and select the matching resolution. - Avoid busy channel --> Busy channel is quite laggy. Once I move to the 2nd channel, it's not laggy any more. I hope above tips will help you to enjoy the game.			"

												I'm at 84 hours reaching about level 18.No, I do not recommend it...although it's worth about 50 hours of play.If you want to play golf for a few hours over a few weeks, sure, go for it; it's generally fun.  If you want to get into a ""Golf MMO"" which really outs itself as a well veiled P2W game, go for it.  If you have 50 bucks to waste, go for it.However:This game lends itself poorly in defense of F2P games to a degree which hurts, around level 15-20 it becomes obviously P2W, and more importantly, Pay To Exceed Expectation.  I wish it wouldn't but it surely does.  You will become a bare minimum player on courses which require more of you than is really reasonable.  If you do decide to play this 3-click golf game, which otherwise would be very enjoyable, start with a power player.  Accuracy is not worth it.			"

												First of all, don't get discouraged by the mixed reviews. If you like Golf, it's a fun game.It's Pangya meets real golf.The leveling feels nice, it actually feels like progressing through your Golf career with your character. Yes the game does have that Vindictus feels to it, character wise. Which it's not a problem in my opinion. You can get costumes and clubs by playing the game. Missions give you a very good amount of in-game money and it basically comes down to strategy and patience, like Golf should.The game does have some arcady things but it's a lot more difficult than Pangya for example.Overall I recommend trying it out if you like Golf games.

												Do not bother unless you intend to waste money buying  platinum. The game has been updated not to ""pay to win"" but ""pay to play"". There are many many bugs, you will not receive the  log in bonuses after the first week. As your character progresses and builds better skills, the swing speed will become unmanageable unless dun dun dun you buy platinum to to buy mods to reduce it. Decent game that the designers ruined with greed.			"

												I was looking for something _not_ violent, strategic or fast paced - and that I could play on my own mostly .. and I would say that this game fulfilles these criteria. I haven't played it for that many hours, but I felt I had to write a review none the less .. For someone needing this particular type of game I'd say it's exactly what it sets out to be .. There's still things to explore for me of course, but I wanted to adress one issue that I've ran in to: Even with the graphical settings set to a minimum I am experiencing some major lag spikes after being online for a bit, and as I have just recently started, I don't know if it's related to the christmas content (which is nice, but not really super easy to see the guides, or the hole for that matter, in the putting training range >.< - the hole is white to stand out in green grass ... not reaaaaally working so well in snow ... )I am hoping it's just a coincidence with the lag issues, because I could see myself using this game for some casual relaxed getting away from it all - there's a multiplayer part that I haven't, and probably won't explore unless I really have to, and sure you can spend money to get some good stuff and all that - it's just how the F2P gaming industry works ..Graphics are good - not that I'm an expert :P - the mouse doesn't always do 100% what I tell it to do, but it's mostly when in the square (public domain), so it's bearable to get to the actual games imoGive it a try .. ;)			"

												The 3-click Swing method has been a curse to golf games since the beginning of video games. EA Sports Tiger Woods 09' delivered a different style that worked, and since I've been adapted to as a primary method. I played golf games on consoles because it was a great way to have a few (or many) beers with friends and family while on the couch, so I've been used to the analog pull and flick style.I was hoping for a more developed swing-game when it comes to PC but it seems to be elusive to game developers of Winning Putt: Golf Online. In golf, it is all about the fluid swing. The amount of power and accuracy is determined within the swing and it is key to be smooth, perfect timing and with the utmost delicate power on impact. Adaptive swing using the mouse to follow a path from point A to point B and back to A is what I was expecting PC golf games to be using. That way the swing can be determined by power and accuracy based on mouse movements. I was let down. Looking past the sad 3-click swing method Winning Putt: Golf Online uses, the game at it's core is just a simple golf game. It has the options to flood the players with plenty of options to customize their characters, play at well designed courses, play in variable winds and weather... Beautiful graphics, and simple text-chatting. I was really hoping for a built in VOIP (Voice Over IP) to talk to other players which would really get me to play this as a primary game. But again, this is a free-to-play game which is, at its core, just a simple golf game. There is nothing about this game that drives me to want to play it more, other than sitting back, having a few beers and embarrassing players that are way more higher leveled then myself. It's not that I hate the 3-click swing method and it's tedious repetition because I'm actually deadly accurate with it. It's just an unimmersive experience using it. I'm focused on setting up the shot, then I pull away to do this mini-game, and the ball goes right where I wanted it too. The adaptive swing, or analog stick pull-flick method changed the game for me which drove me to play more-and more- and more.  I'm not sure if I'll continue to play the game, based only on the utilization of the 3-click swing method. If they design another ""optional"" swing method using the mouse, I'd see myself coming back to Winning Putt: Online Golf. In the end, EA Sports Rory McIlroy 2016 on console games will be my go to golf game, and Winning Putt: Golf Online is, just a simple golf game.			"

												This is the first golf game I've ever tried since I played the Links series back in 90s. As a casual golfer and more of a serious gamer, I find the game surprisingly fun and relaxing. It almost is like taking a fun vacation (perhaps because I've been playing Fallout and League for too long......) The community is friendly and helpful. Pros: good graphics, fun gameplay, good community and lots of modes. Simplified golf mechanics at least for a beginner like me, I like the community fostering interactivity in game. There are like 9 courses already. It is free to play. Cons: I found a bit of slow-down at times. It takes time to understand the layout of the map (not the courses so far) but the open area. I will be playing more and update my review further. So far, it is a solid free to play  game to recommend.			"

												I had to rewrite my review after 100hrs to really give my insight.You can make a golfer free to play work for awhile but after the courses get abit harder and you might need to upgrade the clubs to handle it with money. I have seen good players without ""p2w"" clubs beat players with better clubs because in the end its about getting a ball in a hole.Its really fun with friends and those who understand all the little details that go into golf like wind and lie.

												Ill start by saying im not a hardcore golf fan. I dont even really like golf games too much. However, I downloaded this game a few days ago and havent stop playing it since. It looks very pretty and the gameplay is solid as far as i'm concerned. One major downside to this game though is that there a some pretty bad P2W features but as a casual playing i dont feel the effects of it at all. If you aren't really into golf im sure it would still be a fun game to play now and again but if you are a hardcore fan of the genre I would still recommend it but I dont know how big of a hit it will be for you. This review is a little more serious than I normally do but I feel like this game deserves a clear and honest review to make things as clear as possible. I like this game, I really do and im sure a lot of other people like it a lot as well but it's definitely not for everyone.TL;DRFun, Pretty game with some P2W features. Not for everyone but you should still give it a shot.			"

												Well, I started this game in Jan. 2016 before it's release on Steam. I am currently lvl 35(max lvl) with well over 1000+ hours into this game. Yes, I'm a golf addict. If you ever plyed ShotOnline or Golfstar you will quickly fall in love with this game.This game is great but it does have it's faults and I believe it was released a tad early onto steam as it still needs to be more polished. So, keep that in mind that this is still a work in progress.I can't stress enough to people that this is no Golf simulation so if your looking for that experience you better check out Perfect Golf. Now far as gameplay goes. I think the gameplay here is great. With all different difficluties for each course, very easy/easy/normal/hard/very hard. I like that fact playing on harder modes gives you more rewards as it more challenging especially on very hard mode.Competitive Play: Some right off the bat will say this game is PAY2WIN. When your playing Tour/Challenge Rounds or Ranked Rounds people use Platinum items to make there game better. So if your into trying to compete, be prepared to spend a little money on certain items.Lasty, There customer support is top notch and they are always trying to improve the game. They are a little slow at doing things but they do listen and GIT-R-DONE eventually.Give it a try!!!			"

												It is good to play if you just want to relax and play a few holes for an hour or so. Don't download this if you're looking into competing without paying loads of cash because it is pay-to-win. On the other hand, gamers with limited time to play using it to decompress after a long days work will find it enjoyable.I chose an accurate golfer because it is less infuriating.			"

												Just so you know, I've started playing this game before it was on Steam, and am currently level 18. So I did not play only 3h.I like it, it's a good game if you like golf games, and it's free.So even if you never played a golf game and/or don't know if you'd like it, what do you have to lose?You have to take the wind, the terrain and the club you're using into account when you hit the ball.Would not recommend playing against people who are more than 10 levels above yours.Would definetly recommend playing it with your friends, though.

												The amount of time I spent in this game isn't reflected properly in Steam, due to the fact that this game has been around since January 14th in its open beta phase. I have over 1000 hours of actual in-game experience.Winning Putt is a fun MMO Golf game with a lot of potential. At the time of writing it still has quite a few flaws; some minor, some major. Whether you can look past these flaws is entirely up to each individual, so I won't include that in my recommendation. My recommendation basically means: ""It's fun to play, regardless of the flaws"".			"

												 I like this game a lot. But it does have a few flaws. Using the power hitter is all over the place. They have some pay to win helpfulls too. And it seems to me as you lvl the game play changes some. Meaning like speed of the moving bar. But with all of this said, this was the game that i finally broke down and added some money to, and really enjoy. I play this game everyday.  I say if you love golf games like Mario golf, or Hot Shots you will most likely love this game too.			"

												I like free games. How far can I get with out paying any money? My character is semi pro with lots of quests and upgrades available. SMite and team fortress are similar examples...after playing and having fun with a game, I start to WANT to pay some money for a good product. It does cost money to win the Tour or be super competitive. Like I said to my wife though hehe, still cheaper than real golf. There are lots of ways to make the game easier by spending $ if you want to. Pick an Accuracy class player initially. Power class is very unforgiving. Large breasts, short skirts, custom caddy names, very friendly community and fun rounds.Bottom line: great game if you arent expecting to rule the server with +10 driver of noob annihilation for free.Disclaimer: I'm not a golfer, I'm a hockey player. I have spent $0 on this game. "

												I'm really on the fence about this one. I'll just say first: Yes, I reccommend trying it. But I've edited this review to be a 'no' after reaching about level 12 and seeing the f2p-paid gap increase so heavily- not only that, but there's just too many paid items. Boosts for everything. They want you to pay for a 20 minute boost for this, a 1 hour sponsorship for +5%exp, boost balls, boost bags, clubs, even a soda to restore your energy takes a crap-ton of premium-only currency. It's not just a competition gap- you're even held back playing totally alone, if you don't pay. Still fun for a couple rounds, but don't invest money into this.________________________It looks good, sounds good, and has some really nice ideas. In fact, it just feels like they almost certainly had an incomplete/cancelled fantasy MMO and decided to turn it into a golf game instead. Everything you'd expect from a generic fantasy mmo is here. Experience, leveling, skill trees, upgrades, gear, etc. Just, in this case, instead of whiffing on fireballs while you level up, you're slicing balls into deep rough when you're almost positive that the shot should've been safe. It's unique- usually with golf games, if you have the player skill you can just dominate immediately. But this game forces you (even a bit artificially) into doing poorly when you're a noob- creating an actual sense of progression. Prepare to struggle for bogeys and pars for a bit. The real downside here is, that instead of going with (what would seem to be a slam-dunk) real money only for cosmetics, the cash shop items are DEFINITELY in what would be called the ""pay to win"" category. Money makes you better in every single way, by leaps and bounds. Gear, skills, stats, better caddies- you're flat-out at a disadvantage versus other players if you don't pay. That being said, I'm having quite a lot of fun playing a round or two a day by myself as a Tiger Woods subsitute. Your call.			"

												So this game is pretty interesting. It's an MMO golf game built on Cryengine, the same as Crysis and FarCry, and has a surprisingly deep character customization system. As for the gameplay, well, that depends on the person playing whether or not they find it entertaining. I can say that I found it rather amusing and could see myself playing it when I'm looking to pass some time.

												THIS GAME IS ADDICTABEL!I watched JoshOG played this game (sponsored stream) I started playing right after he was finish playing, and now I have been playing around 20 hours in 2 days (Yeah I know it says 2.5 hours, but i started playing before it got released on steam).- Hmmmm wow 12 hours past already ?- Damn I need some food- Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I maybe need some sleep also...- lets make a dinner and eat, and then keep moving and play more :PGameplay:Its F2P, but its def not P2W - you get some few advantage with using some money, but you can easliy beat them without spending a penny. Trust me. I have to say that this game is super good, I have never been that attracted to a game before, and I have 2000+ hours in CS:GO and around 1000+ hours in h1z1 (not the same type of a game tho), but seriously, this game is liiiiiiiiit, nuts and all that.COME ON IN GUYS!One last thing.

												Let me first say that I am one of those players that falls under the category of not liking actual golf but loving golf video games. You could march 20 professional golfers in front of me and short of one being Tiger Woods I wouldn't be able to recognize any of them. But anyway, ever since the NES version of golf I have been in love with golf games and curiously enough 20 years later the swing meter follows the exact same concept. Now that we got that out of the way let me start off by saying that the basics that make for a fun golf game and game play are present in this game. Whether or not you have some necessities to actually make your experience enjoyable is another question. You start off EXTREMELY hobbled. I was struggling to not get triple bogeys on every hole. The swing meter is VERY unforgiving and can get you very frustrated. As you go around and start playing rounds with random players you start to notice that other players do not seem to have as much trouble as you do. Then you notice they have certain clubs, buffs, accessories, enchantments. You start shopping around for these things and notice in order to get anything worthwhile you have to purchase them. Hey, no problem. I can do that. Then you notice there are two types of currency. Gold, which is in game currency you earn through matches and missions and the precious platinum which they give out to you in drips and drabs every once in a blue moon. The platinum is what you purchase with actual real money. the going price is $10 for 5000 platinum. I know what you are thinking. You are thinking, ""Wow, I bet you can buy a lot of sh!t with that."" WRONG! For example, there is a buff used when you putt that gives you a projected path of the ball. Trust me, this is almost mandatory when you get on some of these greens that are crooked as fk. They sell them by the 100 for guess what? 5000 platinum! The prices on this game are out of control. But nevertheless there is still alot of crap you can buy with the inhouse gold. One way to make a lot of in house gold is by using the challenge option. This is where they match you up against certain PVE computer players of different ranks. Depending on the rank of the player you can get a certain amount of gold for defeating that player. The only problem is you are only only allowed play three challenges a day and if you lose all three of them then you are sh!t out of luck. Not only do you not make any gold but it cost you money to enter these contests. So guess what happens when you go and try to play after you have expended your three limit challenge? Yep, you guessed it. You can circumvent the three limit by paying platinum currency. This game just oozes greed.  In my guesstimation you are probably looking at spending about $60 to really enjoy this game. Perhaps more down the line. You may say well $60 is not bad. Most triple AAA games cost that much. This ain't no Triple AAA game bruh. The graphics  are OK, I would say 7 outta 10. The optimization is absolutely TERRIBLE! It is common to drop to 14 FPS in town's square which ain't no big deal since that is not where the actual game play is. Its not acceptable but not a huge deal. But occaisonally you will get a drop like this in game play and that is fkn unacceptable. You are giving me 14 FPS with mediocre graphics set on medium and there ain't even 50 guys running around on screen like most MMOs? GTFO here! And you have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for petty buffs and clubs? I cannot recommend this game even though I really wanna love it since I love golf games and as I mentioned the game play could be fun with the right equipment AND no frame rate drop. The frame rate drop is what caused me to down vote it. You cannot have a jumpy screen when trying to peg that swing meter. Impossible. As previously mentioned, without buffs just pegging the meter slightly to the left or right means means rough, bunker or even worse hazard or OB.I think if in a few months, they realize no one is playing any more and they decide to work on the graphics and for fks sake get that FPS to a minimum of 30 with a full server, then maybe it might be worth giving it a shot. I personally think they should A) fix the graphics, B) charge 15$ to actually buy the game and C) drop the P2W model entirely and go with p2p with charging for REALLY special packages but make most of the good clubs and buff accessible for reasonable in game currency. The game has potential to be really popular but as of now I cannot recommend.EDIT: As of today (11/16/2016) the putt guide buff is selling for 2500 platinum. Maybe they are starting to realize they are asking too much for stuff.EDIT2.0: As of today (11/26/2016) the game is STILL struggling with FPS drops to the point of making the game practically unplayable.EDIT3.0: After playing the game for a solid month and a half and no longer experiencing FPS drops or swing bar skipping I have changed my vote from No to Yes. The rest of my comments about the outrageous prices still stands though. Game is fun and with the main technical issues resolved it is now worth giving it a shot.			"

I love it! sure there are issues and bugs, sure there is room for improvement, but it does what a golf game should; it provides beautiful courses with stunning back-drops for you to lose your mind and your balls. The character development is nice, the community is authentic, people from around the world will commiserate with you when you hook it into the water hazard. I have spent 6 hours at a time playing. I have made good friends. my game is no where close to where it should be! my caddie and me had a fling behind oswalds...5 stars all the way.

Conclusion:This is probably one of the best Golf games online that is free. Winning Putt keeps winning with great graphics and gameplay. With a couple of tweaks here and there this game could become really popular in a couple of months. Esports here we come.  "

												Mediocre golf MMORPG. Obviously using a pre-built MMORPG engine and made by people who speak no English. For some reason in our realistic-but-outdated Playstation 2 grade world, we have gold as currency, guilds instead of clubs, and enchantments? This game sends a lot of mixed messages and somehow even requires a fairly beefy PC to run due to how horribly unoptimized the game is.The actual golf play isn't terrible, but everything ELSE holds back the entire experience.On a personal note, I was in the closed beta a year or two ago when it was under the game ""Project Bluesky."" Absolutely NOTHING was fixed as the aforementioned problems are not new ones. Only added content and a new name/logo.			"

												Ok, I am going to breach the 'subject':  Here I am, standing in my panties trying to swing the iron.Sure, many of us have found ourselves in this very situation. Nearly bütt nak'd on a golf course, swining a slippery iron, being scolded that I ended up ''in the rough'', my stroke is ''fat'' and what now. Sure. But that I'm forced upon some teenage japanese pogostisk-jumping teenagers, who shamelessly flirts with me while I am trying to handle the wood and go for smooth strokes - well that's just outrageous.- The game's a good social passtime btw. I've struck up many new friendships, Seeing as we have the same taste in bikini & nuttbag, I mean golfbag./Dr. Mabuse, angrily gaming since the C64.PS:  On a less serious note....  Its a Great Game. Go get it! What more can I zay? Unless you want a die-hard golfsimulator (and in that case for Olaufs sake' go out and do the real thing then!!) then this one hits home. There's a tactitile feeling' about this game that unrivaled by other golf-games I've played. Graphics nice. Community is actually good - not the usual toxied teen w. their ""'I'm gonna get you"" in their whiny voice while mom yells in the background.. No, Helpful and Respectful. Enjoyed peaceful and cozy chat while we were going 18 rounds/or 9/6/2  4 players. Here you'r more likely to get complimented on your play or encouraged, by your opponents!You dont have to grind endlessly and I've not even had the hint yet that I should take my wallet out and buy something. If anything its nice that you have to play a bit - then you can upgrade - explore your new abilities or gear - then after a little while your awarded new thing and so on. Good On You developer. One of my favorite games of 2016 - and then its Free on top of it.			"

												Great fun.  Decent game engine and a few nice course designs (and some strange courses).If you can enjoy playing against yourself or against friends who don't spend loads of money on this then it is 100% possible to have a wonderful time without it costing you a penny.Randomisation as to whether it's a push or a pull when you don't hit the sweet spot (rather than predictable behaviour depending on which side you're on) brings an element of randomness into it that isn't there in, say, Tiger Woods - where you can shape your shots as you like.  With luck this will get changed in the future, but even if it doesn't this still has a decent feel to it.  Shots are taken with the tried and trusted three-click method (or two-click if you're putting) and it all works pretty well.Playing ""special"" shots uses up your stamina/mentality points which are regained between holes (but it's OK, you can buy them back with real money by getting energy drinks and giving them to your caddy to carry around - if you're not prepared to be careful planning when you use non-standard shots so as not to exhaust yourself) which is a limitation.  In the special shots category are things such as power shot to hit ten yards further, straight shot to narrow the error window, draw shot, fade shot, punch shot, backspin shot, and a few similar items.  You're limited in what you can use by a) which shots you've actually unlocked by improving your stats, and b) which shots you choose to equip before you start the round.  You only have a limited number of slots (more if you spend real money) much as you have a limited number of slots to carry extra equipment like stamina-replenishment items or longer range golfballs.Whether you feel the need to spend money to get fancy clothes and clubs, or to kit yourself out with snacks and energy drinks, will be a personal choice dependent upon what you're hoping to get out of the game and whether you want to be competitive in the global tour rankings.  The game is free to try though, and you'll be able to get many hours out of it without investing anything other than your time - which should leave you in a good position to decide whether this game is for you.  It's worth remember that you can turn the ridiculous ""commentator"" (and I use that label very loosely) off.  If you don't then you might end up starting to like it, which would be bad.If you enjoy golf then this is certainly worth a trial run.If you want a friendly round then give me a shout - you'll usually find me on channel 5 hanging out on the beach.

												I don't often wrtie reviews but in this case I felt like I should. This is a really well done game! If you golf, this is a great game that you'll enjoy. As with most F2P games, I was skeptical, but really turned out to be a great game. The mechanics are there and are as unforgiving as playing a real round. It IS graphics intensive but looks fantastic. Highly recommeded.  If you do play this game? One piece of advice....the TAB key is your friend.			"

Every time I click the launch button, it ""failed to initialize"". The FAQ support page is useless. I don't care about the high cost of platinum because the game is free and you don't need platinum to enjoy the game. It's only for people who have to have the best gear and the stupid costumes and other clothes. The character customization is only a big deal for people who absolutely have to have their character look a specific way. The randomizer is all you need. I no longer recommend this game since it works one day but the next it won't even launch. I haven't changed anything in my settings or programs. There's no reson it should fail to launch after I played almost 2 hours on the first day.			"

												Great little golf game.  As many folks have said, it is a lot like Hot Shots golf. The game look awesome.  Very easy to just pick up and play. To me it seems totally F2P at this point, but I am only to level 15.- Driving distances are very short to start, about 175 yards, which some of the holes very challenging, where you are almost playing for Bogey.- Putting is really fun with huge breaks. Much bigger than in say the PGA Tour/Tiger Woods games.- Old School 3 Button Clicks to hit the ball.- Fade, Draw, and Punch are special skills.- Power and Accuracy Players are the 2 classes right now, and they have distinct playing styles.Definitely worth at least checking out if you like golf games, especially if you like the old 3 Button Clicks which many games have gotten away from.

												I want to like this game, I reaaallly do.  I enjoyed my time in games like Shot Online, GolfStar and Pangya.But....I just can't.  While the game itself is just fine, its the payshop that makes it utterly absurd.  I don't mind dropping a few dollars here and there on a game that I happen to enjoy, but for just a 1 Month ""Premium"" Membership, they're expecting you to pay 50$.50$ for ONE MONTH.. Any F2P game out there that charges that is going to drive its player base into the ground very very fast.The cost for Cash Shop items is, overall, rather way to high.  They're the only items that provide any kind of boost to your stats at all, so someone thats just casually playing or playing for fun will never be able to compete at the higher levels of play.  Courses seemed designed to make you purchase these cash heavy items in order to be even remotely decent at them.  God Forbid you try one of the ""harder"" courses w/o realizing the need for any of these things.I guess this'll just be another Golf Game that I play for a few hours and then toss aside, which really saddens me, cause i've been looking for a good Golf Game to play online like these for awhile.  Too many company changes(Pangya) or just Overcharging Cash Shops or Underwhelming Communities.I guess I can't fault Bamco from trying, but I shoulda figured the moment I saw WebZen that it was going to be ludicrous.P.S. Disregard my 14+ Hours, I accidentally left the launcher running and Steam counted that as play time! (-o~_~)--O Steam O--(~_~-o)TL;DR Pay 2 Win w/absurd Prices ruins any quality play the game had going for it.			"

												Strange game. The 'players lobby' is full of goons who think that the user created female golfers are actual females gamers. They are not. So quit trying to chat them up you oddballs. Also lobby full of level 8000 players who must have spent a months house rent on power ups or whatever. Well done. Gameplay isn't great and the courses reward said level 8000 platers as most holes are 500 yards plus. As always, developers are maximising profits by rewarding those stupid enough to pay £10 for a virtual pair of golf shoes which make you hit further. Not an awful game, just doesn't really reward pure skill.			"

												This game is great; It's simple and doesn't require you to be a golf expert in order to play.  However, it needs  some optimization; It runs poorly on older cpus. Also I want to point out that this game apparently doesn't work at all under 32bits systems even though the game requirements says otherwise.			"

												This game is good and good fun. Yeah lots of big boobies but I have yet to see anyone run around in just underware. Pay to win? Yeah you can do that but I've won a couple of times and I haven't bought anything yet. So far no A-Holes either, which is unusual for most games. Advice. don't buy a lot of level upped clubs until you reach level 10. Maybe a driver and a 3 iron for the long shots out of the rough. Using power shots is not advised unless you can hit the middle of the accuracy gauge 90% of the time you use it. Take the accurate guy as your player unless you can do 80% or more in the middle of the gauge as well.I give it a 9/10, the only thing lacking is a way to fly the ball higher or lower.			"

												Fix the Swing Bar Lag-Jumping.......This is My main issue with this game!!!! If the Devs fix this problem 1st i promise you will have more good reveiws and people making purchases. As for the prices being too high to purchase stuff, yes i agree and the platnium thing should be completely taken out of the game,, just use gold whether its 1k gold or 1 mil gold. For example if i put in 2000 hrs into this game playing matches and saving my gold i say i should be able to buy the same club as someone that put in 10 hours playing the game but made a purchase of X amount, just saying ""reward your loyal players regardless if they make purchases"" I will say i have not spent anything on this game yet and wont till they fix the ""swing Bar Lag problem"" However when i do manage to not get a laggy game i can hold my own and do pretty dam well. Other than that its a great game offers multi player, chat window, graphics are not bad, and offers a challenge. On a scale 1- 10 i rate this game a 7 and would be an 8 if they fix the lag issue...However, i am giving a thumbs Down until the lag issue is fixed because IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. Fix the lag and i will give a thumbs up and rate at an 8....			"

												I played this game fairly thoroughly for the last couple weeks and got to level 20, and started using the level 20 clubs set.  I have just uninstalled for the simple reason that I found no actual fun factor.  I tried the f2p model and when playing for free, you do get given some basic equipment but you need to spend up big to improve your gears and for simple consumables that make the game easier to play.  Whether this actually makes the game 'fun' you will have to ask someone who pays.   There are a couple mechanics that have just made the fustration factor finally outweigh any sense of satisfaction.  To do the best shot you need to hit the sweet spot on the swing bar, which after level 20, and with a pretty good gaming computer, I can hit about once in 20.  This is really frustrating..  There are specialist skills which make very small changes to you swings/hits so you feel like there is nothing worth aiming for in terms of skill development.  If anyone played Pangya, I just want to compare its swing bar mechanic - in pangya if you clicked the swing bar at the power you want, and then realized you were long or short, you just let the swing bar go back to the start and you can try again.  Not so with winning putt, once you select power you are stuck with it.  This is really frustrating.  What makes it worse is that you can experience an accidentally 'double click' on the swing bar, which is a reported glitch and basically your click registers at the incorrect spot and so, since you can't just let it reset, you tank the shot and ruin the hole.  Some of the courses are nicely designed as you'd expect and then others are so monumentally stupid in design, that again, causes nothing but frustrating to a point where I got today and thought ' why am I putting myself through this.  Its just not fun.'  Why bother - well Im not.  Im done.  Good Luck if you choose you give this a go, for the early quick levelling levels say 1-15, its okay, but thats now worn off for me.			"

												This isn't the golf game you're looking for. Tutorial is fine, but once you get into a server (even by yourself) the shot bar is slightly jumpy and sporatic when it goes up and down. You need it to be smooth to get accurate power and distance, and the game punishes you pretty heavily if you slightly miss either. In my opinion this is a game breaking issue. Also, load times, why you so long for such simple graphics???			"

												At the beginning, I really liked this game.  I really did.  The graphics, for being free, are amazing.  This game is MUCH better than Golf With Friends. It really is like a golf MMO.However, that loveliness is short lived.  The difficulty ramp is just obsurd.  Plain and simple.  You're given Missions (quests if that term is more your flavor) and completing those helps ramp your skills up.  Which is great! And then you ""level up"" to being a Junior Pro.  And this is where the game just takes a nose dive to awful.The amount of courses you can play where you feel viable are sorely limited.  If you're sub level 20, then you're pretty much in 2 courses.  So if you're good with playing those 2 repeatedly, then you may enjoy the game.  I don't and I do not.  The words ""Very Easy"" are sort of a slap in the face because ALL courses can be labeled as ""Very Easy"" but their not.  You'd be lucky to escape each hole with a Bogey.  So you try again and again.  But the courses get harder and harder, the greens get steeper and tougher, WAY too quickly.  There is no easing into the higher end portions of this game.  Just a pure hard slap in the face and get ready to eat more bogeys than an Air Force Veteran...because that is all your diet will consist of.  The bonus of having power up items (""potions"") and enchanting, yes you heard me right, enchanting your clubs to get bonuses are great...until you realize how utterly useless each of them are. I wanted to like this game, but when I'm consistently getting bogey and double bogey unless I play 2 certain courses, then I'm out.  I'd ask for a refund if I paid anything towards this...which I haven't.This is Dark Souls + Golf Because Bandai Namco hates you all.3/10 for scenery alone.			"

												I agree with a high portion of the reviews for this game. The game is fun until you reach around level 18-20 then it's almost a necessity to spend money. The game itself is very basic requiring only 3 clicks to play but still can be a bit frustrating at times. The crowd seems to be culling more and more each day making finding 2's or 4's matches pretty difficult at times. If you don't mind spending cash in a free to play game then this game could be a good fit for you, but if you refuse to spend cash then you will get to a point in which advancing further seems impossible.

												It has a Sims Feel to it, but that's the only good part. They don't clarify enough exactly how to get a good shot, and my shots suck every time. HORRIBLE Game.			"

												I didn't like it.Thought the grafics were not up to par for 2016 . Ten years ago the game would have been good but not now! I see lots of talk in comments about Crysis and Cryengine but comparing this with Crysis, You would never even think it could be same engine. It heats up my processor like Crysis but thats about it..Lots of glitches. Lots of lag. Terrible optimization. Something as simple as turning your camera in town square and walking ten feet is even laggy. Not very realistic golf at all either. No wind. basic swing bar. Click two or three times and hit the ball. Pretty basic arcade stuff. After 4 hours i just found myself yawning and clicking like a zombie. Not even looking at the course or caring.. It lacks any kind of oooomph!Not bad for free but i certainly was not impressed enough to blow any cash on it in their cash shop that's for sure. Nor would recommend it to anyone unless mass improvements were made. In this state it is bland and boring!			"

												Free is hardly true. Otherwise the game is great for what it is. There is a few things it lacks in. Actual accuracy of your balls hit or rotation is often awful and super off kilt whch will leave you cussing and ashamed. If you want to be up there with the premium players you end up shelling out a lot of real cash. If you play for free and work your way up it's definitely a grinder MMO.Entertainment Value = 10/10: A lot of men make women chaacters which is a bit awkward on the eyes and chat box. Fairly entertaining as most will try and portray themselves poorly as a woman.A lot of people try and flirt but the censors make it amusing as well.You can say damn but not crap OR butt.Not sure where the Teen rating comes from. I think it's safe for everyone with the censors in place.  "

												where's the golf?!?!game looks nice and i even like the effects. started nicely, couldnt make any mistakes, this game is too easy.as soon as i became junior pro at lv10 it was a different game. i now had some boosts, some training and next set of clubs. as i played though i saw no difference in performance from boosts or training, granted it was only i couple steps up from start.  what you do need are drinks to replenish stamina or mentality almost ever hole or your performance drastically decreases. powershot? better chance at hitting bullseye on dart board, slightly off and wicked hook or slice. best not to use researched boosts.wind? green slope? toss up if you get the intended effect. same put different outcome all the time.  cant hit a fade or draw it needs to be researched. then when used drains the player which costs you drinks. make a mistake and take an extra shot or two, best drink or you will be adding more strokes.this is a golf game meant to be played with boosts, if you are not willing to spend the money dont bother. you can get by for awhile but eventually will hit a wall. for me that wall was lv 12, most will tell you lv20-25.

												This is a fun little game, but it is definitely a pay 2 win game... Although, if you absolutely don't see yourself being someone that participates in the ranked matches or anything, you can easily have some fun in this game with a couple of friends... If you're wanting to do something other than kill time though, this is not the game for you.I've played this game off and on since open beta, only since it hit steam though does it seem like the game doesn't want me to play it with constant server disconnects within minutes of starting... This is more than likely something to do with my internet or computer set up since it doesn't appear to be a big issue mentioned anywhere.			"

												Unless you are willing to dish out real money, dont bother with this game. Even in tournements they allow pay 2 win with cash shop items that improve your characters accuracy, range etc. same guy have won 80% of the tournements, guessing he spent a ton of cash for it. you can buy some for ingame gold which sucks to gain, most stuff need high amount of platinum= real money.Dont bother			"

												I like that it's free, thumbs up for that. I dislike all the enchanting faff and gimmicks. These just get in the way of an otherwise good golf game. I hate the ""stamina""  and ""mentality"" meters which often ruin an otherwise good round of golf. I hate that players with more money have better clubs which hit the ball further, and suffer less with stamina than newer players.There's so much tacky rubbish you must buy and mess around with, like hard boiled eggs, stamina drinks, training levels, golf bags with enough ""slots"" and endless other junk. It's like they weren't confident they had a good golf game so they added all this distracting junk which just makes it annoying. A lot of it is still confusing and I don't know what the purpose of it is. I also hate that you need to repair your clubs after every round. Yet with all these annoyances, I keep going back because playing online is still quite fun as you get better at playing. I will eventually get sick of the distractions though. I wish there was a version of this game where everyone had access to the same golf clubs, same everything, so it just came down to making a good shot.   "

												I like this game but my problem is somewhat different because i love companies with support systems and not leave you hanging. so this is the only reason i'm downvoting it.if you like games with support from the companies for there games i would avoid this game because it's bandai namco and there support systems sucks heck even when i go to there support site https://f2p-support.bandainamcoent.com/hc/en-us it just gives you ""helpful information"" > https://f2p-support.bandainamcoent.com/hc/en-us/categories/201134846 but when you try to join the support it doesn't have anything so you can't join.Also http://forums.winningputtgame.com/ just leads you to bandai namco support website.
