								The game is funny for the first 5 minutes, but then it becomes repetitive and boring, but it's okay, 'cause it's a pretty early version, and you can't expect much from an early access game... When it will be completed, i'll be able to say more... (Sorry for my bad English, im Italian :P)			"

Early Access Review
								So I expected a football (soccer for you Americans) game, where you can build some obstacles so your opponent can't score that easily. What I got was a football game, where I can just plant some stuff, place some NPCs (with a bad AI) und they are running around chasing the ball. There is a place with two goals, but it doesn't really matter if you or some of the AIs scores a goal. There is no sense in this game. I know it's in Early Access, but right now it is just a tech demo for an upcoming game, which MIGHT look and play good.

								The game doesn't really have a neat concept or anything like that, simply it's just futbol. Now, the game itself, IS HILARIOUS! It's fun to play with different settings on/off or just with a friend. It's just a playgroung for the physics of a future game, but still it's fun to play and that's all that really matters.			"
