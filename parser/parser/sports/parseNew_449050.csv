												Rock Paper Scissors Champion is a terrible game and even though it's free it's not even worth your time.This game is nothing more than a game of Rock Paper Scissors and not to mention the game is also quite mediocre in content.The story is that you are the Ex Rock Paper Scissors Champion and you have to beat three opponents to win back your fame. The game is incredibly easy to finish in 10 minutes and after that there's next to no replay value what so ever.The art style is horrendous and is one of the worst graphics I have ever seen. The game has a really cool intro song which I enjoyed ( Yes I honestly did) and that's all the good I can say about this game.While I had fun for a bit, the fun turned into frustration and even though it's free I highly suggest staying away from this game.Final Rating: 2/10 - Terrible If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about this review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

Bottom line: This game is terrible.Sure, it IS pretty difficult to make a game on python, but this art style is (pardon my language) absolute ♥♥♥♥ing dogshit.The music sounds like it's trying to parody ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MIDIs, and this game has absolutely no strategy since the start. Just the screenshots already disappointed me.HOW TO FIX THIS GAME INTO SOMETHING GOOD:For the love of Jesus Christ, PLEASE DON'T CODE YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IN PYTHON. Python is for scripts, NOT GAMES.Please don't use MIDI. (Or at least don't make it sound like MIDI)and make the game have some strategy, like you can see what they're about to throw first, which can work out for you but can also be used against you to trick you. AND NO, NOT IN THAT WAY YOU HAVE ALREADY IN THE GAME, THAT ONE SUCKS.Devs, consider this review something you should put in your mind if you ever make a sequel, or just attempt to fix this.			"

												Rock Paper Scissors Champion is an arcade game about the game Rock Paper Scissors. The intro is awful and the gameplay is as simple as it can be. The graphics are done in paint and the game is just very poorly done.There's nothing else to say about this game really. It's free, but I wouldn't suggest trying it out, I had to get 1 more minute on my time counter on Steam to post htis review, because I was already bored after 4 minutes of playing the game.			"

You get into the game and realize it's not the normal 2 out of 3 to win, but each win knocks down the opponents ""health"". You think to yourself, ""Why the hell would they do that?"". You play a little longer anyways, cause I mean you have the game, so just give it a little more of a shot. Not long afterwards you realize you really are just wasting your life away with the kind of decisions that brought you to playing this game for more than 10 seconds...

												Not being an American, I barely even know the rules to Rock Paper Scissors...and still managed to beat the first two of three ""opponents"" in ♥♥♥♥-all time simply by spamming my three possible options.  The third opponent kicked my♥♥♥♥♥ however, so I guess there might be some semblance of ""strategy"" in this game after all.  Shame that I couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed working out what that semblance might be.  Ugly graphics, ugly sound effects, and virtually non-existent gameplay.  The musical soundtrack, however, is sheer and utter GENIUS.  Shame this isn't an album, I could actually give it a thumbs-up...    Oh, and to all you people who thought that What's Under Your Blanket!? was a new low in gaming, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.  At least that game was entertaining for ten minutes or so.  This one barely makes it to the one minute mark.  An insult even at the low, low price of FREE.      Verdict: 1/10.			"

												Are you sick and tired of all those enjoyable, great games you have in your Steam library? Are you looking for a game that not only bores you half to death but also shortens your life span each time you play it? Well look no further than virtual rock, paper, scissors. Have you reached your limit of struggling to make that pesky fist, or laying your hand flat above a surface, or even holding up those 2 fingers at the same time? Now you can left click on your mouse and get the same type of mind-numbing, tiresome, monotonous, and overall lack of pleasure right from the comfort of your own home.On top of all that, you don't even need to communicate with another person. Yes, that's right! You can now play a game intended for 2 or more people all by yourself. Perfect for those lonesome nights in your Mom's basement. What are you waiting for? The faster you install this game, the faster you get the absolute satisfaction of uninstalling.			"

												RNG. The game.Pros:- just click randomly and you might win- can take from 2 minutes up to 300 years to complete- i like the trick they made with little ""story"" when you beat all 3 oponents so it kinda makes sense when you play again- there are combos when you pick same 3 choices in row..Dont take these pros seriously, this looks like a flash game from 2004 on random online minigame siteThis game could acctualy be decent idea if it had online multiplayer with ladders and competitive tournaments. You could add coins you earn to buy clothes or different animations or something idk...Cons:- its rng- no replayability- will make you think what you are doing with your life- everything is drawn in paint- if you play this game more than 1 time you should reconsider your life choices- people are acctualy playing this "

												Rock Paper Scissors Champion is a free game about playing Rock Paper Scissors against 3 masters of the game. It worked, played ok, looked ok, sounded ok.  Interesting to add a combo power when you throw 3 of the same hand, i just wished the paper power would last more than 1 move( like 3 moves).  Has original theme music and sounds, (horrible as it sounded).   Artwork looked like a child did it.  I was under the impression that each master will throw their favorite sign the most during the match but i am not sure.  I still lost to Rocky and have not pulled off a win of the whole match.  So the game is challenging if you don't know the secret to playing this game.  The music volume is in the Preferences at the start page, (you have to suffer through the theme song before you find it.) Try it, if you like indie games.For more info:Greelight review

												That didn't last long...Welcome to the ultimate guessing game...oh screw it.  That's all it is.  RPS with horrible graphics, an awful soundtrack, and no soul.  It's as though this title was designed for the sole purpose of p*ssing people off.There's something about combos should you guess a certain number of things right in a row...but it's still guessing.  And no, I couldn't defeat the first guy...why do RPS championships even exist?  (Japan actually sees it as a passion and a skill...don't believe me?  See the following video:)

			In the weird but fun file. This is something: In Japan they have a kind of ""sing off"" where people use paper rock scissors to determine who will make up a band and debut a Singing CD/Album.

SHREK                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the                          jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's                          quite good on toast.                                      MAN1                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!                          (waves the torch at Shrek.)                Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The                men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long                and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the                men are in the dark.                                      SHREK                         This is the part where you run away.                          (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.)                          And stay out!

Fairy tale creatures.""(He sighs and                          throws the paper over his shoulder.)                 THE NEXT DAY               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard                sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures                to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line                are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto                who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three                little pigs.                                      GUARD                         All right. This one's full. Take it                          away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!

Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up                to the table.                                      HEAD GUARD                         Next! What have you got?                                     OLD WOMAN                         Well, I've got a talking donkey.                                     HEAD GUARD                         Right.

Donkey just looks up at her.                                     HEAD GUARD                         Well?                                     OLD WOMAN                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little                          nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox.                          Talk, you boneheaded dolt...                                      HEAD GUARD                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

I'm the talkingest damn thing                          you ever saw.

The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One                of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's                hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled                with fairy dust and he's able to fly.                                      DONKEY                         Hey! I can fly!

												I was browsing through steam's free to play games when I discovered this gem. I downloaded it (55 mb, literally 5 seconds) and fired it up. I could not have been more pleasantly surprised with a game in my life. There is so much variety in the gameplay, you encounter new things around every corner (don't be fooled, there's no actual movement in the game). Rocky's move set was especially hard to decipher but I finally beat him and stormed through the rest all night (okay maybe not all night, maybe 10 minutes). The reward at the end is truely incredible and satisfying. A brilliant end to a brilliant game. The game's narrative was exciting and enthralling leaving me wanting for more. I cannot wait for the sequel or DLC (preferably both).ITS TRASH, ONLY GOOD FOR THE SOUNDTRACK			"

												SO simple and stupid. The first one uses rock a lot. The second sometimes plays the item to defeat the item you previously used. And the final one is sort of random, but I one-shotted it. BUT WHY DO YOU CARE? YOU CAN JUST SPAM ONE ITEM AND YOU'LL PROBABLY WIN! You'll have fun with this game for the for the amount of time it takes to download, as you'll be happy it took no time to download. That is shortly followed by dissapointment as you PLAY the game.

												God, where do I begin. This game is a masterpiece from head to toe. First was the intro, a beautifully crafted song and music piece that the likes of Beethoven could only dream of. Next, was the plot. Never have I seen a more complex yet amazing plot, filled with twists and turns from the beginning to the end. The characters were very deep and I was involved with them within moments. The gameplay was an amazing system I have never seen before, with so many different options of play it was amazing. The graphics are beyond next-gen, like something you may see on the Playstation 6 if you're lucky. The soundtrack and sound design are possibly the lowest point, yet they would still get an easy 8/10. But overall, this was a beautiful game that I don't think any could parallel it for generations, and it was an amazing emotional trip for me as well. I was crying, laughing, mad, concerned, surprised, none of my emotions went untouched. And to think, all of this for free. Amazing. Would I recommend this game? To anyone with an IQ above -7, I say hell yes. Do it, or your life will not be complete.			"

												If i had a game like thisI would publish it on newgrounds  or some other website that accepts flash games and  not  Steam.Track wasn't good or bad but rather decent.I didn't play that much since i got tired of guessing and failed to beat rocky multiple times.It would be fun if it wasn't RPS.Game wasn't bad overall but i cannot reccomend this. Afterword:Games based off hide and seek are better.			"

												The Annual Lazytown Spring Smash Potluck was tomorrow or so Robbie had been informed. It was something of an explanation to how Robbie had ended up here in his life, walking along with Sportacus with bags of groceries. He didn't understand it but it was an explanation.To begin with, Sportacus was not particularly good at walking alongside someone while carrying groceries. Point of fact he wasn't particularly good at carrying groceries at all. In order to flippity flippity flop around town, he needed his hands free, and that left Robbie trailing along behind him, lugging cloth grocery bags loaded with supplies.This is what Robbie's life had been reduced to; carrying someone else's groceries. Strike that, carrying someone else's groceries and listening to that person explain what they were going to do with them. Some sort of fruit salad, Robbie had gathered, not that he was about to ask.""…of course you don't have to eat it, but maybe you could try it? I think you'll like it, maybe, and…""Groceries. Sports candy. All in the bags, along with one small cake, delicately frosted in white and purple icing, for him alone. Although knowing the local brats Robbie was likely to be suckered into sharing at least some of it. That blond kid was particularly good at sorrowful, pleading eyes when it came to sweets.Sportacus jogged back to him, still rambling on about what he was going to mangle his fruits into for the potluck and utterly unbothered that Robbie only grunted in reply. ""…and I was thinking about making those little sandwiches, the kids like them last time…""He'd never have done this before, Robbie thought sourly. He'd never even been to The Annual Lazytown Spring Smash Potluck; he'd always managed to sleep through the blasted thing. How was it Sportacus always managed to get him to do things like this?Shopping for fruits and veg, no, get it right, shopping for sports candy, going along with Sportacus for potlucks, for crying out loud. Worse, they were going back to Robbie's bunker with all of it and Robbie wasn't even entirely sure why. Yes, yes, he had some kitchen space cleared out now, one section of his counter marked off with masking tape that meant none of his machine parts were allowed to enter the sterile area. And yes, he had somehow grown a collection of knifes and utensils and bowls; the blasted things seemed to have sprouted from nowhere and now they lived in the masking tape zone.It still seemed like it would be easier to make whatever it was Sportacus was babbling about in his airship, but that would mean Robbie would have to climb up a ladder carrying bags and that was a level of no that couldn't be properly expressed in words.At his bunker, Robbie set down the bags with a sigh, only half-listening to Sportacus yammering on about fruit salad and sandwiches and whatever else was flittering through his mind.Why did he do these things for Sportacus, Robbie wondered idly. It made Sportacus happy, true, but…it made Sportacus happy. Something about that clicked in Robbie's head, like a faulty gear suddenly snapping back into place. It made him happy, it delighted him when Robbie did things with him. Shopping for his sports candy, going to the Annual Lazytown Spring Smash Potluck, tinkering around with small inventions in the park while half-watching Sportacus playing with the children. It made Sportacus happy and when he smiled at Robbie, it felt like…it felt…well. Sportacus being happy made Robbie happy.Realization came with the force of a smack between the eyes. Sportacus was humming to himself, sorting through the bags and making neat piles out of the fruit and he was here in Robbie's bunker doing this because Robbie wanted him here.""Sportacus, I think I'm in love with you,"" Robbie blurted and he couldn't have held the words back with both hands.""Hmm? Oh, thank you. I love you, too,"" Sportacus said absently, studying the row of bundled vegetables and fruit as though he were planning out a schematic of health. Probably he was.That...was not the right reaction. Robbie blinked at him, mouth agape, and then demanded, ""Didn't you hear me? I said I love you.""Sportacus glanced at him, ""Yes, of course I heard you. I said thank you, didn't I? And I love you, too.""Robbie stared. ""But--""""Don't tell me you're only just realizing this now. We've been going out for weeks."" Sportacus turned to look fully at him, setting the loaf of organic stone-ground wheat bread aside.Robbie straightened instantly, looking down his nose at Sportacus who had the audacity to look amused. ""Of course not!"" Robbie scoffed, ""I just realized I hadn't said it out loud.""Sportacus's smile gentled. He rose up on his toes and pressed a light kiss to Robbie's mouth, hardly more than a peck. ""Of course you have. I always hear I love you when you're speaking."" He turned back to the splayed vegetation. ""Now, do you want to help me slice these or did you have a project you wanted to work on?""""I…"" Robbie faltered. He did have a project he could be working on and he was making a new outfit for the potluck because there was no point in attending an event if you weren't prepared to dress for it. Sportacus was already peeling the bananas, slicing them into even chunks as if it didn't matter to him in the least what Robbie chose…and why would it. Apparently, he knew how everyone in the room felt before even they did.""I can slice them."" Robbie washed his hands before gingerly taking the little green carton of strawberries. His slices weren't as even as Sportacus and sometimes he got little pieces of the leaf in it but he managed the entire carton.Sportacus smiled at him, soft and sweet, when Robbie handed over his uneven strawberry chunks and added them to the bowl. ""Thank you, Robbie, these are perfect.""Not perfect, not at all, but Sportacus was still smiling, humming to himself, and he didn't so much as glance up when Robbie started slicing the grapes to add to the bowl. They were making fruit salad together and tomorrow they would be at the Annual Lazytown Spring Smash Potluck together and it would be everything that Robbie dreaded it would be. And everything he hoped it would be.Maybe, just maybe, he could hear 'I love you' when Sportacus spoke, too.			"

												You and your sisters are running a Puppy Rescue Center. Each has a responsibility. Barbie is in charge of doing the actual recue of each puppy in the neighborhood on her bike. You play as her and you get a set of objectives that must be completed. As you progress you play as all the sisters as you work on the objectives in order to get the puppy adopted out.General GameplayYou get a phone call on your cell phone and this is how each rescue begins! Eventually you get a map of the town. You are suppose to get on your bike and follow the arrow which guides you roughly where to go. Keep in mind that sometimes it points to an area that you can't ride your bike into. Once you find the puppy you must sometimes are required to lure the puppy to you by watching for what the puppy needs on screen.Rescue CenterOnce you are able to pick up the puppy you bring it back to the rescue center. (You then play as Skipper; Barbies sister) The first thing you have to do is check for a microchip using the scanner, (all this is automatic) if there is none you will be prompted to name the puppy yourself. After that you play minigames including removing fleas in which you get rewarded with 10 bones. Finally the puppy is sent to 1 of 3 kennels, eventually being able to earn 2 more at 400 bones each. Kennel#6 will cost 500 bones!Rescue Center- KennelOnce the puppy is in the kennel there are a series of objectives you must complete. An Example would be training the puppy in a quick time event. In this event for example you are told which buttons you press at what time in order to perform the requested performance in that course event.The puppy needs to be 100% rested before you can move onto the next objective. The last of the objectives is getting the puppy adopted. Gameplay: Breakdown The 6 objectives in order are: Note you do 1 in each only and are random for each puppy!#1: Finding the puppy by going through the town. An example of a place the puppy can be is a construction zone.#2: Returning to the shelter with puppy OR sometimes you will be prompted with(Puppy Rescue) Earn Trust: You must Coaz the puppy to come out of hiding.Puppy Rescue- Earn Trust A Screenshot of Barbie and Her Sisters Puppy RescueBy: (♥) Pink Lily#3: (Puppy Treatment) Vaccination / Remove Fleas Puppy Treatment- Remove Fleas A Screenshot of Barbie and Her Sisters Puppy RescueBy: (♥) Pink LilyNote: You play as skipper in puppy treatment.#4: (Puppy Training) Agility Training / ObedienceNote: You play as Stacie in Puppy Training.#5: (Puppy Grooming) Bath / Clip Nails / Brush TeethPuppy Grooming- Clip Nails A Screenshot of Barbie and Her Sisters Puppy RescueBy: (♥) Pink LilyNote: You play as Chelsea in grooming the puppies.#6: (Puppy Adoption) Graduation.

AdoptionOnce the puppies are adopted you have to find them an owner by looking at people and their compatibility applications at the kennel, being the last step. You have to look at the applicationsto see if they match someone on the list. The game will tell you if they are or not. The person is than called to come meet their new puppy. Some of the breeds found in game are: Shiba Inus, Labradors, beagles, huskeys, DalmationsCons- These are based on my experience Downsides of the game are that there are that you have to figure out things on your own, the controls are awkward, the camera controls could be better. The game does not tell you what to do with the puppy when you first get one. Pros- The game is cute and loads of puppies to rescue! Once you get past the cons you begin to really enjoy the game. It kinda reminds me of the sims game in the sense of the environment which I found neat. I also think this is a really good game for achievement Hunters! The game should not prove to be that difficult to get 100% for those interested in such task. Recommendations: Don't lose your bike when in search for the puppy. You will be auto returned once you found the puppy only not if you lose it before.Don't spend a lot in upgrading your kenel since you will lose all upgrades once puppy is adopted.Update: They recently added cards! You know what this means? Barbie cards, emoticon and backgrounds!!! @_@! GOTY			"

The game is centered around our hero Champ. After being defeated by villians Rocky, Randy, and Ripley, Champ suddenly realizes that.......this game is a complete sack of dung.

WHY IS THE GAME SO SHORT?Now that the questions are out of the way here's my formal review of ""Rock Paper Scissors Champion""Pros:-Hey, At least it isn't Sonic '06-There really arent any pros?Cons:-Why isn't it Sonic '06.-Imbalanced Gameplay-Game is really short,beat game in 16 minutes-Characters are unlikeable and badly designed-Game has no effort and looks like a baby who emerged from the womb 10 minutes ago made the game.-Game gave me Terminal Cancer-Game made me want to join ISIS-Rock is overpowed-Paper is overpowered-Scissors is overpowered-""No winner"" results in mutual health depletion; That's kinda stupid-Actually this whole game is kinda stupidNow if you excuse me, I'll be performing a satanic curse ritual on Rocky, that smug imcompetent,egotistacal,arrogant,cowardly misearable excuse for an opponent In short I rate this game Bleach/10                                                         Goodbye from your friend,                                                                                              -Cygmatic			"

												Just the best rock paper scissor simulator I have ever played. It really shines out from those knock off chinese ones.

NO more pesky button combos, no more frantic fights to the death, just mash the rock button in 2016's most epic fighter.

												Eye opening game that everyone should be obligated to try. If there is one thing ""Rock Paper Scissors Champion"" know It's the art of story telling. We are introduced to a wide array of interessting characters who all have very divese and complex personas that all develop over the course of the game. The game's story handle many topics at once such as death within the family and living with clynical depression and the story hinges on how theese characters handle each situation but most importantly how they change and who they become once these intrigues are over. I have learned much about myself while playing this game and I can honestly say It have changed me as well. It showed me how I excersise prejudice towards other people. For example at the start of the game when we meet Rocky, who I asmued would play Rock every single turn, however I soon found out that he just like me changes my strategy according to the situation given at hand. This theme however changes depending on who it is that plays and how one chooses to interpit the message. I would recommend anyone who likes personality driven games to play ""Rock Paper Scissors Champion"" for it's in my opinion the greatest persona driven game on the marked right now.

												        Rock Paper Scissors Champion was one of the best games I've ever played. This was by far the most fun I've ever had on the computer, much less steam, hands down. No questions asked, would strongly reccommend to anybody old and young alike, this is a truly iconic game anybody can enjoy by themselves, not requiring other people to love and cherish. You can throw all of your time into this game and be completely addicted for hours, there is truly no limit to this game. The DLC is very, very worth it and should also be downloaded and purchased. This is the best game I've ever played and if you don't play it, you obviously wasted your time downloading steam.			"

												I guess this got Greenlit, but I am not really sure what the point was.I understand aiming at ""deliberately crap for humor"" but they landed on ""deliberately crap and not funny.""Like, playing Rock Paper Scissors is only marginally insteresting when it is for deciding who has to pay for pizza, and entire game of it is just annoying.

												This game, honestly, is the best game I have ever played. The intro song really got my spirits up for the game, and for good reason. The lyrics sound very thought through and the beat was very catchy. The plot of the game is a very touching one, indeed. You were a great champion of a great league, just to be taken down, but you retake your place as king. I have never seen a better plot, and I don't think I ever will. Thank you for this masterpiece.			"

												""Life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't really soften the bad things, but likewise the bad things don't really ruin the good things."" -The doctorSadly, ths game doesen't HAVE a pile of good things.No, seriously, this game does not have ONE good thing going for it. At all. The gameplay is cut dry with no variety, the bots don't even need PaperThinMind to predict your next move (nine times out of ten i think that when i input my move he reads it and THEN decides.), And the graphics are terrible.  And before i hear b!tching about how it's ""On purpose"" and how i ""Shoulden't unsilt other's design choices"", the art is terrible, on purpose or not. Get over it.And the dev (it better be only one, what with the quality level) knows this! There's no feature list! It's just a thing telling you how to play their trashy song. And it doesen't even do the whol song!! Like, what the hell is this?And don't even get my started on the cliches!Let me count them.1. you wear an eyepatch2. you're missing a tooth (how the hell did he need these from losing in the RPS championship?!)3. Rocky. FREAKING ROCKY. This charecter is a walking cliche. It's probably obvious.4. Randy. Guess what? He's freaking stupid! (the cliche is that randy is an overused stupid person name. Like seriously, who names thei chid RANDY?)5. Ripley. The one girl in the group, and she's the one that is prideful. She's not even participating in the fight, shes just looking at that stupid mirror.6. Game has its own theme song.7 ""you're here to reclaim what's yours"" cliche is cliche cliche. (did that make sense?)8.  Only eight people(all of whom are generic spectators) showed up to this stupid event. Probably the parents of all these kids.9. Climbing the ladder of championship cliche.10. Combos. The mere existanse of them.11. The twin blade combo has a massive explosion after it. Even though it was only one extra attack, AND it probably didn't even land because you've set up a pattern and the bot knows you're going for a combo.12. Rocks. Defense. Cliche. I am embarrased to have tainted my library with this abomination of a game.The pixes that displayed it have all sent apologies for displaying such an atrocity. (i know that doesen't make sense get over it.)The very bits that held the code of ths game have committed suicide over being used for this freak of gaming.Seriously, there is nothing here for you.Do not get this game.UPDATE:The computer i downloaded this on stopped working abruptly with no explanation.I have reason to believe it commited suicide because i forgot to uninstall this game.

												Janken, (Rock-Paper-Scissors for you Gaijins) is a competition that demands the utmost of determination and skill. Hosting endless layers of mindgames upon mindgames behind its deceivingly simple ruleset, it is not an activity to be partaken by the simple-minded. So imagine my surprise and delight when I would find such a game to be offered on a non-Japanese service such as Steam.Unlike in countries with inferior cultures (take the United States for example with its barbarous sports like Football and Rugby where those primitive apes thoughtlessly throw themselves at each other. I imagine it is due to the resulting brain damage that the East has evolved to be more intelligent than the West), where it is treated as a mere children’s game, Janken is an artform in Japan, as obvious as it should be through the likes of manga such as ""Kaiji""and ""Liar Game"" (Ignore the simpletons that recommend you to simply “watch the anime”. Their brains, likely atrophied by years of Transformers and Superhero flicks, cannot comprehend that absorbing both is integral to the artists’ intended experience).In fact, I think the only thing that would make this game better is if it were made by the Japanese. They would take it a step beyond what the Western developers have created by tailoring a deep and intricately woven backstory for each character. The main character would be brooding and mysterious, if only due to his troubled past which will be revealed over the course of the campaign. Rocky would have had a rough childhood, having been teased all his life for his genetic deformity caused by the accident that lost him both of his parents. Randy would have grown up in the slums, and would have slowly risen to the top through sheer will and determination. And of course the girl would have been a childhood friend of the main character who made a promise to one day marry him. With such modifications, the game could possibly exceed “G-senjou no Maou - The Devil on G-String” as the greatest game on Steam (a nod to my fellow G-senjou no Maou enthusiasts), but I digress.I have seen several criticisms of the game containing only a single player campaign. These cancerous philistines are everything wrong with the state of Western gaming. A multiplayer experience cannot provide the tempestuous rollercoaster of emotional highs and lows that a precariously crafted single-player game can. I am immensely grateful that the Japanese industry does not so easily succumb to the demands of the degenerate masses and refuses to arbitrarily add multiplayer into games that clearly don’t need it.In either case, the developers at Wholetone Games have proven themselves sufficiently competent by expertly building upon the existing Janken formula (a task I previously thought impossible). Through careful placement of strategic combo moves, players have to put infinitely more thought into their turn (a concept that may be difficult for our Western counterparts to comprehend). With its near-perfect composition of intellectual stimulation and emotional depth, I wholeheartedly recommend Ｊａｎｋｅｎ　ｃｈａｎｐｉｏｎ (Rock Paper Scissors Champion) to all lovers of high-quality entertainment.Addendum: please offer a Japanese version of the opening theme			"

												I must say I was skeptical when downloading that game.I was searching for some game that was cheap or even free, which wasn't a big killer for my disc space and I came across this amazing game.The story:You are playing as the protagonist, the former Rock Paper Scissor champion and you must fight your way back to the throne. On your way, you must beat various strategic geniuses.The Gameplay:You are playing a game called ""Rock Paper Scissors"" to regain your title as champion.Rock-paper-scissors is a zero-sum hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are ""rock"" (a simple fist), ""paper"" (a flat hand), and ""scissors"" (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). The game has only three possible outcomes other than a tie: a player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors (""rock crushes scissors"") but will lose to one who has played paper (""paper covers rock""); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (""scissors cut paper""). If both players throw the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.There is also some special combo moves you can do to higher your chances of winning.My conclusion:After hours of playing, I can gladly recommend this game to all of my friends and family and I think everyone should have tried it at least once. The OST is also worth buying, since the soundtrack is very well put together.			"

The story is tremendous, the gameplay is excellent, the characters are wonderful, the graphics are just divine. I seriously can't believe that this game is free, and we are so lucky to have such a wonderful and excellent game that everybody can enjoy. Best game on Steam, best game ever created.10/10			"

I used the rest of my time (4 minutes about) to put hotdogs in the microwave, take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ wash my hands, and then eat the hot-dogs at their most optimal temperature. If your goal is to find something to do while you wait on hotdogs to become perfectly edible, and or you have to take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is the game of you.			"

												According to all known lawsof aviation, there is no way a beeshould be able to fly. Its wings are too small to getits fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't carewhat humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry?- Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening?- I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your fatherpaid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate.We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz.- Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.- Bye! Barry, I told you,stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam.- Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel?- A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I tooka day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry.- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie?- Yeah. - You going to the funeral?- No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.Such a hothead. I guess he could havejust gotten out of the way. I love this incorporatingan amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men.- We are! - Bee-men.- Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oitygraduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your careerat Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennasinside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?- A little scary. Welcome to Honex,a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee,have worked your whole life to get to the point where youcan work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant PollenJocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected,scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctivegolden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot.- She's my cousin! - She is?- Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right.- At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspectof bee existence. These bees are stress-testinga new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes?- Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement,the Krelman. - What does that do?- Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs aresmall ones. But bees know that every small job,if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the jobyou pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life?I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees,as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?""How can you say that? One job forever?That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only haveto make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could theynever have told us that? Why would you question anything?We're bees. We're the most perfectlyfunctioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe thingswork a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you knowwhat I'm talking about. Please clear the gate.Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!- Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's likeoutside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks!- Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters!You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were.- I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knowswhere, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a PollenJock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollenthan you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol.Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing itand the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies?Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys.- Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerousbeing a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned meagainst a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat,and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my!- I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today,wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patchsix miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh?- Barry! A puddle jump for us,but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am.- You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy?Are you bee enough? I might be. It all dependson what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices.- But you only get one. Do you ever get boreddoing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you justmove it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm.It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad,the more I think about it, maybe the honey fieldjust isn't right for me. You were thinking of what,making balloon animals? That's a bad jobfor a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not surehe wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes.- I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're goinginto honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer?- No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now.I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Geta gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today!- Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobswill be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available?- Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations!Step to the side. - What'd you get?- Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first?- No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open,not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman?- Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See?He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up.Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling			"

												The trailer and screenshots absolutely do an injustice to this masterpiece. Never have I witnessed a work of art as entertaining as this video game. The plot is an emotional rollercoaster from beginning to end. Without spoiling any important plot points, you play as an ex-rock paper scissors champion who has fallen from glory. After winning countless championships, the champ feels hollow on the inside, resorting to fruitiously spending his victory money on high-class drugs and expensive alcohol. The champ falls further and further down the hole known as substance abuse until eventually, our hero loses his wife and two children in a car accident. The champ feels truly worthless at this point, quitting rock paper scissors tournaments and losing his home. Homeless, wifeless, childless, and broken, the champ decides to enlist in the military. After a four year term in the middle-east, the champ learns first-hand the atrocities of war. Ashamed of the horrors he committed by the orders of his commanding officer, the champ comes back to America to rekindle his relationship with the last thing he holds dear to his heart, rock paper scissors. The champ must face opposition and hardships no man before him has faced, all in the name of rock paper scissors. It is time for the champ to reclaim his throne. Truly a diamond in the ruff. 10/10, a masterpiece.			"

												I think this game truly embodies the problems with the rock paper scissors metagame. Paper and Scissors are just too weak compared to rock. Paper only guarantees you a win on the next round while scissors adds on a single point to your score and it can be completely countered by rock's invincibility. Too many tournaments are ruined by brainless idiot scrubs spamming rock and getting away with it. I still rage quit in rock paper scissors and always will as long as rock spamming and StoneWall exists. #GetThatRockBanned			"

												This game is, in two words, utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ Despite being completely free, it costs too much. I almost wish it did cost something so I could be more upset about it, but if it did I probably would have gone insane and murdered several people by now. 10/10, would recommend downloading before it's inevetably removed from steam.

												I've actually enjoyed playing this game. I know that making a rock paper scissors video game sounds stupid, but I think what makes it work is that the game isn't trying to take itself seriously. Everything about the game is stupid, from the theme song, to the plot, all the way to the gameplay itself. Rock Paper Scissors Champion starts out with a ridiculous theme song that pretty much explains the plot of the game with singing that sounds like they hired Robot Jones to sing the theme song. The intro looks and sounds like it was from a TV commercial that Mordecai and Rigby would watch in an episode of Regular Show. Honestly this whole game seems like a Regular Show episode, which is probably why I see such a normal thing to go weird be funny. I think another reason why I enjoyed this game is because it reminds of the random web browser games I played when I was a kid. Honestly, I would recommend giving this game a try, before giving a final verdict on it since the game is free with no microstransactions or anything. I understand that people will strongly disagree with me, but the review is based on my personal opinion and experience, so they have a right to disagree if they're opinion of the game is different.

To be fair, I had already made a descion by minute 3 but I had to leave it running because of the minimum for the review. It was a nice attempt at making RPS into a game but it was really boring.

												(English)Honestly, the games I've seen. It's just a slap in the face to the gaming community, accompanied by the terrible farting music that howl developed the game, interspersed with spread graphics and mrazota characters. Gameplay is full random, then there are no tactics in the game. At all. This game is to stick the 3 buttons, in the hope that you will win. Only after the victory, no reward, and another a mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ character, which differs from the previous only in appearance. And Yes, in game 3 of the enemy. Their win and the game ends. All! I was able to stand only 11 minutes of this hell. 1/10(Русский)Честно говоря, в игры я не видел. Это просто плевок в лицо игровому сообществу, сопровождающаяся ужасным пердеж музыку, вой разработал игру, вперемешку с графикой и мразота персонажей. Геймплей полный рандом, то нет тактики в игре. На всех. Эта игра для того чтобы вставить 3 кнопки, в надежде, что вы выиграете. Только после победы, ни награды, и другой умственно отсталый персонаж, который отличается от предыдущего только внешним видом. И да, в игре 3 противника. Их выигрыш и игра заканчивается. Все!

												I now hate this game for many poings. - Hearing loss - Absoloute Cancer - WHO WOULD EVEN WANT TO BUY THE SOUNDTRACK!!! ARE YOU INSANE!!!!  The intro in the first place, I take sympathy to others who ♥♥♥♥♥ headphones, It was litteraly about to blow my ear drums out. The Volume was obsurdly loud, and it sounded like a 20 year old with no life sang it. You want to kill someone dont shoot them make them listen to this for an hour, garunteed death within 15 minutes.  Secondly, the game is absoloutly insane to beat, you have to win against the NPC's which is impossible! The graphics are  terrible.  Also who is going to waste 1 dollar for the soundtrack!			"

												This is the most cringy game I have ever played! The game starts out with the most cringy theme song pretty much ever that seems to try to spell out the backstory of the game. Then you play rock paper scissors against the various villans in the game to attempt to become the champion in the game. You can also perform combos of moves, which give you temporary abilities, likc shooting fireballs, but other than that, it's unfortuniately not very fun. It's only thirty to fourth MB of space, though, so if you have, like, a few minutes of free time, you could completely waste it with this game. Otherwise, I wouldn't. Thanks for reading my review, and I hope I could help. Have a mira day, and God bless you!			"

												""Rock Paper Scissors CHAMPIONNNN!""I have heard those words before.Hope imposed from the title, I wondered if this could be the RPS simulation all the pros had been waiting for. Sadly.... this is NOT the case. I seriously regret telling my local RPS club I would look into this software (I scoff at the thought this could ""teach"" an aspiring athlete). Simply, the core gameplay is plagued, one could not count the issues. Yes, even with the extra fingers of a siamese twin.Most notable is this shovelware's lazy reliance on RNG, not unlike many lowly RPS sims. If the devs stopped there it could pass as a free (albeit ugly) timewaster, but ASSwHOLEtone GAYmes decide to trash a classic with some ""modern"" additions. I simply cannot fathom why they decided on ommiting a ""classic"" mode without the ""Streaks"", ""Score"" or Health Bars.Much has already been said about this title's aesthetic. I personally like the look (I'm no graphic design designer by any means). I even thought the song was catchy. However, not one RPS enthusiast I showed this to could hold in any vomit.""Rock Paper Scissors '''''''Champion'''''''''"" lacks, like a corpse without a coffin.You will find no simple AI assessing moves, nor making a typical guess (Noob? Beat them at the start with paper).In case you didn't know, pro players spend hours upon hours honing their knowledge of ""tells"". Nowhere in this game will you see anything of the sort. Hear me out plebs, this is important:Thumb positioning in the pre-game fist could be a giveaway for rock. (If my suggestions are taken onboard, keep this to the easy difficulty, anyone in a legit ""championship"" knows (some may even bluff/double bluff a new facewith it).The animations could be given more frames, and hint to the moves early on, this allows a predictive counter, providing one can  move milliseconds late. The current control scheme is set out much too rigid for anything of the sort, which is a pity. I have seen many people bluff rock, only to snap out two scissorblades of fingers (a semi legal, but respectable technique).""Rock Paper Scissors"" is much more like a duel in a Western than this game's casual clicking. You will find no depth or redeeming value here, what I have witnessed deserves a fetid 0/10However, I will be analysing the game in the further weeks. Current scorn aside, this abomination could be quite purposeful in some sly ""modern art"", a topic to which I hold much enthusiasm. I can imagine it's context for satire of our society post Hilary Clinton's inauguration. Therefore, I will be scanning this game for twists, hidden messages, or alternate endings.This review will be updated should the onion have more layers. Cutting deeper I just leak tears of dissapointment, but I want to prove or disprove any improvement. Maybe this is like the tasty fried onion in a hotdog. God forbid I bite this onion raw.Adieu			"
