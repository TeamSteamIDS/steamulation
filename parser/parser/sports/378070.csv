Early Access Review
								Having put many hours into the alpha and beta builds pre-steam, my overall impression is a good one. Pros:	+ The game is tons of fun. Seriously, if you've ever messed around in a Spiderman game, or just wanted a sort of parkour type arcade game, this game is so for you.+ Maps are large, expansive, and varried. There's tons of challenges to do, leaderboards to challenge others on, and hidden collectables. It harkens back to an older feeling generation of games. + Tall skill ceiling, but very satisftying to learn. You will struggle at first, but there is always noticable improvement. And there is also always room to improve.+ Feels as good, if not better on mouse and keyboard as on controller, so don't feel as if you need a controller.+ Game just plays so well. It's a simple concept exicuted very well. The game's physics have improved since alpha and feel very satisftying. Cons: - The game built by a single buy, and it does show. It is not hard to find yourself clipped between a pillar and a wall, unable to escape. Graphics are also not cutting edge.- Camera can be wonky, especially on controller.- A passable tutorial at best, I would say unintuitive. My advice is go into all the pillars in the tutorial level. They will introduce basic game mechanics. And try all the buttons to see what they do.This is a game clearly developed by one man who loves what he does, and is very good at it. It is all apparent. This game harkens back to the old Spiderman games, as well as classics in general. It is very much a make your own fun sort of game. You have to know how to entertain yourself, even with the world challenges/leaderboards. A true open world game, with ideas exicuted well for this little seen parkour genre game. I would highly reccomend it to anyone who reads this and goes ""hmm this game sounds enjoyable"".			"

												This game has a very interesting idea, where at some point in the future the sport ""energy hook"" is implemented and becomes an acclaimed sport and joined the action lovers. Risking his own life to maneuver in mid-air and show that you are the best of all, using your jetpack and electrical cord. The system is identical to that of Spiderman, where the web is actually a rope, super jump your jump with propulsion, and the dash is simply a second function of the jetpack.Interestingly you can combine both skills to go faster and faster and also to access the most difficult places. With this you can jump the highest place to be able to reach and so do as many tricks as possible before are, of course, falling to his death.Every stage you have a different area to explore and find challenges, getting medals for their progress. There are also collectibles scattered throughout the stage.The music of the game for the most part are good with rhythm, I think techno, however the sound effect may be considered annoying (especially when it is at high speed and you can hear the sound of air being cut).While looking through the images and video in the store, I believe the scenario seemed much more beautiful and interesting, which in game it seems that owed ...Parkour moves to boil down to walk through the wall and movements (said maneuvers) are few and very limited.There are 6 stages in total and some challenges to be met which are few and simple, not to mention the areas despite having an operating level are completely lifeless which leads the player only have one thing to do leaving the proposal (a large and exploitable area) somewhat limited.The game can be rather considered fun, but I knew not specify how long it will be for you and honestly if it is to play something that looks like a beta of another, prefer to play the original, in this case I refer to spiderman 2 which is genuinely much more fun.NOTE: 4/10PS: when faced with the walls of buildings was often possible to see inside (visual bug)For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.

												This game feels very unfinished. Even though its supposed to be stylized some of the environemnt just look untextrued. The camera is ubearable. The swinging is ok at times but most of the level deisgns doesn't support it well. If it was free or still early access it might be acceptable but its not worth a full price tag. I've played quite a bit of Spider-man 2 and you'd be better off just going back to that game.			"

												I bought this when it was in early access(around 4-5 months ago) and I thought it was pretty cool but I said I would wait until the game gets finished and then I would take a proper look at it. Fast forward to today and I can't recommend this game because it still feels like it's a work in progress. The camera goes all over the place and is way too sensitive and the graphics looks awful and unfinished. This feels like just an empty game with nothing really to do in it. I loved Spidey 2 and I love parkour style games but this isn't it. Don't waste $15 on a unfinished game, while the Spider-Man 2 style swinging is threre, it's not worth it because this is just a empty space with nothing to do in it and it still feels like a demo after a long time in Early Access.

PROS++Remastered and improved swinging mechanics provide the same if not more entertainment and sense of speed than Spiderman 2 did back in 2004.+Large maps to explore and fly around, great variety of hookable surfaces throughout+Game is a bit tough to learn, but upon mastery makes you feel like a godCONS-Game is ugly; graphics are bad and look extremely dated on some levels-Fewer world challenges than I would have liked-Camera can be difficult to get used toEnergy Hook fulfills what it set out to do: recreate the magic and awesomeness that was the swinging through cities in Spiderman 2. With improved depth and realism, and mechanics the game successfully creates a parkour game that has such an amazing sense of speed and flow that even after completing all the challenges you will be booting up Energy Hook just to continue to fly around. If you like to explore open worlds and compete against leaderboard time trials at high speed swinging through the air, I highly recommend playing Energy Hook.			"

Early Access Review
								The game still looks and feels rough, in particular when it comes to collision detection and camera controls (on a gamepad, at least), but once you get somewhat used to the controls it becomes a lot of fun.Out of the three levels i played so far, i feel the mechanic is by far at its best in the second level, a city of skyscrapers. Here the experience becomes more like the Spider-Man 2 you may remember, as you can just swing about and have to care much less if you're in range for your hook. Exploration in this level was an absolute joy for me and it was where i spent the majority of my time. By contrast, levels 1 and 3 require more precision and didn't feel nearly as much fun to me, though to be fair i don't have a lot of practice yet.From what i've seen so far, the game still has plenty of room to grow, but it is already fun in its current state and has a lot of potential. Worth checking out.			"

The best thing this game has going for it, is its gameplay. Which is great, because that's the important bit. There's no story, or combat. Just traversing maps with your abilities. Energy Hook was created by the man behind Spiderman 2's Swinging system. So that system is brought over into Energy Hook, reworked and improved.The Hook line you shoot shortens as you wrap around poles, gets pulled back by building corners, can be shortened or lengthened as you swing. Needless to say, the amount of depth is very cool. You've also got a jetpack at your disposal. You can tap or hold the jump button according to how high you want to go. The game also gives you a boost ability, which will use the jetpack to propel you forward, whether you're soaring through the air, or swinging. To recharge the boost meter, you need to land on you feet. Either by running on the ground, or running on building walls. It feels badass.There are multiple maps, all done by different artists. It's cool because they've got different art styles, as well as play styles. Each map also comes with racing challenges and trick challenges. The race ones are where its at, forcing you to do quick turns, tight entrances and fly make some huge swings. The trick system is a bit dull in my opinion. There are two buttons you can use to do a small spin, or hold onto you legs. In combination with those, you can manually spin your character forwards/backwards, and sideways. Although you can combine stuff like that, it's not much. The more interesting tricks are when it comes to doing stuff like Loop the loops, where you spin around a pole entirely, or similar tricks.Overall, it's a great game. It might take a bit to learn how the game works, but when you get going, it feels incredibly satisfying.Recommended!			"

Early Access Review
								I need to preface this review with a warning. Energy Hook is still in a state that looks and feels early in development. Putting this aside, it's already very fun to play. I backed it on Kickstarter and, as such, have some play time that's not displayed on Steam.Energy Hook is a cross between Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Spider-Man, namely the second and best iteration of movie adaptations for the latter. Its developer, Jamie Firstrom, is the creator of the famed swinging mechanics in said movie adaptation, but if you've read anything about this game, you probably already know that. The reason why this is becomes apparent as soon as you hop in-game, as it is the single biggest attractive of this game.The meat of the game is organized in different levels, each of which containing various challenges ranging from ""time attack"" to ""highest score"" style affairs. You move around by running on the ground (which was just updated to feel, well, good, finally) and swinging with your... energy hook. While in the air, you can perform tricks and, as expected, string along swings to produce the best scores possible, gain amazing speed and increase the rate at which your jump and boost meters refill. Hitting a nice sequence feels great, but be aware, there are many times where you'll find yourself in an endless string of colliding against various buildings and terrain. It might just be that I am awful at it, too.It's fun. It's not at all perfect, there are still various bugs and the odd crash to desktop (in my case these are rare and often when exiting the game), the menus are rudimentary and performance on your machine may be iffy. It's fun though, and the issues that the game does have get significantly less relevant (or existent) with each update.All in all, this game gets a ""eh, yeah, why not, give it a try, it's pretty fun"" from me.

Early Access Review
								There's a massive amount of potential here. Right now it's kludgy and awkward, but after a few months of polish ironing out some of the stuff I've outline below, this game will be so fun.  Getting into the abstract shapes outside of a city would be so fun.There's not enough vibration for the controller. I'd expect the controller to vibrate on boosts sure, but then whenever a web is connected, whenever I press down on the jump button, and whenever I hit a wall. This could be the biggest thing missing beyond the animations.The web should be bend a little, it seems like it's always in a perfectly straight line. You'd think there'd be a bit of a bend in front of you as you get pulled along, and then chasing behind you a little bit as gravity takes over entirely.The tricks seem like they only make you go down, in the interest of building up boost, it's too much negative reinforcement, I'm looking to stay up in the air, and doing a straight X or Y trick costs me way too much height.It's not obvious that Up and Down on the D pad is supposed to rotate you, since you can't be moving the analog stick at the same time. It makes sense once you know, but its frustrating to spend time to figure it out.a lot of the time my web cuts on on me and its not immediately clear to me why not. I'm assuming that the angle got to sharp or I turned around a corner, but having some sort of feedback on why that's happened would be nice. Another place to add vibration too, wire tension. This is probably a big reason why the game feels so strange. Half the time I boost in a small space the web gets broken and I don't understand why. Its more negative reinforcement of the boost button.Having an instant reset or at least kill button. I don't want to watch my ragdoll fly around for 3 seconds at a time, I'm looking to get back swinging asap.			"

												Simple enough: It's the Spiderman 2 web slinging only with environments that take advantage of it rather than an open world city that just uses it to get to point A to point B.It's ugly. It's janky. The on foot movement is greasy, like you're in some sort of crazy momentum based skateboarding game with on foot patched in at the last second. The camera is almost nausea inducing and a near constant battle to control. Your character looks like a downie.But it's pure grappling hook bliss, fun enough to explore aimlessly without an objective, much less do crazy challenges on. The whole thing feels like a one man project, and I am pretty sure it is close to one-man working on the basics, but different artists do each level, so each has a different feel. You got a sci-fi dockyard, a couple of cities, and a canyon to muck with. Stat upgrades, extra levels, and linear challenge levels are all had through completing these challenges though.But this is the technical, no cloud grappling, pure web slinging game you've been hoping for. The price might scare you off but you get a good amount of content for your dollar and a game system that is worth exploring.			"

												Supported this game on kickstarter because the creator was behind the swinging system I loved in Spider Man 2.Unfortunately this game is not polished enough for me to be happy with that investment.The environments feel unfinished, but that's fine as long as swinging is awesome.Unfortunately it's not, the aiming of the hookshot is always pointing in the same direction, which is always too high up, and you don't get any control over it so you're unable to do tricks that allow you to grab to specific parts of the building, and you're always on the mercy of the hook grabbing something out of sight unless you're looking straight up, these things definitely make this game suffer in terms of feel.

Early Access Review
								Edit: I should preface this by saying that I have been fortunate enough to play this game for the past 3 years and that many of the things that seem obvious and easy to me might be more difficult for new players. If you are a new player I would recommend that you take time to learn how to play before you discard it for ""being bad or boring or hard"". Once it clicks this game is amazing and my original review might be more relatable. To me Energy Hook is a great ""podcast game"" - It's easy and satisfying to make your way across maps without really having to think about what you are doing.This comes from the games perfectly executed core mechanic, the swinging. It is so light and intuitive that you will always be able to go where you want to go without being held back or having to struggle against the game.For people that are looking for a bit more challenging gameplay there are missions where you can complete difficult courses and compete for highscores. However I would not go in to this game expecting it to be very hard to complete unless you want to be #1 on the leaderboards.			"

Early Access Review
								Energy Hook is a fast paced, high flying, traversal game that is being made by the inventor the the swinging mechanic from Spider-Man 2.It took me a bit to get use to how the game controls. It was frustrating and I couldn't imagine trying to play with a mouse and keyboard. Luckily, my handy Xbox One controller worked perfectly well. You control your character via 3rd person and can jump, boost, and swing to complete each time trial or task.It was actually rather frustrating until I decided to start messing with the settings. Buried in the settings is the ability to turn off ""simulate wrap"" or something to that effect. What would happen is when you were swinging the game would predict that direction the swing would take you and automatically turn the camera for you. By turning off this setting you are able to use the right thumbstick to manually turn your character and easily point in the direction you'd like to set up your next swing point.Once you get going the game feels fluid and does remind me of the web swinging in Spider-Man 2. I would love to see a better tutorial down the road, however, as with most early access games you should take it to the forums for the time being. Tutorials aren't high on priority lists for games this early in development and is wasted time, especially if things are going to change. The game is set up in levels with different color portals that indicate start points for different time trials throughout the stage. You walk up or swing over to the portal, step in and it will start the trial. You must swing and boost through rings in the order that they appear, trying to do it as fast as you can. There's also a leaderboard although I admittedly didn't take too much of a look at it. You can really see what the developer is going for here. The proof concept is strong, the swinging mechanic is working well, and the gameplay is moving in the right direction. However, there is still a lot of work to go and the developer will be the first to tell you. Looking at the forums the dev has posted a lengthy Google doc with over 100 fixes in the works, ranging from bug fixes to gameplay changes. Having a developer dedicated to a project is key, so consider that when deciding to support a project. The game is also a little pricey for where it is in the development coming in at $17.99 (Currently on sale for the random 12% off). I don't think this is a wholly poor decision though. Pricing a game like this will make sure the right people are supporting it and the feedback the developer will receive will be of a much higher quality. I usually scoff at such highly priced early access games, but that's usually for games with heavy multiplayer content where the price creates a barrier of entry for something that needs a lot of players for testing.

An enjoyable experience with loads of potential.Note: I never played the original Spider Man games or any of the earlier alpha builds of Energy Hook. Everything in this review is from a 100% new player.PROSThere's really no other modern game (to my knowledge) you can play today with such a sophisticated and expressive swinging system.The core swinging & momentum mechanics feel great, and the trick system is a pleasure to master.I found myself having fun trying to secure a spot on the global leaderboards.CONSThe tutorial could be more user-friendly for new players.

								First impressions of the game were terrible, thought the swinging wasn't very good and it was unwieldy.However, I gave it a chance - and I highly recommend you do too. I plugged in a controller and found things a tad easier, slowly getting used to swing around. At first you can't swing from things very far away which really makes the swinging seem like it's bad and more difficult than it actually is, but you just need to do a few challenges to increase that.Also, get to the second level as soon as possible. This is where the game truly comes into its own and replicates that amazing Spiderman 2 swinging, even outdoing it. It took me about an hour to properly get to grips with the game but it was absolutely worth doing and I would highly recommend this - just stick with it throughout the dodgy start! (which will hopefully be improved throughout development anyway!)			"

								The game definitely harkens back to Spider-Man 2's swinging system, and the developer has been active in continuing development throughout Early Access.  There are definitely still issues with the game, but it's in Early Access, so I would expect that (I experienced some weirdness navigating menus with the controller, for example).  All-in-all it's definitely worth a look if you liked the locomotion-based gameplay in Spider-Man 2.			"

								Short Version:This game is not ready to be on Steam. Even for an early access game, it's an absolute tire fire. Wait for the full release.Long Version:Imagine climbing to the top of a 50-foot tree. Steadying yourself with a rope you've looped around the top, you pause to start up your techno playlist on your music player. Then the rope slips from the trunk and you fall. Half of the branches on the way down you collide with, while the other half snag the rope in your hand at random, jerking and hurling you every which way, until you finally hit the ground, just happy that the world has stopped spinning.Alternatively, imagine swinging around Spider-Man 2 the movie-game in the corner of a dance club, while someone continuously cracks you in the head with an oar.Now you know what it's like to play Energy Hook, in its current form. And I need to go lie down and listen to something soothing.			"

This game is very similar to old Spider Man games where you launch a web our of your hand and attach it to something in order to create a rope to swing on, except in this game you use a line of energy alongside a jetpack. You can also do a variety of stunts such as in-air tricks and wall-running.+ Visually the game looks pretty good+ It's quite fun to swing around, you go extremely fast while also gaining great height+ Each level is very open giving you plenty of room to fling yourself around+ Challenges (such as racing through rings) with leaderboards - The camera is very jerky and disorientating, especially when trying to change directions- The combo/trick point system isn't very rewarding at the moment- Currently there's not a whole lot of content (it is in Early Access though)(Suggestions:)~ Add more enemies / obstacles, I feel like this game would be a lot more fun if perhaps you were being chased by something, or if there were traps / dangers to avoid, or if there was an overall goal to the game.  Something more than simple challenges^ Or perhps a new challenge like ""get to ____ before the time runs out""			"

								This game has incredible potential. However, I play games on something slightly better than a toaster, and this game does NOT run well on toasters. I'm sure it's pretty fun, but right now it's just wayyyyyyy too unoptimized for me to recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a good computer.			"

								As the description says, if you have any fond memories of swinging around in Spider-Man 2 from Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube, this is by the man who made that happen. The swinging system in Energy Hook is not the same as that one - this is more based in ""realistic"" physics and there are slightly less superhero acrobatics going on - but the feeling of zipping between high rise buildings driven only by tension and momentum hasn't lost any of its appeal. The game has made a lot of progress since its earliest builds, to the point where I feel pretty confident recommending it to people who think they'd be interested. The levels are fun to swing around in, and the high score challenges are a good prompt to develop your skills.Really enjoying watching this one come together.			"

								While the controls are a bit confusing at first, after 15 minutes in the game you are easily flying through the maps in the game. Its probably the best swining mechanics in any game ever made.			"

								It's no surprise that this game comes from a guy who worked on a bunch of the Tony Hawk games as well as Spiderman 2. It feels a lot like a cross between THPS and Spiderman 2's swinging mechanic. But you probably know that already.This is a game made by a single dude, and you have to judge it as such. If you come in expecting the polish of a $100M game, you're going to have a bad time. It's an indie game, and the mechanics are solid!It takes a bit to figure out, and the game doesn't really hold your hand, but once you figure out all mechanics and you get your swing down you will have a blast soaring around. If you're the type that played Assassin's Creed or Prototype or Spiderman (or any of those sandbox-type games with creative movement controls) and you found yourself wasting hours and hours just running/jumping/flying/tricking around and seeing what kind of crazy moves you could pull off instead of playing through the story, this game is for you! You get this incredible sense of freedom and speed, and it really is beyond satisfying to swing and fly yourself from the streets up to the top of the level's tallest tower.In addition to free play in each level, you have a host of challenges to choose from. In addition to in-level challeneges, there are also VR challenges (i.e., no big level; just a challenge course) you can find in each of the main levels that are a great way to learn the ropes...honestly I would love to see a VR set of training levels to start you off and teach you the ropes, but knowing how long and hard Mr. Fristrom has worked on this already, I completely understand if that never happens.A couple tips for beginners to get good as quickly as possible:1) Unlock the second level (Southstar Island) ASAP as it's a much better environment to learn to link a bunch of swings together IMHO.  It's much bigger and much more uniform, so you can really get the mechanics down. You can do that by doing just a few challenges in the starter Gravship Dock level.2) You aim your energy hook left/right with the left joystick, not the right. Once you figure this out the whole game opens up. This realization took me longer than I'd like to admit :)3) When you're just starting out, instead of relying on the momentum of swings alone, throw in a jump/boost at the end of each swing to keep you high in the air and keep your speed up.

								It's the guy who did the swingning mechanics from Spiderman 2 (which were one of the best parts of that game). Biggest downside right now is some lack of polish (early access, to be expected) and lack of a referenceable tutorial or controls explination. The core gameplay is there though.			"

								There's a lot of potential here with Energy Hook. The game feels like a cross between Crackdown and Tony Hawk. The developer has supported the game so far with consistent updates and is constantly looking for community involvement and feedback to improve the game. There's a great sense of speed when zooming around the various areas and the controls and feel of the game spot on. Can't wait to see where this goes but definitely worth the time to check out if you like trick style games.			"

												Not a bad game.The gameplay is actually fun.But it lacks content, replayability, and presentation.I remember playing Spiderman 2, just swinging around NY for hours. The combat and missions felt like a gimmicky filler, so I'm glad there's none of that in this game. But Energy Hook is still missing something. It just feels really unfinished and unpolished. There's no bugs, but there's hardly any content to begin with. You can only swing around for so long before you get bored. Even the positive reviews have less than 10 hours of gameplay time. Furthermore, this game isn't updated anymore, so there won't be any new content or updates.If you loved the swing mechanic in Spiderman 2 and want to swing around for an hour or two again, I'd say get this if it's less than 5$.Otherwise just skip.P.S. I don't own an Oculus Rift so this is not a review of the VR experience.			"
