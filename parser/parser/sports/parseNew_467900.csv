Early Access Review
								*Update on mouse and keyboard*Mouse and keyboard now work, it feels like a great use of the mouse... though controllers will always feel better, there is just one more reliable player to play the game at your parties... single player experience is ""there"" but not satisfying/fun enough to purchase the game for a SP experience. Multiplayer is still great.*Review made a few days after EA release*Swordy is not for every PC, make no mistake, Swordy is a niche game requiring Multiple controllers (with the recent and solid addition of Keyboard and mouse) , Friends, and a willingness to wait until those meetups to play the game... (and it only really starts getting fun with a third (or more) person(s) too)...To those having a Party with a few friends around, Must grab.To those looking for a single player experience, Don't get it yet, Wait a few months and see how the single player modes progress and then re-evaluate Swordy is a Unique ""Arena Party Game"" In the vein of ""Starwhal"" or ""Duck Game"" or ""SpeedRunners"". They are great, fun, and silly... though there's a few drawbacks out there.Most of these Arena party games are platformers... and too many people have WAAAY different skill levels in platformers to make them fun or fair.This game is a lot more like starwhal ""new"" control scheme, a game where most people are unfamiliar with the controls, starting everyone off on a level playing field. What this game has going for it is a really strong sense of ""Honourable combat"", ""Casual rulemaking"" and ""Improvisation mid combat""""Looking at each other across the arena, blood has been spilled, but both your weapons are aflame... the rain starts... everything else seems to fade into the background, Slowly spinning up the hammer, charging forwards, both you and them start screaming...""Moments like that seem to flow and occur naturally, Blows and weapon exchanges seem just right, your opponents rarely outskill you to the point of futility, and when amazing dagger throws do happen, there's nothing but awe across the couch. It feels like one of the few local multiplayer games where battlecries feel appropriate and easy to do. The game is really good at encouraging ""epic memorable moments"", everything feels fair (even when it's unfair).The game is also nice in offering casual rulemaking. You have an immediately apparent unspoken social contract for politeness, a weapon selection as required, not needing to go into a ""Mutators screen"" to disallow certain items... as most friends are amiable to not allow swords, or to only go for punches, or overhead attacks... it's just really nice and refreshing not having to go back out to a menu to get that stuff done.It's also really nice to see a bit of panic mode support, where your thrown weapon misses the target, and now you're running away from a psycho with a flaming spear, grabbing and tossing everything in your path to try escape... until either you manage to pick up another dagger and fling it at him... hopefully with a little more luck this time... or you run into a wall and get skewered...Really, this is just an essential party game that doesn't lose it's lustre quickly, Get it if you're sick of platformers as your only party game options for sure. Get it if you're the type that can convince their friends to bring two controllers over.Remember that you hold X while picking up to dual wield!			"

								I remember seeing this game a couple years back and being absolutely entranced.Happy to report that playing it delivers on that.Right now the emphasis is definitely on sharing a couch and bashing eachother  with a variety of weapons (which is fantastic) I know the devs have spoken about having some sort of a campaign mode, which I'm super pumped for :) super thrilled to be part of early access! :D-REALLY unique combat-wildy entertaining physics kills-beautiful, consistent graphics10/10 would recommend, to be wildy entertained AND support the awesome devs :D			"

								Hi guys, me Sheeveryn here again, big fan from gamers streaming live, i feel like the new update sort of nerfs players movements, i do like exhausting your character but over all they feel really slow.I have also noticed a lot of the time that the characters appear weightless or seem to be able to float on top of your enemies. basically it feels like a lot less gravity which isnt the best to feel in my opinion.loving the new armour and hero mode that really encourages people to vs their friends.Now the best thing i feel about the update is the combat movement, it finally has more control and feels like i can co ordinate with my opponent and even try to parry most of the attacks.But yes over all game is heading in the right direction, i know you guys a a small team but great job, over all im for the change in combat movement/controls and new items of armour that look and sound kewl. but id have to say am a little disapointed in the lower gravity and abilities like dashing are not as fast.Thank you agian keep up the good work.

								SWORDY is a very good party game that's very easy to pick up and play. The controls are simple and the ideas don't take long to get a hang of, but there's a surprising amount of complexity behind it all. If you can get a couple of friends together with controllers, this is one of your best choices, and it doesn't matter how much experience any of them has with the game. The developers are friendly and active, and I can see the updates planned being very well implemented. They've spent a lot of time gathering feedback throughout their closed beta period, and have kept a good rate of development going. This is a really fun game and I highly recommend it to anyone that has a couple of controllers lying around.			"

+ The gameplay is a ton of fun. You essentially pick up various large weapons and swing them wildly at one another like lunatics until someone dies. + The physics can be hilarious at times as you get knocked around, and when your weapons get stuck in other players bodies dragging them around. Sharp weapons will even get stuck in other wooden weapons / handles. + A nice variety of weapons to choose from.+ You can dual wield anything, making for some crazy combinations.+ Bots, which is FANTASTIC allowing you to play the game alone or add excitement with friends. (I've played so many Local Multiplayer games without bots, I'm truly glad this one does!)This game is in Early Access so these are subject to change- I wish there was a way to actively block with the shield. It seemed a bit useless.- Lacking a bit in content (keep in mind this game released 1 week ago in EA). There certainly needs to be more maps, and perhaps more weapon types (perhaps ranged weapons or hazards) to keep the game entertaining. - When there's a lot of players, the camera tends to zoom way too far out which makes it hard to tell what is happening below. (This is mainly only an issue with 4+ players)- The background music is a bit...""boring"" compared to the action happening in the game.~ Just a side note, but you can only add 4 bots, when it seems like there is room for 7. Honestly, the more players battling at once the greater the fun so perhaps raising the amount of bots would be a nice addition.			"

YouTube™ Video: KING SWINGER! - Swordy [Alpha Gameplay] 

			Views: 105		

			Gameplay of Swordy from Frogshark. Swordy is a local multiplayer top-down brawler from New Zealand developers, Frogshark.		

What is it?Swordy is a top-down physic brawler made primarily for local multiplayer.  Players can pick up a variety of weapons and swing them or hack away to try and bring down their opponents.  It does have single player aspects such as the ability to play against bots and single-player 'missions' which are fun but the real bread and butter of the game lies in a bunch of friends smashing each other with hammers for laughs.How does it play?The game plays smoothly.  Controls are easy to understand but challenging to master.  There doesn't appear to be any keyboard control (at least, not that I could find) but the game seems to really suit a controller anyway, being clearly designed for twin stick control.Who would enjoy it?If you like to play casual games with a group of friends, I can see you having a great time with this.  If stuff like Ultimate Chicken Horse or Overcooked are your thing, then this will be right up your alley.Pros:+ Crisp, responsive controls.+ Really nice design aesthetic+ Good variety of weapons with different physics/feeling.+ Dev team seems to be very active and involved in progressing the game.Cons:- UI is a bit clunky and unclear to navigate.- No online multiplayer support (and I don't think this is something that will be implemented).- The shader really impacts upon frame rate (I don't have a top end graphics card (AMD HD7970) and I could still get 55 fps or so but my framerate pretty much doubled when I turned off the shaders entirely).Overall, if you like local multiplayer brawlers, this is well worth your time, IMHO.

								Great game so far. Some suggestimates for the full game: Character customization, maybe a nerf of the spear and stabbing. Makes the game much harder. Easier controls, new maps, new weapons, different modes "

								I had lots of fun playing Swordy and I belive game could have a lot potential as online multiplayer if it was every implemented. Battles are short and very dymaic lasting from 2 to 8 minutes depending on your skill level and how oponents played. There is nice vaerity of weapons which I enjoyed and they all feel very different while equiped. II particulary loved the spear. You can checked for yourself how game looks like in this short 15 min video of a gameplay

								SWORDY is an interesting, physics-based melee combat arcade game, and I love it.The game uses a twin stick method of combat (and triggers for different stances and stabbing) where you spin to attack your opponents. This game currently has AIs and a coop AND versus system for other players.Now so far, the updates that are being released alone are showing me that this game was definitely worth the amount I spent when it was ON SALE. But currently, I personally think it fits its 15$ price tag. So, if you've got some extra cash lying around, and wanna play a local game with your mates, go ahead and get this game.			"

								Certainly not a bad game. It's a bit slow-paced, especially when compared to it's other 8-player local multiplayer competitors such as knight squad and gangbeasts. It has potential too, it is very polished and colorful and the mechanics work, but it just feels slow. My group of friends played a few rounds and quickly decided to move on to something a bit more comical. I give it a 6/10. Perhaps they will add more in the future and make it catch my eye. Until then.			"

								I had a ton of fun with this game. It's still got some kinks from being early access, but I think the main mechanics of the game are fantastic and make for a pretty good party brawler.I'm looking forward to where the game goes from here. A few critiques: SFX would be great to bring you into the fight (potentially music, but swords and spears clanging would be the best) and more levels. That's it. :)			"
