												10 hr EDIT: The AI are still dumb. constantly crash into you. swerve onto the racing line when exiting the pits. They are programmed to keep their line. If you happen to be in the way then they hit you causing you to go wide or lose time. Online play is garbage. get a 'please wait' screen then after 2 to 3 mins it timeouts. managed to maybe race 2 races out of the 30 lobbies I joind.Braking is bad but I think you have to 'level up' by going thri the VR46 academy to improve braking._____________________________________________________________________________I have many hrs experience on MotoGP15.So far on 'VR the game' I have only played a MotoGP full race weekend in Assen as Valentino Rossi on the hardest settingFirst impressions and improvements over Moto GP 15:- cornering feels more realistic, you need to have all your speed removed before the turn and accelerating out of the corner feels better.- less rear wheel sliding around from side to side. As your rear tyre wears (presuming you enable tyre wear setting) it spins more and is harder to find traction but doesnt slide around from side to sidelike in motogp 15- turning into corners feels way better than in motogp15. its sharper and feels more realistic.- Audio has improved and changing down thru the gears sounds better- Graphics are better. The rider moves around the bike more realistically. Crowds are better and cheer at certain parts of the circuit.Dislikes so far:- Braking feels weak and soft and I cant brake late to overpass someone in the corner. Braking late just means running off the track. Have done all overtakes in high speed sections of the track (have tried the 2 different brake pad choices) - Background music during races was the first thing I disabled.Will play more and update the review.

												===TLDR===Following the milestone franchise there is a lot to be desired. If this is your first Milestone game you will be mildly happy to start with, but next year you will be disappointed that the game has hardly evolved from when you last played it on the old title. Ironic for a developer that goes by the name of milestone. I suggest they rename to ""Little Bits""===/TLDR===I played Motogp14/15, Ride and now this. Not because I love these games, but because all the good racers play the latest thing.... Search for gallimar13 on the time sheets and world leader boards and youll see my name up top 20 most of the time.  Now you know about me and my level of play, lets talk about the game. I play multiplyer because I can clear the ""Artifical Intelligence"" by 10 seconds in 3 laps on the hardest settings. TT and multiplayer is the ONLY source of enjoyment after 20 hours. Firstly, wow, in 2016 they finally managed to fix the Time Recordings. Until 2016, recording a lap time and saving it on a leader board was a struggle for the developer in all the previous gamesA bug which has existed for many years in all previous games has been copied and pasted into this one. When you go to the Pits before you complete the first lap in Qualifying; the game still fails to allow you to register lap times for the rest of the sessionThe bikes are better, they handle better, very much the same as 2015, but just a little less jumpy and jerkyThe bleachers/curbs arent as slippery as Ice, you can actually use them nowGrass is still to much like the asphalt in a straight line and can be used as part of the trackYou might be thinking the Physics are amazing but the brakes are rubbish at the start of the game, this is because your rider is lvl1. Get to lvl100 and it all starts to feel like 2015 again with slight improvements here and there. Still Arcade like but some parts of the handeling feel a little more real like late brakingIn multiplayer, if you are a lvl1 rider vs a lvl100 rider you will have no chance, you brake later and corner slower and have less control and struggle more. Single player: As you progress through the game and your custom rider gets higher in lvl and gets good it doesnt get harder and harder. It gets easier and easier and thus more boring and less of a challenge as you get better as a player.You can not be official riders in multiplayer, you have to be custom riders. So you cant be Rossi, in the Rossi game.the choice of numbers and font styles for custom riders is terrible. Theres more rossi helmets to choose from than there is numbers and font style. Some combinations look terrible on the bike. The game feels like to much of a copy and paste of old games, with slight tweaks the developer should of patched in previous games. Your basically buying a patchFlat track is very fun, i didnt like the car modes.The old bikes and 2 strokes are fun, if you can find the right players to race them with youThe old tracks from ages ago have been added with the new tracks. This is very nice. Example: Assen is in twice, with the old layout and the new. The Donington track is there. And moreThe amount of custom gear to choose from is basically all the same from 2015, except you have to buy it. Theres obviously additional Rossi attire, from the likes of AGV and Dainese  The graphics are heavier on the system than in 2015, and dont look a massive deal better than 2015, but they are better, but just a touch. Sounds are the same on most bikes and have been that way for years by the same developer, this developer is the laziest I have ever known. Finally after every race it displays lap times, race times and fastest lapI can only recommend this game if your seeking to play the best multiplayers or love the pants of Rossi, as all online players have all flocked over to the new game because its only marginally slightly better and it is able to record a lap time properly in the leader boards. If your in for the single player, buy 2015 for cheap. Ride is terrible but good for a change of tracks. You could buy both for cheap and not bother buying Rossi. Multiplayer lobbies are still cranky, and behave strangely when someone with a bad connection joins. The code is not smart enough to be able to take a player with a bad connection and remove him, without crashing the game back to desktop first; taking everyone in the lobby out in the same way. Theres still no function to chat in a online lobby, its like this game was made in the stone age. You have to shut down the lobby and kick all those that joined to change the settings like the voting system, the game type or the tyre options. Thats terrible by any of the standards in 2016The menus are over done and overly confusing, and over animatedTheres not enough smart ways to save your custom bike settings Also when you win a race, the celebration has been removed and the PITS have been removed, the game has less immersion. There is no video cut scene when you win a world championship. There is no commentary like you get in football games. Its justa excel spreadsheet of the result then then option to start a new season. YAWN. 2015 had these things.Milestone as a developer does not support its games. Ive seen better support and more updates in Angry Birds and other mobile games/apps. Usually after release, if you have any issues, you live with them,If money or love is not an issue, I recommend this game over previous titles, but its not a great deal better eitherIf Milestone is the Developer, dont buy a season pass or any additional extras other than the base game. These guys dont add anything to the base games value afterward.Following the milestone franchise there is a lot to be desired. If this is your first Milestone game you will be mildly happy to start with, but next year you will be disappointed that the game has hardly evolved from when you last played it on the old title. Ironic for a developer that goes by the name of milestone. I suggest they rename to ""Little Bits""			"

												Ok.... Milestone. THE BAD  From the moment you start the game, you can clearly see they did nothing, NOTHING and i mean ZERO work on their Engine. It has the same Issues as RIDE.  They keep milking their licenses with major Brands in the Motorcycle industry for as long as they have them. The Game crashes frequently and the sound quality compares to CameCube games. Some poor guy sat infront of a mic. and made ""Braaaap, Braaaap!"" noises. The rewind function kicks in for NO reason! I admit that iam not to far into the gane, but guess why,... it crashes/freezes all the Time. THE UGLY Its sad to see that there are no motorcycle games made by renowned Game Studios, so fans of the Genre need to take what they get.Why put in Race cars? there are 100 Games that excel in that area!Why isnt it possible to change your leathers? Only Glovers, boots and Helmet. THE GOOD Yes, graphics got a little bit better.Loading times are way shorter.Menu has been streamlined and the look and feel is way more appealing.I`d love to recommend this game because i want to support Motorcycles games but this seems way to unfinished with fundamental Issues,			"

												Need for Greed - Valentino Rossi. I couldn't get more arcade than this BSI've played MGP15 and Ride and boy, those games are much more challenging than this.They took some fun elements out of MotoGP15 career mode (private teams, bike development) and added those annoying Academy Events. Starts are now easy because there is a launch control and you can't switch either this or the anti-wheelie off. The bikes are much easier to ride than in Ride or GP15 and even on highest difficulty with a medium team you'll win every race.The bikes handle like cars (full breaking in full lean sure) and the cars handle like drunken sealions. I'd request a refund if I could.Full throttle in the gravel? No problem. Cutting corners short? Sure. Touching white lines and kerbs in the wet? Not even a drift.And now you can enter MotoGP at the age of 16 apparently. Let's ignore the MotoGP rules AND physics in a MotoGP game :)This is a stripped down version MotoGP15. Need prove? The gameplay is 100 % the same: AI leaving the pits still do a 90° turn in the first corner, there is still the wobble when auto drive switches over to your control and the AI still finish in the basically the same order in any given race.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			"

												After testing the game and playing a little bit I must say I'm really happy with the product. I have mainly compared the VR game to MotoGP 15 wich was very disappointing. Anyway. The game is improved in almost every aspect. The Flat track and Monza Rally show are just a small add on to the game, and honestly for me they are waste of time. Only on bike/car to choose. To make it short: PROS:-Improved graphics and physics. Now riding a bike is more challening and gfx is more realistic. -The feeling of a speed is very good. -Improved sounds of some bikes. -Whole MotoGP 2016 season. CONS: -The grass still has the same grip for front tire :-( -There are some bugs that I've noted already but they are not annoying as in previous games -Some bike still have that annoying sounds-Not many possibilites to customise the rider. Only few boots and gloves to choose, many helmets but only from italian manufacturers. I didn't play the multiplayer yet.			"

												Pros :-Very smooth performance, I'm on a GTX760 with an i5-3570k, no overclock, and everything moves like butter, including menu transitions and loading times.-So many ♥♥♥♥ing game modes! MotoGP is split into 2016 MotoGP, Moto2, Moto3, the 2015 season, 500cc Two-Strokes, 250cc Two-Strokes, 125cc Two-Strokes. Then there's Flat Track, either in single race, Americana or Enduranch styles. Drift, Rally and R1M Practice. And then we haven't even gotten to the Historic Events, Time Attacks (And a special Rossi Time Attack mode), and even Randomly Generated Challenges. Haven't even gotten to the DLC yet which adds even more.-Added Rider Bonuses and a levelling up system which I think some will not like, but I personally enjoy as it gives you some goals to work toward unlocking.-A lot more helmets to choose from! I love helmets.-Career mode is a lot more refreshing since they break up the actual season into portions where you do the other race categories (Flat Track, R1M, Drift ,Rally)-Contrary to popular belief, motorcycle portion physics is actually pretty good for a video game if you set it to Pro. You fall over just for the slightest physical infraction and takes a lot of skill to get used to.-♥♥♥♥ing Rossi voiceovers and interviews!Cons :-Graphics not bad, but pretty meh by 2016 standards especially with the standards set by Gran Turismo and Forza.-Audio is average, forgettable soundtrack. BG audio like crowds and exhaust back blasts are choppy and crackle sometimes under heavy load.-Rossipedia. 3D gallery, neat but useless function.-Driving physics in Rally and Drift are weird and illogical. Cars feel weightless. Takes getting used to.-No more bike and team customization! Not that I care, was never great anyway in previous MotoGPs.See video below for visual presentation :

												Jacko Rating8.5/10After 10 hours of play I can reccomend this game to Bikers and Motogp fans as I have had a blast playing so far.  Lets get down to the specs;The graphics and visuals are great and the attention to details on the bikes is superbAudio a little dissapointing and seems to be exactely like Motogp 15 which i own, after playing many hours of Dirt Rally the audio here is definately below par.Animations are decent enough and I got a very rare FPS drop/hitch (I run a high end PC) which I hardely noticed, certainly nothing to distract me from the game.Actually playing the game is as I have already heard quite similar to Motogp 15 so it was easy to pick up and go straight in with no assists, pro physics and AI set to Hard.  I found it easier to win than previous Motogp games so not sure how thats gonna sit with fans of the franchise, I would have liked more of a challenge.The amount of content is fantastic with Career mode as it is in previous releases letting you build your own customized rider and bring him up from Moto 3 to Motogp, also included are Non bike races such as rally and drift but my favorite is the extra flat track bike races at the VR Ranch.  For me being a biker, gamer and Valentino Rossi fan the games dedication and theme of VR throughout is an absolute must have and the extra content included is all related to VR's history and amazing career such as classic 125cc, 250cc and 500cc races (yes the old 2 strokes) plus flat track races on 2 different tracks along with other highlight events and races from VR's past.  A treat for VR fans!To sum up I am happy with the changes and VR wrapping that has been added this year to improve the Motogp franchise and will be playing many more hours prentending I am the man himself - RossiNice Effort this year.

												Latest MotoGP Game from Milestone dedicated to the MotoGP legend Valentino Rossi #46 which include aside from MotoGP classes VR's moto ranch and the Monza rally.It feels like more arcade than a simulator, low quality graphics for a 2016 game, physics are not so good compare to other racing simulators.But aside from physics and graphics it's a fun game to play.

												Dorma please in the name of god, take Motogp off Milestone. How many years has it been since they took over from THQ? How many years have they had to come up with a half decent multiplayer mode? How many years to iron out glitches and crashes? Yet every year it's the same, same old game, same old glitches and crappy(even when you can get into a lobby) multiplay. I love Motogp, and the sad thing is, this is the only liecensed sim out there. Dorma for godssake wake up and see the crap Milestone are putting in front of your biggest fans. Surely time for change, this can't go on year after year			"

												So far, im impressed. Compared to the previous MotoGP games it seems alot more immersive and realistic, mainly due to the new features in the carrer mode such as Rally and Flat track races. The ""Valentino Rossi Game"" idea seems to work well, it adds alot more content to the game.The graphics are much improved and the bikes handling/feeling feels a lot better.Its a shame they scrapt the motorhome and pit settings for the career mode but the new idea of being apart of VR46 academy is very refreshing.

												This is an early review because I haven't yet explored very much of the game. I've played the initial dirt track tutorial and a multiplayer race (more on that below).I've played MotoGP 13, 14 and 15 extensively and Ride more than I'd like to admit so I have solid perspective on the games Milestone releases.Of note: The subjective:1. Physics seem more forgiving than previous MotoGP titles. Very similar to ride, the grip level feels astounding at times. Perhaps I've just gotten better at these games but this one feels pretty forgiving on pro physics.The Good:1. Menu and loading performance is significantly improved over RIDEThe Bad:1. I've tried multiplayer 3 times. The game has crashed 2 of those 3 times after the race loads to 99% leaving me with a 66% disconnect rate (It doesn't differentiate between a crash and a disconnect).The time I did get to race the performance was good and we had a good race.2. Multiplayer is STILL not integrated with steam. This is inexcusable at this point.3. Launcher menu STILL does not expand and cuts off entire settings fields for PC usersI'll update the review later to recommend once I see how Milestone responds to the multiplayer crashing and also after I see how Milestone supports the game. If this turns into abandonware after 1 month as is the norm I will be very disappointed.			"

 Short evaluation by Lythronax Valentino Rossi The Game is Milestone's new MotoGP video game (MotoGP 16) in tribute to Valentino Rossi. The graphics isn't that different compared to MotoGP 14/15, the physics are slightly different but not shocking. The multiplayer is small but there are some player playing (If you want to play online, add me and join my MotoGP Steam group). Like in every Milestone game the bugs are everywhere but since the last patch the multiplayer seems to work pretty good except some errors (LOL).  Conclusion: All in all if you like bikes, MotoGP or Valentino Rossi, go buy that game. If not, you don't miss anything and maybe wait for a even better MotoGP 17 next year.			"

												Played a lot of motogp 15 and have found this game to be an overall improvement on the series. Career mode has changed and now you start in the VR46 acadamey as a wild card and have to fight your way to the GP. There are several other events throughout the season besides GP racing like Vale's flat track, drifting, rally races, and racing the R1's. Besides the career, there are so many other events from Vale's career that you can re live. Customer Support is active, they even fixed an obscure glitch that from what I found, only happened to me. Looking forward to any bonus content they release and will continue to play until I become a 10 time world champ ;)			"

												Loving the game so far.Looks stunning and plays really really nice super smooth""No Stutter""like when you turned into the apex in the previous titles.The physics have improved  under breaking and getting on the gas.Lots and Lots of content which is varied like off road bikes and rally track.Well worth the price Tag, can't comment on the DLC as not purchased yet.Couple of negatives : audio is ok but not  not great when you look behind or pan the camera the sound is directional (don't like it ).also onboard sounds need attention.No Rider Names doesn't Work ?I have turned off rider names in options but still shows up in game.The names are noticible when you come into range of another rider....I hate this.I don't want to see some digital name above a rider when im racing, it kills the immersion and looks arcade and loses the look and feel of a stunning game.If anyone knows a work around i'm all ears.UPDATE: Milestone have fixed name issues and is currently looking @ online disconection issues. so good news.Also they still haven't implemented online options where you can lock players assists such as forcing all to race onboard. So you will still will be disadvantaged if you like to play onboard (you will never be as fast as ppl playing in arcade mode behind there Bikes). Edit: 10 hrs game play so far. Multiplayer is Broken at the moment it's hit and miss...mainly miss, if you can actually race someone online it's awesome but very annoying and time wasting the  game crashes or please wait and nothing happens so be prepared for all that that crap.Still recommend it  as its awesome fun.

												Haven't really played MotoGP series since MotoGP12, as a MotoGP fan i am impressed with this although there are a few things i'd say to anyone reading reviews before making this purchase.Pro's so far (will come back to edit):-Easy to get into-Nice career mode, fairly well built around the player-Good leveling system within careerCon's-Not good for keyboard players, would suggest investing in a controller-Car Physics for Drifting/Rally are god awful (Stick to Bikes...Please)-AI suck, by far the biggest con for me. It seems as though they don't even count you as being on the track, they hit you out of the way and you can't do they same to them or you'll just fall off.The game itself is good fun when you're just passing time. I wouldn't recommend this at full price though so i'd suggest to anyone wanting to buy it to wait til it's on sale or buy it cheaper from a third party website.			"

												I've been following Milestone games for while, first bc they are the only developer working with bikes and most of the championships or road races all over the world, so, no suprise for any motorcycle fan, and second, bc i like the physics and some of the tracks in this games, besides, this is just way to have some fun alone or with friends without the pressure of the 2 sec mistake like in real world driving.Doesnt really matter how far you go with game physics, nothing really beat driving a real bike, and never Milestone tried to replace that tbh, that`s why so many people call this games arcade, but they never intended to be simulators either.With this out of the way, im feeling a step back in Valentino Rossi version against all previous games, first bc the driver skill really influence the bike behiavor, like braking late, and that may pass the wrong impression if you come from MGP15, were you think the bikes just dont brake, but after you level all your driver skills, they are basically the same game, with a few expections.They took some fun elements out of MotoGP15 career mode, like the private teams (this was a great adiction to the series in 15, why remove it right in the next interaction) and bike development was replaced by driver skill, but unlike any umodded bike in 15, riding any bike at start in VR is pain, and it takes while until you feel things getting normal, and then, added the Academy Events, that sure bring variety to the table, but it also detach you from your goal (this is can be seen was pro or con depending on each person opinion).The only thing that still remain was big problem in most Milestone games, is the AI, you feel diferences betwen games, but they are so tinny, that are easly missed and sometimes their behiavor is awkward for racing game, like in some races a full pack from start to finish.VR is still a great adiction to any fan collection or if you love the theme and like to play diferent versions once in while, if you look for the best experience, well, in my opinion it still is MGP 15 by long shot, not only bc of your private team, but the overall experience is much better.

												I have played all of the MotoGP games back to MotoGP06 on my Xbox 360 and have loved everyone of them, I have all of the MotoRacer games apart fom 4 which I only found out today it was available and the MX vs ATV games are all in my collection.  This game for me stands outs so so so much.  Not only do you get the core game but also flat races, rally races and RC car races which shocked me how good it actually was.  I would not hesitate to give this a BUY rating and cant recommend the game enough.  Lets just pretend that Marques did not win this year and see if you could beat him in the game.			"

												Excellent MotoGP game! I love the way the bikes feel, getting much better. I was a huge fan of the original MotoGP game created by THQ. The controls were perfect on that one. WIth this new game, they are close to the original's controls. I was really disappointed with the past offering from milestone (MotoGP 08, 09, 10, 14, etc). But this game kicks a$$. 46 GOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!			"

												this is one hell of a great game. it is worth getting although i personally would like some changes.the ability to do a season on any sport you want, so for example you can do a flat track career championship rather than arcade championship, customisable bikes and your own teams. more tracks for the flat track and stuff like that.overall an amazing game with some amazing aspects to either help you get better in the game or to just have fun			"

												Rear wheel on the GP bikes is no longer made of butter, they changed those tyres to the flat track bikes, those things have anal lube coating on the wheels braking on GP bikes is terrible, your old braking points are useless, you must brake sooner as the bike cant stop, wont stop,  cant trail brake into turns anymore without getting a mouthfull of tarmacsounds are a bit betteryou get a stamina bar now, still not sure what happens when it runs outpositively surprised, im loving the flat track mode, still need to get used to the new feel of the GP bikes "

												I'm a lifelong fan of MotoGP and the GOAT, but this game came with the Vale name and ruin everything with graphic like mobile games,terrible sounds and mechanism :| just look at ride 2 and see how milestone can make high quality textures for a game(at least it looks like the PR screenshots in its steam store page) but they did not the same job on Valentino rossi the game because they expected it can sell by the name of the GOAT....Also late braking is dead in this game[the best part of MotoGP for overtake] Milestone is killing the Gaming aspect of MotoGp, they have the license and no rival so they sell garbage!dont buy this game, they are making fun of Valentino rossi by this game :))) buy ride 2 insteadoh i almost forgot, the game refunded :DP.si had more than 50hours of game play before buy for myself,i dont know why i did that...stupid move			"

												Having only played the game a small amount of time i can say everything seems to have been improved in terms of physics and feel to game since Moto gp 2015. AI is more a little more responsive and its more of a challenge to be competative in races on harder settings. The whole seems to be more in depth even with the new added race modes.			"

												How in the world these guys got and have hung onto the official license from both MotoGP and Valentino Rossi I have no idea, I guess agents and product managers dont have time to play the games that the names of their brands are going on to.Pro`s Very stable game, Not a crash or a lock upOk graphics, For 2016 on a very new gfx card they look functional nothing more.Sounds are on the whole done well, Music is terrible  but thats to be expected.Good selection of tracks, But with a slight downsideConsGfx away from the bike models, Very yesterdays jam.. Stick crowds frozen in time.Non open gameplay, Want to race any bike at any track well you cant.Handling, This is one of the most major flaws. Turn in turn out is all wrong, Brake zones arn`t in keeping with the simulated speed and rider weight distribution is all wrong.Wet handling is very suspect, It seems the game forgets about the weather setting and the AI certainly does.Very poor multiplayer, Don`t expect to race people more like watch they rubber band forward and backwards.Which leads me onto the most horrible part of the whole game, AI or lack of it. Setting it high for a challenge just adds unrealistic entry/exit and straight speed. Too low and it matches you ... Push it down to very easy and it still out accelerates you thru corners... Pro settings and it openly cheats cutting corners with no penalties let alone riding into each other with also no downsides.I can`t say the addition of the speedway track added much, To me it seemed like the handling model from Fim Speedway 2016 had just been copied and dropped in. The rally cars however arn`t bad, Sure there is very little realism but they are fun to belt round the Monza special stages.Milestone need competition from another developement team, They`ve had too long being the only motorcycle sim makers and it shows, Same tire model, Track designs and handling for the past few years have really lead to their products being very substandard.Could I recommend this game, If you like Rossi and want just an arcade racer then yes but for anything more serious  stay away from this low effort, No love for the genre toy of a game.++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Reflection after playing for a few more hours, Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Are the track gfx dated yes, Does the Multiplayer need work and the AI speed mapping needs alot of help BUT and here`s the change; The More you play it, getting better, Rider skills, Learning which bikes are rubbish and which work well, Where the AI is slow and stupidly fast it actually dawns on you as you play that it`s not too bad. THe rally and speedway stages still seem very out of place but as a Motogp game it`s not as bad as you think.			"

												Only a little bit into the game, but it's very fun so far. Yes you can nit-pick anything to death. If you go in expecting them to hand you a real Motogp bike and AI that reacts like the real riders, you will be disappointed. If you go in expecting it to be a little better than motogp15, then you will enjoy it. I'm really loving it as much as I did the previous Motogp games. I love Motogp so that is a big plus, I love Rossi so this was a must buy for me.			"

												9.5/10The game has had tones of input and attention to detail! Lots of nice featured historic races for multiple classes, tones of different classes from past and present to race and many different modes. The career mode is very indepth and different diciplines with the VR 46 academy is nice... I thouroughly enjoy this game and the car physics as well as the different dicipline physics are suprisingly well optimised. Only complaint is online races crashing sometimes and the brakes are made of cheese!!! Very unpredictable sometimes work mostly they dont. All in all very good game!			"

												H παρούσα έκδοση έχει αρκετά στοιχεία που μπορούν να διατηρηθούν σχεδόν ανέπαφα και σ’ επόμενες, οι οποίες αναμφισβήτητα οφείλουν να δώσουν μεγαλύτερη προσοχή στον τομέα του ρεαλισμού. Έχω την αίσθηση πάντως ότι, σε γενικές γραμμές, κι ο ίδιος ο Valentino Rossi θα έχει μείνει ικανοποιημένος με το συνολικό αποτέλεσμα της φετινής version.It certainly has some elements that can be preserved intact for future versions of the MotoGP franchise, which undoubtedly must pay bigger attention to the realism and simulation factor. Nevertheless, I think Valentino Rossi himself must be quite happy with the overall result of the game.http://ragequit.gr/reviews/item/valentino-rossi-the-game-pc-review "

												~~~~ Please bear in mind thay I got this game for $10 off a key store ~~~~In the 1.5 hrs that I have play, I can say that I have enjoyed every moment of it. I am not a MotoGP fan and hardly new who Valentino Rossi was, how ever in saying this I did pick up MotoGP 13 for $5 and enjoyed my very short time with it.I can not truely comment on the realism of this game, as I bought it for a casual experience for my breaks between Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, rFactor 2 ect. The graphics are very simular to MotoGP 13 and also plays almost identcally, with assists on. However, I apreciate the other side to this game, then non-MotoGP side. The dirt bike thingys are fun and gives me anxiety to see my rider half of his bike to go around a sharp corner. The drifting, in the one race I have done in the career so far, was average. But please prove me wrong as I think drifting in general is a bit stupid.If you are a true MotoGP fan, and you need this game, pick it up. Maybe wait for a sale or get it off a keystore like me (you all know the one) If you are not a huge fan, and looking for a game to play lightly here and there maybe pick up one of the older titles if they are cheaper.
