												Pro Skater 2D is a game that I recommend because:- it has an acceptable price- it is indie - it is classic- it is a method to banish boredom- it has a good concept- it has trading cardsEnjoy!			"

												I get the appeal of skating games. I really like skating games.Skating games that use WASD for tricks and directional keys for movement are annoying.It is customizable, but I feel like there must be a better way to do it? Contextual button pressins or something?Anyway, can't say I am a fan of this.Also, the game is 4:3 default with no way to change. It is 2016 :) 16:9 is what most people are playing on guys.

			A platformer/skateboarding game where you do various Skateboardy tricks on a 2D plane. Controls are clunky. Like and subscribe to see more of my amazingly ugly mug reviewing all the games you don't...

												The game's idea ani't bad but still ain't new.I have no problem with the graphics but still it could have been better.The soundtrack is only one track looping the whole time till it gets annoying. The game needs more options for audio adjustment and resolution options.The game is 4:3 default tho.The gameplay is so hard. Even the tutorial needs a tutorial.I've played it for more than an hour and still haven't mastered it yet.Using SDAFE for tricks and directional keys for movement is kinda annoying.You can change them, But still there must be better way to combine both of moving and skills together.You only get 2 mins to move in a map which you need to do certain tasks to move on to the next.It's nearly impossible to master it enough to pass the first level.To jump you need to press four or three keys at the same time. You also supposed to do tricks while jumping so add more keys. We are gamers not octopuses.The requirements and the game size is pretty good. You get three cards drop for five cards badge.If you are interested in reading and discussing reviews. Check Cassus.org "

												Cheap, in all aspect.In general, skater games is not in my heart (BMX guy, sry), so this review could be a ""hater"" kind of.But I remember I tried Tony Hawk's Pro Skateboarding on my friend's PSX, and that was awesome!Also I seen some online flash games, which was good enough.So...I didn't expected an AAA title, but this is way under my expectations.- Physics / dynamics is afwul- Control is horribleYeah-yeah, cards, but that doesn't save this title.But what could?- overall better graphics (bigger sprite for example)- A ""map editor""- A decent soundtrackAny good thing? Yeah, the combos.And yeah, cards, but that doesn't save this title.I could mention OlliOlli, but that's 10 times expensiver... Maybe on sale, you should get that! :DYou still want to try out Pro Skater 2D?Here is it, for free...http://www.chipgames.net/game/th-pro-skater-2d.html "

												ok ill keep it short but honestthe game has horrible controls, granted you can change them in options, but skate games are hard to control without a controller imothe horrible controls leads to doing simple tasks to become a challenge on its own. could only manage to do 3 goals on level 1 because the controls made it to difficult to do anythingalso THIS GAME IS COMPLETLY FREE ON MANY FLASH GAME SITES! LITERALLY ALL IT SEEMS THE DEV DID WAS CHANGE THE NAME SLIGHTLY! THIS IS ""TUDY HAWKS PRO SKATER 2D""			"

												Pretty good adaption of the 1991 classic Skate or Die: Tour de Thrash for the Nintendo Gameboy.I would've probably spent less time in this than I did, but I couldn't figure out how to exit the game.6/10, gift to people as a joke when it's on sale for less than a cent.			"
