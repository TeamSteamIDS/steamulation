								Update 2: I'm rewriting my review from ground. In my last review I complained for the comfort, in just a couple of days the developed solved 100% of sick issues I reported (just in the beta release when I'm writing this). What can I say, that's great!Worldy Cup is a soccer game with a cool 8 bit style (the name, and not just this, reminds World Cup for Nes), so pixel art graphics for most of elements and a proper soundtrack/effects. It supports almost everything, flat monitor, VR headsets, pad, keyboard, motion controllers. At the moment the roomscale/motion controller side is weak, you're going to use the Vive controller as a joystick with an almost standing experience (better stay sit with a pad), but the dev plan to introduce new modes and new solutions for roomscale, maybe even with full body locomotion like arm swinger. The game is still in Early Access, most of the contents are going to come in future.Worldy Cup offers a single or multiplayer match and torunament. The multiplayer is only on the local network, but online gaming is on development. If you want to play in lan but just few of your friends own an headset or maybe mixed Vive/Rift headsets (I guess also old dev kits should work), this is the game: you can play with almost everything. Up to 4 players with the tournament, and 6 players in single event.The game offers many kind of cameras, front or side view, far to close, scrolling or still. After the last update anyone could find the proper one, and the far/still is perfect if you want a 100% sickness free experience with no motion (I find the medium with scrolling not bad at all, as comfort).During the game you control just one character, you don't swap with the one who take the ball as usual, but you can say the CPU what to do (do anyone remember NBA Jam? It's the same). It works in single player, but is focused to be used with multi, one player one character. The game is super fast and very arcadey, chaotic sometimes, but extremely fun. In single player you've lot of nations and football fields, but the IA need some finishing (all teams looks similiar as strengh and style). This and new game modes are planned in future releases.Worldy Cup is a promising game, pretty fun even now but with a great potential, online matches with this could be a real blast. At the moment it's more on seated/standing side, as you can play the game with or without VR, but it looks like we could see some nice roomscale+handtracking surprises soon.			"

Wordly Cup is a VR or Non VR 3D Pixeled Soccer Game.I really enjoyed this game, it's just amazing. It's super fun, and there is multiplayer. To be honest, I dislike sports. But I don't dislike this game. It's super funny...too. And the developer is very nice. BUT...there is a bit of glitches in the game, but other than that, it's a great game. GO BUY IT!OVERALL: 8.5/10 "

								Such a cool idea! I loved World Cup Soccer on the NES!There´s still a lot to do... but the direction is good.I really don´t need the semi-real styles.So, I hope the devs focus and flesh out the fun factor!			"
