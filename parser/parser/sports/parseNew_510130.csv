Early Access Review
								能看出游戏关卡设计很用心，难易分配还算合理。个人感觉后边有点难。			"

												I didn't like Power Link, but someone who likes feats of dexterity probably will.The premise is simple, move a pair of oddly shaped pliers carrying a box through a maze of electrified wires. It's a bit akin to Operation! the kid's game, only Power Link is a lot harder and ramps up the difficulty fairly quickly. "
