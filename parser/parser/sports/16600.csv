The graphics are great, the sounds as well, and the puzzles are, well... remember that word I told you to at the beginning of this mini review ? Yes ? Great ! My job is done.Excellent game though ! Great to play for a few minutes or a few hours.[Rating: 80/100]			"

												I started playing trials with Trials HD on the Xbox arcade where I would build my own tracks and try and beat top scores over and over.This edition of the game is great and feels good when doing a perfect run. The mechanics of the bike and the physics-based rider makes the game have a funny side as well.I give this a 8.5/10 for being a great pickup and play game.			"

I bought it on steam a few months ago. For a 2008 game (youll see me say 2008 game alot) It's actually stunning, physics and graphics ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant. It's sad the game is dead and no one is in chat anymore, I still play this game and I highly encourage you to get this game instead of the new ones like trials fusion ♥♥♥♥.

												Trials 2 is a great game, i had great times playing it.  Controls are very simple, just throttle, break, tilt back and forward, but the game becomes very technical as you pass the levels and every little movement will count on your performance. It´s not like all those tilt games out there, this has really nice physics and gameplay, and a lot of havoc!Also is a great game to play when you only have 5 or 10 minutes available. You can race with ghosts or watch replays from others players, and when you see the best players runs you cannot believe how good you can get to be.  It´s a very fun game with a lot of crazy stunts, i recommend it to any person.			"

												For a $2.49 purchase price it wasn't too bad. After clearing the stages I didn't have any desire to go back and replay, perhaps if I had the option of running vs AI bikes or online people at the same time (onscreen) it'd have been a different scenario but as it stands, it was a purchase I could have gone without.The gameplay is tight but there are moments of ""UGH I WILL DESTROY YOU."" There are some physics exaggeration but that is to be expected for a title like this to work and be successful. While they are exaggerated they do make sense. The audio is quite repetitive and the music, oh the music... I'd have preferred being able to load my own music instead of listening to the garbage. I turned it off.In the end I can't recommend this game because there are newer editions out that *should* feature the onscreen multiplayer I mentioned.			"

												Compared to newer entries in the Trials series, Trials 2 feels incredibly dated. Its lack of polish, unrefined and floaty physics, and just general quality-of-life features show just how far RedLynx have come over the years. This is a very barebones game, but it was necessary for the devs to get to the point that they're at now. As it stands, this is a decently fun little time-waster, but the Miniclip sponsorship signs in the background show you exactly what kind of mindset you should approach this with.Overall, I recommend skipping this version and picking up Trials Evolution or Fusion instead. Or, you could even play their mobile app, which is also very good.			"

												This game easily the most brutal and unforgiving game I have ever played.  If you can mange to get it to stop crashing and freezing your graphics card, you will be treated to ridiculous elasticy physics and frustrating glitches (like your bike folding in half on a regular basis).The learning curve is extremely steep, which is reflected by the nearly impossible achievements.  In order to become half decent at Trials 2, you will need to study replays and practice infuriating sections of track for hours on end, and even then you have no hope of touching the leaderboards.So unless you have a lot of time on your hands, and like extremely difficult challenges, think again before you choose this game.

												Playing Trials 2 is like going to a restaurant, and ordering the chili.First, you're impressed.  It's pretty good!  The meat is tender, the onions and beans are flavorful, the broth is robust.Then, the cook comes out and adds some Cayenne pepper, to give it just a little spice.  Superb!  Well done!And then the cook comes out again and adds some more Cayenne pepper.  Well, I mean... why?  It's quite good the way it is.  You can still taste the other ingredients, and it's not bad, but things are kind of getting overwhelmed by the spice.And then the cook comes out once more and dumps a gallon if Cayenne pepper into your dish.  Now you're irritated, but you know there's good chili in there, right?  You take a bite, and try to ignore the spiciness, but even when you find a great big chunk of meat or something, all you can taste is spice.  Spice, spice, spice.Difficulty is good in a game.  A little spice is more than nice.  But when your game's gimmick is that it gets so difficult that you can no longer taste the enjoyable stuff, well... what's the point?  Who wants to eat THAT dish?A bad chef is one who sucks at chili.  An unforgivable chef is one who ruins good chili.  The same goes for game devs - good game, ruined because some idiot was all like ""XTREEEEEEEM MEANS HARD, RIGHT?""  I will not be purchasing any games by Red Lynx again.			"

												Trials 2 is a ton of fun to play in short bursts. It's challenging making tricky jumps and landing at the right angles. It's also hilarious to watch as your driver crashes over and over and over again. Even when the game gets frustrating it's more difficult to notice or care because the crashes are so comically terrible. There's a nice bit of satisfaction to be had when that hard track is finally overcome. I recommend just for ♥♥♥♥♥ 'n' giggles.			"

												Redlynx Trials is one of those games which is easy to pick up but very hard to stop playing. You control a trial bike rider across a wide variety of indoor courses, some of them truly awe-inspiring in their complexity.You're supposed to get the rider from one end of the obstacle course to the other, but the endless faceplants, rashies, crashes and bashes are almost as much fun as safely navigating the course. Never have broken bones been so much fun.For added enjoyment, try playing this with a friend - you can take it in turns to see who breaks the most bones.			"

												This is one of the most exciting and addictive game that I've already played. When you start playing, you won't stop until break your records, you'll want to be better in each track you play. And in the March 22th will be realeased the Trials Evolution: Gold Edition for PC. And will have a lot of inovations for the game be more atractive and competitive, for spend a lot of your time in the game. This game is like drugs, when you start, you'll never stop, but I think that is a good drug, or no. So, if you want a reaally good game, that will help you when you'are bored, this is the perfect choice!			"

												I am basically a FPS gamer, however just because the price was right I downloaded TRAIL 2 and I gotta say, the game is pretty cool, good graphics and pretty addictive. For a switch of pace, try this game, its only $2.50 (12/22/2010) and its the best $2.50 game, (other than F.E.A.R) I ever spent.			"

I use an Xbox360 controller it's very hard with a keyboard to be percise on this game WHICH YOU HAVE TO!!  (you can play  with  a 360 controller on most games because ""PC is Microsoft"" and you just bought another controller from logitech or something??)			"

												I love trials games, and Trials 2: Second Edition was where it all started for me. I played this game for hours at a time, on a daily basis, for months. Endless, minimalistic fun, with plenty of achievements and leaderboards to compete for/with. If you're just getting started with Trials games, this is the perfect game for you.			"
