												Trackmania Canyon is a really fun game, if you have ever played a Trackmania game you will find yourself at home. If online against others or alone, it is basically always you vs. the best time. There are no collisions, no agressive driving people smashing into you... just your own skill stands between you and the gold medal. ;)Highly recommended.			"

												Let me explain something about this game. This game has a multiplayer that is NOT for the casual gamer. It is quite competitive, and it likes to display this competitiveness all up in yo' face. You WILL see that one dude (or multiple, I mean, they're everywhere) that can finish the track in half the time it takes you to finish it. I see this every other time I go onto this game.The game has a steep learning curve that requires at least an hour or more in order to learn the basic physics of the game. After that, there are tricks that, once learned, can help you set better times in the multiplayer. (i.e. Left-CTRL braking & using a controller.) The tracks in this game play a major role in shaping your skills, as they are user-created. They can go from being pretty basic to being some of the hardest tracks you'll encounter on your time here.I know very well that time makes all the difference in the multiplayer. In fact, it MEANS the difference. Times are what determine your position in a round, and the time is calculated in thousandths of a second, making photo finishes seem like nothing. You can set a record time in a single round, only for someone to beat you by .002. It really can be that close. There IS the odd tie, but it doesn't happen that often.Now, you should go into this game knowing that you're not gonna win your first race by a long shot. Practice makes perfect. It blends in the arcade-style driving physics and fantasy environment with a competitve multiplayer that stands with some of the best. I've never been so involved in a racing game that isn't a sim. Trackmania 2 also has its own ladder system, which determines how well you do amongst other players worldwide. And we're not only talking worldwide, either. It can track official progress to as close as your own state (if you live in the US, that is). You have a number for everything, from server rankings, to single player rankings, to country rankings. The better you do, the more the number goes down, and the more accomplished you feel.I recommend this game, because it makes the $20 you'll dump on this game worth the cost. Now, do mind, this was a game that was made BEFORE the UPlay era, so it doesn't require the UPlay launcher. Instead, it has its own launcher for launching titles, although it still is in need of serious revision. "

The game deserves more players but Nadeo/Ubisoft really dropped the ball by splitting it up, and refusing to lower the prices even now. Stadium is active, Canyon is a bit less active, but you won't find an active community on Valley.This'll run on nearly anything, I played it on a laptop with i3 and integrated graphics at around 50fps jjust fine. 720p.

												Canyon is an arcade racer that consist of tracks that are somewhere between 20-30 seconds. You meet up online (or you can play against yourself) and everyone competes for the best time on each track. It's all about nailing those perfect drifts and jumps so you can shave milliseconds of your time. You can instantly restart at the push of a button. It's a very simple premise, but it's is insanely addicting. Tracks are short and easy to learn, but difficult to master. You need to cut each turn perfectly to win against other people online. You'll be saying to yourself: ""Just 5 more minutes, I'll quit after the next track."" And two hours later you're still playing. Highly recommended.			"

												Trackmania 2 doesn't offer a pushed calling mode, sensible tracks and stupefying gathering of available autos like other hustling titles. It has single-player substance, however Nadeo's continuation isn't wanted to be played alone. This is an establishment about sharing, about social event, and about dashing all through of this world circles in the wake of taking a snappy skip off an avenue lifted over a gap floor. It runs with a social occasion of force tracks, yet the certifiable delight of the redirection is picking through the get-together's appearances and ricocheting into servers to go up against others for smart times. Certainly, even so not long after dispatch, there's as of now a critical designate of substance there. On the off chance that you basically need to play alone, there are still a couple of things you can do. The included tracks have benchmarks worked in for you to go up against for changes, and if you're not a power racer the substance will set aside a long chance to open. Regardless of getting to the end of a parcel of the Black-level tracks can be a massive test, additionally fuming through at satisfactorily high speeds to get improvements. While the substance can enthusiasm to race through, the experience can feel genuinely devastate with just phantom vehicles to keep running with you. Thankfully there's a choice to stack in the soul autos of the replays of different players in case you're connected on the web, which drives a supposition rivalry moreover tip you off to better lines around the tracks. Playing on the web can be generally more fun, regardless, in light of the way that you can meanwhile fight and speak with others as you advance through the server's guide turn. Diverse techniques for play are open, however Time Attack is the one being played by far a vast parcel of those on the web. In it all players race over a length of track to post the best time. There's a general time control until the guide switches, and inside that breaking point you can restart as a significant part of the time as you need to record a middle of the road time and help your general arranging. You can see the autos of others as they race however there's no crash, which means you're set up to try the best line to the get done with paying little notice to what number of different players are pressed onto the track. Online preoccupations run an assortment of custom interfaces that show data like near to records, the present tune playing, the track name and client that made it, moreover live rankings as everybody sprints totally, which give a superior than normal layout as you speed along. The track changes for a couple of servers beginning now combine just client made tracks, which can continue running from truly standard, clear associations where the crucial test is to turn as valuably as could be allowed to more extraordinary game plans where you'll hit different speed cushions and go taking off through the air for extended time ranges. In multiplayer stimulations you're given a lot of unexpected beguilement as people around you pound into bars, miss the mark as for gigantic hops and crunch nose first into dividers, or flip end-over-end around sharp turns and off the sides of circles and slants. You'll keep running into relative pitfalls, the effect of which is showed up by the point by point hurt appearing on the autos. Replaying tracks for better times can in actuality change into a fixation in light of the way that most tracks take between 30 seconds to barely a moment to finish, so it never appears like one more lap will be a lot of a period obligation until it's four hours a short time later and you understand you neglect to eat. This is an arcade style racer, so it's unquestionably not hard to get and rapidly show signs of improvement than normal handle on how everything limits whether you're utilizing console or gamepad controls. Controls are clear, simply invigorate, brake and turn, yet there's essentialness to the managing as you comprehend how to utilize the skimming mechanics chronically major for getting a handle on tight changes without beating into a divider or losing a wealth of speed to braking. It's no essential accomplishment paying little regard to the principal controls, as keeping your auto level with the ground over the bangs, bounced and flawed turns of different tracks can be a shaky business. Without enough speed or certainly the right edge it's amazingly simple to end up moving over the gulch floor, however since such an unavoidable danger of dissatisfaction exists it's especially fulfilling when all goes right. Notwithstanding the way that each auto is in every practical sense obscure in Trackmania 2, you can skip into the auto head to re-attempt your paint occupation and create on a track. The unassuming bunch of included formats are all bolster enough, yet in the event that you require something without goliath Ubisoft logos on top of it you may need to contribute the imperativeness to make your own. You can then name and additional the auto and bring it into online rivalries so others can consider about your elegant limit or scorn both your auto's system and you're completing times. The moved track distribution director is astonishingly more strong, permitting you to shape as crazy a track as you wish with a degree of included building pieces. By burrowing through the toybox of grades, passages, S-turns and gorge pieces you can manage some truly imperative courses, an indistinct number of clients from of now have. These appearances are then shared between those in the Trackmania 2 accumulate. It makes a few additional strolls in the event that you need to pick particular tracks, yet it's a key matter of downloading records and setting them in the fitting records. You can then give them a shot yourself in a LAN beguilement, split-screen or in outrageous position modes, or disregard the entire creation point of view completely and simply welcome the get-together conveyed content interweaved into the track insurrections on your most treasured server. It absolutely doesn't hurt that Trackmania 2 looks phenomenal. The lighting impacts and appearance in your auto's reflexive surface are particularly phenomenal, and however the detail on the track pieces isn't decisively on near level, it barely matters as you zoom at high speeds through turns and over hops. To some degree more blend inside seeing the tracks would have been regarded, however the get-together is beginning now working consistently making exchange looks. What truly matters is Trackmania 2 goes on an empowering opinion speed, which adds generally more imperativeness to the experience. Nadeo's Trackmania strategy has dependably been about mixing arcade-style hustling with insane track design, and Trackmania 2 is the same. It empowers an over the top mission for the ideal dashing line however dazzling tracks. You can have a stunning time doing combating to be the speediest in a server or basically welcome the stimulate of taking off at fast crosswise over yawning split and tearing through circles. It's a redirection about social affair and sharing and Nadeo benefits a control of wrapping up the entire of the Trackmania encounter – neighborhood multiplayer, online rivalry, track and auto editors and general rankings – into one bundle. The failure felt through emphasized disappointments examining the crazy turns and touches of Trackmania's courses may put off a couple, yet without the risk of disappointment there could be no conclusion achievement. When you finally run a perfect line through a track to post a record time, every busted fender and yelp of anger is forgotten in a rush of sublime satisfaction.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												Well what can I say? Trackmania is one of my favourite game series. It's a series that basically says ""Screw conventional arcade racing and your Need for Speed knock-off crap, we're doing our own thing."" And so they did. The gameplay is crazy, the difficulty tests your perserverence, the modes are fun, track-building is like a childhood dream come true, and it's very addictive. And this has been the same since the early days of Trackmania (2003) and progressively gotten better. So kudos to Ubisoft to holding onto what Nadeo set out to do in Trackmania 2. I'd definitely recommend everyone to give this underrated game a shot.			"

												Canyon is most fun of all Trackmania 2 games. It is well designed, nicely balanced in singleplayer, and drifting here is like a dance. The game itself is intense, challenging and it requires a lot of tries on each map to reach higher position in local or global ratings. And that's very important. Competition feeling is one of the most powerful in Trackmania. All that matters - is your skill, and not how well you can kick opponents from the track.I really enjoyed it despite the fact, that there are 3 different games now instead of one: TM2: Canyon, Stadium and Valley.And I strongly recomment this one, it's very different from canyon parts from the first game.

												This is a fun arcade racer with odd physics settings(including being unable to touch other cars. Easy to play hard to master. Most of the gameplay would come from racing on other peoples custom tracks or attempting to get times on the leaderboard in solo. The big seller behind trackmania is its map editor that has a lot of preset peices you will assemble together. The odd physics allow you to create crazy tracks, anywhere on the board for having fun or to have something challenging to beat. The game can also be very competitive with a leaderboard that can be viewed at local and international levels(You pick your location when you create your account and you will be a part of a set of regional to international leaderboards). The most fun i have is competing for the solo international records who get to have their posted to that track.What I liked:Compete Against Anyones Records- For every single track everyones best score is saved to the leaderboard along with a replay. You can select any of the records from the top players to your friends and add the vehicle to track to race against. All of the records you select will appear as ghost cars that align with your actions(reseting will reset them as well). You can use the top players ghosts to learn their strategies for the tracks and have a crap load of opposition to choose from.Solo Mode- The tracks are Divided into difficulties(represented as colours) from super easy to super difficult(and trust me when i say difficult it becomes extremely hard to even get close the the finish line). The difficulties are great for easing you into the easy driving to the crazy ♥♥♥♥ you will end up doing as the tracks slowly introduce harder and harder combinations of the track peices.Track/Map Editor- Very easy to use. All peices have interfaces that tell you what can connect to what. A large number of peices to choose from. The peices are now much more ""realistic"" in design and appearance/ They look much more natural. Once you start thinking outside the box in your design you will come to realize that actually connecting peices is not even necassary. Then you will start to make crazy courses.Physics/Driving- Like in the past for the trackmania series. Each of the themes use different settings of physics and cars that perform quite differently. The same applies here so your going to need to learn the unique physics. Simply driving is very simple however you will find the the courses you will end up driving suddenly the driving becomes difficult to master.Multiplayer- Generally the race types are time trails and regular racing. Time trials give you as set amount of time/laps to get a good time. You can reset yourself/return to last checkpoint at will. What the others are doing is irrelevant however you can still what they are doing. The regular racing is either a point to point format or an actual circuit. In these races you cannot reset your time. You can still return to the last checkpoint or the start, but your time is not reset. The order the playing cross the finish line is the final score. The matches will be ranked(solo tracks with hard rules and full leaderboard support)Low System Requirements/Graphics/Performance- The graphics are not really great or anything special. They are an improvement from the older track mania themes. Max graphics is laughable for a gtx1070 and when you drop them down many lower end machines can get playable performance. My laptop with a gt740 works perfectly well on descent settings. Game is well optimized as a whole as I haven't come across any issues relating to it.Perfect Balancing- Like the rest of trackmania everyones car is the exact same performance wise. You can only customize is paint scheme. If your not lagging everyone is perfectly balanced when it comes to the game itself. The gameplay consists of experience and skill.Unified Launcher- When you have multiple trackmania2 titles they are all accesible without closing the game you originally started.What I disliked:The is nothing in specific that really bothered me about this game, but just to clarify it is an arcade style game not a simulator in any way. There are no ways to modify the body or performance of the car. So if your into the serious racers this game might not interest you.Final Summary:I would recommend this game to anyone who races casually or wants a challenge. If you need to be able to change setting for the vehicle this game is not for you.			"

												Track mania hasn't always been on steam so I have many more hours than displayed. As far as arcade racing goes, the Track mania series from Mania Planet is very fun. Jumps, wall rides, loops, drifting, high speeds, no complaints, I can use a keyboard to race but prefer a controller for the joystick's sensitivity etc. Both the single player and multiplayer modes are very fun. Like other games, there can be less or more players online during certain times of day. The mutliplayer community is definitely active however. There are plenty of offline maps for single player with varying difficulties to complete for medals. The single player maps in order also can help develop skill. Playing online, the maps can be endless since new maps are continually introduced and cycled. Maps can vary a great deal, from simple to very technical (fractions of seconds count) but very fun. Ranking is tracked and displayed for single and multiplayer, locally and globally.It also has a level editor to create your own maps.I use the steam workshop for car skins and downloadable maps, a lot of decent content.http://maniaplanet.wikia.com/wiki/TrackMania_(series) "

												This game is the undisputed champion of time attack! The multiplayer integration is just so immensely huge. Servers have dozens of players on, theres a gazillion of maps, models and skins made by the community. The tracks in each environment are absolutely insane, but still the whole mechanics are so tight that u can tell each 1/1000th of a second that u lost or won during a turn. Trackmania always was a huge hit back in the days and the new installments absolutely lived up to my very high expectations....i sank tons of hours into the previous games. My thumbs were constantly numb and sometimes i shred one gamepad per month, maybe even more. It's just that good.Going for medals and challenging other players records is extremely rewarding. It's not an easy racer, the track layouts are very tight but the physics of the cars are absolutely tight and theres no surprise loss of traction and the like.If u want to check out the cool factor of Trackmania go to TM-Tube.com and check out some of the users videos...some of the stuff is just insane (in style, driving and trackbuilding alike.)11/10 its just sublime and awesome!!!!+edit:Since i read some negative comments about being only 1 car in the game. Theres a trackmania carpark online with hundreds of cars to download (also on the steam workshop) ...some car makers ask for some of the ingame credits...but most of them are download and play.Of course those car models only change the appearance and sound of your car..the handling and speed stay as the reference model to maintain game balance.

												well, Trackmania² Canyon is my favorite of the series. i love the speed, the crazy tracks and especially the fullspeed maps with lovely autodrifts.like always, hunting world records is one of the biggest parts of the game.the only negative aspect is, that the community is much smaller than it was in titles like nations. but still there are enough good drivers, to compete with.Canyon is definetely my favorite game on steam until now.it's fast. it's hard. it's fun.

												Trackmania 2 is an interesting game. It gives alot ""room"" for the player to customize the game to their heart's content. However, it's not that user friendly. But, after playing around with the features, and getting some good advise from some friends, I figured out how to customize it. The trailer shows them in a gran prix fashion. There's two ways you can do that. 1. Record many ghosts in the replay editor, or 2. rounds mode. I conclude that this game is one's who want a challenge.P.S. Levels A through B will be a breeze, then it's the hard stuff			"

												This is the counter-strike of racing games. It is highly competitive and sees you racing as fast as you can on a huge number of tracks (plus Workshop Content to expand on this number) to score the fastest time! Gladly, though, it also caters to a more casual audience, allowing many fans of arcade racing games to pick this game up and enjoy it :) It looks great, feels great, and provides hours of entertainment!

												Trackmania Canyon is more than your average arcade racer. If you're looking for the Quake of racing games, this is it.It's real time leaderboard incorperation into multiplayer servers serves not only as a visual clarification of your improvements over time, but an insentive to keep playing, and claim those tops spots. The UI is plain, simple and to the point, as well as being easy on the eye.The game boasts a singleplayer series of tracks that range in difficulty, with end-game content being hard to unlock, and extremely difficult without many hours of practise. You can do 'offical' runs every 5 minutes when practicing, which will upon completion upload your time to a leaderboard with the change to get SP or skill points, however internet connection is not manditory to play these.The game has a very long learning curve, with the player having to develop their muscle memory with the car physics, learning tricks that help the top players shave off those milliseconds. There a lot of flicking involved, that's for sure.The physics in the game feel wonderful, and have a very dynamic, full feeling; giving you a sense of complete control over your car. Something that many racing games fail to capture to this day. Combine that with a plethora of user created tracks - from technical ESL-styled and Speedtech courses to LOL and Mr DVD minis, each track potentially introducing a new way to take certain turns, making new tips and tricks to learn for every possible transistion, turn, jump; you name it.Another great plus to mention is the community with the vast majority of players being friendly, and willing to give you tips on how to improve your driving. A small percentage of the playerbase of the populous trolls, but that's to be expected for any online community, niche or not.If you're looking for something to get into that'll take you a while to learn, whilst having fun getting there, then this game is for you. Play for a month then look back on your first replays and you'll really see the improvement which is another great positive about the game as your progress really does show.The only downside about the game  would be the lack of a search option. Finding specific maps or replays is difficult when you've amassed a large library of either is difficult and time consuming.			"

												Here is THE best multiplayer racing game ever made.TrackMania is the game created by the community, the maps, the cars, the roads, the environment, all is made by the players for the players and that's the best point of the game.This is what makes this game different from the others, the players will change the game to enhance the techniques of driving for the competitions to be as impressive as possible. That's why TrackMania Stadium is one of the games listed in the Electronic Sports World Cup.And even though It's been 10 years since the first TrackMania got released, the game is quite empty but you will always find a server to play. However, the main problem of an empty game is that the maps don't change (in some servers), some people already played the maps around a thousand times when the game is about creating and sharing maps.If you never, ever played TrackMania, prepare hours of lessons of driving because this one is ""the new generation of driving"", you are a soap in the canyon, use water to make lather and then slide. The first time is always the hardest, but always the best. If I didn't like this game, I wouldn't had ever spent almost 3k hours of my lifetime playing any TrackMania since 2006.The price is worth it. Try it.			"

												The original TrackMania games were damned amazing and had a great following with tons of servers full of thousands of players at any given time of day. For the last ten months, the new TrackMania games have been dead. I paid full price for all three titles, expecting to have an even better time with the new games, because why not?Well, as the days turned to weeks, I realized the folly of my wasted money as almost all of the servers remained dead across the planet and it continued to be impossible to find a choice of heavily populated servers. Whether it was the dumb choice to milk the players of their cash by splitting the game up into three separate releases (one for each environment) and requiring separate servers for each or if it was the decision to charge money for the new games, at all, the result remains the same -- nobody plays these.If you reference SteamCharts[steamcharts.com] for Canyon, you'll find that the average number of players at any given time through all of 2013 was between 10 and 100. Across the entire planet - and most usually seem to be overseas (Germany, France, Russia, Spain, the UK), so if you're looking for a populated low-ping server in your region and you're in North America, you're going to have a bad time.It's a very unfortunate situation. The game looks better than ever and it has a lot of enjoyment to offer if you like this style of game. It's a fantastic time waster when you need a break here and there. However, you ultimately need a player-base for a multi-player game to be enjoyed. Their business and release model for this series of games completely failed in this way, this time around.Here's to hoping they give the franchise another shot in a couple more years and they correct their mistakes.

												Trackmania continues to be one of the most underrated racing series. The latest feature, Trackmania Canyon, will prove immediately familiar to anyone who has played earlier Trackmania titles, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Quite the opposite, Trackmania is a game of subtle, incremental improvements, perfecting the driving physics, the environments and the community.Trackmania Canyon is not perfect, but it is a perfection of everything that makes Trackmania so deliciously Trackmania, and here’s much to love for Trackmania fans such as myself; from the brand new Canyon environment which combines the best from both Stadium and TM Island, the tightly refined car physics and the overwhelming amount of community content. If you’re a Trackmania fan, Canyon will give you hours upon hours of fun, but if you’re not already a Trackmania fan, this feature is not likely to pull you over. Still, this game is highly recommended. "

												Out of the three trackmania 2 games out now, this one has got to be my favorite. To me it seems like you are able to do more with the car and map combinations than the other two, such as drifting and platforming. With this being the only one of the two that you can drift the cars in, it makes going around high speed turns atually more fun than a hassle, and  you dont lose speed while doing so. The platforming is another great part to this game. If you've ever played jet car stunts for android and ios, you'll quickly learn to love the platform mode. However when it comes to editing and making your own, to me at least, it proves a creative challenge that can be fun and rewarding if you happen to publish your courses to the community. Above all really, just have fun with it. It's not really ment to be taken seriously at all, like every other vanilla racing game out there (forza, gran turismo, need for speed, etc) If you get bored of single player, definately try out the multiplayer on the custom dezined tracks as well. For lack of a good conclusion, try the demo, you'll enjoy it.			"

												TrackMania 2 is a really fun arcade racer.There is only one car but appearance is customizable.In terms of gameplay, this game is easy to pick up but hard to master.There are lots of intriguing tracks, each has its difficulty.I really enjoy the driving, especially watching the car flipping over and crashing into the water.The physics is pretty laughable once you're off the track.Watch your car endlessly flipping in the water, and watch your car somehow remains intact after hitting straight into a cliff.However, that's actually part of the reason why I enjoy this game so much.Instead of getting upset about myself after failing a track, I always burst out laughing upon seeing the funny animations.I would recommend you pick it up when it's on sale. It isn't worth the 20 bucks to be perfectly honest.			"

												I expected this game to be much like the old TrackMania games that basically owned my late childhood. This game is remarkably different, and certainly an improvement.The graphics are much better than TrackMania United, showing off crystal-clear textures and some very nice filters and reflection effects. But for TrackMania, graphics really aren't that important. It's all about the car and the tracks.The Canyon car drives very differently from the 'traction block'-like cars of yesteryear, and really feels more like you're actually driving a car. The car throws weight into the usual precise TrackMania driving, and ensures that you have to know not only the perfect line but also how the car reacts to skidding and countersteering to get a perfect time.Tracks are insane thanks to the huge array of blocks, and making tracks has never been easier with the refined editor. If you are new to TrackMania, beware the difficulty. Everyone is driving cars that all drive exactly the same and there are no collisions between cars, so your only goal is to drive the insane tracks as perfectly as possible, which is usually much easier said than done. If you enjoyed the original TrackMania and crave an even deeper experience, Canyon will keep you entertained for a long time. If you want a fun, fast, and skill-based online racer with no imbalance or BS, there is no real standout reason not to get this game.			"

												Trackmania is my favorite racing game series... and I have to say that Trackmania2 Canyon is the best game of all Trackmania games IMO! Every Trackmania has the unique car physics and ""area"". In TM2 Canyon you have a car that can drift nicely and obviously the ""area"" is canyon :D. Multiplayer works perfectly and I always find games where is atleast 30 players. Singleplayer campaing is also pretty cool and what the best thing in this game is: you can make your own maps and download others' maps!!! You can do very basic maps or really hardcore maps, depends what you want :).. I highly recommend this game to everyone who likes racing games.And why don't I have many hours on this game on Steam?- Because I've bought this before it came on Steam and played 100+ hours it.

												It's the dullest of the three ""Trackmania 2"" packages, and the blocks/environment are a bit less inspired than the other two, but that doesn't mean this is a bad game.If you're a fan of the TM universe buy it! You won't be disapointed (if you are a fan i definetly recommend getting all the three packages).If you can only buy 2 of the three packages i suggest getting this and Valley, but if you can only get one i suggest ""Valley"".As standard from Nadeo, the game is perfect, and once again the track editor is the best one we could hope for.Amazing graphics, smooth gameplay, hard (as it should be), magnificent editor, vibrant community.A seriously recommended game.

												Easy to pick up and impossible to master. Cars are fast and stunts are big, and this of the other two environments stands out the most. Awesome online community, very friendly. Although this game could seem repetitive, it's presented I a way that makes it nowhere near repetitive. It may be the same cars with the same type of track types, but every individual track finds a way to make itself unique in its own way.The track editor has always been major I track mania games and this version of it is by far my favourite and the best of all of them. With the introduction of these new macroblocks, the possibilities for track creation are limitless. The editor doesn't require any experience, as the simplistic design makes it very user friendly.Graphics are incredible for a game of its time, and I may go as far as saying they are amazing still to this day. 10/10, incredible.

												Great addition to the Trackmania name. Switching from Nations to this, they've added a good deal to the physics: Drifting feels controlled, as opposed to driving on ice. Dirt feels like dirt, now, and the effects of it are apparent enough to strategically account for.The singleplayer is more varied, it seems, and serves as an excellent training ground for the new techniques presented in Canyon. But the heart of the game is in the multiplayer, which includes things I haven't seen in other Trackmanias. It feels like the map-makers of Canyon are more devoted, and more creative, in a lot of cases.If you are new to the series, then Stadium might be a more preferred starting point, but Canyon definitely feels more satisfying. Check it out.			"

												Stadium is better IMO because it has more population, more community generated content, and more persistent playerbase than this game.Racing gameplay here is largely based on drifting.  Note that car acceleration is very high, but handling and grip is poor; you literally glide across the road like wet soap on ceramic.This was the first of the TM2 series, and its also the least polished.  Other games fully exploit the features and such that Trackmania 2 has available.Note that environments are canyons, dirt roads, and sand.  That's it.  There isn't much concrete or manmade aesthetic blocks you can use to create custom, beautiful environments.  As such, its a bit harder to create custom maps for this game.However, this game is beautiful and its fun to play.  It comes 3rd in my recommendations of the Trackmania 2 franchise.			"

												The trailer for TM2: Canyon is somewhat misleading. The video shows dozens of cars in intense races through crazy environments. That can happen, but the online community hasn't taken off with this release. What you will experience is an absolutely consistent skill-oriented precision racing game. You will have to drive and drift as perfectly as possible through tracks that can have huge jumps, wallrides, and loops.Fortunately, the vehicle handling is brilliant. Drifting in Trackmania 2: Canyon is probably the best in any racing game I have played, and you still have the ability to maintain precise control during that drift. This is a game about mastery of a track, where every millisecond matters and mistakes mean restarting the race. Highly recommended.			"

												Aside from the absolute scam of selling us environments one at a time instead of the three pack format of the past games (stadium was originally free to play hence it's stand alone debut) the game is littered with technical problems. Chief being that the promised ability to swap between Canyon, Stadium and Valley at will doesn't actually work right now. It can be somewhat fixed by using the maniaplanet client instead of steam but it is still clunky at best and means a majority of servers will only use a single map type. This is utterly pathetic considering Trackmania united had seven environments all merged together. Visually the game looks a lot better on the Trackmania 2 engine, there’s a load more effects and post processing. The game even has a superficial damage model now which is a nice novelty. Requirements are still fairly low although it has had a definite impact for the lowest end machines so beware if you’re accustomed to playing United on a toaster.The editor this time has a far smaller selection of blocks than past games and this limits track design to a large degree, this has been mostly addressed now but for a long time it was perhaps the worst part of the game, disastrous when trackmania is sold on the concept of players making all the content.Nowadays the problem is the community, the high price tags for individual environments coupled with technical problems from Steam demanding a restart to swap between them leads to a massively fragmented community. Simply put nobody is ever playing, even at peak times it’s rare to find more than a few hundred people playing the game compared to the thousands that United had even without the F2P users.You may at first think this isn’t much of an issue, Trackmania is after all about time trials there is no collision between other cars and there is even a toggle to render players if you find them distracting. So playing on an empty server isn’t as impact as it is on other games. HOWEVER remember that Trackmania has always been about player created maps, they quite literally make for almost all of the content in this game. Fewer people playing means fewer people making maps and less content for everyone involved. Most of the great map makers from united and earlier have simply elected to stay in United if not outright left the series. Overall I simply cannot recommend this game, I want to like it but there are just too many flaws and almost all of them stem from Ubisoft’s utterly insane business model for the latest three instalments in the series. If you are new to the Trackmania games stick with United it simply has more of everything.			"

												Probably the most fun I've had with a racing game since the days of Hot Wheels World Race and Stunt Track. To best enjoy  this game, follow these simple steps:                                                              1. Browse the workshop for any cars or tracks you like                                                             2. Start a race (solo or multiplayer)                                                             3. Initiate Initial D eurobeat                                                             4. Proceed to win every race			"

												I spent 20 dollars only to receive the demo version of the game, just because I didn't buy the other two parts of this....What the hell, Nadeo? Even if the game is good (And trust me, it is), this sort of stuff is just unacceptable.			"

Why should you care about my review?I am a father of two boys, ages 3 and 6 and hold a BA in Game Design (although I work as a database admin - tough to leave a job of 15 years to pursue the ""dream"" of game design with a family to support.) That aside, we use a HTPC with Steam in Big picture Mode launched from XBMC. With a wife and two young ones, everything has to be remote and controller friendly. The games also have to be kid-friendly. If you find yourself in a similar situation and trust the opinion of a trained game designer (but not professionally working at it) - then read on.edit: since I bought the Trackmania three game pack, I am posting the same review in the other two titles as the pros and cons are the same for all (except for Valley, which has a Con unique to itself.)Pros-- The game was cheap. $20 for three games (Stadium, Canyon, and Valley) during the Steam winter sale made this something worth trying out.-- Despite not having an ESRB rating (that I could find anyway), the games are kid friendly. Physics are loose, no bodies are flying out of cars, you can restart at a spawn point on the track, facing the right way (important for the three year old!) at any time you get stuck. I can start a split-screen game and choose a ""playlist"" for the kids to race at the same time. They're happy, I'm happy.-- The game is fun. Stunts, fast cars, loose physics, respawns, tricky tracks, loop tracks, various difficulties, time trials, medals, rankings. And I haven't even tried actual online multi-player yet. I'm not too interested in that part so I won't review that part of the game at this time.-- Game runs smooth. I've experienced no crashes (the game software, not cars!), no jerkiness, graphics are decent, controls on a 360 controller are easy enough for the three year old to win races against his big brother occasionally.Cons-- The interface is severely lacking. Poor design choices abound. To launch the games, Steam launches another launcher (ManiaPlanet). In this new launcher, you see all three games you purchased (after you installed them all). However, if I click on ""Stadium"" from Steam, then decide to play ""Canyon"" in the ManiaPlanet (MP) launcher, it says I have to restart the game I want from Steam. What's the point of this extra layer of launcher then? Stupid design.-- The MP launcher is not controller friendly. This means I have to get the keyboard out just to be able to arrow down to the ""Start Game"" button. You can't hit it with ANY button on a controller. Once that's done, you can use the controller in game, but not in this MP launcher.-- Selecting items using the controller is poor design. Blue text turns a bit ""more blue"" or slightly brighter. Arrows that are white turn slightly brighter when selected. The wife and kids can't tell what the heck they're navigating. I know about this and I can barely see this on a 42"" screen. It's clear the interface is designed only for mouse. The controller does work, but it's not easy to see the navigation. This means I have to setup the game for the kids. I have to get them into the tracks, I have to change playlists (or games if they want to play Stadium for instance.)-- Kids can't get their own profile. I tried setting the game to use ""multiple profiles"" but the feature is nigh-useless. I attempted to create a profile for my eldest so he can have his own rankings or even just his own car model when playing split-screen. I didn't want him to access online so I created a local profile. Now none of the games launch. They say ""You must connect online to launch the game."" I did say LOCAL account didn't I? Again, stupid. So I tried to create a new profile using my already created online account (cause I couldn't get the games to run even by myself before doing this.) The game wouldn't let me do that. Only one key per account it says. I tried creating a new account to the same effect. They want you to buy the game again just so you can use multiple profiles. So to recap, you can't create a local profile without connecting it to an onlne account and you can't create multiple users under one account and you can't create multiple online accounts without buying additional licenses. Stupid.-- Due to the above, the simple feature in almost any racing game, choosing a car skin, can't be done except by the online profile. So my kids playing in split screen have to settle for the plain gray cars and my eldest can't keep his own records and scores.-- Car engine sounds disappear when you select High quality Audio (you have to keep it at normal).-- Some of the tracks are way too difficult for really little ones (not a knock on the game, just something to be aware of.)-- Controls are not consistent between solo play and multiplayer. For example, the respawn button by default is the yellow Y button in solo play. In split screen, you push down (click the button) on the left analog stick. I'd like to remap it as the respawn button on the steering control leads to accidental respawns However, it doesn't seem to ""take"" as it looks like it's tied to profiles, which as mentioned above, I can't create.-- the in-game HUD is awful. Everything is so small it's pointless on a big screen from across the room. Thankfully the kids don't care about this info, they just want to race. Worth noting.ConclusionThere is just too much stupidity in design to overcome for me. So if you find yourself with a media center that also serves as a game machine for the kids and are looking for a fun racing game the little ones can enjoy. I'd consider this title at rock-bottom prices otherwise I'm recommending you go elsewhere. You simply can't do simple things other racing games can, nothing is intuitive, the interface is awful (both menu and during racing). Despite that, once you get a race going, it is fun for the kids. So the core gameplay is ok, it's all the design elements, the spit and polish that surround the game that is severely lacking good design. If you want fun big-screen family room entertainment, local split screen multi-player, racing game - go get Sonic Transformed.If you read this far and are just looking for a single-player or online, match-making, stunt racing, beat the clock game - why did you read my review? Didn't I write at the start this wasn't the perspective? Go check out other reviews that are more your demographic. Since you're still here, all the flaws mentioned above still irk me as a designer, so I'd look for a more realistic racing game than this one if it weren't for my kids and split screen wasn't a factor.Get it on sale, avoid it otherwise.

												I actually liked this game, but I have found a major bug. I installed on an old computer back a while and loved this game, but ended up buying a new computer. Now that I attempt to intall it on a new computer, I am told that the cd key has already been used. I am on the exact same steam and Trackmania account, but I somehow don't own the game anymore? I can still technically play the game, but since I ""do not own it"" I cannot play multiplayer, use workshop mods (half the fun), or play more than an hour a day.I then attempted to ask for help on the steam discussions but all i got was responses from a developer telling me that I should be using the same account, can't log in, or should just ignore the ""cd key has already been used"" message.TL;DR: I can't play this game anymore because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM, and the developer is telling me to ignore it.

												This is a hardcore racing game. By hardcore I mean unforgiving and performance focused. It can be exhilarating once you get in the flow, although the tracks are often too obfuscated for that (made worse by the absence of any minimap and their extreme narrowness). The biggest problem about this game though isn't the game itself but the interface and the ManiaPlanet client which are horrendous. When buying I naively expected to find easy in-client map browsing (which was the reason for my uninformed impulse purchase) but it's sad to see nothing has evolved since the early TM days and browsing and downloading and playing user-made tracks is still a pain in the ♥♥♥. Another non-game related gripe is about the stupid ""1 Mania Planet account per key"" system which means you basically lose your game if you lose your Mania Planet IDs. The menu navigation is pretty bad too.So overall the game in itself is very challenging and fun, but everything around it sucks. My rating is to balance out the positive reviews because I would still recommend it.			"

												I misfired 5 bucks during a sale for this game.This game may not be for everyone, but if you are looking for an arcade racing game (there are not physics like in serious racing games), with one only mode of play (solo time-trials in short crazy tracks), this is your game. Somewhere they say it's a multiplayer game, but what you actually can do is to compare your timing with others worldwide and download those ghost times.I prefer games like DiRT, F1, Forza, etc., where you actually race in realistic tracks and cars, not only for time, but for position and championship points as well.

												Gamers may like it, I may be in the minority, but the tracks aren't fun. I don't like the fact you drive 'blind' on many tracks with no way of knowing where you're supposed to go, and there's better racing games out there.If you like memorizing patterns and having to restart races from scratch several times, this may be for you, but its not my cup of tea.At least I purchased it on a sale an didn't pay full price.

												Hvis du tænker på at købe dette spil eller nogen af de andre så lad vær!Det er lavet som om det er et rigtigt racer spil.Men gassen-bremsen og styringen minder om noget der er set i Mario Kart fra N64 eller Super Nintendo, så det er ikke noget jeg kan anbefale nogen at opleveps. Man kan heller ikke købe / få flere biler eller sætte sin bil op på nogen måde..så i forhold til grid vinder dette klart"" men igen i forholf til Shift2 vinder det spil klart over alle andre racer spil (som jeg har spillet) inklusiv alle GT spil til PS2-3Note: Hehe sjovt nok ligner det et spil som Hot Wheels men det kan man ikke rigtigt sige det er (tror ingen gang billedet de viser er noget fra spillet af) måske concept art man det er da også max!

												I enjoyed the track designer and the paint a car function. Lots to keep you busy there. Awesome scenery and an all around great driving experience. However, you can't customize the cars with new parts; you have to make do with the default mechanics. Also, the pre-made tracks get extremely difficult about halfway through the game. I still recommend Trackmania 2, but I would wait until it gets under $20.			"

												Best of the the 3 pack, bought the 3 pack on sale as at normal price the trackmania games are just too expensive. After trying both stadium and valley, canyon has turned out to be my favourite, it also has the most people playing. Not your typical arcade racing game, just your own skills and the clock, so if thats what you're looking for, definitely get this game!			"

												Trackmania² Canyon is very different from the old Trackmania Nations. If you expect Canyon to be the same as Nations, You'll be in for quite a surprise. If that is positive or negative, you must decide that for yourself. I recommend watching a video on YouTube before making a purchasing decision. Anyway. I loved the old Trackmania, I absolutely adored it, so what happened when I saw this game for the first time? I was stunned. Amazed. How they've made this so different, but keeping the soul. The realism is fantastic. Reflecting vehicles, amazing envoironments, you name it. That is what Ubisoft did all those years. They've redesigned the driving mechanics completely. For the good, they've made drifting possible. And how! They've transformed a precision racing game, into an art. The drifting is magestic. And at the same time redicoulusly awesome.I definitely recommend this game!			"

												Brakes? Where we're going we don't need brakes.This game is all about precision and beating the best times.

												Trackmania 2, much like its predecessors TM1, Sunshine & United, is a build it yourself racing game of the highest calibre.Whilst the singleplayer tracks are there to test your skill & wit as a wannabe spped demon, they also provide you with ideas whether basic or more complex that you can use to make your own tracks in the editor.With a wealth of community made tracks & cars to download TM2 is the most ambitious Trackmania to date by splitting its game into 3 main bodies (Canyon, Stadium & Valley), each of which plays vastly differently and requires a different skillset in order to dominate the world leaderboards.Not much of a creator? Then there is the ever popular online races, fuelled with community based tracks & servers to ensure that the game never ends.Trackmania 2 is the ultimate PC racing game and you would be a fool to miss out.

												Looked forward to this since Trackmania 1. Good update to the original with ""fun"" racing on unrealistic tracks.   Just like slot-car toys when you were young.  Long term playability depends on the community multiplayer maps:  here it's a little disappointing so far, too many technical acrobatic maps and not enough circuit racing maps.   There were some good racing circuits for TM1.  So many maps authors love blind hazards!   Losing interest fast...			"

												Trackmania Canyon is probably the most satisying game of the TrackMania² lot.  The stadium approach of endless boring technical fullspeed maps where all speed gains come from just holding down one button or key for the entire map while sticking to a single ideal race line, both the stock and popular genres of custom made maps in Canyon demand precision drifting through impossibly thin margins at blistering speeds.Nothing comes close to matching the sense of speed and visceral satisfaction this game offers at knocking fractions of a second off of your personal bests.  Or watching your car fly into space after getting intimately familiar with a canyon wall or lamppost.  The time attack format and typical bite sized map length of 30-60 seconds allow for experiences that are challenging without becoming too frustrating, either from the perspective of the new player who's still bouncing off walls or the ladder points nerd trying to get that one perfect run.You should definitely buy this game if you have any interest in going fast.

												Trackmania, a series of racegames, it's definetly underappriciated for what it actually it. Personally is has suprisingly the best handling with the arrow keys in any race games I've played. The tracks are wacky, crazy and never seen in any other race game. Includes a track builder, video editor for making cool movies and even some free DLC to pick up through maniaplanet with new wacky tracks to play. Unnoticed, underappriciated but definetly my favorite racing game series.			"

The improved graphics and visual damage system are spectacular and just what the series needed. The only downsides that I found are that the UI id a little confusing and the game should've come bundeled with stadium and valley like how the original had desert, swamplands, and snow.

Actually I see many games on steam based or inspired on Trackmania 1, and nadeo went with Race and Time Attack only 2 modes in effin trackmania. This game also taught me to listen to the reviews and not buy the game blindly. Disappointed!			"

												After getting the complete version of TM2 during the Steam Winter Fail 2016 (Most of the discounts weren't my cup of tea), I have one thing to say about this game compared to the only other TM game I have played, TM Sunrise.This game will TEST YOU. It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.Complimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.This review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.In the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you  do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed (Maybe).			"

												I played the demo and loved it, I've played other racers that look good visually, but were just unplayable,Some racers have a huge car in the middle of the screen, and it tends to spin round in circles without care,I don't like those sort of racing games.But this plays very well, with no spinning in circles, theres a fine art to drifting rounding the corners, and its awesome when you get it perfect and keep your speed up as you come out of the bend.Its like the early trackmania games, but pimped out, and it doesn't lose it technical driving side.If you like to play against your ghost and go for fastest times, then you legally you have to buy this game.

												Very fun and can be as exciting or relaxing as you want it to be.  Most tracks are time-attack based and theres no penalty for starting the race over and over again until you are satisfied with your finish time.This is a type of game I'll never get bored of.  Tons of workshop tracks and mods.  Multiplayer servers are always available 24/7 which are run by the community.A must buy if you love an arcade racer with fast pace action, death defying stunts, adrenaline pumping tracks and awesome techno background music.It is best played with keyboard or digital arrowpad on your gamepad.  Its not made for analog stick/driving wheel.  There are days when I'm burned out by this game but I find that I keep coming back to it every now and then.			"

												Highly recommended; I've put in alot of hours with Canyon, and Valley as well.  But you have to be in the correct mind-frame.  This is not a normal racing game.  There is no customizing you cars and no collision detection with other cars.  It is about doing short tracks (and some longer ones) over and over, trying to shave a 100th of a second off your time.  If you understand what you're getting into, it is very addictive.  Money very well spent.			"

This game could be huge given how fun it is, the developers just need to create a better user experience and I have no doubt the community would increase 100 fold. The three games - stadium, canyon , & valley are all separate and they shouldn't be!. It isn't possible to do multienvrionment using the game within steam.

												I wish I could recommend this game. I like it, I want to recommend it, but the fact of the matter is that it simply isn't worth the price. Hell, I bought it at 50% off and I still feel like it isn't worth it. The controller support is awkward, but it works. The convoluted set up is just plain silly - this is less a standalone and more a part of a greater game. The interface is far too busy. The player base is incredibly small, but there's still populated servers. My main gripe however, is that even though I'd be expected to pay £16 for this normally and it never goes on sale, the game is covered with bleeding advertisements. Ubisoft, kindly go sodomize yourselves with a spikey metal stick.			"

												Looked forward to this since Trackmania 1. Good update to the original with ""fun"" racing on unrealistic tracks.   Just like slot-car toys when you were young.  Long term playability depends on the community multiplayer maps:  here it's a little disappointing so far, too many technical acrobatic maps and not enough circuit racing maps.   There were some good racing circuits for TM1.  So many maps authors love blind hazards!   Losing interest fast...			"

Bottom line, it's great. Go buy it. Oh, a good 80% of the game is spent upside down, at least in multiplayer. The multiplayer is fantastic as well, and works perfectly.

												TrackMania² Canyon is an arcade style racer that requires skill. You take control of a muscle car and race around mountainous courses while trying to keep your vehicle in one piece. The cars in TrackMania² Canyon are very grippy and oversteer when you want them to. I say this game requires skill due to the fact that you need to use precision driving to get the fastest lap times. TrackMania has always been about precision driving, and this game is no different. The multiplayer is excellent and it's an enjoyable experience. The only downside I can think for this game would have to be the price.This title is well worth the money, but I would wait for a sale to purchase this game.			"

												Trackmania² Canyon is very different from the old Trackmania Nations. If you expect Canyon to be the same as Nations, You'll be in for quite a surprise. If that is positive or negative, you must decide that for yourself. I recommend watching a video on YouTube before making a purchasing decision. Anyway. I loved the old Trackmania, I absolutely adored it, so what happened when I saw this game for the first time? I was stunned. Amazed. How they've made this so different, but keeping the soul. The realism is fantastic. Reflecting vehicles, amazing envoironments, you name it. That is what Ubisoft did all those years. They've redesigned the driving mechanics completely. For the good, they've made drifting possible. And how! They've transformed a precision racing game, into an art. The drifting is magestic. And at the same time redicoulusly awesome.I definitely recommend this game!			"

												First of all: Sorry for my bad English :D...My favourite and my most played game of last three years. Trackmania games are my most played games in my life. What makes this game so enjoyable? ENVINORMENTWell especially for Canyon, theres unique desert envinorment that makes you think ""lol, how desert racing would be fun?"". But if you check some screens or videos, you will see the most interesting race blocks, you ever seen in world of racing games. You will see loops, wallrides, ramps, cars driving huge canyons. There are so many possibilities with making your own track !VEHICLEThis envinorment is about drifting. This cars drifts are so awesome... my english is too bad to tell how great it feels. SINGLE PLAYEROfficial campaign will take few hours to finish... unless you want to get every medal, then it will take more than just few days.MULTIPLAYERNo collisions! Every player you play with on server in the same time are just ghosts. You cant hit them and they cant hit you. Its all just time attack.MORE OPTIONSThis game have so much to offer... so i will just write a list of some things: Track Editor, Car Paint, 2D Skins, 3D skins download or create, custom titles download or create, Friends and Chat ingame system (non-steam), and  much more options.+ Car handling is unbelievebly awesome (at least for me), but hard to master+ Maniaplanet system+ Editor- Time attack race only - no collisions, opponents you can see on servers are just ""ghost"" you can drive through10/10			"

												Trackmania 2, much like its predecessors TM1, Sunshine & United, is a build it yourself racing game of the highest calibre.Whilst the singleplayer tracks are there to test your skill & wit as a wannabe spped demon, they also provide you with ideas whether basic or more complex that you can use to make your own tracks in the editor.With a wealth of community made tracks & cars to download TM2 is the most ambitious Trackmania to date by splitting its game into 3 main bodies (Canyon, Stadium & Valley), each of which plays vastly differently and requires a different skillset in order to dominate the world leaderboards.Not much of a creator? Then there is the ever popular online races, fuelled with community based tracks & servers to ensure that the game never ends.Trackmania 2 is the ultimate PC racing game and you would be a fool to miss out.

												Fantastic racing game. I've generally been a fan of the Trackmania series. In fact I can't decide which is better, canyon or stadium, both are great games. Unfortunately Valley is not and is a real downfall, but this is a review for Canyon so onto that!There are tons of servers you can play from, or single player campaign. There are servers for short maps or longer maps, ultimately you have the option. It is a competitive game and you are always trying to get the best time against others and if you really love a tough competitition, pick this game up! The Europeans really dominate at Trackmania, though that doesn't mean you can't! It's a simple game to play, but a rigorous game to master. In addition I really love the fact that a few milliseconds can mean 1st place or 10th place. It truly is amazing.  There are also ways to change the model of your car and have everyone in the server see your GTR or Lambo. Changing the model is one of my favorite features.			"

												This game is made extremely well, and probably the most polished game made by Ubisoft in the recent years. If you can snag this game in a sale (I got it for $5) it is definately worth it. It's a great game to play alone or with friends and keeps you occupied with constant action, be that trying to get the fastest time on a track or seeing how far off the (gargantuine) map you can get before the map timer runs out.

												For a full in-depth review of the whole TrackMania 2 series, take a look at my TM2: Stadium review.Pros The best competitive racing experience you'll ever get. Canyon physics results in that sweet, sweet drift. Great level editor, as well as built-in replay editor. Really diverse mapping/modding scene. Lightweight, smooth graphics.Cons Will break your Backspace key. The whole ManiaPlanet system has always been awkward in of itself, still is now. Community seems to be dead as of late.Final Rating9.5/10 "

												Trackmania 2 Canyon has a lot of pro's and con's and is only really just getting a thumb's up from me. This is also purely my opinion.Pros:- Good Graphics- Good Car Physics (i.e. good/fun drfiting and handling)- Variety of single player maps- Good multiplayer- I haven't tried Map Making, but I've heard from friends and reading reviews that it's good.- Leaderboards for lap times is excellent, and adds some competitiveness in both single player and multiplayer.Cons:- The only real game mode is time attack, which has no collision with other cars, and is purely just you driving and seeing the 'ghost' of other cars. This makes the game repetitive after a while. There needs to be other game modes like Race or Elimination, with collision. This would add heaps more fun and diversity, and reduce the repetitiveness.- You only get one type of car. This isn't a major problem, but having a few different looking cars just adds more diversity which is good.- As it is TrackMania 2 CANYON, theres only 1 type of environment. Yes this is expcted when buying the game, but once again, this makes the game repetitive, and for $20 you'd expect a little more.- Car customization is very basic, and is still hard to do.  And you're customized skins can't be seen (Unless they download the skin youve made manually) by other players on multiplayer, so you're basically showing off your nice skin to bots on single player.- There's no real atmosphere. Your purely just driving through a track. There's no birds flying around, or planes flying over or anything to add some atmosphere to the game. It's just your car and the track.- This isn't really a con, but, when your car falls into water, theres no splash at all. It just goes into the water and NOTHING happens, you just sink or float.So overall, you're paying $20 to drive 1 car around various tracks, doing the same game mode over and over again. Yes, this is still fun, especially with friends, but the game lacks any real change in pace, and gets repetitive after a while. Overall I would say buy it when it's on special, as it is definitely not worth $20.			"

												As a fan of the original Trackmania who put 500+ hours into the original, I can gladly say this one dosen't disapoint. The improved graphics and visual damage system are spectacular and just what the series needed. The only downsides that I found are that the UI id a little confusing and the game should've come bundeled with stadium and valley like how the original had desert, swamplands, and snow. Sunrise also had city, mediteranian ,and tropics.Summary: 9/10 but should be bundeled with valley and staduim			"

												One of the most online competative racing games availbable for PC. Local and International ranking system is rewarding in all the right ways by encouraging you to race against the world's best and general time spent racing. It offers an outrageously large collection of tracks both pre-made and custom forcing you to both drive well around familar and unfamilar obsticles. Some people may dislike the absence of collision with competitors and lack of car customization options. This game takes pride in itself to be competitive and sacrifices simulation features to get it. Physics collisions are generally hilarious and ""LoL Tracks"" offer a more arcade racing experience.

												I've always been a big fan of the TM. For me, TM2: Canyon is the best TM to date, I really cant put my finger on what really gets me about this particular title, maybe its the pace, the speed or just plain thrills of doing loops at 500 miles an hour.If you're into racing games then you HAVE to try this out. It's a completely new dimension of racing. All in all, I'll give it a hefty 9.5/10 and the only reason why it didn't got a 10 is because the grid size in the editor isn't adjustable. The height limit of the editor leaves much to be desired.The multiplayer is a bit tough if you're starting out(this game is not easy) the time differences between 1st and 2nd places are exceptionally small. I love how you can make your own custom vinyls and put them in the game and did I mention the ludicrous abundance of texture/car/block/track mods available?This game is essentially a keyboard racer's wet dream.Get it!

												I wish I could recommend this game. I like it, I want to recommend it, but the fact of the matter is that it simply isn't worth the price. Hell, I bought it at 50% off and I still feel like it isn't worth it. The controller support is awkward, but it works. The convoluted set up is just plain silly - this is less a standalone and more a part of a greater game. The interface is far too busy. The player base is incredibly small, but there's still populated servers. My main gripe however, is that even though I'd be expected to pay £16 for this normally and it never goes on sale, the game is covered with bleeding advertisements. Ubisoft, kindly go sodomize yourselves with a spikey metal stick.			"

												Looked forward to this since Trackmania 1. Good update to the original with ""fun"" racing on unrealistic tracks.   Just like slot-car toys when you were young.  Long term playability depends on the community multiplayer maps:  here it's a little disappointing so far, too many technical acrobatic maps and not enough circuit racing maps.   There were some good racing circuits for TM1.  So many maps authors love blind hazards!   Losing interest fast...			"

												After getting the complete version of TM2 during the Steam Winter Fail 2016 (Most of the discounts weren't my cup of tea), I have one thing to say about this game compared to the only other TM game I have played, TM Sunrise.This game will TEST YOU. It will test you to no end on your precision and how well you can powerslide without sending your car careening into a lampost. One you get it down, you can get that adrenaline rush that the whole of Sonic The Hedgehog wishes it could give you. Getting medals is also a challenge, even with the lower difficulty tracks. I just go for silver medals in single player, because the golds are basically MLG pro (At least they don't quickscope you the moment you get in the lead). The only problem I see with single player is currently, I don't think you can have multiple opponents to race against. Solo is 1v1 the whole way through (As far as I can tell). The physics are still what you'd expect from trackmania: go fast and you'll win, but you might wind up launching yourself off the track at that bump in the road or fly off at the next dip in the road and put yourself into a roll that costs you your silver medal.Complimenting the challenge is the great aesthetics and performance. My computer runs this game at near perfect frames, and the vibrant color palette (DAT SKYBOX BE DOUBLE-D SEXY) makes the game pop.This review is just based on my completion of all the white-flag challenges, so my experience can't say the same other players.In the end, I say that this is a good installment in the Trackmania franchise, and worth my 20 bucks. I recommend you  do what I did, and grab it before the Steam Winter Fail ends, or wait for the next discount on the franchise. Fans won't be disappointed (Maybe).			"

												This game is fun, but dont expect too much. If u have never played a trackmania game before, you might want to read this. Trackmania players, you already have an idea what it will be like. If you have watched the trailer, it shows cars going around a loop. This is actually super hard to do, because you have to control the car as it goes around. It also switches your view to first person when you go around the loop. The single player is fun, though the multiplayer is better. Would recommend to any racing fan.			"

												If you are looking for a racing game that requires pinpoint accuracy, precision, and timing, combined with some of the most unrealistic, yet beautifully perfect drifting, all into one, here you go. The graphics are beautiful, however you probably won't have the time to appreciate them to their fullest extent while trying to dodge various obstacles or while trying to get that one corner just right. Without having to worry about your car actually colliding with the others, you can focus fully on getting yourself to that finish line as fast as possible, with the added benifit of a major decrease in lag on even the worst internet connections. However, I do have a warning, this game is not easy. If you're the kind of gamer that expects to be instantly good at a game, this game will catch you off guard. Basically, get the demo, play it for a little bit, if you like the driving physics and feel you can put some time into this game, then go ahead and buy it already. However, if you're the type of person who is easily frustrated or you think that you wouldn't really be willing to put an effort into learning the game, stay far FAR away. It's a waste of twenty bucks if you don't think you can take the time to learn it.I recommend this game due to the fact that it is the perfect arcady, pulsepounding, physics breaking racing game that we've needed for a long time.

If you're new to TrackMania, let me say that TrackMania is AWESOME. It is basically a time trial game, but what a game! The driving is not realistic. You will do tight turns, stunts and drifts. You will drive at ridiculous speeds, stack, and try again. You will make a tight, high-speed turn, followed by a jump, fly across an enourmous gulf, land, do a loop, and then crash into a finish line. Or miss, but eventually you will succeed.And then there is the extraordinarily powerful (AND easy to use!!) level editor, which has led to large community of excellent user created tracks and multiplayer servers.

												+ Simple and fun gameplay which is easy to pick up and learn, but hard to master. This is the kind of gameplay that only TrackMania can deliver.+ Very skill-based. No gimmicks or anything, it's all about shaving off milliseconds with precise and skillful driving.+ Good car physics.+ Great graphics.+ User friendly track, car and replay editors.+ Lots of community created content.+ Tolerable community.- Ubisoft decided it'd be a good idea to split the environments into seperate games, which means that the already small player base is also split. This results in emply servers. Usually, there's only about 6 populated servers at a time. They also constantly play ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music on their radio. Better play your own instead.- 5min cooldown on official races. Was this really necessary?- You get only one environment. At a price tag of $20. It's worth it if you like it as much as I do, but I suggest buying it on a sale.8/10. A solid racer.			"

												I am a fan of TrackMania games and this one I really enjoyed as well. Even more customizable track editor with the ability to install mods. Cool racing game all around (far from reality) but I find it fun.			"

												You don't need a review to buy this game, just give your ca$h to these French guyz and pretend to be the most skilled driver in the planet.(And, if you want, download my track.)GAMEPLAY: 9Basically, it's not an uberrealistic game, but it's tons of fun and the editor/user created maps are just wonderful.GRAPHICS: 8Nadeo's engine kicks ♥♥♥, no joke, really light on the specs and amazing to see (except for tress, ""DOOM"" like rotating textures)SOUND: 7Same engine sound for all cars (the model is the same, few variations with downloadable ones), music is trippy and entertaining			"

												I've always been a big fan of the TM. For me, TM2: Canyon is the best TM to date, I really cant put my finger on what really gets me about this particular title, maybe its the pace, the speed or just plain thrills of doing loops at 500 miles an hour.If you're into racing games then you HAVE to try this out. It's a completely new dimension of racing. All in all, I'll give it a hefty 9.5/10 and the only reason why it didn't got a 10 is because the grid size in the editor isn't adjustable. The height limit of the editor leaves much to be desired.The multiplayer is a bit tough if you're starting out(this game is not easy) the time differences between 1st and 2nd places are exceptionally small. I love how you can make your own custom vinyls and put them in the game and did I mention the ludicrous abundance of texture/car/block/track mods available?This game is essentially a keyboard racer's wet dream.Get it!

												One of the most online competative racing games availbable for PC. Local and International ranking system is rewarding in all the right ways by encouraging you to race against the world's best and general time spent racing. It offers an outrageously large collection of tracks both pre-made and custom forcing you to both drive well around familar and unfamilar obsticles. Some people may dislike the absence of collision with competitors and lack of car customization options. This game takes pride in itself to be competitive and sacrifices simulation features to get it. Physics collisions are generally hilarious and ""LoL Tracks"" offer a more arcade racing experience.

												great game. tight physics, creative tracks, REALLY good graphics. Not recommended for people who don't like retrying A LOT. You really have to bust your butt to get the harder maps. I'd rather have them all unlocked. Aside from that, good game..............pisses me off so much			"

												Highly recommended; I've put in alot of hours with Canyon, and Valley as well.  But you have to be in the correct mind-frame.  This is not a normal racing game.  There is no customizing you cars and no collision detection with other cars.  It is about doing short tracks (and some longer ones) over and over, trying to shave a 100th of a second off your time.  If you understand what you're getting into, it is very addictive.  Money very well spent.			"

												I love the TrackMania series of games and spent many an hour on TM Nations Forever from release and after steam launch. So I decided to purchase the whole TM collection, starting with Canyon.And that's where the problems and frustration start. As the trend of negative comments show, the DRM of ManiaPlanet is terrible and far outdated. Firstly, it requires an always online connection, even when ""offline"" mode is selected! Secondly, my old account (and achievements) worked once and after that wouldn't be recognised (even after changing password). Waiting without a reply from TM support for over a week is not really professional and of course re-installing the game does not help as it now gives a ""key is in use"" error!?!All in all, TrackMania Canyon has many positives as an arcade racer (editor) but I cannot recommend a game which uses a third party service (ManiaPlanet) with so many problems and non-existent support. I've spent 30mins in game and over 10x times that scouring the forums (fora?) trying to resolve issues with it. If Nadeo isn't bothered improving their service to support their TrackMania titles, why waste any money on them? In the end I had to request a steam refund.-----TL;DR: TrackMania Canyon is a good fun arcade racer but be prepared to experience many problems with their ""always online"" 3rd party service required. I would suggest to download the free TrackMania Nations Forever and give it a spin ironing out any potential problems first, before splashing out on any of the paid titles. Good luck. "
