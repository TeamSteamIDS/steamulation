												Check out my full review here: https://cassus.org/muut/#!/general:review-billiard-vrHoly cow, everyone should ban together and help me flag this game for it's outrageous brokenness. So unplayable. So very not fun.It's a Holiday Russian cash grab, and so many of the so called “Positive reviews” are all from some bot accounts? WTF?. Everthing about this game should be burned!This game needs to die people.0/10 (you give me a few hours and a bottle of vodka and i can make a better VR Billiard Game)			"

YouTube™ Video: Asset Flippers: BCInteractive

Billiard: VR is an asset flip of the Unity Store package “VR Pool – Sprt Starter Pack” by Sergey Shushunov. BCInteractive or “Berdyev” (Elusive Team) has made a habit of deleting comments, deleting threads, vote botting, fake users, fake reviews, and removal of review code given to other critics when he didn’t like what they had to say. In addition to that, this mimeograph artist has harangued consumers, telling them to kill themselves and referring to them as children whenever someone had something negative to say about his asset flips.I urge you not to purchase this ripoff artist’s cavalcade of crap as all you are doing is supporting a toxic individual who does not deserve your money or your time and who attempts to profit at your expense without introducing any of his own content. He has done this on a dozen titles on Steam and has made insane amounts of money already.The original Unity package can be found here: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/71475The Asset has been discontinued but can be seen here:https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/vr-pool-sport-starter-pack-will-be-removed-soon.430895/ "
