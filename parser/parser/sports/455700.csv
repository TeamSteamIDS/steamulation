												Ok, first things first, I'm a huge animal lover (have a bunch of cats), I hate REAL hunting but this is a video game, so I don't care at all about killing a virtual deer. Just like I don't care about killing a cop in GTA, but pretty sure I would never do that myself in real life nor would I like it if any one else does. Big Buck Hunter Arcade is not real life. The game itself is good. I have all the possible home editions of this series. It doesn't stray to far away from them. If like the others, you'll like this. I only have 2 minor complaints and one big one:1)  Loading take a lot longer than it should (gameplay AND menus)2)  No girls! What? C'mon, why is it ok in your other home games and arcade but not here. Don't understand that decision to leave them out... It just adds to the humor of the whole thing and keeps the atmosphere light. Hard to explain....The big one:Raw input is not supported. So not only can I not use my aimtrak gun during gameplay (fine in menus), I cannot do two players with guns. Not sure of the api exactly, but it's obvious it was designed for xbox pads to give them greater control at the sacrifice of accomodating us gun users. (you can use mouse fine). I also have NO idea how to play with two players - i had a keyboard, mouse, Xbone pad and aimtrak gun connected and all just controlled player 1. Probably need another xbone pad...I'm hopeful they'll patch this thing up and address a few of the issues I highlighted. Regardless, it's still a good, simple pick and play rail/wave shooter. Plus it's cheap, just buy it!			"

												Great game! Seems to be very similar to the Arcade Cabinet games. Unfortunately there are no Cabs in Austria :-( so i have to choose the best compromise. I played it with mouse, but i am looking forward to buy 2 lightguns to play the game with these.There are a few thing i hope it gets improved.- Loading time seems much longer than it should be!- Would be great for lightguns if its possible to hide the rifle (& the thread cross) - It seems there are too few girls :-)- Would be great if its possible to skip the conclusions on the end of each sceneHope the game getting an update!cya			"

												lol, could be a very fun game a classic in the making.A lite hearted shooting game with no real connection to real shooting. But the devs really need to get that the load time down or even a retry button with out loading again, as it so fustrating having to reload the level over and over in the end you just dont bother playing it which is a shame.Also new game modes for the bouns rounds there just to short, like an arcade style endless mode say you mis 5 times  then its game over so it makes you want to play and get higher score.Come on GuysPLEASE FIX			"

												Works Well on windows 7 64 bit with amd 6 core I Love Cat and and dogs and horses, and I love animals. but this is fun to play. And its a arcade perfect port. You cant go wrong. Recomand using a steam controller for its motion controlls.  they need to make more of these. and they need to make a linux port too.			"

												I am only recommending this as a several\few gaming session if you got it cheaply(like in IG bundle). Its basically a cheap on railes shooter with a LOW budget. I think only kids can make this have replay value.Also not mining friendly.MAIN CON:What are those guides for?!?!?!?			"

												6GB and longer loading times than Skyrim? Game's not bad but the UX is. Settings are only accessible from the main menu so you need to quit what you're doing, there's no option to simply replay a challenge; you get kicked back to the main menu and have to wait two minutes for it to reload the same environment you were just in...all in all, needs to be remade, not just shoddily ported 17 years too late.
