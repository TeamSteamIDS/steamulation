												Thx to the developer! Ping Pong League is one of those short haptic games, which need a good or better than good tracking an collusion-system to make fun. For me, PPL reached this goal to 99 % (sometimes i have this feeling that the paddle do not hit the ball, even though i thought that i hit the ball with the paddle - maybe i'm just a bad player). That's why i hope that PPL will get new content: a various amount of stages and gameplay modes, tutorials about different techniques to hit the ball, tournaments, hit-the-ball-vibration, ..			"

												For a free game you can't really go wrong with this one. The physics are pretty decent and it is challenging enough. The only thing I will say is that I would love to see some Oculus support as the menus are pretty hard to navigate with the touch controllers and I have yet to find a way to use the teleport function with the touch. However, that being said, I am enjoying my time in it so far and it is a great time sink.			"

												BEWARE! even though this game may apear to be fun, dont let the free price tag on it fool you! this game is broken. the AI on single player needs to HEAVILY  be nerfed. me and my friend played for OVER 3 HOURS  and couldnt even beat the easiest level! it is not worth the download until these problems have been fixed.

												My first ping pong VR game and i was shocked at how good the physics were. I see my self playing this often from now on. For a free game this is amazing, but the ai is not perfect (only tried medium diffuculty). If the ball goes high they miss it 100% of the time as if their arms arent long enough to reach it. But other than that i love the hell out of this game.			"

												I like this game, but there are weird performance issues when looking anywhere but the playing area, even downward.    And for the A.I., winning is inconsistent... on easy, if you hit the ball in the other player's court, you get the point, on medium, sometimes you get the point, sometimes you don't, and on hard you can basically only WIN by HITTING THE NET or shooting OUT OF BOUNDS without even touching the other player's section. I'm not crazy, there is totally a measurable difference going between the two.     But yeah, if you're planning on only doing easy and/or online, this game is probably one of the most enjoyable vr games with a lot of replayability			"

												First of all, I want to make sure that everyone know that I tried the game on Oculus and as such what I say here only applies to Oculus users.I've played Table tennis since I was a kid and I'm quite good at it. The physics in this sim are quite good for a free game.my issues with the game are the following:-The way the default hold for the racket is extremely bad. I had to hold my controller in a very awkward way to be able to land any hits.-spin hits are almost nonexistent in this game.-I failed to find any multiplayer match in the 30 min or so that I waited for opponent for.-the game gets stuck on the rematch screen every single time I lost a game. had to restart the game after every loss.-Finally, the AI for easy misses 90% of my hits making it pretty much useless. The AI for nomal however is quite good landing hit that i see missing. From the 8 games i did vs normal AI i won 3 but had to put quite a bit of effort into it. I'm sure it will be easier one you paly more, but i see this as an issue when people without experiance in table tennis try to learn here. Easy AI wont teach you anything and Normal AI will kick your♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This game is really fun and I enjoy playing it but there is a major issue that has happened and I wont be playing this game again. When you load up the game for the first time it works great but afvter the 4th time loading it up it almost crashed my computer. IT WOULDNT WORK. Its not my PC because I tried 3 games after this and they worked fine. If they could fix this I would give it a recommend but I simply cant			"

												After playing this for some hours now, I only have a few complaints. The hard AI is easy to beat because it's unable to cope with high lobs. If you lob a shot and it bounces high, the AI acts like a complete goon and misses it altogether, EVERY TIME. Also wide fast serves beat it almost every time. If you can avoid these two instant winners and play more smash hits, the AI proves more competant. Overall, pretty good table tennis sim, for FREE, even better. I use the beta version of OVRdrop to play a movie in VR space above the table while I mindlessly practice my skills. Good stuff.			"

												This is pretty damn good. I own 3 other VR ping pong titles which are all excellent, and this free one is decent enough not to bother with those paid titles if you just fancy a casual smash around. Ping Pong League, understandbly, is not nearly as refined in features as my paid ping pong games, but the physics are on par here. The AI could do with more levels, the jump in difficulty is too extreme in my opinion. Otherwise plays great and dig the setting.			"
