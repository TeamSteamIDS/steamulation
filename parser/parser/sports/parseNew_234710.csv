												I own this on both PS3 and PC and there's nothing much to say aside from that this is a brilliant Poker game with tasteful humour, solid dialogue and a great cast.Main Cast: Sam. (Sam & Max)Max. (Sam & Max)Brock Samson. (The Venture Bros.)Ash Williams. (Army of Darkness)Claptrap. (Borderlands)GLaDOS. (Portal)Reginald Van Winslow. (Tales of Monkey Island)Cameos:Steve the Bandit. (Borderlands)Mad Moxxi. (Borderlands)Doug. (The Walking Dead)Save-Lot Bandit. (The Walking Dead)Waiter. (Gravity Bone.)The Good:- Humour is great. - Voice acting is top notch.- Colourful cast of characters.- Well worth the price of £3.99.- Excellent replayability value.- Unlockable items in both Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.The Bad:- Optimization isn't great. - Some annoying glitches. Such as; achievements not unlocking and items not unlocking properly.- Animation bugs.- Audio bugs.Final Verdict:8.8/10I hope you found this review helpful!			"

												Pros:- Comedy has improved a lot- Gameplay is great- More and better choices of chips, decks, and tables- Great lineup of characters including GLaDOS, Brock Samson, and Sam- Pretty good unlockables for Borderlands 2 and TF2- Very fun and great for killing time (great replay ability)- OMAHA HOLD 'EM IS AN OPTION- The action has increased a bit- Great conversations- Some other pros I forgot aboutCons:- Claptrap's ADHD- Ash's constant bluffing- A tiny bit of bugs that rarely happen9/10. Not perfect, but I definitely recommend this to anyone who knows how to play poker.			"

												Poker Night 2 is a Poker game made by Telltale Games. It is available for €5 and is worth a lot more than that. Poker Night 2 allows you to play Texas Hold'em and Omaha with Sam, Brock, Claptrap and Ash. And to hear the sarcastic lines of science fiction's deadliest A.I., GLaDOS.So what is this game all about? Well, you play as 'The Player' and you play Texas Hold'em with 4 pretty well-known game characters. While you are playing, you can complete quests to unlock Bounties. If you complete all four tasks, one of the characters will use an item to play. If you manage to beat that character you'll get a TF2 and Borderlands 2 item.Furthermore you'll earn chips that you can use to unlock special tables, decks and chips. The Inventory, the casino, will get a different appeance if you use a table, deck and chips of the same theme.I won't explain the rules of Omaha and Texas Hold'em, but i can tell you that this game is really awesome. While you're playing the characters will discuss about life, underwear and other kinds of useless crap. Call, Fold or Raise, and try to beat them all!Verdict--------This game offers a lot of fun for just €5. It has beautiful cinematic graphics, features 4 famous game characters and allows you to play poker without spending more than €5! Do I need to explain this any further? Just buy the freakin' game!This game will keep you in the Inventory for at least 25 hours. If you want to get all decks, cards, tables and unlockable items, you will be staying at the Inventory for 50 hours.Score: 81/100			"

												I wholeheartedly recommend this game as a great way to relax after a long day of work/school.For the most part, the characters around the table are fun and have lots of personality.  If you know their history, its nice to see these licensed characters play poker the way one might imagine.  But even if you've never heard of most of them, you'll come to know them - and their interesting quirks - in short order.Sam is conservative with his betting, almost achingly so.  Ash is just as keen on bluffing as he is on raising the stakes - he *wants* the player to squirm.  Brock comes across as more studious with his bets, but won't hesitate to bet big when he feels he has the advantage; it is fun to just *watch* Brock think.  Claptrap is a wild card, and he knows it; he is fairly easy to intimidate and he seems eager to win the approval of his competitors.  His failures - and constant excuses - will make anyone familar with Borderlands want to hug him....and then hit him in the face.What makes the game particularly fun is that the characters seem to actually enjoy each other's company.  The lines are well read and the timing of their usage accurately reflects the events of the match.  GLaDOS is a perfect addition as supervisor for the evening's events - just as much as the other characters seem to like hanging out together, GLaDOS seems just as eager to be rid of them.  The dynamic works extremely well in keeping the match engaging.As for the poker itself, its pretty conventional stuff; no doubt you've played similar games with similar mechanics before.  But the matches move right along at a good pace, and the ""Showdowns"" are enjoyably tense.  These moments also have the funniest lines, in my opinion.  (...Brock...poor Brock...)In sum, Poker Night 2 is a presentation 'tour de force' with very competent game mechanics.  If you like card games, its not one to be missed.  Oh, and the price is great, too!			"

												I really enjoyed these fantasy charactars talking about their adventures and making whole poker game feel more alive. Poker system is good, it's classic poker and you can play Texas Hold'em or Omaha style., but ifyou just want to play poker this game is not for you, it's frequently interrupted by chatting of other players and you can't do nothing but wait till they finish. So I recommend this game just in purpose to enjoy the scene and atmosphere. Stories and statements are quiet repetitive, but what would you expect, when you are playing 156th game of Poker, just to make your account balance not be in red numbers.Kinda funny and interesting.6/10			"

												A virtual poker game from the Telltale studio, with four characters from different titles, mingled together for your pleasure. And it gives you some items for Team Fortress AND Borderlands 2! Other good thing is what it is a relatively fast full-complete game, where you can get some basic poker skills, if you wasn't familiar with all that poker stuff before.Surprisingly, it is a second game! So I can't be helped but to compare it with the first chapter. Though before I'll drown in the collation, I'll give you some general info.As a virtual poker player simulator, this particular game have many flaws. You have to listen an idle talk of some weird NPC characters, and the most of that talking is amusing at best, and, the worst, it gets repetitive quite fast. To succeed in the game, you need to complete some ""goals"", which can be easily seen as dumb moves. Like struggling for the showdown with only the kicker card, without any combinations... So, eventually, you'll make that goal, but how many times you'll fail miserably in the process? Only Fortune knows.In short, Poker Night 2 almost non-recommended for normal poker game. If only you're not absolutely green in it, so you need a simplistic stuff for getting started.Now, to comparison with the first game:Like Brock (one of the characters there) saying: I guess it's one of those ""take the good with bad"" things...1) Characters. They are much less attractive than in the first game. Less talks (less lines, and especially good lines for every character), less of this ""friendly"" atmosphere, which was created by the predecessor. While I'm usually a big fan of Ash Williams from Evil Dead franchise, I really have to say that it was his worst appearance in the video games (and I've seen them all). Other opponents are also of almost no fun. Brock and Sam have maybe two or three funny lines each, and even Claptrap isn't that shiny thing to save the day.Worst of all, while trying to make them all a better players, Telltale wiseguys do not give them personal characteristics, behavioral patterns, which was a catchy feature of the first game.2) While failed miserably with characters, Telltale has improved other aspects of the game, like: fixed stability issues, added more skins to background, and more little features like ability to order some drinks to your partners, to weaken them... There are much more various music now, visual part is a way updated from the first game.That's more, there you can play not only in the basic Texas Hold'em, but in the Omaha variant of poker as well. Which is good for your poker skill and flexibility of your mind.3) So far it sounds like ""less talk, more action"" stuff, which may be good, if you Just Want to Play a Poker... But alas! For some evil reason they cutted the ability to skip all those fuzzy repetative talks. So, when Claptrap is looping and freezing in the first time, it is fun, sure. But after you hear him 10-20 times, you obviously will be wanting to skip that *beep*. No such luck.I summarize:It is not very good poker game, besides the fact it is easy to adapt and there are an Omaha variant as a plus to the classic hold'em. Play it, if you are getting the items for Tea Fortress or Borderlands 2, or collecting acheievements on gold. But if you are looking for an atmospheric and fun poker game, I suggest to play the first Poker Night game instead. It is better.My mark is 6.2/10.			"

												Rusty Venture used to sell faulty products to S-mart and apparently had a working relationship with Aperture founder Cave Johnson until his disappearance in the 1980s. That seemingly baffling sentence is a good test for gauging how likely you are to enjoy Poker Night 2. If you have no clue what I'm talking about, then it might be best to mosey on. However, if you recognize the references above and laugh at the very thought, then have a seat at the table.Like the original, your enjoyment of Poker Night 2 will depend greatly on how well acquainted you are with the different franchises showing up. The group is a little more eclectic this time around, pulling names from television and film as well as video games. You're now playing cards with Brock Samson, the kill-crazy bodyguard from Adult Swim's Venture Brothers, Claptrap the robot from Borderlands 2, Ash Williams, the cursed warrior from the Evil Dead film series, and Sam, Max's long-suffering talking dog detective partner. To top it off, GLaDOS from the Portal series has dropped in to act as dealer. There's at least as much dialogue as the first game had, and conceivably much more. Themed games (available once the player has unlocked a deck, chips, and table from the same franchise and activated them all at once) include exclusive conversations you wouldn't hear otherwise, and GLaDOS will often interrupt the players to ask if they could hurry up so she could get back to observing her tests. This is a far more volatile group than the original lineup. Brock has a temper that is always threatening to surface (especially when he loses a hand), while Claptrap and GLaDOS both make several remarks about killing humans. Ash seems rather calm, almost dazed, but he's just happy to be away from deadites for a couple hours. And Sam is the most level-headed of the group, even though Max is sitting in the booth behind him trying to throw him off his game.Poker Night 2 has loads of additional content, including a new game mode (Omaha Poker), unlockable decks, chips, and tables for each character that offer new dialogue and a complete redesign of the Inventory (the Sam and Max 25th anniversary set is my personal favorite), and 5 bounty items to collect, one from each player and GLaDOS. The unlocks are gained by spending Inventory tokens earned while playing, while the multitude of unlocks for both Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 get handed out when the player wins another player's bounty item. Unlike the first game, bounty items are not put up randomly, but made available when certain challenges are met in-game. Another change to the bounty mechanic has the item won once the player simply wins the tournament, rather than having to knock out the character who put it up. Cameos and in-jokes abound, some of them pretty freaking obscure. It's a treasure hunt for detail lovers.As before, there is the chance of dialogue repeating. Unfortunately, Telltale did not include a skip option this time around, for no discernible reason. Another letdown is the fact that Ash sounds nothing like himself. Nothing against the actor who voiced him, but why not try harder to get Bruce Campbell? It would've really added to the experience, especially when all the other characters are faithfully recreated down to the original voiceover. Still, this is a dirt cheap title with a fun premise and solid execution, and I for one would like to see it continue. I've even had fun just speculating with other fans online about who should be included in the next installment. If you're a fan of any of the properties that Poker Night 2 has brought together, or if you just want to see what all the fuss is about, you won't regret the purchase. Telltale Games has added more unlocks, more characters, and more dialogue, all for the same price. It's hard to beat such a deal.			"

When you choose a full set of unlockables you've got the themed place with some funny animation after someone's knocked out.+ More characters. The GLaDOS as a dealer is a pure win. Max is still there with even more craziness.+ Percentage of a win possibilities during all-in deal.+ Much more to-the-point achievements. It can take ages to get straight-flush in the Poker Night at The Inventory.+ (Debatable) Much more challenging partners.+ Game lags much less on slow PCs.+ The game process is more fast-paced. "

IntroHey buddy whats up! Seems you got money on you grab a set and relax lets just play some nice friendly games with big watts of cash.What is really good about this game is not the poker itself. Which you can find anywhere on the internet anyhow. CharactersIt is the characters and the humor they bring to the table. The characters were pretty enjoyable to play against and that is its strongest selling point. Yes, if you play enough you will hear repeated dialogue but thats not an issue if you play in small session for the long term replay value say 30 minutes-1 hour a day.PrizesI found earning items and skins to change the style of the environment also a nice touch that adds some value to the overall game. Conclusion I would recommend this to anyone who just wants a quick break from their other games to enjoy hanging out with character personalities in a poker game.			"

Fun for a casual play when you have 5 minutes to spare but often find yourself staying for an hour.Recommended for: Light hearted cardplayers who like these whacky characters from their own franchisesConclusion: 7/10.

												Much like Poker Night at the Inventory (1), this game features a unique gathering of various game characters, who find themselves by a poker table. Poker Night 2 offers a brillaint variety of banter between the players, much like what was seen in the first game, and it ranges anywhere from humerous comments on the other player's history to snide remarks about their deeds - if you think you can enjoy a couple of random game characters getting together and cracking wise at eachother's expense, then this is definitely a game for you. Additionally, unlike the first game, the actual poker gameplay is spot on what you would expect. No weird hangups, no weird glitches where a pair of twos will beat a straight. Definitely recommended for something to do when you feel like playing something casually, or just feel like wasting a couple hours with some humor.			"

This game is especially good for novice poker players to get acquainted with how the game is played, and also for the more experience players to just have fun with. 8.5/10			"

												Poker Night 2 is the sequel to Poker Night at the Inventory. It continues bringing together many popular characters from different video games. This time Poker Night features Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Ash (The Evil Dead), Sam (Sam and Max series) and GLaDOS (Portal) as your dealer.In Poker Night 2 you have the option of playing either Texas hold 'em or Omaha hold 'em. In either case, tournaments start with a $20,000 buy-in.An humorous opening sequence leads you down into the Inventory and introduces the characters. These characters will have fun lines to say on their own, but the real treat is when two or more characters talk with each other.Each character also has a special item that you can win from them that unlocks items in Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.Like in Poker Night at the Inventory the sequel has no multiplayer option, so you always play against the same opponents.The audio gags and discussions are amusing the first time you hear them, but they get annoying when you start hearing the same ones over and over again from one tournament to the next.All in all, if you are looking for a good poker game, then you should try Poker Night 2. The funny conversations and the items you can win make this a fantastic little game.Sounds 7/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Ahh, Poker Night 2. I must admit, I was pretty ecstatic about this before release. This sequel to the original Poker Night at the Inventory combines the personalities of CL4P-TP from the Borderlands series, Ash from the Evil Dead series of movies and video games, Sam from the Sam and Max series GLaDOS from the Portal series, and lastly, Brock (What?) From the Venture Bros. TV Series. (Oh, also, Mad Moxxi from Borderlands is the bartender but she never says anything so ignore her.)Well, I'll just make this short and quick for all of you, just DON'T. This game, in my honest opinion, is just not worth buying. This game is not only a poker game, but it is also meant to be a comedy that you can get a good laugh out of as Poker Night 1 was. In Poker Night 1, I considered the interactions of Tycho (Penny Arcade) and the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) to be truly hilarious. However, this game in particular falls flat as both a poker game and a comedy. Firstly, to me, anyway, most of the lines were simply unfunny. They were either stale jokes that were easy to see coming, or puns. Plus, as if the lines weren't enough to ruin the comedy, there simply aren't enough of them. I can't count how many times I've heard Sam say ""Sure is, exciting, isn't it?"" in a row every single time he placed a bet. As a poker game, I'd say it falls flat in that the bots are far too ridiculous. It seems like every single hand the bots get is simply one card better than yours. For example, I got a flush with both of the cards in my hand, I enter a 1v1 showdown with Brock, who then beats me with a 1 card higher kicker than mine. (In Poker-ese, that's incredibly hard and unlikely.) But, if this was a one-time experience, I could understand it, it's just poor luck. But this seemed to be the case EVERY SINGLE TIME I got a good hand, though it may just be me whining, there seems to be very little reward for being able to read the bot's faces. They seem random, if anything, which in a poker game, is truly ridiculous. I do not recommend this game,»ZCC« Zombie Chicken			"

Short version: 90%Poker Night 2 is s step above the previous game in every way: more banter, better humour and opponent AI… it is simple more fun. It is probably the best poker game for this price, or even any price.Long version:Poker Night 2, just like its predecessor, tries to do what a few other poker games did by enhancing video poker with quality writing. Everyone you meet here is a known character from a known franchise (video games and motion picture alike), and they chat a lot. Their banter is not only full of humour, but somehow manages to feel natural, even when they talk about time travel or demons.The amount of spoken lines is impressive, and it can be boosted further by unlocking character-specific themes which all come with their unique bonus dialogues. This little addition can keep you in the game for quite a long time; it may take up to ten hours to unlock and hear everything.Good dialogues are great, but they couldn’t keep you around if the game is bad. Luckily TellTale managed to program a rather impressive AI for Poker Night 2; an AI that follows the characteristics of your opponents. They all have personalities and play accordingly… they sometimes even give small tells, if you look closely. Naturally they cannot substitute human players, but far as poker games go, Poker Night 2 is probably the best one you can get– and for a rather low price.			"

												This game is a perfect example of ""a joke isn't funny twice"". You'll laugh the first time you hear the dialogue, but after the second, third, and fortieth time, you'll be rolling your eyes and pressing keys on your keyboard trying to find the skip button before you get reminded that there isn’t one.+Free BL2 and TF2 items (honestly the best point to play this game)+Funny mix of characters. In my opinion, a better cast than Poker Night 1. +Banter between characters is funny...the first time (explained below)-Dialogue gets very old, very quickly. This can be unbearable for some of the longer dialogue scenes. Oh, and did I mention they're UNSKIPPABLE?-The same thing above applies to ""tells"" in the game. ""Don't be scared by the chips. Don't be scared by the chips"". - Tells are less common than in Poker Night 1, and more ambiguous-A.I. feels very cheap, moreso than the first game. Even if you have a very good hand, they will most of the time beat you with unbelievable ""god hands"". This is one of my core complaints. Some people may say that I'm whining. It is definitely possible to do well against the A.I., and I've found the correct rhythm to regularly win against the computer. However, doing this requires you to be incredibly defensive. You must play much more conservative in Poker Night 2 in comparison to real life poker games because of the complete BS hands that the computer can get. Even when you have a very high hand, the computer will manage to tie with you. When combined with the gruelingly repetitive dialogue, this game can really feel like a chore for the items. There are hundreds of cheaper poker games out there that simulate the experience much better than this.			"

												Thanks to this game I now have a good idea as to how to play Poker.Initially I never knew how to play any type of poker but Poker Night 2 was just as good as a guide in playing it. Can't say I've mastered the game for sure since your enemies are basically AI and Poker mostly deals with more of bluffs and body language than luck. This game would have been a plus had it had an online multiplayer feature, but i guess this will do.What I enjoyed most about the game were the characters and in-game conversations. They are so funny, especially Glados. Just because of this game I feel like playing Portal 2 and watching the Sam and Max shows as well.Great game....you learn how to play it and have fun whiles playing it. 9/10			"

												This game should have been amazing. Poker Night at the Inventory was fun, and Poker Night 2 theoretically improves on every aspect of that game; the decks, tables, and themes you can purchase in-game are of an even better class than ever before, and Telltale pits you against a whole slew of characters who not only live up to, but surpass those of the first installment. On paper, everything is jolly and lovely. But when you first start up the game, you realize something is wrong...horribly wrong. The effort this game forces you to put in to earn its touted TF2 items is a far cry from the laid back nature of Poker Night 1's system. By the time you've earned the fifth, and arguably best, item the game has to offer, you've trudged through 15 disgusting challenges the game concocts for the sole purpose of extending the longevity of the game, all at the expense of the player's mental health. Any joy you may have derived from listening to the delightfully witty banter of characters such as Claptrap or Brock Samson will quickly turn in to teeth-gnashing fury as you feebly try to find a way to skip past all the fluff just to fail the tournament at a critical moment, with the bounties right out of your reach. What's worse, the items you can earn are intrinsically linked to the Steam achievements for the game, which means that, for the unlucky few out there (yours truly included), playing in offline mode prevents you from reaping your hard earned rewards. The proposed solution to this issue? ""Like we give a ♥♥♥♥, we already got your money, fool. Delete your save and try again"" - Telltale Games and Valve Support. ""P.S. You're our ♥♥♥♥♥ now, LOL""In short, this game can only have concievably been concocted in the deepest wretches of Hell, created through an unholy union between Satan, Cthulhu, and Duma Key, and fashioned from the filthy excrement of a million aborted fetuses. Do yourself a favor and pretend the Poker Night series never made it past the first installment. Even the greatest of masochists would pale at the thought of playing this   inhumane creation.Also, Sam is a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

Posted: January 10, 2015
												So, about a year ago (at the time of writing, anyway) I was up at about 1am on New Year's Day, cider in my glass and I was playing Poker Night at the Inventory 1. It's a quirky game, with colourful visuals, great characters, great dialogue and some neat rewards. Oh, and there's poker. I had never played Texas Hold'em before (to this day, I think it's the only proper card game I've ever played) and after looking up the rules and having the tutorial fill in the blanks, I had a good idea of what to do. So much so, that I bought the sequel to play more and, more importantly, get more items for Team Fortress 2. I'll say it now; Poker Night 2 is definitely better than the first PN. If you haven't played the first one, I'd recommend it, mainly if you play TF2 like me. Now, that's enough backstory. On to the good stuff. (This review might be a bit on the long side).So, once again, you're back at the Inventory, playing poker against 4 colourful characters from various entertainment. The first PN had Strong Bad (Strong Bad), Max (Sam & Max), the Heavy (Team Fortress 2) and Tycho (Penny Arcade). Now, we have Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Ash Williams (Army of Darkness) and Sam (Sam & Max). In my opinion, this is a much better cast. It certainly feels more balanced as opposed to the craziness of the first game. Oh, and did I mention that GLaDOS is the poker table and commentator? I won't explain the rules of poker (the game has another tutorial for that anyway) but I'll list off the features. In PN 1, you would play poker, win different decks and tables and stumble upon a chance to win a TF2 item by beating the retrospective character yourself. This chance was entirely random, so if you only wanted the item (let's face it, that's what we all came for) you would have to keep hitting the 'restart' option and hoping that someone would put their item on the table. When you take into consideration the fact that characters would occasionally fold frequently (I'm looking at YOU, Tycho), this would make the matches rather tedious, as you have to keep trying to make characters bet whilst not making poor decisions and giving them more money (making it even more long and tedious). Thankfully, this system has changed. Now, you complete challenges to have a player place a bounty on the table. Win the tournament and an item for Borderlands 2 and TF2 is yours. Lose the tournament? The item will be back on the table by the next match, no resetting needed. Also, there are new tables, decks, chips and the introduction of themes. Apply all the items in a set and the Inventory gets a BIG visual overhaul, changing the lighting, the background and giving the retrospective character a slight outfit change. There are also special cutscenes and dialogue that occur with these themes, both of which are quite entertaining. Seriously, the cutscenes with Steve in the Borderlands 2 set are some of the funniest moments in this game. More features include a second mode of 'Omaha' poker (again, there's a tutorial) and being able to buy drinks for the other characters, making them reveal 'tells' more often (basically, hints about the strength of their deck Yes, I said DECK). There's also a cheatsheet that covers all the possible hands but if you've learned poker then you'll probably know these.Finally, the dialogue is worth mentioning too, it's that good. It ranges from references, to asking others about their universes and some great humour (particularly with Claptrap). It stops the gameplay from seeming too stale and makes it more entertaining, even if you hear certain lines multiple times (I'M LOOKING AT YOU GLADOS). Now, the game isn't perfect. Some challenges may take time to beat and despite this, the replay value isn't that large. But, for what it is, Poker Night 2 is a solid sequel and a great poker game. If you own TF2/Borderlands 2, played the first PN, or both, pick it up for some good entertainment. 8.5/10			"

												It is just as someone else already pointed out. The game is clearly biased towards the AI, regularly providing them with very strong hands and even dealing cards that have already been played. It seems as if the developers wanted to stretch the game to make sure that players listen to all of the dialoge between the AI characters (which is obviously the actual point of the game). In order to achieve that, they mess with hands probabilities big time, let alone basic logic.As long as you don't care about the actual poker game going on and just want to hear some funny conversations, you will likely enjoy this game for a few hours. However, if you're looking for a competent poker game and assumed Poker Night 2 would deliver that while also offering a fun setting, you'd better give this one a pass.			"

												This game is pretty much what it sells itself as, nothing more or less.  It's a Texas Hold 'Em tournament featuring fictional characters from somewhat recent games, and two cultural characters known from outside gaming.  LucasArts and Telltale veterans Sam and Max, and the damaged robots Claptrap and GLaDOS represent gaming, while Ash from The Evil Dead and Brock from The Venture Bros. round out the group.  Moxxie is the bartender, but you never interact with her.You play as yourself, never seen, against Brock, Claptrap, Ash, and Sam, while GLaDOS hosts and Max messes around off to the side.  The game then pretty much consists of playing Texas Hold 'Em while the characters chat and wisecrack at each other during the game.  While that's pretty much all there is to it, they do say some really funny things.  As you play, you can unlock special items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 by winning hands and completing challenges.  You also earn tokens you can use to buy drinks and themed items like cards, chips, and tables based on the franchises featured.  For me, this is one of the games I play just to wind down, and when I can't sleep.  It's not too involved, it's not risky or complicated, it's just poker.  With video games characters and jokes.  I just wish it wasn't Hold 'Em.			"

												Poker Night 2 is one of those sequels which is mechanically comparable to the preceding title, but more charming and polished. The first game delivered a poker experience with four pop media figures, the second gives you the same, with different figures. The new selection is both more interesting, and better presented, as befits a sequel.The player, voiceless, is ruthlessly teased by their opponents. Brock Samson plays with an appropriate sort of serious absurdity, the most grounded competitor. Claptrap is as annoying as he is in his birth title, and you'll enjoy when he leaves the table. Ashley Williams is so aggressive, you may let Sam handle him. Sam is the cautious, ruthless player who almost always plays his cards.All in all, if you want a more challenging poker experience with better - more varied - dialogue and interaction between the characters, buy Poker Night 2, and have a night to remember. And then another. And another.			"

												Ah Poker Night 2. A poker sim with 5 players total. 4 From Different franchised games plus you the mute. This is a fun little poker game with very unique dialogues featuring Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from borderlands2, Ash WIlliams from Army of Darkness, Also Sam and max tag team this time around. GLADOS is the overseer of your hectic underground illegal poker game mocking you at any chance she gets. Some scenes will make you LOL. The core game is fun and quirky but is missing a lot of features to make this a complete poker game. You are forced to do 5 players  no more no less. There is no online or multiplayer at all. There are a few sets of unlockable decks, chips, and themes  based on each character to add some replayability and try to experience all the dialogue. CPU strategy can be messed around buying them drinks from the bar so they are not always predictable. In the end Poker Night 2 does leave you wanting so much more and proves poker games have a  place on steam. You can't beat its asking price of 5$ 1$ if on a sale. So I deff recommend it even if you don't know poker or only like 1 of the characters.Final Score 7.5/10			"

												My gambling adventure continues on this game..... I remember the days of playing with The Heavy, Strong Bad, Tycho, and Max at The Inventory..... Ahhhhh good guys to play poker with...... (OH WAIT Max is back.... for the conversations xD)Anyway Poker Night 2 is just like the first game except there's new poker players [Brock, Claptrap, Ash, and Sam], (Sam is my most favorite character to play poker with), a new dealer (GLaDOs), trophies, and new poker environment settings based off of the poker players.... Anyway this game is lots of fun and it's a pretty good game to practice before gambling in the real world....... XD Anywho I definitely recommend this game if you're into playing poker.""Poker ain't a game for cowards!"" - Ash Williams			"

												This is how the game works: You get a hand that is hardly ever beaten. The NPC's cards are most likely crap compared to it, at least if you have played some poker you know it's not very likely everybody has better cards than you every single game.Now depending on your playstyle their cards are adjusted by the game to punish you for being too sure of your hand.If you play ""reasonably"", you might get away with your hand and beat all of the others.Doesn't matter how good your hand is or if your winning chance is 99% after you decided to go All In with it, during the next move the game will place cards that definitely beat yours in your opponent's hands. Your winning chance switches from 99% to 1%. This happens on a regular basis. The game just counters your hand and whatever you have, you WILL be punished.Sometimes every NPC has ridiculously good cards to make sure your good cards are countered, which means every single one of them has a Flush, a Full House and so on. But this only happens when you dare to go All In too quickly.If one of the NPCs goes All In though with a 2 and a 7 (yes, this happened) before even the flop is revealed, they win the game with it. So - not fun at all. The lines of every character are terribly annoying and you can't skip them or keep playing during them. It is like watching the same 3 cutscenes again after every move, and some of them are very long. I would play PN1 again, but this game? No way. Just grabbed all the TF2 items and deinstalled forever.			"

												Poker Night 2 is a card game that you are in a league with famous characters from games, namely: Claptrap (Borderlands 2), Brock Samson (The Venture Bros.), Ash (Army of Darkness) and Sam (Sam and Max series). Which is developed and distributed by Telltale Games with release date April 23, 2013.This game is a continuation of Poker Night at the Inventory game, which has the same premise tournament, however the characters involved are others.In gameplay is simple and easy to perform any function, even the biggest problem is to learn the rules of the game, despite having a short tutorial that is very functional.The goal of the game itself is very simple, have the best combination of cards and win the opponents to only have you at the table, that is, the new champion. There is also the missions which completing a number unlocks the chance to win a special item, can say a sort of trophy, and each character has a unique item, these trophies not only count as an advance in the game, but also release exclusive items for players of Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2.In addition to the trophies the game also features unlockable visuals that are purchased with tokens which are earned when making point in the tournament (between 10 and 50 chips) and winning (100 chips).Three modifiable items: chips, the table and the cards.Joining 3 items of a theme change the scenario as a whole and makes the character belonging to use a ""custom"" different.The game despite being a genre where the seriousness tends to be better, ultimately happens several dialogues and comedic interactions, which increase to the character of the scenery. (The other characters also interact with different scenarios). Among the players there are secondary characters as GLaDOS (Portal 1 & 2), Max (Sam and Max series), Steve and Moxxi's (Borderlands 2). Although the only character portal be a sort of secondary, there is also a trophy and setting the same.Things that caught my attention in particular:- Customizable for the game, which give a totally new and more attractive face.- Items and trophies that serve to encourage the player to get 100%.- Several scenes and dialogues that change during gameplay.- I found particularly good addicting game.I picked up this game without any pretense me hold or even being afraid of not being able to go away for never having played Hold'Em or any other for the tournament. I admit that every match was surprised with the amount of dialogues and small scenes, like when I found out everything I told here. After +/- 10 hours, I even I am a little better and I have a fair amount of victories.The matches have about 20 minutes each, but depending on your walk, you can have 10 minutes where you give all in and lose everything, even when the cards are not good you jump several times which may lead to 30 -40 minutes on average.There were few times which I came across an error in the game and despite everything that happened not really detracted from the gameplay: character cross in front of the camera and vr inside and some dialogue hang for about 1 or 2 seconds, however were really times were rare. I think for sure the game is worth it, because I believe so much who is playing the characters, humor them or even learn about a new sport. Will get yes please everyone.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/ .Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.			"

												On sale for less than $2, this game could be dog♥♥♥♥♥♥in a bag and it might still get a positive recommendation... As it turns out, this is actually a brilliant way to spice up a game of virtual Poker.  Great characters, plenty of well done voice acting, interesting unlockables, and good atmosphere (revealing that last card can be very suitably tense).Some of the jokes get old after you hear them over and over, especially the long ones though.Shame it never got DLC to expand the cast of AI players, I wouldn't mind rotating players in and out every now and then.

												If you enjoyed playing Poker Night at the Inventory, then your going to love it's sequel. Taking place at the same old Inventory, only this time it's a game of Texas Hold Em or Omaha against Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from Borderlands 2, Ash Williams from Evil Dead, and Sam from Sam and Max, while the mechanical GLaDOS from Portal acts as the dealer in this game. The gameplay is more challenging this time with more money then the last game, and every so often the players will either try to raise the blinds or go all in, it's a real gamble to see if your going to win or not. The game introduces the Inventory Tokens that act as your currency to buy beer for the players or to purchase Table Felts, Cards, and Chips, as their are 5 Table Sets. Buying drinks will sometimes help the player see their tells while unlocking the Table Sets from a specific theme will give the Inventory a new look, as well as some special dialogue for the characters along with some entertaining eliminations to the players. The exclusive items are back for both TF2 and Borderlands 2, by completing specific tasks, someone will place a Bounty Item on the table in which you have to win the tournament instead of knocking them out to win the item. I recommend playing Omaha to win the Bounty Items as you'll have a better chance in getting a good hand most of the time. Just like it's predecessor, the dialogue is wonderful to listen to, it's not that often you see 3 video game characters, a TV show character and a Film character having a nice friendly and comical chat together. I only had a few issues with this game, mainly the missions you need to complete to unlock a bounty challenge, some of them are simple while others rely on luck to complete them, and that tends to be annoying. And once again, no Online play. But other then that, Poker Night 2 is an epic game and since it's only $5.00 like it's predecessor, it's worth it. Especially when you can unlock Sam's hat in TF2 which is awesome!			"

												I love poker and I'm a big fan of Borderlands and Telltale, what could go wrong? A lot actually.....This game is really frustrating and has nothing to do with poker, the players have no range at all and you don't have any fold equity. One exemple: 3 players with the same stack, 2 of them go all in on a A J 9 flop, the third one then call with 3 6 offsuit (no flush draw possible, no odds whatsoever). No one would ever do that, and it actually happens every two hands on that game. At no point I felt like playing poker or had any pleasure sitting at the table. The characters are not funny, especially when they only have 5 different lines each. So you'll hear them making the same comments again and again.....and again. The pace of the game is very slow, every time someone talk, the game is paused even if the people talking are not in the hand.If you like poker, don't play that game. If you don't know poker and would like to have a taste of it, for the love of god don't play that game and seek any other poker games out there. The only point of playing it would be if you really want the downloadable contents for Borderlands 2 or TF22/10 (1 point for the downloadable contents and 1 point because Claptrap), would fold again			"

												Poker Night 2 is a great improvement on Poker Night 1, offering new opponents, 10 exclusive items (5 for TF2 and 5 for Borderlands 2), items that change the theme of the whole Inventory, the Omaha game mode (I prefer Hold 'Em as a great Hold 'Em hand often becomes a terrible Omaha hand) and GLaDOS AS THE DEALER. The dialogue and animation are even better than the original, and the AI seems to be scarier - rounds rarely end without at least one opponent going all in. A few negatives: quite a lot of typos in the subtitles; Brock's dialogue is a bit quiet sometimes; no options to reduce the amount of chatter; didn't seem to work well with a controller.			"

												This game will frustrate you.This game will seem rigged.This game will put you in imaginary debt.10/10 would lose $100,000 in half an hour again.Review Revision #1:Before reading this edit, bear in mind I play (almost exlusively) the Omaha game mode, which is identical to Texas Hold'Em except you get dealt 4x cards instead of two and you pick two from your hand to make the 5.There are many things wich annoy me about this game. For example:-- There's plenty of dialog in this game that not only gets repetative and annoying, but also is unskippable. This is simply frustrating.-- I don't play a lot of poker outside of this game, nor do I know the probabilities associated with different hands, but the hands will go on seemlingly long streaks of good or bad cards on the same players over serveral hands. What I mean is: you might have bad cards for up to ten or so hands while one or two of the AI have great cards for the hands. Whether or not this is typical of poker, this does get infuriating.-- The AI bet without logic a lot of time. I've seen the AI go all in to $10k - $20k+ on an Ace High hand after the River (5th) card has been delt. Nobody in their right mind goes all in on that much money with only a high card. There are so many other betting discrepancies that it's not funny.-- Going on the above point, the amount of betting that occurs before the first three cards are delt is rediculous. With a $20k buy in on you + 4x AI players, I've seen the pot hit $30k+ before the first three cards are delt. There is no hand worth a pot that much without seeing those first cards.-- The AI don't change their play styles and if you're paying attention even a quarter of the time, it's very predictable who you'll be facing off againt at any given point. For example, I've elimintate 3 out of the 4 AI players many times, but never have I ever not eliminated Ash.-- Another example is early game, Sam folds a lot. I'm not kidding. I've seen a player been busted out and somebody's up $20k+ before he ever makes any bet what-so-ever (apart from the blinds).-- There are too few unlockables and you earn way too many tokens. It is so easy to earn the tockens required to unlock all the skins for the decks, table and room, so you're left with all these excess tokens. The only thing other than those unlocks that you can spend the tockens on is drinks for the other AI players. This is not only fruitless half the time, but also doesn't seem to stem the tide of tockens you earn.-- This is perhaps my biggest complaint: There is not Multiplayer! No multiplayer mode, no online server (dedicated or otherwise), no LAN, no nothing! This means that not only can you not play with your friends, but the game itself gets extremely repetative after while because there's not enough variety in the AI and, as mentioned before, there's problems with the hands delt and the AI betting.As you might be able to tell from my above list, there is so much about this game that annoys me. That being said, I kinda like and kinda dislike how easy it is to grind out all the achievements. Also, it does seem to be a half-decent time filler or TV companion. For example, if you're watching a movie or TV (especially if you're watching it on a second computer monitor), it's a fun enough game to play while watching.Overall, it's not a particullary great game and is definitely lacking (especially in the multiplayer department), but if you can pick it up cheap, then it's definitely worth it. Giving it a 6.5/10			"

												First of all, if you do not like poker, I don't think you will like this game. Don't get me wrong, the poker part of this game is only like 10% of the game.So, if this is a poker game, but the actual poker playing in it is only 10% of this game, what makes this game worth while? One thing: Excellent screenwriters! In this game you play poker against four persons, Claptrap from Borderlands, Sam from Sam & Max, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros and Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams from Evil Dead. These guys have the most amazing and hilarious things to say, and I can honestly say I'm not sure I've heard it all even though I played a lot of hours! The screenwriters in this game have tied together these characters in a way that many other games can't do, and since these are all loveble characters from already known media, you will probably already know them and recognize some things they talk about. The thing that keeps one playing this game is first of all the conversations, but secondly the achievements. when you play against these guys you unlock different boards and enviroment of the room you play in, you also win different ""famous"" items from these guys, so there are quite a few things to do. But yeah, I really recommend this game AS LONG as you enjoy poker.Oh, and did I mention Glados is the one who's the dealer? Great fun!And you get stuff to Borderlands 2 by playing this! It's a win win situation!			"

												First off, let me start with this: This is a great game if you enjoy poker or the personalities of the characters involved, BUT Don't pay full price for it. There simply isn't that much content to justify even a $5 price tag. You only get two poker modes, Texas and Omaha, and the dialogue becomes very repetitive after awhile. You CAN unlock some new dialogue options by winning consistently and buying full sets of unlockables (card decks, chips, and table covers for each character) but the dialogues are still random so the new stuff may take awhile to pop up. The game regularly goes on sale as much as 80% off, which is a very fair price.			"

												Poker Night 2 is a game you want to play if you feel like playing some cards and relaxing a bit. The comments of the NPC's become a bit repetative at times but they are funny and that goes a long way. The action itself is a bit slow paced, mainly because the game takes some time to present you with the NPC's dialogues in between hands. You can however skip to the next hand if it is your turn. The NPC's poker AI isn't all that bad, they can surprise you with some bold and unexpected moves but after a few hours of play you will start to see a pattern. They will occasionally break the pattern though, which makes it exciting. You can collect throphy's and themes for the poker room which is pretty straight forward but fun nonetheless.If you judge this game for what it is (a cool way to play cards and have a laugh) and not for what it isn't (a poker tournament simulator) then you will have a lot of fun playing it.I would give it 7.5 out of 10.

												After playing this game for a couple of games, I think I've finally grasped how the card game 'Poker' works.Every turn, you randomly click buttons on the table, hoping that the dealer tells you that you've succeeded. If you succeed, you are given an ancient and powerful artifact, capable of destroying or enslaving the human race entirely. I have used this to great effect by traveling back in time and enslaving most of an entire race, before I was almost assassinated in my sleep and forced to come back to this era to write this review.Overall I give this game about a 6.8 out of 10, due to the amount of vomiting that has occurred due to rituals involving bear urine and anthrax. I heavily suggest this game to anybody looking to learn how to play Poker.			"

												Most people complain they ruined poker night 2 because it is to hard but I disagree. I feel the harder difficulty made it better because it felt like a game where you really had to spend some time on it to master and unlock things. They also did much better on the AI and the jokes are as great as ever. If you felt poker night 1 was to short you will enjoy this one more.			"

												Poker Night 2 is not your typical type of poker game. It's not about ploughing through those hands per hour and getting as much action in as you can. It's all about attempting to create an atmosphere akin to a game with friends. The most important thing in the game for me, is the characters and how they interact with each other and the player. The game has a lot of dialouge, and there's a few conversations between a couple of the characters, which is a nice change from the odd quip here and there.The addition of a GlaDOS as the dealer is great, I could listen to her speak all day I think. I also like that Moxxi's manning the bar, I was disappointed she didn't even have a word to say though.Overall the characters have a good amount of lines, but not enough. I was getting repeats of the conversations within an hour of playing. I'm sure there's stuff I haven't heard yet, but I can tell that there's not enough dialouge. On the other hand. The game is priced at £3.99. I can't expect the voice acting that we've come to expect in our games.I would've really liked to have seen more characters. Even another two characters would make things more exciting. I don't mind playing short-handed (there's only ever a maximum of 5 players at the table), and having two characters able to rotate in with the rest would make each game feel a little different.The AI has been vastly improved since the preceeding game. The NPCs all seem to have a distinctive style of play, which once figured out makes things a little easier. The tell system is often a complete giveaway. An observant player should never lose a tournament.One thing that hasn't improved from the last game is the horrible UI. It's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥to find the right raise sometimes. I'd love to be able to type in a number, or have incriments of chips I can drag to the table. It does the job, but it could be better. The bounty system is quite fun, being presented with challenges to complete keeps things interesting. I'm enjoying unlocking the chip-sets, decks and felts as I accumulate more tokens based on my performance on each table. One of my favourite features in the game is that if you activate the deck, chip-set and felt from the same set the UI changes to be stylised to match. There's also a couple of other changes, but I wont spoil them for you!Something else that I like is that if you're unfortunate enough to be knocked out you can watch the rest of the game play out. The game will even show you the NPCs cards.Overall, every damning point about the game can be easily defended by it's wonderfully low price. Personally, I would love to have seen a bigger game, even if it was sold at 3-4 times the price. I think they could have increased the price point to $10 and added some more content without losing a considerable amount of sales, but I guess that's not the type of game this is.Bottom line: Casual poker fun with great characters at a great price.

”Hail to the King, baby.” -Ashley WilliamsWith the myriad of video games that have been introduced throughout the years depicting intense scenes of hardship, degradation, and redemption, I am certain there are some characters that would prefer to just take it easy and play some table games every now and then. Poker Night 2 (PN2), the sequel to the ever-popular Poker Night At The Inventory, was published by in 2013 by Telltale Games, and allows the player to ante-in to a one-game poker tournament with individuals the likes of Brock Samson from the Venture Bros.  television show, Claptrap from the Borderlands series, Sam from the classic Sam and Max detective adventures, and-my personal favorite-Ashley Williams from the  Evil Dead/Army of Darkness trilogy. Poker Night 2 is exactly as you expect it to: as a card game computer simulator; there’s really no explanation needed for this. However, this title offers much more than just a deck of cards and green felt.Here are a few reasons to consider Poker Night 2:Gameplay - This title is not so much a continuation of the last episode as it is a familiar experience with a different set of familiar faces. The player is re-invited to the Gallery, the venue for the first game’s setting, to partake in more tournaments with an increase buy-in amount. The player may challenge said opponents to two variations of poker, being Hold’Em and Omaha. There is nothing truly outstanding about the game’s mechanics other than being able to purchase drinks for other competitors to throw them off of their game, though it does have a unique facial-reading system in which the player may gauge the others’ dealt hands by viewing simple responses to them. PN2 primarily utilizes a mouse interface to select options in menus and during tournaments; this is as simple as it can get. Why I added this section, however, is to touch a bit on the other competitors’ ruthless cunning during tournaments. I am usually pretty decent at poker and other card games, but this character cast knocks me down a peg both competitively and morally at times by taking outstanding risks to oust everyone else from the game.Humorous Cast - Along with the stated characters, Mad Moxxi from the Borderlands tends the bar, Portal’s GLaDOS is the card dealer, Tales from Monkey Island’s Reginald Van Winslow reprises his role as the Inventory’s host, and Max-Sam’s faithful partner and competitor in the first Poker Night-sits idly by, awaiting moments to add to the comedic dialogue exchanges; a random bandit from Borderlands named Steve also makes appearances from time to time, but mostly remains hidden from the scenes. Each individual around the table converses with one-another fluidly, and intriguing conversations arise both about the game at hand and of everyday lives, such as Brock Samson’s mentioning of his employers or Sam and Max respectively spouting back and forth. These witty exchanges remove much of the tension from each session so that the tournament simply feels like a friendly game among friends.Unlockables - Poker Night 2, similar to the original, features content that may be revealed through play. After each session, whether the player won or lost, tokens are earned that may go toward purchasing various themed table felts, chips, cards, or alcoholic beverages during games-which simplify the ‘tells’ from the opposition. Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 also benefit from Poker Night 2, as players may equip items such as Sam’s signature hat in TF2 and Brock Samson’s haircut for the Gunzerker in Borderlands 2, respectively; these unique articles are rewarded for obtaining Bounties, challenge items unique to each character’s respective games.TL:DR - Though not complex, this title can be extremely cut-throat in nature, especially when there are few remaining players. Conversation is intriguing given it is between various characters that will very likely never meet again, and livens up the play experience with quirky yet witty lines. I highly recommend this title to anyone who enjoys playing table games with brutal adversaries. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews.

												Even though I did not play any other game which the characters are in (I own Borderland but haven't got the will to play it), I still really enjoy the game.

												This is by far the best video poker game I've ever played, it easily teaches how to play poker as you play, the AI is the most challenging and most complex yet, and you feel like you are actually there in the scenario, playing poker with real people, only the people you play against are iconic pop culture characters.The characters have an endless amount of dialouges, but once you play about 20 matches they say the same thing every time, another problem i have with this game is that you don't get to be a certain character, you're always known as ""that guy who's mute"" you don't really get to establish a friendship with the characters like in other TTG games (then again, this game mocks you for being a nerd playing virtual poker).This game is certainly great, it's a shame it's overshadowed by it's partnership with Team Fortress 2 items, it is honestly a great game to play besides getting those TF2 items.If you love poker, this is a must have, far more better than Poker Night 1.TL;DR Very complex and puzzling AI, easy to adapt inside the game and just fun poker time, dialouge gets overused when it runs out and you don't get to have a character as a protagonist for a game that immerses you in a virtual reality.Just buy it.

												This game is good.  Not great mind you, but good.  Anyone who has spent a significant time playing poker in the real world and then attempted to play it in video games would tell you that most poker video games are crap.  This makes sense, as trying to replicate the human mind as it plays poker would prove difficult.  Consequently, most poker AI is overly simplistic and not true to life.  This game is no different in that sense, but thankfully it's still an improvement from the previous installment.  The AI is a little off at times, but for the most part the computer players play a solid game and aren't prone to the ridiculous aggression found in the previous installment.  That being said, the betting is still off as it's quite common for a computer player to open a pot with a bet that's 10x the current pot.  If you have a good hand and are trying to get action that makes no sense, and if you have a marginal hand and are bluffing then why not go all in?  It's a confusing play that happens often.  Thankfully, the characters and banter are a huge improvement over the previous game (which was already quite good in that department).  The number of comments from characters and the various unique interactions between them makes this game less repetitive than the previous one.  Overall this game is a good one, but I still long for the day when we're able to better program poker AI.  This is likely the best poker game on Steam at the moment, but it's a 7/10 as far as I'm concerned.			"

 A Poker Game With Unusual Friends.What To Expect From This Game?This game is about gambling $20,000.00 against some irregular players in a game of poker. Your opponents will frown, laugh, chat, bluff and make threats in order to win the tournament. There are two modes of Poker to play for each tournament that will offer new challenges and achievements to complete. When the player successfully completes a tournament, money will be won, tokens to be gained and a possible prized trophy to be received. The player will laugh or cry and possibly kiss his/her money goodbye.What Are The Pros Of This Game?  Movie/Cartoon/Game Characters (Original Voice Actors)  Good Game Controls  Good Graphics  Fun & Entertaining Conversations  Alternate Setting Changes  Alternate Elimination SequencesWhat Are The Cons Of This Game?  Limited Players (No Variety Of Characters To Play Against)  No Conversation Interaction With Players  Repetitive Conversations  Opponents Have Higher Luck Advantages  Empty Threats  No Fighting (Who Wouldn't Enjoy Seeing Brock VS Ash)Would You Recommend This Game?Yes, I recommend this game for the fans of the characters in this game. It is interesting to see such characters interact with one another, but it is a shame the player (he or she) cannot engage in conversation or interact with them too. Puchasing drinks for other players is the only interaction with the characters in this game. I know this game is purposely released as a ""Poker"" game, but the developers could of enable more options for the player to interact by asking or answering questions or get into a brawl. However, the game does very well of being a simple card game simulator. My other complaint is there should of been more opponents to play against other than Ash, Brock, Claptrap and Sam. **Game Tip: Expect to ""Fold"" a lot in this game due to bad hand dealt to player percentages.Fold, Bet, Raise or All-In For A Game Of Poker !!!

												It's poker with all new characters and unlockables, what more do you want ? Well, for starters, I wish I knew how to play poker. Properly.The characters and environments are pretty sweet looking and the voice acting is superb. But since it's a poker game you'll probably have heard all the lines after only one hour has passed. And let me tell you, there are a lot of conversations. At times I just wanted everyone to shut up so I could play in peace.But, for a price this low I can only recommend it, especially if you know how to play cards (and enjoy it at the same time). If you loved the first one there's no doubt you'll love the second one as well.[Rating: 77/100]			"

Poker Night 2 does have better characters (imo) but doesnt utilize them correctly. There isnt enough good conversations. Sure there are few, but those will pop up very rarely. Now lets talk about the ""Play to Win!' mechanic. The way to win items is so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its not even funny. First you have to complete three objectives, and then you have to win an entire tournament for one (or two depending on if you have b2 and tf2) item. Doesnt seem hard, but it really is.

												While I've very much enjoyed the original Poker Night at the Inventory, it's sequel, Poker Night 2, is generally quite lackluster and omits vital customizations included with its predecessor. First and foremost, you can no longer skip the table chat and cannot change the amount of discussion by the other players. While amusing at first, it doesn't take long to exhaust the included dialogue, leading to hearing the exact same gags game after game after game. There's also the bizarre choice by the developers to include Ash from the Evil Dead film series, yet the character isn't voiced by Bruce Campbell. Instead we're treated to a thoroughly awful impersonation, both in terms of performance and writing. Furthermore, the way they use Claptrap makes me even less likely go any further with Borderlands, though in part this stems from how often he repeats himself, yet never shuts up. The high point of the game would be GLADOS from the Portal series, handling the job of dealer. Sadly that doesn't do too much for me when I really dislike most of the other players. Sam from Sam & Max is cool, but as is true to his character, also rather low key. I really thought this would be an excellent sequel, but I'm disappointed to say that I'll be keeping Poker Night at the Inventory as my default casual poker game and will merely make use of Poker Night 2 on rare occasions when I feel like something different. One and a half stars out of four.			"

												A huge step down from the previous Poker Night game. Jokes are constantly recycled, the AI is awful and makes weird moves like going all in on the first hand of a tournament, and the writing just isn't as good as the previous game. Just stick with the first game unless you really want the DLC for TF2 and Borderlands 2.			"

												Ahh Poker. A game for great war heros, not tiny baby men. You, the player, must face off your age old nemsis, the A.I., in a high stakes showdown for honor, glory, and  helluva bunch of virtual chippies. Face off against iconic characters like Claptrap from Borderlands, Sam from Sam & Max, and GLaDOS from Portal, and prove to them your the richer man (Unlike me, who's 300,000 dollars broke). Win awesome prizes and rewards for bonus content in Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands. Show lady luck that you don't need her to win! (Oh, and there's also Omaha but I have no idea what that is but PLAY IT ANYWAYS).Without a doubt, this game scores very high on the list of games that probably died and went to valhalla.                                                                                                                                                                        ~THEHAMMERNOOB			"

												The reason you're playing a Poker Night game is for the characters, and Poker Night 2's cast is excellent. Claptrap is at his annoying best, Sam (and Max, from the bench) are amusingly absurd, Ash is as smooth as he was in Evil Dead, and Brock is voiced impeccably - and aggressively - by Patrick Warburton. The dealer, namely Glados, is at her acerbic best, humiliating and degrading at every opportunity. If those characters sound like fun to you, you'll have an enjoyable poker sim to play.As for the unlocks, while I can't speak for the Team Fortress 2 items, the Borderlands 2 items are excellent and humorous. Playing as a human-sized turret from Portal is worth the price of admission by itself.Note to achievement hunters and perfectionists: unlike the last Poker Night game, the achievements in PN2 are all fair (Poker Night 1 required a victory by straight flush for its final achievement, a 72,192 : 1 chance).

												Poker Night 2 is another excellent title from Telltale; they did a great job with the banter and captured the character personalities quite well. The voice acting is good and the interacting between characters doesn't seem forced. My only criticism would be the character AIs seem to respond to stimulus the same - it would be cool if Brock did more bluffing than Claptrap (for instance). I also did some experimenting and the computer responds the same regardless of the player's actions from hand to hand. If they wanted this game or a certain character to be really top-notch they should use some kind of Markov model to evaluate player actions. In any case this is a great choice for some casual gaming on a laptop or when you want to be able to walk away from a game for minutes or hours at a time during play. 8/10 for a casual title.			"

												Do you like card games? Do you even consider yourself a cardshark, able to take off the most skilled bluffers and gamblers singlehandedly? Well try out this Poker game by Tell Tale Games. If you beat it, you can feel not robbed... but reconsider, they might rob you off your time. The personas in this game are well drawn, and very coherent in their behavioural patterns. As soon as you have learned what specific sentences or motions mean, you'll know when they are bluffing. This game is fun to play, as long as you don't overdo it, playing more than a tournament a day doesn't do anything good. The achievements in this game are a gift, they are reached easily most of the time - that is, if you don't blunder on an epic scale.I recomend this game to all people who like a good set of cards, and to friends of Evil Dead, Sam & Max, Borderland-Series, Portal... Oh, yes I have forgotten Brock ^^ Well - never mind.			"

TL;DR nutshell - Fun poker game, great music (why can't it be purchased? *sad panda face*), fun dialogue, better than the first installment.  Downside is that it's pretty short, and the dialogue gets really repetitive.The ""Once she drinks coffee, she doesn't shut up for hours"" version:It's a decent game from Tell Tale.  We have the murder-machine Brock Samson from Venture Bros (highly recommended show to watch), the ever obnoxiously annoying CL4P-TP unit from the Borderlands franchise (play the games, they're fun), Ashley Williams from the Evil Dead franchise (I don't like horror so no opinion), and Sam from the Sam and Max franchise all together at the same table, being taunted and experimented on by with GLaDOS as your dealer.There are five challenges in total to get through to get the downloadable unlocks, and five felt/chip/card combos to get which have their own set of stories to go with them that don't appear if you only have one or two unlocks on.  The possible challenges are funny, as I don't know if I can actually deploy ninjas, want to take an asprin and call someone in the morning or do the hokey pokey.  Some are challenging as all get out, like ""Win with only a high card"".  This time around, there is no difficulty setting, which I found disappointing.  The music is amazing, especially the slow piano version of ""Still Alive"", and the variations on all of the theme tunes, like the opening theme to Borderlands 2 ""No Heroes"".The two complaints I really have are these: 1) the game is far too short, and getting the unlocks are too easy for the most part.  I end up deleting all of the saves and starting over, just to keep it interesting.2) they could have recorded a lot more dialogue, especially for GLaDOS.  Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is really funny, but to be told ""Well, that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior"" over and over and over and over and over again gets old fast.  That and their reactions to you going all in.It took a while for me to get the rules of Omaha, but I finally got it figured out.  Now, if I could only get into a showdown with someone other than Sam...Poker Night 2 is a good game to play while eating supper, or killing a few minutes before you have to leave.  It's not in any way a ""great"" game, but just a, ""Meh, I'll play this to murder some minutes while I eat/wait"".			"

												EXTREMELY WORTH BUYING. A HALOVER9000 BEST BUY. for what that's worth.Mouse-only. For this alone, it is a good game. Go ahead and read this, because you don't have a life. Nor do I. The review gives: Why One Might Buy, Should I Buy, How To Win, and Bonuses.Be honest; many of us now game instead of watch movies or infomercials to fall asleep. Mouse-only is crucial then, as well as when wanting to Let Her Sleep, or when encumbered with the flu.Then there are those who relish the mashup in music, the homages (pronounced oh-MAHH-zhes) to predecessors in science-fiction movies, and cross-cultural expansions in gaming. This game, like Poker Night At The Inventory, directly uses other iconoclasts from other games and media. Seeing them interact, regardless of your opinion of some of them, is good for dozens of hours of entertainment.OK, for poker, it's a bit tougher than other games.........Several of the players are cavalier, and at least one is as cold as steel. Hence, drink tokens. They're not just useful for seeing Moxxi's lady parts walk by. One can earn, and spend selectively, drink tokens to instantly change much of the other players' conducts and rule systems.OK, for poker, then it can be a bit easier than other games........BONUSES: Winning drops up to 5 Team-Fortress-2 items. Winning also drops up to 5 skins/accessories for Borderlands-2. Winning a Borderlands-2-themed tournament also gives an extra Badass Rank point to spend in BL2. And A Perfect Steam Achivement Game might be easier than with other games. I'm a Waaay Casual Gamer, and I have all but one Steam Achievement on this game.At five bucks each, both Poker Nights are worth it. At $2.49, you should be buying both on the spot. And, if they're ever 99 cents again, it's a NO-BRAINER.I'm Hal Over 9000; I'm nobody; this is me caring about you.			"

												First impression review!After replaying the first Poker Night at the Inventory, I decided to go ahead and get the second one during a sale. These are my first impressions of the game.First off, the atmosphere seems a bit less cozy, the chatter amount can't be changed nor can you skip the chats. I do find the new characters a bit dissapointing compared to the older crew, who felt a lot livier and these just throw more mean snarks and remarks instead of fully chatting with eachother. Although I do like the inclusion of GlaDOS as dealer, she's just an awesome dealer with the right amount of evil. Sam definitely makes more jokes with his partner compared to Max in part one, which is also nice.The poker itself felt as good as always with a better unlocking system than the previous one. The ability to buy the ones you want makes it a lot more rewarding. Since you don't have to wait for the ones you really want. There is a new gamemode, Omaha, but I haven't touched that one yet. Overall, the game still feels fresh and fun if you're bored of the first one. It has new jokes, new characters and new visual flair to unlock. There are a few things downgrades compared to the other one (unskippable stuff, lesser settings etc) but they're not too bothersome. So if you're a fan of the first, go ahead and try it out!			"

												I can't honestly say I'm that big of a poker player, but I do know how the game works and I think I safetly say that this is a pretty solid game.At only five dollars there is so much value here because it just isn't a simple poker game. Telltale has taken their IP's and in cooperation with Valve combined all the different characters from their games into a very entertaining game. Their care with regards to character, story telling and good writing really shows and make this game a the stand out that it is. Because without the funny dialogue this game could have so easily gone the other way and been utterly terrible.A more detailed review for a game that doesn't need a more detailed review can be found on my blog here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2013/09/poker-night-2.html.

												In all honesty if you want this game because it's poker it's a very poor game. It constantly reads the hand you have incorrectly - many many times I would have a straight or full-house but it'd only see a pair or two-pair. You'll be face palming so often your head will start to concave. Seriously how did this even pass play testing?If you want it for the TF2 and BL2 achievement items it's... alright? The items are only for looks. Which isn't really a bad thing. Some look better than others. Overall that's the main reason I keep playing it. I feel the items are needed to get my money's worth.The meaty part of this game though really is the characters. That part gets a 10/10. GLaDOS especially is hilarious. The only reason I recommend it is for the character appeal. It feels like you're really sitting down with some stars and not in front of a bunch of computers.If you know how to play poker this game will leave you infuriated at it's faulty programming. If you don't know how to play poker this game will confuse you even more, but you'll be less infuriated.			"

												The game Poker Night 2 is a quirky humor based poker game where you can play texas or omaha hold 'em. The game is simplistic and incredibly fun. The whole thing starts out with a basic intro to poker familiarizing you with all the different hands and basic winning strategies. While most play these games for the acheivement items you'll find yourself so unintentionally sucked in by it's charm that items will come without effort. The game RARELY has issues and the issues I'm talking about are things like an important flop being dealt that will skip some dialougue but the game tries to keep things like that at a minimum. All in all poker night 2 is a hallarious game that is without a doubt worth the 5 bucks it costs. BUY THIS GAME			"

												6.9/10 - Improvement on the Original in all areas.The first Poker Night really didn't do it for me; it felt incomplete and way too easy! This one however improves everything and closes those gaps from the first.If you like casual poker this is a good buy for $5.This installment has tournaments, stats, achievements and some pretty fun gameplay. You can also use your earnings to purchase decks, chips and various table felts. It DOES get annoying listening to the competition banter. Sometimes they will go on for quite a bit and as far as I know you can't skip it. It's like trying too hard to be funny and create additional interest. Overall; this is a fun poker offering. Worth $5. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more. Free Keys and Reviews weekly!

												Poke Night 2, the sequel to the first Poker Night. I have mixed emotions about this game. For one, this game IS fun, but can get boring quickly and repetitive. Most people get this game for ""Team Fortress 2"" or ""Borderlands"" items. Lets start off with me saying that the first Poker Night didn't work on my OS even though it said it would. This, however, does work (Macbook Pro, Yosemite). This game IS self explanitory. It's basically just playing Texas Hold em'. Over. And over again.Really, theres not much to say. Get the game ONLY if you want to play cards alot OR to earn items for different games, even though it will take a while. If you are a nub like me, you wouldn't know how to play Texas Hold Em'. If you don't, don't get this game. Seriously, unless you want to take the time to learn.I do NOT recommend this repetetive game. Go out and play cards in real life with your friends and or family members. I rate this 4.5/10. Even though this game is on sale, I rather save my money for something else.			"

												A fun game with bad poker mechanics, mostly amusing characters (I can barely stand Claptrap in the Borderlands series, he isn't much better here), and a bounty/unlockable reward system that half works. The challenge system for gaining the opportunity to unlock bounties is a step-up from the RNG of the last game (which lead to me restarting until I got bounty games after the dialogue became stale). GLaDOS is excellent as always, and having her as the dealer was a wise move.When it comes down to it though, actual poker players say it's nothing like playing poker, and the unlockable bounties for Borderlands 2 straight up don't work; it's possible to get them if you contact Gearbox support, but I think when you have to open a ticket to recieve what is debateably the biggest selling point of the game, the product is fundamentally flawed.This isn't a game for poker players or collectors.

												I don't know what it is, but there's something magical about this game that makes me enjoy it so much. It's very odd, given the circumstances, I would have thought I'd never get this addicted to a simple card game, and it doesn't help that before playing this, I didn't play card games at all. As I started to play the game more, however, I started getting the hang of how things worked in Texas Hold 'Em and I started developing stradegies. Now, I'm the only one in my family that can play poker, and I won't let them forget that. I've been constantly asking members of my family to learn how to play so I could have someone to play with instead of the computer, and my addiction was only taken further when I started learning other card games outside of poker. I know the story I just told was a little off-topic, but it's a big factor in what made me like this game so much. Poker just got addicting to me, and I'd just keep coming back to this game which some could argue is repetitive.That's just my personal opinion though, I think poker is really fun. If you want an action-packed game with tons of variety, you're not going to find it here. It's just poker. Still, there are some things about this game that sets it aside from playing real poker. The fact that they were able to get together a wide variety of interesting characters with comedic personalities is great, and the conversations between the characters really sets a great atmosphere. The problem with this is, the conversations repeat. A lot. The jokes are funny, but you won't be laughing at them by the 40th time they're told.I also like how this game rewards you for accomplishing things. You'll win not just virtual money, but also items and accessories in Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. So that's pretty cool.Oh, and GLADoS is the dealer. You can't go wrong there.In my personal opinion, I'd give this game a 9/10. It's very fun and addicting, and the characters that you play with are great. I'd recommend this to anybody who plays poker.			"

												I actually really liked this game.It improved a lot on its predecessor - I especially liked the customizable environments which produced some different KO's when a player went bust.Playable characters arguably not as interesting, but the inclusion of GlaDOS more than made up for it.Most people picked this game up to get some TF2 items, I liked that the gameplay was a bit more mixed up and that you had to complete certain achievements to progress and get an item.On a side note, there's a common hack/cheat with Steam Achievement Manager which people used to get the item w/o completing the game, because apparently virtual texas hold'em is too difficult. sheesh			"

												Let's compare to Poker Night 1: The dialogue started repeating much earlier, and you're no longer allowed to skip it. On the other hand, there were a couple of conversation arcs which were apprently set up to take place over the course of several sessions of play, which was interesting. I didn't suspect I'd like the cast of characters as much as the original, especially the guys on the right, but everybody turned out to be pretty likeable. There are still table, card and now chip style unlocks, and you don't need to win games to get them; instead, you're given three random 'challenges' which usually aren't too horrible, and then completing these challenges and winning a game unlocks cool stuff for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. I guess it is a better system than the previous. Unlocking matching club motif sets actually changes the whole Inventory's look to that theme, such as a Borderlands one and a Portal one, and that was pretty cool. The AI now seems to cheat like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way more than I remember.Uuuuhhhh you know what, I'll just call it about even. Even if this one doesn't have Heavy Weapons Guy in it. Actually I was kinda hoping for the Engineer this time.			"

												I don't know what it is, but there's something magical about this game that makes me enjoy it so much. It's very odd, given the circumstances, I would have thought I'd never get this addicted to a simple card game, and it doesn't help that before playing this, I didn't play card games at all. As I started to play the game more, however, I started getting the hang of how things worked in Texas Hold 'Em and I started developing stradegies. Now, I'm the only one in my family that can play poker, and I won't let them forget that. I've been constantly asking members of my family to learn how to play so I could have someone to play with instead of the computer, and my addiction was only taken further when I started learning other card games outside of poker. I know the story I just told was a little off-topic, but it's a big factor in what made me like this game so much. Poker just got addicting to me, and I'd just keep coming back to this game which some could argue is repetitive.That's just my personal opinion though, I think poker is really fun. If you want an action-packed game with tons of variety, you're not going to find it here. It's just poker. Still, there are some things about this game that sets it aside from playing real poker. The fact that they were able to get together a wide variety of interesting characters with comedic personalities is great, and the conversations between the characters really sets a great atmosphere. The problem with this is, the conversations repeat. A lot. The jokes are funny, but you won't be laughing at them by the 40th time they're told.I also like how this game rewards you for accomplishing things. You'll win not just virtual money, but also items and accessories in Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. So that's pretty cool.Oh, and GLADoS is the dealer. You can't go wrong there.In my personal opinion, I'd give this game a 9/10. It's very fun and addicting, and the characters that you play with are great. I'd recommend this to anybody who plays poker.			"

Click Here for the Full Review! [monthsbehindreviews.blogspot.com]Synopsis: A fun game that expands upon the original by including an additional play mode - Omaha style poker. In addition, the AI system has be revamped and over all this game is much more difficult than it's predecessor.  The unlock system has also been improved, both for in game items like tables, cards, and chips, as well as the cross promotional items that you'll get for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. There are some flaws here though, particularly a fringe case in the item unlock system that will make you want to break something, and an AI that seems to get far too lucky on the final card. Still, not a bad game to pick up and play in 20-30 minute increments.The amount of time you can get out of this one varies based on how good/lucky you are, and just what it is you expect to get out of the game. I put in 15 hours or so to get everything in game and all but one achievement, which I could probably have in the next hour or so. I've rated it a 7/10, and recommend picking it up at $2.50, though I have seen it as low as $0.99.			"

												I liked Poker Night 2's bounty system, and the banter is always good, but this actually felt like a step backward from the first game. Not being able to control how talkable the characters are is a feature that was sorely missing.And the characters themselves seemed a bit less interesting. In general I felt like they had fewer lines of dialogue and repeated themselves more. There was also a distinctive feeling of the AI cheating on the final card flip. There were some incredibly unlikely outcomes that kept happening hand after hand after hand.So at the end of the day if you like playing poker against an AI you'll like this, but I actually think the first one is the better of the two.

I love this title and I know that I could easily hop back into it to play poker with some really amazing and hilarious characters. It has wit, humour, visuals and plenty of great moments. The unlocks are fantastic, the gameplay gets you hooked and most of all it's the conversations and unique 'themed' poker rooms that get me wanting to play it more and more in order to hear what all the characters talk about. And even better, the game is under £5. Why don't you just stop reading this and buy the game already. You will love it. Trust me. It's amazing.

												TL;DR : Plain mo**er**cking awesome. Come on, it's GLaDOS and Cl4P-TR4PI love this game, I used to be a noob in IRL poker but I got better with playing this game.Yeah I first bought this for the free items for BL2 and TF2, and this was also on sale, so all great stuff.In my opinion, the AI is good. Well it isn't perfect, of course, but it's not too challenging nor too easy, and although people say this is 'rigged', I think it's just plain luck. Winning a 20000 bet with Ace high or a Straight Flush is so magnificent to the Max. The characters, as you see, are great, including GLaDOS. Well, tbh you need to be open-minded and accept jokes coming to you as humour and not insult, because what they comment are overly amusing. Yes, it does get repetitive at times, but the fact that the game keeps running on background (they do checks and raises and all that stuff while the convo goes, and you can too) so if a dialogue is repeating, you can 'skip' it in your head. I'd say 10/10, better than it's prequel. Oh, and with the virtual Inventory Tokens, you can also buy your opponents drinks, and make them make more hints or their cards.			"

												I recommend this game if you are a poker fan like me or you just having a boring aftermoon and want to do something, then this game is for you. The game is not to easy and not to hard. But the thing is that it is a poker game and it feels like you playing infront of people and the like talk to you.			"

												Poker Night 2 is an improvement on Poker Night at the Inventory and it adds so much content that you'll be hopping around your room squeeing with joy. I love this title and I know that I could easily hop back into it to play poker with some really amazing and hilarious characters. It has wit, humour, visuals and plenty of great moments. The unlocks are fantastic, the gameplay gets you hooked and most of all it's the conversations and unique 'themed' poker rooms that get me wanting to play it more and more in order to hear what all the characters talk about. And even better, the game is under £5. Why don't you just stop reading this and buy the game already. You will love it. Trust me. It's amazing. And if you don't believe me then go watch my livestreams or other highlights! There's fun to be had!			"

												So, Poker Night 2, the follow-up game from the Poker Night at the Inventory, featuring new characters, new dialogue, new atmosphere, new, almost everything. Question is, did it succeed in what it did like it did in the first one?Let's start with the story: it's simple (yet again), beginning with the Inventory, a secret poker place for people to play Poker together for high stakes (this time for $20k instead of $10k).You play as The Player, who is presumably the same person you play as in the first Poker Night game, who is yet again, the silent and never-talking one, yet recognized still and warmly welcomed as you arrive from your limo to The Inventory.That is essentially the story in a nutshell: it's simple, it's true to the nature of Poker Night, and it's just a little more fun than the first one, I feel.Now onto the aspects of the game:Game AspectScoreSide NotesGraphics10/10 The game looks much more polished and vibrant than the first, and the characters still look true to their natureDialogue 4/10 The character's speeches was very specific and not improved at all from the first game, in fact having maybe 5 minutes worth Soundtrack 7.6/10 The soundtrack isn't as fitting as the first game's soundtrack, but it's still awesome as hell nonetheless Gameplay (differences) 10/10 I love the improvements made upon this game's gameplay: ordering drinks for people, the idea of Bounty Challenges, earning coins for winning tournaments to spend on felts, chips, and card changes, and the game winning is as satsifying as the first game AI 10/10 Much like the first one, this game's ai is believable, and even occassionally bluffs its way through the game Atmosphere 3/10 Between the dialogue and the character picks, I just can't imagine actually sitting down at a poker table playing Texas Hold'em with these characters: they're just, too diverse in personality Overall Score 7/10 This game's score tanked because of its overall atmosphere that it delivers; it delivers the feel that you need to win, or else be judged from these characters Side Notes If you're in it for the tf2/Borderlands2 items, and don't mind the atmosphere, then by all means it's worth the $5: if you're looking for a good poker game, though, I'd just stick with the first game   "

												TL;DR : Plain mo**er**cking awesome. Come on, it's GLaDOS and Cl4P-TR4PI love this game, I used to be a noob in IRL poker but I got better with playing this game.Yeah I first bought this for the free items for BL2 and TF2, and this was also on sale, so all great stuff.In my opinion, the AI is good. Well it isn't perfect, of course, but it's not too challenging nor too easy, and although people say this is 'rigged', I think it's just plain luck. Winning a 20000 bet with Ace high or a Straight Flush is so magnificent to the Max. The characters, as you see, are great, including GLaDOS. Well, tbh you need to be open-minded and accept jokes coming to you as humour and not insult, because what they comment are overly amusing. Yes, it does get repetitive at times, but the fact that the game keeps running on background (they do checks and raises and all that stuff while the convo goes, and you can too) so if a dialogue is repeating, you can 'skip' it in your head. I'd say 10/10, better than it's prequel. Oh, and with the virtual Inventory Tokens, you can also buy your opponents drinks, and make them make more hints or their cards.			"

												First of all: I know this game was made to cash in on children that only want TF2 items. That said, here are the reasons why the devs should be ashamed of releasing this:-The strategies of the AI make no sense: When they bet or raise it's always a couple times the pot size, they call all ins with really crappy cards, they fall for standard poker tactics, etc.-When you play like an actual sane person would do, the portal robot is all over your face saying that you suck. Every single time. When you make a standard bet, the other players say that you suck.-To win those TF2 and borderlands 2 items, you have to complete challenges. But most 'challenges' ENCOURAGE you to play really bad. Example: win a showdown with 2 players. In a 5 player tourney, right.-The animations are borky-The conversations get really boring and repetitive. The one that annoys me the most is the blonde guy making an all in move.-The design of some card decks give me the creeps. What genius thought of a card deck where you have to stare 5 seconds to every card to discover which cards you actually have?-There is only 1 word to describe the design of the menu: tedious.Luckily, there are some good things about the game as well:-The conversations are well written in general. Sometimes they make you feel like the players are just casually folding or calling. Surprisingly, the claptrap conversations are the funniest. After an hour of playing they get repetitive though.-On rare occasions there are hands where the AI isn't completely dumb.Buy it for €1 if you want the items. If you're looking for a poker game: don't.			"

												If everything that is great in the world sat down to play pokerWith a dog, a robot, a god among men, a badass, and another robot. Seriously though, five dollars is a fantastic bargain on Poker Night 2, especially if you know and love the characters like I do. The TF2 and Borderlands 2 unlocks are pretty awesome too! Enjoy hilarious dialogue between beloved characters and slam down a couple-a-beers. All around, it's a pretty great time. there are a few gripes here though.1. WARNING! THE BORDERLANDS 2 UNLOCKS DO NOT WORK AS THEY SHOULD. I HAD TO CONTACT GEARBOX SOFTWARE TO RECIEVE THEM. 2. Dialogue loops. This happens quite often and unlike PN2s predecessor, this game has no option to lower the amount of poker table chatter or outright skip it. The jokes are hilarious, but can get grating. 3. Ash isn't voiced by Bruce Campbell. :P Not a serious complaint, as the VA does a good job, but I would've LOVED to see him reprise the role.Wonderful game. The funniest I've played in years, the best crossover that isn't Smash Bros i've seen, and getting the Max mask for the Mechromancer in Borderlands 2 is just awesome. I fully reccomend a full price purchase.			"

You can't lose money here, if we don't calculate the game's price to our loss.A great amount of humorous conversations made me laugh several times, but after a while they become repetitive of course. In my opinion the character Sam doesn't really needed here, cauz Max already took part in the first episode. Come on, there are a lots of funny game heroes out there to pick up. "

												Telltale still doesn't seem to ♥♥♥♥ing understand how a deck of cards works. CARDS DO NOT HAVE DUPLICATES IN A DECK. Otherwise they did a solid job, even despite the huge middle finger to PC (O gaming industry, y u do this so much) release job. All the characters are alright this time around, though they insult you a tad much for my taste. While with the first game, say, Tycho would go 'Those cards will do!' in response to me winning a hand. While in this game everyone is mute and only criticizes you. The group definetly doesn't seem as friendly this time around, though the characters interactions are handled much better. Also Omaha FTW <3. As a poker game, this fails horribley. As a fun game with some unique characters/dialogue? It's pretty good. 6.1/10.			"

												Let's compare to Poker Night 1: The dialogue started repeating much earlier, and you're no longer allowed to skip it. On the other hand, there were a couple of conversation arcs which were apprently set up to take place over the course of several sessions of play, which was interesting. I didn't suspect I'd like the cast of characters as much as the original, especially the guys on the right, but everybody turned out to be pretty likeable. There are still table, card and now chip style unlocks, and you don't need to win games to get them; instead, you're given three random 'challenges' which usually aren't too horrible, and then completing these challenges and winning a game unlocks cool stuff for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2. I guess it is a better system than the previous. Unlocking matching club motif sets actually changes the whole Inventory's look to that theme, such as a Borderlands one and a Portal one, and that was pretty cool. The AI now seems to cheat like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way more than I remember.Uuuuhhhh you know what, I'll just call it about even. Even if this one doesn't have Heavy Weapons Guy in it. Actually I was kinda hoping for the Engineer this time.			"

												I liked Poker Night 2's bounty system, and the banter is always good, but this actually felt like a step backward from the first game. Not being able to control how talkable the characters are is a feature that was sorely missing.And the characters themselves seemed a bit less interesting. In general I felt like they had fewer lines of dialogue and repeated themselves more. There was also a distinctive feeling of the AI cheating on the final card flip. There were some incredibly unlikely outcomes that kept happening hand after hand after hand.So at the end of the day if you like playing poker against an AI you'll like this, but I actually think the first one is the better of the two.

												A humorous Poker Game Simulator where you play against Claptrap from Borderlands, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros., Ash from The Evil Dead and Sam from Sam and Max. Your card dealer is GLaDOS from Portal.If you like simulated card games then this game is phenomenal. The continuous comedy only increases the enjoyment - I've never lost all of my money and had a smile on my face in real life.10/10 Poker Simulator.			"

												A game of poker with quips from the likes of Brock Samson from the Venture Brothers, Ash from Evildead, Claptrap from Borderlands, along with the Freelance Police Sam and Max. Oh, and you, the silent player. Play hands of Texas Hold 'Em or Omaha with the host GLaDOS from Portal. Go down as one of the greater poker players at the green table, or be a tremendous failure after busting and losing $20,000 (You'll most likely be busted by Ash, he's an♥♥♥♥♥like that). A good, casual game to pass the time if you have a few minutes. Sadly, there's no multiplayer and no other characters besides the ones listed above. Buy this during a sale for less than 5 dollars if you have some money to burn and want a casual game to play once in a while. Get it if you really like poker, otherwise you might want to throw your money somewhere else. A bonus to this game would be the multiple TF2 items you get from collecting ""special items"" from each of the characters, such as a Spike TV 2012 VGA award from Claptrap. To get them, you have to do a series of simple bounties during one tournament, and beat the next tournament to win the item. The TF2 items are quite nice, but the weapons have no value or different stats except for being achievement items.			"

												Poker Night 2 is an improvement on Poker Night at the Inventory and it adds so much content that you'll be hopping around your room squeeing with joy. I love this title and I know that I could easily hop back into it to play poker with some really amazing and hilarious characters. It has wit, humour, visuals and plenty of great moments. The unlocks are fantastic, the gameplay gets you hooked and most of all it's the conversations and unique 'themed' poker rooms that get me wanting to play it more and more in order to hear what all the characters talk about. And even better, the game is under £5. Why don't you just stop reading this and buy the game already. You will love it. Trust me. It's amazing. And if you don't believe me then go watch my livestreams or other highlights! There's fun to be had!			"

												Both of the Poker Nights games from Telltale are absolutely worth a few bucks just for the humor alone, and are a great way to learn how to play Poker too. You'll probably play 5-10 matches before the dialog starts to repeat, so the replay value here is limited, but the price is fair.			"

												Poker Night 2 is an extremely offensive CoD rip-off, the bad things about it are:No teams, you're always playing Free-for-all.You can't choose what you're holding in your hand, it's completely random.Changing your decorations doesn't alter your gameplay or give you a tactical advantage on your opponents.Brock's a c*nt.Ash isn't really any better.CL4P-TP is an obnoxious down syndrome with the mental age of 2.I think Sam is okay, but he pisses me off by folding every single f**king hand.Also, another thing that annoys me about Sam is everytime someone goes all-in he shouts ""GOOD DAY IN THE MORNING."".

												Five dollars doesn't usually get you much. This game TEARS DOWN that wall. Now, this game is NOT for everybody. It has a BUNCH of jokes, but at least 85% of them are at the expence of the player. Also, being a poker game, if you don't know how to play texas hold em', this game is not for you. Lastly, and this one is UNFORGIVABLE, no multiplayer. A poker game, WITHOUT MULTIPLAYER! (I'm gonna let that sink in for a second.) Still, this is a well made game.The AI is NOT like Mario Party's on hard/expert. (In other words, it's not 100% cheap and OP.) It's jokes are amazing! (If you're ok with videogame charactors making fun of you, that is.) And, well... FREEKING POKER! Also, TF2 and Borderlands 2 unlocks. 'Nough said. Now if this was 10 or 15 bucks, STAY AWAY! But with it's $5 tag, GO STRAIGHT FOR IT! 8/10			"

												Very cool and neat game with a very cheap price too. You can unlock cosmetic items for both TF2 and Borderlands 2, which is pretty cool. The graphics are really nice and colourful and the game is simple and easy to learn.What makes this stand out is that there is a ton of funny dialogue for the characters and seeing how the characters interacted was really cool, which is a really good motivation to keep playing and unlocking more items to hear more dialogue and situtions, plus it really makes me wish for an Evil Dead telltale adventure game starring Bruce Campbell.Definitely worth a pick up if you want to unlock some items and have a calm game of poker after playing some other games.

I'm also so glad that GLaDOS, one of my favorite characters from the Portal franchise and one of my favorite robot characters of all time, is actually in this game!

Poker with who? Poker with your Favourite video game characters! You have Claptrap, from Borderlands, who is funny and makes the game humorous at all times.You have Ash Williams, from ""The Evil Dead"" franchise, who makes cunning remarks, of how great he is.You have Brock Samson, from Adult Swim, who likes to bet a whole ton of money every time.You have Sam, from the ""Sam & Max"" games, who likes to talk about his adventures, while you have your own poker ones.You have GlaDOS, from the ""Portal"" games, who narrates the Poker game, and talks about various ways to kill you...And you have the quiet Moxxie, from ""Borderlands"" who serves the drinks, to make ya'll drunk!This is a mix up of different styles, and the gameplay is amazing! I love Poker Night 2!When you win, you dont just have the satisfaction of winning, but you can get Money to help you make the place look like your favourite game, and you can win prizes for various games, Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2.I think this game is worth every little cent I payed for it. Its a truely spectacular game, and i'd buy a sequel if it came out!8.5/10Highly Recommended.			"

												Gambling is EVIL! I can tell from my own experiences.One of the safest place to play poker is at the Inventory. You can't lose money here, if we don't calculate the game's price to our loss.A great amount of humorous conversations made me laugh several times, but after a while they become repetitive of course. In my opinion the character Sam doesn't really needed here, cauz Max already took part in the first episode. Come on, there are a lots of funny game heroes out there to pick up. "

												Quite an interesting way to play free poker. It really provides the entertainment people require.PROS1. Fun GamePlaying poker has never been so interesting. All the insance antics and the interesting conversations held by the characters. E.g. All the false information about dogs from Sam.I especially liked the themed sets. E.g. Steve from Borderlands 2 and his ""Heyoo""2. CharactersAll of them are so funny. I love Claptrap the most. I was hoping Moxxi would speak though.3. Probability CalculationsI appreciate showing the probability though I wish you would teach us how you arrive at the number.4. Crossover Game RewardsNice. Love the free skins for winning.CONS1. No Multiplayer ****Such a fun game and you can't play multiplayer. What a waste. I felt that Telltale could easily make themselves one of the top games on Steam by allowing for multiplayer. Perhaps they have some restrictions regarding publishing online gambling software but I would like to point out that Dota 2 already encourages gambling in the form of match predictions using CASH.2. Nothing to DistractWhile waiting for the NPCs to decide (which should be instant), maybe there could be something interesting to do in the few seconds in between.3. No Concrete Assurance That It's Not RiggedI don't see anything anywhere in the game that points out that it is not rigged. So far the best assurance I've come across is a forum post. The idea that the game is rigged to win at some points and lost at others takes away a certain portion of fun.SUGGESTIONS1. Assurance of Non-Rigging/CheatingMaybe you could have a small option in the Menu that points out how Telltale codes the game to be non-cheating. 2. MultiplayerYou could attract all the seniors in their retirement to Steam, thereby helping to make Steam a true company for all.3. Other Card GamesBridge, Taipan, Baccarat, Blackjack, Big 2 etc... The list is endless. Why stop at Poker? You could corner the market on non-cash card games on Steam. I AM HIGHLY AGAINST USING REAL MONEY TO BET ON STEAM GAMES. IF YOU DO MAKE A POKER NIGHT 3 WITH MULTIPLAYER, DO NOT ADD A REAL MONEY COMPONENT OR ALLOW PLAYERS TO MAKE REAL MONEY SIDE BETS.4. Newbie TutorialHave a simple section teaching how to calculate the probability of winning with your hand. This will teach advanced mathematics to MILLIONS of players. This would be optional as some people just hate math.5. Protect People from Cheating You could also teach them about the dark side of poker, like the cheating. This would help to protect the public from cheats in real life. E.g.""cooler decks"", palming cards, marking cards, false shuffles.Treat this like an act of charity.6. Gamer's CentralYou could create a Gamer's Central just like the one from Wreck-It Ralph. Then everyone can choose their card game and walk into an empty room.			"

I feel as if I am actually sitting down to play some Texas Hold'em when I play Poker Night 2. Not only that but the computer players always have something witty to say or may break into a conversation that makes me laugh. If you are a poker fanatic I would recommend this game 10/10.

I shaved my head clean before I bought this game and it's one of the best things I've ever done, otherwise by now I would have baldspots from yanking my own hair outta my head! #beardgamestrongWould shave my head clean again to avoid looking like sh!t/10OLD REVIEWGreat Poker game!

Product received for free
												I missed the functionality of being able to skip the characters’ dialogues by clicking with the right button, which the first game had. After a while the dialogues start to become repetitive and it's really annoying having to listen to them over and over again. The bet-sliding bar is also less responsive than in the first game. But it's still a great game nonetheless, and thank God it doesn't have the luck-related achievements the first one had, which makes 100%'ing this one more doable. It does have an annoying achievement to reach a balance of one million dollars though, but it's easy to exploit: if you close the game as soon as you're about to lose and re-open it, your balance will never go down, making it possible to reach the milestone very easily.

												As with the first game, the player's enjoyment of Poker Night 2 will depend on how familiar they are with the characters. As a fan of Borderlands and Portal, I found Claptrap and Glados to be very funny. The other characters aren't important to me, so I found them quite dull, although Ash did make me laugh a couple of times with references to Bruce Campbell's Burn Notice character. There are plenty of unlockable items to give the game some longevity, but the downside is the characters don't have enough lines, so they repeat themselves often. There are two variations of Poker, Texas and Omaha, and a much better explanation of the rules than the first game, so poker novices won't be totally confused. I'm sure there are better poker games around, but considering the purchase price, I feel like I've got value for money.			"

												Decent enough Poker game if you're a fan of the characters. The banter is witty for a couple of hours and then it gets a bit tedious having to listen through it over and over. The AI are also known to cheat at times, and although they give off tells, they can be completely off the mark. It's more of a guessing game than a strategic one unfortunately, but for $5 it's still a few hours of entertainment.			"

												I just finished getting all the achievements in this game, so I figured now is a good time to right a review. I have really enjoyed it this game and it was definitely worth the $1.24 I spent. This game got me into Poker (and then all my friends) and actually Sam/Max. The characters are humorous, and they each have a unique poker style and tells. I will say that some of the lines/conversations get played out quickly. I got one conversation b/w Claptrap and Ash 3 times in three hands. That said, thats by far the worst example, I just wish I could skip the banter that I've heard before. Also I have heard from others that if you like Evil Dead, the fact that Bruce Campbell didn't do Ash's voice is weird, but I wasn't a fan so I didn't think much of it. I recommend this game if you like these characters and want a poker sim. It was a good choice for me, especially at that price. 7/10 Hamdingers			"

												I love the unique content that is unlockable in this game for Team Fortress 2, no other games around can do that. The dialogue is funny and witty, I still hear things I haven't before after twenty tournaments. This game would be even better with multi-player, let players select one of the normal NPCs to play then slim down the dialog set for each character. At least a good idea if a third installment is made to the series or if this game was ever updated. Even basic skipping abilities for normal dialogue would be great. It feels like it slows the games down after a few in a row. Plays fine at the native resolution on my Intel HD 3000 chipset meaning it can run on most laptops. Totally great game, a must own in for your Valve collection. 8.5/10			"

												Play poker with your favorite dudes you've never seen before until now.Dog, Sassy robot, violent human, other violent human, and super super super annoying robot from borderlands.I want to kill him by throwing cards at his metal body until he suffers all kinds of cuts. I hate annoying robot. I also hate max from the first game.Naturally you can get things from each dude for your favorite tf2 mercs if you win. They improved the prize system in that you gotta complete certain missions, and those missions unlock the right to have someone put forth an item if they still have one.Its still just poker...or texas hold-em.You can get a skull hat for pyro, a knife for heavy, a mask for spy, boots for scout, and a cartoon dog hat.the banter from each person is amusing, but the sassy robot always wins.poke-I mean Texas hold 'em/10			"

												This, my friends, was a super fun game. It's actually currently a ""free"" offering on PSN as well. Wherever you play this though, you are in for a treat. You are the nameless, silent ""The Player"" and are playing against Brock Samson, Claptrap, Sam and Max, and Ash Williams. The dialogue is pretty witty and at times hilarious as the other players talk amongst themselves, have little jokes and jabs they throw your way, etc...the table is hosted by GLaDOS, who is also the dealer, and who interjects passive aggressive hostile jabs at all the players throughout the game. Actually, GLaDOS's dialogue is effective at representing the subtle menace for which it is known.There are a few options in the game that enhance the experience, most notably the ability to upgrade your chips, felt, and cards to the settings from all the other characters origin worlds/stories, which outside of changing the appearance of the room/table/et al, also unlockas new dialogue between the characters. You can also buy drinks for the other characters, delivered by your favorite bartender, Moxxi, in whose bar you are actually playing poker in. The drinks cause the other players to be more obvious in their tells.Speaking of tells, each of the players has them. Brock is a hothead and will often bet without a real hand. Ash plays more like Gus Hansen, Claptrap plays a solid game overall, and Sam almost always folds unless he has a real hand.That's pretty much it. Outside of the setting, dialogue, and some challenges which allow you to unlock new skins and such for Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2, it's pretty much a straightforward Hold 'em and Omaha game. So, if you like poker and video games, you will probably enjoy this. If not, look elsewhere for sure.			"

Items can be way too hard and tedious to get, thanks to some challenges.2. TF2 items are all boring cosmetics instead of a mix of reskin weapons, a badge and cool shades like in the orignal.Overall just as good as the orignal.			"

PresentationPoker Night 2 follows a familiar pattern that you have probably seen or at least heard of before, and much like the original title Poker Night at the Inventory, it puts you, The Player against four other characters from different blockbuster franchises not only from the video game industry, but also from television series and movies, in tournaments of Texas Hold'em or Omaha Hold'em. This time around your adversaries are Sam from the Sam & Max franchise, Brock Samson from The Venture Bros, Ash Williams from The Evil Dead franchise, and Claptrap from the Borderlands series, in addition to GLaDOS from the Portal series which takes the role of the dealer. There isn't a story that unites those characters at the Inventory poker table, but having them in one place is great no matter the circumstances, and even though there is no adventure or story to follow here, hearing from them once again is just as nice. Even with the thought of the game being a simple poker simulator with your favourite characters as your adversaries in mind, the game does little to set itself apart from other such games apart from having those characters in it; there is only a short introduction cutscene when you start the game for the first time that shows you making your entrance at the Inventory for the first time and bumping into all those characters along the way as you move towards the table, and after that everything will become an endless repetition until you eventually get bored of the game. Even if you aren't familiar with some of the franchises that brought you those characters, they will make themselves known to you as you play more and more with them and hear their stories, but the really pleasure comes for those long-time fans of one of those characters, because hearing themselves explain one of their adventures that you are already familiar with in different way and in some ways making a parody of it is unlike nothing else.Rating: 7GameplayThere's no catch here, it's poker: you either dig it or you don't, but considering the amount of poker games out there, some of which come at no cost at all, looking at Poker Night 2's only 2 game modes and the lack of any sort of multiplayer you realize that if you got this game for the actual poker playing experience, you clearly got the wrong thing. Sure, Texas Hold'em and Omaha Hold'em are the most popular poker modes, but just like anything else it will get boring to follow the same road every tournament without any twist to change the actual game. Poker was always one of the most popular forms of gambling and even if virtual poker games still maintain that feeling by using virtual money and chips, it doesn't feel like gambling unless you play against other human players. Playing against the AI gets boring incredibly fast simply because their next move will always be predictable in a form or another, and even though the difficulty of the game is somewhere around what would be a normal level, you can't increase or decrease the difficulty to your liking if you're looking for a more intense experience or a more relaxed play. The only things that will change the boring atmosphere come in the form of unlockables, that once activated will change things like the deck of cards, the table or the chips and activating all three of them from the same theme will trigger a different scenery effect specific to that theme, making the Inventory look like the set of another Evil Dead movie or the next chamber of Portal experiments, but even so, those changes are strictly visual and will not affect the core idea of a repeating poker experience that is isolated to the AI battles only. Apart from the items that can be unlocked using tokens that you'll win at the end of each tournament according to what position you finished on and the ability to order drinks from the bar for your adversaries there is nothing else to distract you from what is an incredibly repetitive set of plays that is limited in every possible way.Rating: 5.5GraphicsPoker Night 2 isn't the prettiest game out there, even compared to other poker titles only, but it's not bad looking either; the characters are nicely done, the backgrounds are pretty and those unlockables really change the scenery in a pleasant way, especially when you combine all three of them from the same theme package. The animations are decent, even though the lip sync can be way off at times, but all the funky moves of those characters that combined with audio effects create some funny moments make up for it. Things don't look bad in any way, but you can clearly see some cubic edges when the camera zooms in on a character's face and so on.Rating: 6.5AudioThe cast, even though small, does its job of creating a rich audio environment as Sam is voiced by David Nowlin, Max by David Boat, Brock Samson by Patrick Warburton, Ash Williams by Danny Webber, Claptrap by David Eddings and GLaDOS by Ellen McLain. The one great thing about Poker Night 2 comes in the form of its epic dialogue between all those legendary characters that will constantly tell jokes and stories, all to the delight of the player. As good as those jokes are however, they won't last forever, and even thought the first hours of the game will be a pleasant surprise for the fans of those characters as you hear more and more stories about them, they will get repetitive eventually and when they do, that fun will almost instantly turn into boredom.Rating: 8ExtrasIf you're a fan of those characters or at least some of them, you'll have fun in the game for a few hours, but after you've heard everything there is to hear, which shouldn't take longer than 5 hours to do, your only motivation will come in the form of unlockables which in a worst case scenario will take around 10 hours to unlock all, and after that there really is no reason to come back: you'll hear the same old lines over and over again, there is nothing else to win or see and there are much better poker games out there available for free, which can also be played online.Rating: 4VerdictPoker Night 2 is a delight for those who appreciate the classics and wanna hear more about their favourite characters and this game is the perfect opportunity to see some of those legendary characters all in one place, but that special treatment will only last for a few hours, and once that is done and you've heard every joke those characters have in store for you, Poker Night 2 is just another game that you won't play ever again.Rating Overall: 6.2Check the full review and a lot more about Poker Night 2 at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=216 "

												Those are some high quality promo items.  Grand game.  ...But in all seriousness, Poker Night 2 is a very entertaining poker excursion.  Before this game, I had no idea how poker functioned.  Now, when...or if...if I ever participate in an actual poker tournament, I highly expect witty banter from interesting characters, nostalgic yet distinguished jazz-like music and fascinating themes. Either that or I will be instantly disqualified and forced out.  It's the perfect education tool, it teaches all the world about the joys of poker!  Such as buying alcoholic drinks to slowly but surely sabotage other fictional players or using a cheat sheet.  If any sentient being is still alive after reading that, then good, now I can accurately assess my opinion of the game.  Really, Poker Night 2 is a simple ""video game"" at the end of the day.  After all, it is what it is, poker.  What makes it so entertaining are the characters and their conversations with one another.  Poker Night 2's cast of characters is comprised of several fictional video games, animated television series, and even film characters.  Though these celebrities are hardly the most obscure of competitors, I admit that I had little idea of a few of them.  However, the way they interact with one another manages to crack a smile on my face.  The act of Brock Samson, the deadly assassin bodyguard from the Venture Bros. snigger at a profile of Sam, the bipedal dog detective from Sam & Max is a humorous conversation to listen to while looking at one's deck of cards.  Same with the adventurous Ash Williams and the slightly annoying yet semi-endearing CL4P-TP robot talk about his life story or attempt to put the moves on the dealer, a female A.I. by the name of GLaDOS and instantly be dismissed is nice to listen to.  ...The first few times.  While the charm of the conversations can last for quite some time, if one plays this game for hours on end, they will inevitably listen to the same dialogue line they heard sometime an hour or two before.  There unfortunately is only so much variety in one playthrough.Luckily, the game does not rely on characters chatting your ears off to keep you playing.  Not only are their incentives like the promotional items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2, but the soundtrack is a pleasure to groove to in one's seat.  Songs like ""Still Alive"" are reprised in a smooth jazz version to fit the calm, calm mood of having one's virtual wallet face the equivalent of being suctioned in by a vacuum. Of course, that seems like a hefty toll.  Fret not, for your ears do not have to take on the entire burden.  For your dear optic nerves, there are several card and chip themes for your playing pleasure that can be used to customize your tournaments.  You can combine card themes, chip themes, and table felt themes of your favorite franchise (as is represented) like Portal.  Unlock the themes and deploy them and watch as your poker table is immersed in an Aperture Science simulation.  Alternatively, employ a Borderlands 2 theme set and get the gritty, casino feel or the Sam & Max themes and unlock a black and white detective mystery movie-esque setting, originally meant for Sam & Max's 25th anniversary.  However, at the very end of the day, Poker Night 2 is just that, a poker game.  A poker game featuring the stars of video games, a television show, and a movie series.  I recommend it, not just for its incentives, but for its fascinating, entertaining themes and dialogue around the poker table.  ...And because those promo items are really good looking.			"

Songs like ""Still Alive"" are reprised in a smooth jazz version to fit the calm, calm mood of having one's virtual wallet face the equivalent of being suctioned in by a vacuum. Of course, that seems like a hefty toll.  Fret not, for your ears do not have to take on the entire burden.  For your dear optic nerves, there are several card and chip themes for your playing pleasure that can be used to customize your tournaments.  You can combine card themes, chip themes, and table felt themes of your favorite franchise (as is represented) like Portal.  Unlock the themes and deploy them and watch as your poker table is immersed in an Aperture Science simulation.  Alternatively, employ a Borderlands 2 theme set and get the gritty, casino feel or the Sam & Max themes and unlock a black and white detective mystery movie-esque setting, originally meant for Sam & Max's 25th anniversary.  However, at the very end of the day, Poker Night 2 is just that, a poker game.  A poker game featuring the stars of video games, a television show, and a movie series.  I recommend it, not just for its incentives, but for its fascinating, entertaining themes and dialogue around the poker table.  ...And because those promo items are really good looking.			"

												Poker Night is mildly fun, but the AI is worse than the first. It's absurdly easy to bluff and bully, and it takes far too long to unlock things. The character dialogue is good but gets repetitive way too fast.  But most importantly the game, simple as it is, isn't really all that functional. The downloadable unlocks, which are the reason most people would give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about a game there are a thousand free varients of as it is, don't work most of the time. If you try to download Borderlands 2 items you have to write an email to Gearbox with a screenshot or you won't get them. To be honest, this game probably IS worth the money. But a company that leaves such a gaping flaw in their game unchecked deserves nothing.			"

												Great design, fun time in poker... but filled with annoyances.All the characters talk too much! It's one thing to have some level of small talk by your favorite characters... I mean, that's why I bought the game! Initial raise gets you a reaction comment. If you all-in, you get 5+ gasp reactions from the group, even if they've folded previously, then they'll fold 80% of the time, then you'll get a 'player win' or 'player loss' razzing from GlaDOS and whomever won or lost. Also, Sam might be playing, but Max constantly interjects... and I hate those two from the first game. The dealer randomly tosses insults you as you are dealt cards, reraise, win or lose hands... and it's almost always Claptrap at the showdown, so anyone who hates him will hate him on a 1-on-1 level.The rewards system sucks! Original Poker Night would give you the 'reward' after you knocked out the one player w/ the item. This one has you complete 3 ""challenges"" to get a shot at a bounty, then you have to knock out all 4 players. One of the challenges is ""Spend 8 perfect tournament's worth of tokens to unlock the Portal set"" so those challenges aren't fluff either. There's no reset for them aside from deleting your save. Some folks on the Steam Forums say they have been stuck for over a year on same challenge. Even if you were magic, you'd have to do 10+ perfect games to get the unlocks... and they're time consuming! Until the blinds are 800/1600, these guys fold neatly on most raises like a pair of pleated pants. Oh, and despite having a SHiFT account and Borderlands 2 installed, none of the Borderlands stuff unlocked natively and I had to submit a SHiFT ticket with Gearbox. TF2 stuff unlocks W/O any hitches, as is the norm.The game looks pretty. I hate to badmouth it... but I bought the game because I liked the characters and wanted the unlocks. Spending a ton of hours to get the unlocks, when I'd rather be in B2 or TF2, and starting to hate the characters I liked before I started playing... honestly made me very unhappy.			"

												TL:DR if you ever wanted to know what it felt like to play a rigged game of poker here's your chancePoker Night 2 lets you play poker against some recognizable characters and features Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Sam from Sam and Max, Claptrap from Borderlands and Ash Williams from Evil Dead. It also has Glados from Portal. I wanted to like this game. The idea is good, playing poker against these characters and listening to the funny conversations but the AI ♥♥♥♥s you over constantly. Good points:-the conversations between the characters are good and funny though they do end up looping the same stuff after a while-you can get items for Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 Bad points:- the AI rigs the game against you. Get a good hand? Doesnt matter one of the AI players will beat you 9 times out of 10.   Get a two pair the AI gets a three of a kind. Get a flush the AI gets a straight flush. The longer I played the more evident it became.-Claptrap from Borderlands is just as annoying here as he is in the Borderlands game and is easily the worst of the featured characters.			"

It's still mostly just a $5 promotion with unlockable items for TF2 and Borderlands 2. The unlocks for those games are hardly worth the time because in TF2 almost everybody will have them in due time and people hardly play Borderlands 2 as often as they used to (even then nobody pays any attention at all to whatever their partners are wearing).In short: Whoop-de-freaking-doo			"

												Only get this game if you want the items that come with it. The Borderlands 2♥♥♥♥♥♥is neglectable so you should only want it for TF2 items.Why is this game not the poker you game you should be buying? The cutscenes. They are annoying after a few games and you can not skip them. You might be able to turn them off (Haven't checked) but that would kill everything besides the poker element. Don't get me wrong, it would be a great game but everything feels clunky and the menu is horrible. To switch 2 pages in the menu you take about 8-10 seconds. Dreading, not majorly long, but still dreading.It has some fun features, decks / felts / chips can be customized to different sets that belong to the characters that sit at your table.In the end, if this game wasn't feeling so clunky. Had a skip button and slow overall I would recommend this to everyone. Because the poker is just poker. And that's mostly what you want from a poker game.			"

												Middle of the road game, to be honest. The game was a ton of fun for the first few hours, but between Claptrap being completely annoying and Max just being a d**k, it almost made the items not worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed the unlocks, but I nearly went insane having to constantly place insane bets to get even minor pots. If you want a few cool items for Borderlands and TF2, go ahead, you'll probably like them. But if you're new to poker, this game is a cheating motherf**ker that will CONSTANTLY go out of its way to give you absolute Hell. Got a three of a kind? Too bad, you only have a high card. Have a royal flush? Sorry, we're just going to count it as a normal straight. I recomend picking it up while it's cheap, get the items, and either keep it for some themed poker or refund it. I highly recomend the original, even if almost all of its unlocks were merely reskins.BTW, why in the Hell are Brock and Ash here? Brock's entertaining, sure, but the theme of this series is gaming/gaming related media. While Evil Dead at least had a game series, Brock's inclusion is just confusing. I personally would have tried for getting the rights to Phoenix Wright, as Phoenix is a small time poker series in the canon of his games, but then again, Capcom doesn't have the best track record when it comes to multi-corperation co-operation.

												       Out of all of the other poker games I have played, this one is one of the worst. I'm sorry to say but for me this poker game just screams computer automated. When I say this I mean to say that every round you come close to winning - you lose. Now I know what your thinking, ""you're just a bad poker player"". But I'm not, in fact, I've been playing poker in real life and in games for almost 2 years now. As another one of my side-hobbies, now please bear with me when I say this game is a slap in the face to the common poker player. Because 70% of the time you find that your cards are not better, by a long-shot or a short one. Now I know Telltale can do better with this, and it has in the past and the future with their other games. (Including the first Poker Night at the Inventory.) I have played the first poker night, and even on the hardest level - and I could win tournaments. But sorry to say, in this game that doesn't matter if you have a decent hand.  But for some others this might not be a problem, but for me and maybe a couple of other decent poker players it is. I'm not trying to be a sissy when I say I cannot have a decent hand and never win. Frankly I don't care about the achievements at all, I just love poker in general. But to me this game just ruins it, Telltale needs to put some realism into the game. Thank you			"

												While I do find this game amusing, and will probably continue to play it as a time waster, there's a few gnawing reasons behind this negative review.Starting out, I have to say that this is far from one of Telltale's best works.  The game honestly comes off as something they spent a weekend throwing together for a quick buck before they moved on to their next epic story.  It's poker, with some entertaining characters, and I realize that in itself has limits but this game had the potential to be a far better experience.Getting down to the nitty gritty of the whole thing, the biggest flaw in the game is sheer repetitiveness.  Within the first half hour of playing you’ll quickly notice characters often become repetitive with their expressions toward your actions.  I swear, if I have to hear Sam say, “Great day in the morning”, one more time I can’t be held liable for the consequences.  Not to mention how often Claptrap brings the game to a solid halt explaining how he’s immune to bluffing, right before folding.  It was funny the first time, but the 300th time is just annoying.  That’s the biggest thing here.  All of these expressions were meant to be funny or amusing, and they are the first time you see them, but then it’s like watching the same joke over and over again.  It stops being amusing and just becomes dreadfully annoying.The next least annoying feature of the game is, again, repetitiveness.  This time it takes the role of the introduction of each game.  Every time you start a new game a 3rd rate character announces the buy-in for the tournament at 20 thousand, the camera pans to show everyone putting meaningless and endless wads of money on the table, and after a short eternity you finally get to play cards.  This could have been completely left out, there’s no point to it.  Doesn’t matter how many times you play the game, everyone is still going to magically pull a stack of money out of their pocket and drop it on the table.  It’s not like a character is going to be $5 short, or reveal empty pockets, or something.  Everyone’s always got the money, so why waste time on meaningless “cut scenes”?  Going right along with that is the blind notification.  When GladoS comes in and talks about upping the blinds it seems really out of place.  It’s like felt they needed to make announcing a change in the rules enjoyable, but got the intern to do the job.Aside from poker there are some other draws to this game, the most important being the unlocks for other games.  Having accomplished a lot of these unlocks I can safely say, they’re really not worth it.  From what I can tell each character has a “special item” you can win, by winning the poker game while they have the item up for grabs.  That means there are only 4 special items, each of which unlocks a few things across the different games the characters come from.  Most of the unlocks are simply cosmetic, and won’t actually mean much to anyone.  There are a series of these, again simply cosmetic.  You win points for playing poker and completing “achievements” that are assigned to you at the start of the game, like defeating 2 opponents in a head-to-head match.  These points can be used to unlock different cosmetic styles for the poker table, chips, cards, etc.  The unlocks are themed after the various games the characters are from (portal included).  That said, once you find and unlock your favorites there really is no further use for the points.  I had a bunch of the unlocks done within the first 3 hours, which really left me not wanting to do any more.  All in all, and I really hate to do it, I have to give Poker Night 2 a thumbs down.  At best it’s a gimmicky way to play Omaha or Texas Holdem poker (those are the only two modes available).  I went in hoping for more, and maybe that’s what led me to being so disappointed with it.  I’ll probably still play it from time to time as a time waster, but it’s not a game I’m willing to recommend.			"

												The game is unplayable due to a game-breaking bug. Whenever a sidepot forms and one of the two players still in the main plot folds, the game gets stuck and does not progress. Sure, you could play in a convoluted way to try to avoid this situation ever occurring, but that isn't very fun. There doesn't appear to be any fix and it hardly seems like the game is supported.

												Poker Night 1 with slightly better UI, a reworked Rewards system, less-interesting unlocks, and all the personality of a can of Coke Zero.When your single-player poker game relies on unlocks and personality to sell itself, that's not a good thing.Danny Webber, the voice of Ash, deserves special mention as one of the most wooden voice actors I've heard in 2013. David Nowlin (Sam) is in way over his head as usual, failing to add the comedic punctuation and nuance that Sam's lines demand (one of the many reasons why the Telltale incarnation of Sam & Max has fallen far short of the original). Brock Samson is about as bland a character as it gets - deliberately so or not, it makes no difference; intentional blandness is still blandness. And finally, Claptrap manages to be even more obnoxious than both Strong Bad and Tycho combined - an achievement of sorts, I suppose.The lines themselves repeat much quicker than the original Poker Night (it seems each character only has one ""reaction"" to an all-in, and given that all-ins occur quite often in poker, believe you me this is quite noticeable), and the TF2 rewards are a pair of Scout socks without a football (objectively inferior to the Football Manager socks), a mediocre Pyro hat, a Spy mask which by virtue of being a Spy cosmetic means that nobody will ever notice, and a Sniper hat that looks like five other Sniper hats. In other words, honestly nothing worth suffering through the stilted dialogue and soulless emptiness of ""Poker: Vs. CPU"".Just because it's cheap doesn't mean it's worth it.			"

												Much worse than the first game.1. Unable to skip most of the dialog with the right-click. Seriously, how could you do such a regression? Only the pre-game Winslow lines are skippable at all.2. Well, so maybe it's possible to go to the settings and just reduce chatter like it was in the first game? Nope, such option is similarly not available. WTF regression #2.3. Players bet completely randomly, they go all in with a low pair too many times. The bets are much heigher than in the first game too (which I guess is considered an improvement by some), but with wild loose betting this is just insane to play against. I've had many times gotten in a situation where they go all in with garbage on the flop, you call them out on this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and then miraculously they get a flush on the river – and you go start another tournament. Aggravating.4. Well, maybe there is, just like in the first game, a setting to flip ""from easy to hard"" that would suddenly make opponents sane? Nope. Not available either. WTF regression #3.5. The GLaDOS is wrtiten terribly. Super poorly. How could you misunderstand this character. The original GLaDOS never insults or underrates the player directly, her ""burns"" are quite smart and detached from an emotion to hurt the player, and this one is just spurring with stupid shallow ""you're stupid"" remarks. Idioticly unskippable repeatable remarks. This wouldn't have been a problem in the first game, where you can just right-click as soon as you hear the beginning of the ""biting in the ample posterior"" line, but nooooo.The better announcement of the rounds endings, a good probability system on showdowns — if only those would combine with the first game, it would be excellent. But no, this ""progress"" is hindered too much with intolerable regressions.			"

												Casual poker in its bluffing, tell guessing, strategizing, finest. If you are looking for a casual Poker game that feels like poker night at your friends place look no further. The jokes, stories and running gags keep the game upbeat and fun. Although PN2 will not make you feel like you are at a Hold 'em tournament in Vegas, it will give you all the things you love about the game of poker. Some noteable downsides include a lack of variable difficulty and no way to shut off the banter. However, the unlockables and themes add more value and stay true to the reason for picking up this game in the first place: To have fun!			"

												I bought this game how many months ago and the bloody thing still doesn't work.  It just gives me an error message every time at the same point in its loading sequence.  I get the logo and the preliminary sound effects, but the game itself just up and quits whenever it tries to load the opening sequence, or the main menu for that matter.  I don't even know which comes first, I've never even seen that far past the loading screen.  This game stole five dollars, except it didn't, the package deal to throw in Poker Night 1 was all I got.  I already had the first Poker Night game, that is what inspired me to buy the sequel in the first place.  And then it turns out from a review that I didn't even miss anything because it wasn't even Bruce Campbell as Ash from Evil Dead. And now all I have to show for it is a broken game and a broken link that takes me to it.  An unfulfilled promise from a overall unfulfilling game.  I cannot say which was worse.			"

												A simple poker game in which you play with several fictional characters from several media outlets. (Some of whom I recognize)There are only two poker games you can play: Texas Hold'em, and Omaha. (Compared to the first game which only had Hold'em)As a sequel, it improves upon several aspects of the first.1.) The addition of Omaha to the available gamemodes can shake things up a bit. But not much.2.) You can buy drinks so characters will show their ""tells"" more.3.) More unlocks. The addition of different poker chips as well as the ability to change the theme of the entire Inventory when completing a set, adds more variety cosmetically to prevent the game from going stale too quickly.4.) Challenges. Instead of just knocking out the person for his unlock, you have to complete challenges, and then win another tournament.5.) Multiplatform. It's not just on Steam this time, it's also on XBox, which means more accessibility.6.) More 3rd-party unlocks. Just like last game, you get to unlock ingame items for not only TF2, but Borderlands as well this time.7.) Better graphics.However, there are a couple things that makes it worse than the first game.1.) Less dialogue. There's less voice acting in this one, which means the talking can get repetitive much quicker than the first game.2.) Less options. There are less options that you can configure, particularly a ""dialogue frequency"" option that controls how much the characters talk. This helps exemplify the problems of number 1.Verdict:7.5/10Conclusion:Compared to the first game, it improves some aspects, but falls short on others. I gave the first game a 7/10, I'll give the sequel 6.5/10, with the fanboy in me bumping it up to 7.5/10 (like last game) because of the characters and witty dialogue.If you're looking for a poker game, this wouldn't be for you. But if you're a fan of the characters, enjoy some witty dialogue, and wouldn't ming getting a few more special items to your TF2/Borderlands inventory, and wouldn't mind the bargain price of $5, then I'd highly recommend this game.

												In my opinion this is a game worth you're money, 5$ for hours of poker with a orignial dialoge, though characters tend to repeat sayings and things like that, its far from annoying. If you are interested in learning how to play poker this is also a good choice, it eases you into the basic rules and the game is somewhat easy in the sense that the npcs you play against have easy ""tells"". Which, if you don't know, tells you if they are lying, telling the truth, ect. Over all this game is a great game if you wanna learn the basics of poker or if you just a simple poker game in generall.			"

												It's a single player poker game, its fun, challenging, gives tf2/Borderlands 2 items/skins, it has characters from different games, their jokes and conversations are fun, but after playing some hours they become repetitive but you can unlock more while earning tokens, this game doesn't have a lot to do, but for 5€/$ is good. If Telltale decides to make a 3rd part they could add a The Walking Dead character, this would be awesome.However it has some issues when you unlock some Borderlands 2 bounty items, it's really more a Gearbox SHiFT issue because Borderlands 2 uses it detect shift codes or other stuff on your account(separated from Steam), and it won't detect like half of your obtained items for Borderlands 2, so you have to keep trying or write to Gearbox support, tf2 has no problems with that since this game don't use any stupid non-Steam account system inside their game.

												Sigh.I have tried to enjoy this game, I really havee but I just cannot, even if you want to play with game and cartoon characters you love I still can't recemend this game to you.If you dished out the small price for this game then it was most likely because they dangled team fortress 2 and borderlands 2 items in front of you and I bet that you stopped playing when you got the items, why?Poker games are suppose to be based on chance and be a enjoyable experiance with a high reward if you manage to win your hand BUT this game seems to disagree, the game's AI loves to♥♥♥♥♥♥tease you by dealing the card that will make you lose LAST, and no this is not a series of bad luck, this is consistant for EVERYONE, you can easily look on youtube and find a overstock of videos with the same event which means there is no chance, your going to fail if you all in everytime!Next up I would like to talk about the conversations and characters interations with you, and let me be blunt. they love treating you like s*** no I'm not kidding, it is not jeers or jokes about you, this is literaly pure spite, but with a character like glados this is understandable, she is not programmed to be ""user friendly"" if you play portal you know that very well but all characters treat you like this, one moment that really annoyed me was when the characters had a pre game conversation, one character asked why it was 20,000 buy in instead of the old 10,000 before-hand (why was that believed to be a improvement I don't know) and the host explains ""this was to bring in more upper class gamblers to the club"" and literaly one of the chacters ask ""then what is the player doing here then""That line would have been ok if the other characters went into uproar saying that was uncalled for and mean but instead what do they do, they all take a long stare at you, no other words are spoken and no expression is on their face, they just look silently at you and start to play, this is few of the actions they will perform to you.But there are a few good things to the game, one of which is being able to buy the characters drinks, getting them slightly drunk you can acturaly make them show off tells so you know if its a bluff and you can call on them, this would have been a great feature but the AI is ♥♥♥♥ed and the characters will do tells even if they have the most godly hand and even if it does suck the AI will give them a winning hand on the final card so it does not matter too much.On your loss Glados will come down to you and make fun of your loss, telling you are worthless and provide nothing to the world, then your kicked from your match back to the main menu, thats the best part, after being treated like crap you have even faster access to getting out of the game and uninstalling.Unless you like being treated like dirt.I recemend that youavoid this game at all costs.Buy the first one if you really want to play poker with game characters.

												Quite simply the best poker game out there to get. Texas hold 'em is here again as well as Omaha hold 'em this time around, which I am much better at. More crossoveryness, with extra characters besides the 4 other players (GLaDOS is the mother♥♥♥♥ing dealer). Even more unlockables than the first game, since there are 5 items for Team Fortress 2 and even Borderlands 2 this time, with its own set of 5. Just greatness all around, I just wish there were more voice clips. The first game had 4 different settings to select from for the conversations, and this one has no such thing, nor any difficulty options. The AI is noticeably smarter than the first game, and this one just a lot more enjoyable all around. You can earn inventory coins to buy sets of chips, decks, and tables, one of each for each of the 5 franchises represented here. I never thought there would have been a sequel to Poker Night at the Inventory, and now that there is one, I hope to see more in the future, cause this♥♥♥♥♥♥s great, and poker is a gold mine for iconic character crossovers and goofy interactions between them. Such as Claptrap flirting with GLaDOS. More of that please, Telltale.			"

												Quite simply the best poker game out there to get. Texas hold 'em is here again as well as Omaha hold 'em this time around, which I am much better at. More crossoveryness, with extra characters besides the 4 other players (GLaDOS is the mother♥♥♥♥ing dealer). Even more unlockables than the first game, since there are 5 items for Team Fortress 2 and even Borderlands 2 this time, with its own set of 5. Just greatness all around, I just wish there were more voice clips. The first game had 4 different settings to select from for the conversations, and this one has no such thing, nor any difficulty options. The AI is noticeably smarter than the first game, and this one just a lot more enjoyable all around. You can earn inventory coins to buy sets of chips, decks, and tables, one of each for each of the 5 franchises represented here. I never thought there would have been a sequel to Poker Night at the Inventory, and now that there is one, I hope to see more in the future, cause this♥♥♥♥♥♥s great, and poker is a gold mine for iconic character crossovers and goofy interactions between them. Such as Claptrap flirting with GLaDOS. More of that please, Telltale.			"

												A simple poker game in which you play with several fictional characters from several media outlets. (Some of whom I recognize)There are only two poker games you can play: Texas Hold'em, and Omaha. (Compared to the first game which only had Hold'em)As a sequel, it improves upon several aspects of the first.1.) The addition of Omaha to the available gamemodes can shake things up a bit. But not much.2.) You can buy drinks so characters will show their ""tells"" more.3.) More unlocks. The addition of different poker chips as well as the ability to change the theme of the entire Inventory when completing a set, adds more variety cosmetically to prevent the game from going stale too quickly.4.) Challenges. Instead of just knocking out the person for his unlock, you have to complete challenges, and then win another tournament.5.) Multiplatform. It's not just on Steam this time, it's also on XBox, which means more accessibility.6.) More 3rd-party unlocks. Just like last game, you get to unlock ingame items for not only TF2, but Borderlands as well this time.7.) Better graphics.However, there are a couple things that makes it worse than the first game.1.) Less dialogue. There's less voice acting in this one, which means the talking can get repetitive much quicker than the first game.2.) Less options. There are less options that you can configure, particularly a ""dialogue frequency"" option that controls how much the characters talk. This helps exemplify the problems of number 1.Verdict:7.5/10Conclusion:Compared to the first game, it improves some aspects, but falls short on others. I gave the first game a 7/10, I'll give the sequel 6.5/10, with the fanboy in me bumping it up to 7.5/10 (like last game) because of the characters and witty dialogue.If you're looking for a poker game, this wouldn't be for you. But if you're a fan of the characters, enjoy some witty dialogue, and wouldn't ming getting a few more special items to your TF2/Borderlands inventory, and wouldn't mind the bargain price of $5, then I'd highly recommend this game.

												I bought this game how many months ago and the bloody thing still doesn't work.  It just gives me an error message every time at the same point in its loading sequence.  I get the logo and the preliminary sound effects, but the game itself just up and quits whenever it tries to load the opening sequence, or the main menu for that matter.  I don't even know which comes first, I've never even seen that far past the loading screen.  This game stole five dollars, except it didn't, the package deal to throw in Poker Night 1 was all I got.  I already had the first Poker Night game, that is what inspired me to buy the sequel in the first place.  And then it turns out from a review that I didn't even miss anything because it wasn't even Bruce Campbell as Ash from Evil Dead. And now all I have to show for it is a broken game and a broken link that takes me to it.  An unfulfilled promise from a overall unfulfilling game.  I cannot say which was worse.			"

												For those that are familiar with the first game, they will feel right at home here.  Even at the title screen, references to the games and videos that the game's characters overflow here.  From the gorillas from Sam & Max to the bartender from Borderlands, there is always something around to tie the oddly matched characters together.  There is even is photo at the staircase showing the characters from the first game.  If you are willing to let your eyes roam, there is plenty to see.Another visual detail about the game is the unlockables.  Just like the first game, you can earn unlockables that lets the player customize the look of the game.  Unlike the first game, those unlockables have an affect on the game.  By using an entire set, it causes both how the area looks as well as how the characters talk.  A prime example of this is watching your opponents leaving through the Venture Brothers' teleporter.  Knowing that each set has something special to see, this gives extra variety to what the characters could say and do.Speaking of the talking, that is the real draw about the game.  As with most Telltale Games titles, the humor alone makes the game worth playing.  From moments like the robots dealing with paradoxes, Ash learning about his unknown fame, and Brock dealing with dubstep, listening to what they have to say will keep you coming back to more.The one big problem about the first game is still present in this game.  That problem is the lack of variety in the gameplay.  Seeing that Texas Hold 'em is the most popular version of poker, it is understandable that they feature it in this game.  New to the mix is Omaha, a variant of Texas Hold 'em.  However, they still choose to ignore other popular variants of the game.  Games like Stud and the classic Draw are out of the mix.  Even within the Community games, there are more games like Razz available to play.  By only focusing on two similar versions of same game, the gameplay still feels limited.  Once you are used to the two games, it will leave you wanting more.  Having Blind Man's Bluff, something featured in Sam & Max Episode 103, would have been perfect for Telltale's style of humor.  If they are going to make a third game, they really need to add more types of games, not just slight changes of the same game.			"

												Tell-tale Games are back once more, with a terrible poker game which 98.5% of people buy purely for the Team Fortress 2 items! [Including myself!]In all fairness, this sequel to Poker night at the inventory isn’t actually as bad as the first one, in my opinion anyway. The AI in this game is a tad bit smarter then before, you can still try to rustle up a method of getting around it, but it is nowhere near as manipulable. And I actually enjoyed the dialog in this one a lot more than the first, still repetitive, just not as much. I could even go as far as saying that my love for borderlands 2 and portal 2 actually made this game a lot more bearable for me, due to the familiar characters that I know I love. Even the pixelated love of my life “Steve” makes an appearance. The quite humorous lines and cut scenes again make this game a lot easier to play.Although the actual gameplay part to this game has improved in my opinion, the item-grabbing side to it, I was really bummed out by. The only reason for that being that it was A LOT more difficult to get these items. And when I finally got that last one, i was actually close to celebrating. It really was a challenge getting each characters bounty item.All in all this game is an improvement on the first one, a lot more work for the items and still something I would consider to be uninteresting to people actually interested in poker. I think poker should be left to us humans; AI really isn’t a good idea when it comes to a game that’s supposed to be so well thought through. "

This game has better graphics than the first.The Bad: The difficulty seems a lot higher than the last version (Poker Night at the Inventory) and with no gameplay options such as difficulty settings and ability to turn off the talking once you've heard it all this game can get pretty frustrating. Also, its assumed that the player is a male. Not that that is huge but its noticable.Overall: I like the original game better because it didnt cream me every single round and if I just want to play poker I could turn off the chatting.

												An immersive and funny game. It definitely feels like playing with friends in real life, but with video game characters. They'll eventually start making small talk, discussing about anything and it will get repetitive after a while, but it's a rather immersive atmosphere, with the characters feeling like being alive with their gestures, their replies and their moves. GLaDOS makes an excellent dealer, with her snide remarks as always. It could use more characters to play with, though, if we want tournaments, more characters should be attempting to play in, even if they can't play all at the same time. It would be more diverse and even more challenging. Despite this minor flaw (that is understandable), it's a real fun game, and I would recommend it again and again if I could.			"

												It's poker. I shouldn't need to describe that any further. If you don't already know what poker is then you prolly shouldn't buy this game.The neat thing about Poker Night 2 isn't in the actual gameplay. Again, it's just poker. What makes the game neat is the fact that you're playing poker with an interesting set of characters. Each character has their own set of tells and conversations they will strike up with each other. It's fun and cute for a while.I say ""for a while"" because eventually they start repeating themselves. Once I started seeing the same dialog over and over, I started to tune it out. At that point, I was really just playing computer poker by myself. So overall: It's poker. Do you want to play poker or not?			"

												For all Pokerfans is this a must! Its funny and the atmoshere is just cool. And for sll achievments hunters, it's easy to earn all of them. If you got Team Fortress 2 or Borderlands 2 you surely want the special items. I love these quests to end. It makes me playing longer than normal. On the first part of this game you could close and open the game until they offer their special items, here is not that easy. You have to end those quests to let them offer their special items. Cool is the new feature where you can buy some alcohol for the mates. This let them say what for a hand they have. I always wanted to change the styles sometimes because to play on the same table, background, cards and chips will get boring and here we can change these styles. Negative is that sometimes the rounds are bugged then you have to close the game to continue. This is the only negative aspect here. All in all this game is just amazing. If you love to poker or want those items then you should buy this game. You won't regret it!			"

First you have to be only with one other person, you must not have anything but like a jack high, queen high, king high, and ace high (I think), and last you must have a higher card then the other player( like i think 10 but mostly jack and up).

												It is fun for a couple hours, but it soon gets boring if you hear Max talking about the amount of hamdingers the pot could buy for the 100th time. Initially it seems that they actually put some effort in the amount of lines your opponents can say, but sadly they run out too quickly. I continued playing for the Borderlands 2 rewards, but did not get them because of some common glitch. Long story short, you have to contact support before you get your rewards in the other games. And you'll probably need a bit of patience after contacting support with your request... Hey maybe it will fix itself after a while, just don't delete the game because it does not seem to upload the savefile to steam. And geting the steam achievements somehow does not give the rewards either. Yes good times.My tip, if you really want it, wait for a good sale. I got it dirtcheap and that made it more worthwhile.

												A TERRIBLE Poker game. In this day and age who wants to play Poker with AI? You know the ones who only bet if they have good cards? The dialogue is okay, but they begin to repeat themselves after a while, and they drag on the hands.If you really want a Poker game, find one where you can play online with other people / friends. Full House Poker on Xbox Live is one of my favorites. Unless you want to grind (for hours) trying to unlock the cosmetic items in TF2 and borderlands 2, I'd highly suggest passing this up.			"

Poker Night 2 is the poker game I always wanted. Quick, easy, with fun dialogue and characters. If you like the game of poker, and want to play it with some characters from video games, or if you just want the TF2 items, for this price, it's a steal. It gets repetitive, yes, but there's a lot of fun in just sitting down and play some poker while listening to music in the background.+ Good graphics, Telltale-style, so it's a bit cartoonish+ Easy to run+ There's a lot of fun in just playing poker+ Fun characters+ Funny dialogue+ Great timewaster+ Cheap= I think if multiplayer was added, this would be more played and more funOverall, I'd recommend picking this up if you like poker, Portal 2, TF2, or just want the TF2 items. It's a great title, with lots of fun to be had.Final conclusionA: Must have.B: Great game, picking this title up in a sale is almost a steal.C: It's OK, worth it in a sale, but lower your expectationsD: Not worth it, unless it's 90% off, or if you really want itE: Technical disaster, do not buy this at any circumstances			"

												This game is a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Your opponents get frequent straights, flushes, and full houses. Also, if you go heads-up with an opponent, they'll often get a winning card that was already played. In other words, they'll get cards that shouldn't even be in play within the deck, if you're keeping track of the numbers.I've played lots of poker games over the years, from WSOP titles to MTV's Stacked and online poker games, and I say to go play Stacked instead of this if you can manage to get your hands on a copy. This game is nothing but [RNG] hell.			"

												Enjoyed the first game, but cannot recommend the second.  Repetitive dialog that cannot be disabled continually slows down the game.  Although it was a bit fun at first.The game also cheats, for lack of a better term.  Based purely on game statistics, it appears that there is a mechanism in place to keep players from going all in.  I play a lot of hold-em and it is pretty obvious to me that the game is not on the level when the player goes all in.  Play the hand with standard betting, no problem.  Go all in with a 80% hand and you will lose 90% of the time.  So, standard hold-em strategy will not work properly.In pure English the deck is stacked against you in a way that defies normal play when you go all in.  You will lose a lot more than you should.  I am not talking a little bit either.  They probably did this to weed out the players who go all-in all the time and win based on pure luck and not skill, but it removes an element that makes hold-em the popular go to game every where, the show down.  Couple that handicap with the fact that some of the bounties require you to win those show downs and this gets even more frustrating as the only real way to do this is grind away until the game gives you a break and lets you win a hand you should win with no problem.

												I bought this on the many glowing reviews I read of the game, and can't for the life of me figure out why any of them were posted lol.  This game is incredibly shallow, and is filled to the brim with repetitive, unskippable dialogue.  It's also quite shallow in terms of unlocks and game modes to explore.This could have been such a great game with just a few very easy changes.  Being able to have some sort of 'fast play' mode would have done it alone.  At least then you could burn through some poker hands without sitting for 30 seconds at a time listening to the same banter you've heard 100 times before.Avoid at all costs unless you just want the unlocks.

The game was so slow paced that it drove me insane because you can't adjust the level of chit chat like you could in Poker Night 1.Combine this with the AI saying the same things every 30 seconds makes this game a nightmare to play. Each tournament takes like 30 minutes so good luck getting those promo items. Another thing, those morons at Telltale Games stuffed the achievement system so those who play this single player game in offline mode will have to contact Gearbox and Steam support for their items. AND I PAID $1 FOR THIS SH*T.(♥♥♥♥ YOU CLAPTRAP, SHUT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP. I THOUGHT U WERE ANNOYING ENOUGH IN PANDORA BUT HERE YOU ARE UNBEARABLE X.X)2/10. Would have rated higher if Moxxi replaced Claptrap			"

												I hate PN2 with a passion!Another game in which AI BLATANTLY cheats (last card BS). It's so obvious how AI always get better cards but some people still believe in TT statement that AI doesn't cheat.Even worse, you can't skip cuting scenes and dialogues. They are funny first several times, but hearing same thing again and again is very annoying. I have to completely shut down sound in game and listen internet radio. Half game's time is QTE!!!Buy only on fire sale and for TF2/BL2 items if you play those games. Otherwise, no as is terrible poker game.			"

												To be perfectly honest I actually found Poker Night 2 to be kinda meh. While Poker Night 1 had some redeeming moments I just didn`t really feel it with this one.I think my biggest gripe is moreso to do with how Ash Williams is in this game. Don`t get me wrong I am most likely the biggest Evil Dead fan out there. But Bruce Campbell, who portrayed him in literally all of his actor and VO appearances (excluding the musical) doesn`t voice him here. It`s just jarring, like someone trying to do an impression with none of the charm.Add to that the unlocks are also pretty ehh as well, none of them particularly stand out compared to the Poker Night 1 unlocks. In general it just makes me scratch my head as to why this was made in the first place.			"

												Meh. Almost everything in Poker Night 2 feels bad comparing to Poker night in the inventory.If you're here just for the hats, wait for the sale, try to play it, then unlock your achievements using cheats.The casino is way more crowdy, no more little comfy company.The players are overall bad, except may be the Claptrap, as long as he doesn't flirt with Glados.You thought Strong Bad was bad? Well, enjoy the company of such mоrоns like Brock Samson and Ash Williams.I don't care if they were good in their own universes, they don't belong in poker night.The game starts with Brock wasting the previous unnamed player, then Ash says ""We're all celebrities here, and who's this lame"" (pointing on you). Then, after you knock out everyone except Brock, he'll threaten to beat you up if you win the tournament and then he's told that the winner will be escorted by casino security to prevent this.Very friendly and relaxing atmosphere, right? And don't forget Glados popping up on the screen every other minute, spamming its ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice lines.The only good thing in this game so far is various list of cosmetic unlocks for decks, cards, chips and even the casino itself (although the prices are weird, portal themed items costs much more than borderlands themed items, for example) and a huge variety of additional dialogues you can enable with activating the whole set of themed unlocks.Requested: list of tf2 items you can get from this game.[wiki.teamfortress.com] "

												A fun Hold 'Em and Omaha poker game.Featuring characters like Ash Williams from the Evil Dead and Army of Darkness movie franchise, Claptrap from the Borderlands games, Brock Samson from the TV cartoon series, The Venture Bros., and Sam & Max from the Sam & Max games and GLaDOS from the Portal games.Every character has a unique, clever and funny personality, all done with excellent voice acting. It is a lot of fun to watch them in full conversations with each other during the game. Listening to them telling stories about their personal lives, cracking jokes at each other, showing emotions of sarcasm, anger, nervousness and sympathy as the game plays out.For a poker game, I found Poker Night 2 very entertaining and highly recommend it if you are a fan of the characters from their TV shows, movies and video games. :)			"

												If you're here for the TF2 items, be ready to invest some hours into this game. Unlike it's younger brother, you cannot simply rush achievements; there's a new bounty system. The bounty system can be extremely unforgiving, especially to those who don't know the game very well. The cards that you are dealt can also make you want to uninstall the game, especially when you are drawing dead for 30+ hands. The bots don't know that they're doing, sometimes they flop a house and other times call with air/limp with nothing. You cannot predict the bots, and be sure to only all in when you have something higher than two-pair, because this game can screw you up. A letdown in terms of poker, you can't even skip the dialogue; and after a while it just gets so annoying. Once I get all the promo items, I'll  be sure to uninstall this one.EDIT: Lost my first potential bounty item with a Queen 10 to 5 3. You'd think they turn the game in your favour...			"

												It looks quite neat at first and the ability to unlock BL2 (also TF2 but screw TF2) items is sweet, but...I could swear the game cheats, the AI knows when I'm bluffing and won't fold if I am whereas if I have a really good hand they back away from even a tiny raise (or 'happen' to have an EVEN BETTER hand). Surely this could just be coincidence but I'm starting to see a grim pattern here.The dialogue gets painfully repetitive after two or three hours and you can't skip anything but the tournament intro speech. Some pieces of dialogue take a while and make the game torturously slow.I've never been very good at poker in real life so I can't really tell what's the game cheating and what's me being rubbish but I'm quite convinced the game doesn't play exactly fair. After a while the only reason I keep playing it is to get the unique items for a different game so that's probably not a sign of this one being that amazing in itself.			"

												A weak sequel to Poker Night at the Inventory. The character selection is a lot less synergistic than the original and feels like it was just made with licensing leftovers. Unlike Original Inventory, the dialogue between characters is VERY annoying, full of memes, and they took away the ability to set how frequently conversations start as well as the ability to skip lines, meaning if you play the game for more than a few minutes you will find yourself losing control of the game for long periods of time while the circle of play is interrupted for another unskippable cutscene you've already seen a hundred times. Glados is scripted to mock you no matter which move you make, even if you play well, and her sass is also unskippable, which just makes the game a slow-paced, annoying slog where every hand you wait 45 seconds for someone to finish repeating a story just so you can click Check and then wait another 10 seconds while Glados explains why you're an idiot until you find the one button she doesn't have a comeback for: Quit.

												Frustrating. I consider myself somewhat good at poker. I always seem to win against my friends and in other games. I have played probably around 20 rounds and have not won even once. Maybe I just suck but I have seen things in this game that I have never seen in real life poker. Some of the other opponents just get too lucky... Another gripe is that the hands are obviously pre determined and not random at all. I have seen more than 4 of the same cards more than once. It kept happening with claptrap, we would both get 3 of a kind and tie with the same cards. There is no way that there can be 6 aces on the table because there are only 4 in a deck. That in itself is an obvious flaw and is what has made me quit playing this game. I cannot reccomend this game but I can however, reccomend the poker in Watchdogs. Not as entertaining but much more fair.			"

												This game, unlike it's first counterpart, is a work of art.  Despite the bots' annoying impulses to go all in way too often, the game is really fun.  Especially hearing the players converse about their lives and make jokes.  The game also features some TF2 items, which you earn by winning the bounty items of the other players.  If this sounds like your kind of game, you should  buy it.  However, stay away from the first Poker Night game... just saying.			"

												You can unlock stuff for borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2, witch is nice.Funny coments BUT NOT a very good poker engine. Multible time I got a hand that at least be a draw, but the cpu plays it bad and I loose.Example: The Cpu play a Flush with 4 card of the flop. I got pair K but also Flush with 4 cards from flop. But cpu takes it as pair insted of at Flush and I loses. I had a higer Flush and shoud hav won, at least be a Draw / split pot.But not the way it rolls in this game, therfor I can not recomend it.

												I have to say this is a really fun little game. Playing poker with several famous game characters really is a nice little way to pass the time. I can't really say much more than that, if you can play poker you can play this and if you don't play then frankly it isn't too hard to learn but the quips do become slightly tiresome after a while but on the whole this is a fun, cheap game.Check out my Youtube channel for new lets plays every Monday and Fridayhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l1zwMcpJm_hJq4owO3nHg "

												Okay, let's get started.Poker Night 2 combines all different characters from games in a match of hold em' or ohama. That's it, TellTale?Well, here's the point. This game dosen't feel 'complete' in an any way. If you're blaming the now technological standards, go play Watch Dogs when it comes out. What I'm saying here is this game isn't complete. If a game dosen't feel complete to me, I wouldn't like it that much. Away from the flaws, this game has good graphics and I like the way you win rewards for TF2 and BL2.You see, the original came out alot of days before, and it was nearly at the top of the awesomeness meter. But the only reason why the original did it is because it was 'the first game to combine famous characters in a game session we like' and 'the rewards are awesome because you can get them in TF2' and so on. It WOULD be so-so if I didn't care that much, but I felt like writing reviews today. If you just want the items, get the game. If you ever see me playing this, it's because I want to get the items for TF2 and BL2.Humpty			"

												DISCLAIMER: Don't play this game for too long in one sitting or very often. It could really use some setting adjustments and extra features. If you don't love Poker too much, then don't bother with this game, obviously.First off, I like the game concept in the sense that it's Poker (Texas or Omaha) with the addition of some nice characters from TV and video games: Brock Samson from Venture Bros, Claptrap from Borderlands, Ash from Evil Dead, Sam & Max from... Sam & Max, and GLaDOS from Portal. The game has an interesting personality with these characters because there's actually good dialogue and some very funny scenes that happen as you play. Hearing the characters bicker back and forth, or listening to GLaDOS giving sarcastic put-downs is hilarious.On the other hand, the above is really the only thing ""extra"" to the game. Without it, it's just another Poker game, and the bonus characters wear off pretty quickly. It's not that the characters and their personalities bother me, but it's that there simply isn't enough dialogue for the game, and there aren't enough game setting to manage.I had only played the game for less than a couple of hours, completing a few matches/tournaments, and already started encountering a lot of the same dialogue, thus it became very boring very quickly. The sad part about that is there aren't any settings to manage that. You cannot skip dialogue unless it is before the whole match begins or you just folded and want to skip to the next hand. If you are in the middle of the game, you just have to sit and wait. Many times did I place my bet and had to wait nearly over a minute to make my next move, because the characters would talk a lot before the next person would fold or bet.A minute isn't a lot of time, but when it happens very often, it can take a lot just to finish one hand and can be very boring if you have heard all of the dialogue by that point. Similarly, you can't change any gameplay settings to limit the dialogue.On top of the dialogue, you will encounter certain cutscenes sometimes in the middle of a match or when someone is eliminated or you win the game. You can't skip these either, thus they are just you sitting there for 3+ minutes at a time when you have seen them already as well.The only thing to change the dialogue is to change the Unlockables to 3 items matching one of the characters (e.g., a Venture Bros theme for the room). Doing so adds extra dialogue while you have all 3 items activated, and the dialogue pertains mostly to the matching character and things involving the show or game world. While the new rooms are a nice touch, you still run out of dialogue quickly, and further the rooms actually add longer custcenes for elimination and winning, thus you have to sit and repeat things even more.All in all, that really makes the game boring and take way more time after you've played a handful of rounds (per room). Being able to manage the dialogue occurrence and being able to skip it and the scenes would be a lot more useful if you're tired of seeing the same thing over and over.Because of the above, the game therefore turns into a basic Poker game that is artificially extended by repetitive dialogue and scenes. No other real settings exist for the game, and the only extra addition to the game is the Bounties. The Bounties are essentially goals that you get and you must complete 3 of them in order to compete for a Bounty Item. Once you get to the Bounty Item, you must win the entire match (and eliminate everyone) in order to win the Bounty Item. Once you do, you simply unlock an item for Borderlands 2 and for Team Fortress 2.The Bounties themselves are really a pain. They are randomly generated, and once you get them, you cannot change them. Depending on your luck, you may get really simple Bounties like ""Order a drink"" or ""Come in 3rd place or better"", which are relatively simple things to do. Otherwise, you will get the worst ones such as ""Win with a flush or better"" or ""Win with a high card"" which can take indefinitely to get, because none of those things are up to you. They are just up to luck. Having to win with a high card means pretty much everybody at the table has to get no special card matches and then you just have a King and everyone else has less, for instance. There's a few other ways to get it, but it's really less often than winning with a Pair, for instance.You just have to play and play and play and play, eventually getting the Bounties. It is just a waste of time and pointless, since there really isn't any skill involved in those. Poker does require skill, but only in terms of generally winning, not winning with a specific pattern.All in all, I don't mean to say that the game is terrible. The dialogue and scenes, when you first experience them, are absolutely hilarious and I loved it. But the game dies out pretty quickly, and it's a shame. They really should have added some extra features and especially configuration to the game.			"

												If you're an avid poker player - don't bother.  Witnessed Claptrap call all-in with a pair of deuces against Ash's straight.  Either Claptrap's balls are really made out of steel or the game's AI is seriously lacking.  You sit with the same four mugs starring at you every game, and buy-ins never increase.  Jokes and conversations get recycled way too often.  Entertaining when you need to kill some time because your wife is taking two hours to get ready for work and you're already 30 minutes late on a Monday morning.

Short ReviewPoker Night 2 is an average poker game, yet it shines due to the comedic relief supplied by many recognizeable characters over the years. After a few hours of playing however, the repeated jokes get very worn out. It's also important to mention that there really is no such thing as ""tells"" in the game, and some of the strategies the AI use are just illogical at times with no rhyme or reason.ScoreGood- 7/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game. It had all the good things a poker night game should have, and it carried not onyl big name characters, but unlockables for 2 other games. But after several hours of gameplay, I have to toss it into the♥♥♥♥♥♥pile.The Banter between the characcters is good, but in general the game is insulting to the player with every move they make. After wiping all of them out 3 times, being called an idiot for the moves I make just starts to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. Bad move.But seeing as I piad a buck and a quarter for the game, I wasn't going to complain. But it had another, nastier secret.4 times in a row I had a winning full house. 4 times in a row I went all in because I had a winning full house. 4 times I lost because it only counted it as 3 of a kind. The game can't even do the basic poker playing that my 1980's Macintosh could do with ease. They got a few rights, slapped together a few voice actors and put nothing into the game mechanics. Then they insult you on top of it. If you want to throw away your money for nostalgia, this is your game. If you are looking to play poker...let's hope you like long dialog before it gives you a chance to do anything.1 out of 5 stars. And the 1 is because I liked a couple of the characters.			"

And yes Brock, you can buy a lot of bowie knives with that money.It's very buggy, and I can't really recommend it even for the promos. Clicking a button too soon locks up the game completely, and everyone just sits there staring at you forever. And if you want the promos, you have to complete three challenges to unlock a bounty challenge. Those three challenges can be something like, ""Win a showdown with just a kicker"". In other words, I hope you like poker, because you're going to be playing a LOT of it.Basically, it's poker. But if you want poker, there's better things for it. Like going out, getting friends, and playing with them. Only buy this if you want the promo items.			"

												MORE GLADOS PLEASE!!!You like Poker? You like playing Poker with fictional characters of some of your games? You would like to play poker with the always ""motivational"" advice of GLADOS of Portal 2?Well, then this is your Poker game!I like the idea of playing one or two hands of poker in a while. And if you are into some funny dialogues as kind of ""story"" you will experience some good time with Poker Night 2. I played the first part as well but part 2 is even better because of GLADOS is being the card dealer. I think ""her"" monologues from Protal 2 are some of the funniest things in computer gaming history.As special motivation you can win some items for other computer games (Team Fortress 2 & Borderlands) if you complete some special tasks. And I really would like to see a third part of Poker Night. Maybe with some skins for CS:GO this time. Wouldn't mind to beat a terrorist or counter at the poker table ;)			"

												A great game and a definite improvement over the first Poker Night! I originally bought it just to get the items for TF2, but it turned out to be much more than i expected. With captivating conversations between the players, a tantilizing soundtrack,  and lots of unlockable content, this game turned out to be money well spent.			"

												the real problem with this game is the impossiblity of the challenges needed in order to get into the prize games.it gives you three ""challenges"" which are like ""steal the blinds"". very easy. I did the first 6 in the game i got them.the problem is the achievment: ""win a showdown with a better kicker"". I've had that challenge for the longest time and lost countless showdowns with a smaller kicker. I would suggest that a skip challenge or complete 3/4 to progress would be better. this challenge is garbage. me complaining about odds: yeah this game is fun if you like losing. It's obviously possible to do well but it requires so much luck. I cant count the number of times I will go in with 70%+ odds and lose out. the dialog is fun for the first hour but then its slow and repetitive.after 17 hours I have 500k. one win = 100k and 5 losses = -100kthat means I'm five wins over average, which means about a 4:1 lose:win ratiothose odds are complete depressing garbage. with no rhyme or reason i constantly lose on decent odds			"

												I enjoyed this game, honestly. The dialogue is great and the challenge is at a rough but attainable level. I felt like I was playing Hold 'Em poker with old friends. What I'm most disapointed about is the lack of support with the Borderlands 2 skins. I've unlocked everything but as many times and I mash download, check my linked SHiFT account, and even checked my NewU station in Borderlands 2.Now as disapointed as I am with spending 12 hours to get these rewards and come up with nothing I can still recommend its a great game... just don't purchase this game for the BL2 skins... you will be massively disapointed. 7/10Edit 1/4/14: After working with the wonderful folks at gearbox support they have corrected the issue and I now have my skins!

												With $96,000 in a 1 on 1 against ash, he gets 2 aces the flop then revealing another ace or even 2, 3 hands in a row, then getting a 1% chance flush, a 20% chance straight, and continues his hands that cannot ever lose until I have 20k and he has 80k; this♥♥♥♥♥♥didn't happen once, I had this or other such systematic forced losses over and over again. So if you want to play poker I suggest you find a game where the odds and the players involved matter and it isn't a pre-determined flop and hand before you even get your cards.Not only that but any time I had any chance of winning (that fit to the pre-determined flop) every character just folds, I could simply call and the next chance they get they fold. One might say the point of the game is the witty commentary, but that is only 90 minutes or so, and you can simply listen to that anywhere, when the game is so rigged that you could just go all in every hand and have the same end result why even bother playing? In conclusion, if you want a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game where the only victory you get is a forced fold on a pre-determined hand/flop for all AI and yourself, and spend 30-100 minutes every game only to find out you had no real chance of winning to begin with then you can get this game, but I think you could find a better use for $5, like a cheap aids infected ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with no condoms, at least then when you have a guaranteed end you get to have sex.♥♥♥♥ this game, the items aren't worth it.

												I know almost everyone plays this game for the TF2 items, but here's how that's gonna go.Before we start, an exploit: If you close the game, it resets the last hand dealt when you come back in. Ergo, go all in all you want, there's no riskYou'll steamroll the first game.The second game will have three arbitrary challenges that will happen in any game.The third game will have run out of lines, and all you'll be hearing from this point on is:Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. Well that was a clever move that won't come back to bite you in your ample posterior. The poker algorithm is very basic, don't expect any of the other players to react to the possibility of having a hand, they only react to the amount of chips you use to bluff or raise at random to bluff, regardless of the cards on the table. Max will never ever bluff though.Also, you can buy them drinks at the start of the game, which makes them do their very obvious animation that reveals if they have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand.Oh, and they go all-in all the time. They'll go all in for a pair of twos when there's Ace, King, Queen, Jack on the table. In fact, Claptrap loves to go all in on the blinds.Also, after the second game, you will rarely ever win a hand. The characters will always magically have a better hand than you. Oh, you have a Straight Flush? Well, the guy you went all in to has a Royal Flush. However, Brock and Ash always have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hands. It's always a pair or two, never higher. You'll knock one or both of them on the first hand almost 1/3 times. Visually, it's pretty great. Everyone actually looks very much like they should. AND, unlike the first game, it doesn't have that stilted Telltale Pose-To-Pose animation where the character's face moves into an expression, then their body starts moving, then they stop moving, change faces, start another animation sequence.The characters will talk♥♥♥♥♥♥on every move you make, stopping the flow of the game, which makes you wish they get into a scripted sequence, because when that happens, they just play the ♥♥♥♥ing game.I give this game a Shut The ♥♥♥♥ Up GlaDOS/10			"

												Perhaps if I didn't suck at poker, I wouldn't get the feeling that the game keeps stacking the cards in the favor of the AIs. Still, it gets annoying constantly losing with a halfway decent hand. After calling significant bets as bluffs. Or having the last card played count in the opponent's favor when I clearly had the advantage after suckering them into large bets.But other than that, the game's great! And funny!			"

												Don't bother getting this if you played Poker Night 1. The game is the same, and the AI is just as dumb. The only one winning here is whoever decided that rushing out the same game with a slightly different setting and lesser-known characters wasn't a one-way ticket to Hell for excessive greed.Who are these characters anyway? Last game, they got Max from Sam and Max who we should all remember from childhood cartoons, Strong Bad from the most awesome flash website ever created, The Heavy from a FPS, and one original character who was a spoof of what TTG thinks of gamers which was actually somewhat amusing at times.This time, there's a bland angry guy who has the voice of Joe from Family Guy, some annoying robot thing that claims to be from Pandora but definitely was not in Avatar and was probably only included so the graphics people could work less, some guy called Ash who can't be the adult version of the Pokemon character unless he's fighting undead Marowaks or something, and finally the only character who isn't out of nowhere or just made up, Sam from Sam and Max.Even having Sam is barely enough, he was only given about 4 good lines, all where he's talking with Max rather than these other personality-deprived nobodies. Much more often, you're stuck hearing annoying robot guy's excessively long voice clips that can't be skipped and which pause the action (there really should be an option to mute him or replace him with Max or something), or having to hear 10+ times a game everyone overact to every All-In, despite how commonly the AI does it themselves. But at least GLADOS is the dealer so we don't have to hear bland short sailor guy talk much anymore.If you want to play poker online, find some other free website to play it at, it's not worth it to get this just for Sam, Max, and a couple of other much less interesting personalities, all backed by the same stupidly bluffing AI as the last game.

												worst poker game ever. if you want to play poker absolutely do not buy this. it cheats a lot and nothing is about luck or anything, even one time i had a full house but it counted it as a three of a kind to let a flush win. i only got it for the extras it give on other games etc. if you love any of the characters and want to hear them play i recommend you watch the game on youtube or something they are really hilarious but the game still sucks.

												MORE GLADOS PLEASE!!!You like Poker? You like playing Poker with fictional characters of some of your games? You would like to play poker with the always ""motivational"" advice of GLADOS of Portal 2?Well, then this is your Poker game!I like the idea of playing one or two hands of poker in a while. And if you are into some funny dialogues as kind of ""story"" you will experience some good time with Poker Night 2. I played the first part as well but part 2 is even better because of GLADOS is being the card dealer. I think ""her"" monologues from Protal 2 are some of the funniest things in computer gaming history.As special motivation you can win some items for other computer games (Team Fortress 2 & Borderlands) if you complete some special tasks. And I really would like to see a third part of Poker Night. Maybe with some skins for CS:GO this time. Wouldn't mind to beat a terrorist or counter at the poker table ;)			"

												I picked up this game for a solid key, and i must say it was worth it entirely! This game is extremly fun to play, and knocking players from your favourite games (such as clap trap and Sam) of the table is very enjoyable! However, there is a minor set back that may swing if you want to buy this game or not, and that is the in game items that you can obtain from this game (for tf2 and borderlans). In Poker Night 1, it was random and the players would put their items up, however, now you have to complete a set of challenges, then knock every player of the table in order to win the item. I find this fun and challenging, but i can see why people wouldn't like this change.(Would reccomend picking Poker Night 1 up as well!)			"

												This game is the bestest! I get to spend so much quality time with my favorite characters from my most favoritest TV show, video games, movie, and comic! The stakes are higher than the predecessor with longer lines, longer banter between characters, a hand-ful of non-playing characters participating in the longer banter, long animation cycles for each action done by all these characters, and the cherry to top it all off: it's all unskippable! Wow! Amazing! I love Claptrap! He's so zany even though he repeats the same dialogue over and over with the same exact tells and resulting actions in the same poker sesh, even repeating himself consecutively! And all of the other characters do this too! I love your repeated naggings, GLaDOS. Please marry me! I read Girls for M and I have some good ideas on how to further highlight how pathetic I am for playing this game, which each and every character in this game rush out to make obvious, and make this all kinkier than it already is, like the repeated flirtations between Claptrap and GLaDOS. Tie me up into a hog-tie like a pig ready for slaughter, stomp on my nards, and take all my money from my wallet, because I'm going to plop down for a preorder of the sequel to this bad boy of a game!

												I'm terrible at poker, but that dosen't stop me from enjoying this game. I'll admit that I bought it for the unlockables and was slightly interested by the characters, but having played it I must say its selling point is the dialogue. It is very well done, with all of the conversations having little to do with what is going on in the hand but more about the games of the characters themselves.  I may have slight bias due to GLaDOS being the dealer (She would not be as funny playing poker, that's for sure) but I would recommend this game to anyone who knows any of the characters here, regardless of how much they like poker. (There is an easy way to win each hand if you suck like I do, just look in the community guides.)			"

												As much as I want to recommend this game. I can not. Despite the GlaDoS quotes defintely living up to there potential as in Portal 2, there are extremely minimal of them and they become old very fast. Certain quotes just aren't witty or funny enough and drag out an extra 5 minutes pointlessly. Gameplay lacks as the AI can not calculate simple functions as Identifying a Full House vs a 3 of a kind and may often mistake Full Houses for 3 of a kinds thus making you lose. Also, some hands that you and your opponents get far too good cards to be a coincidence. The chances of you losing can go from an almost certain circumstance to an instant win too often.The aspect of bounties is a pain. Certain bounties are almost unbeatable and render the Item for Team Fortress or Borderlands an extreme waste of time. Such as the Win with a High card as there AI is built to immeditely fold when they do not get anything beyond a pair. The only time this is doable is when you either 1) Get extremely lucky or 2) You get a glitch happen. Either of which will take hours to wait forReview: Despite Quotes being well done, they are minimal and get old. Mechanics for the game require improvement as they are glitchy ocasionally in situations. Bounties will take forever and will not happen fastGameplay:6/10 (Only 2 modes. Could use more)Mechanics:3/10 (The Full house problem just happended again. Seriously) Quotes: 6/10 (GlaDoS quotes are amazing but burn out fast)Replayability: 8/10 (Game is unpredictable) Overal: 5/10			"

												AYOOO. I seriously am so glad I bought this game. Easily one of the most unique, and amusing, poker games I've ever played. With a plethora of interesting characters like GLaDOS, Brock Samson, Reginald Van Winslow and Ash Williams, this game has a ton of hysterical moments with each character exchanging quips and discussing various topics like personal servitude and job openings. The gameplay itself is fun and always engaging, using features like 'tells' and 'bounties' to create another layer of challenge and play style is beyond awesome. The different felts, decks and chips give you more reason to keep playing and earning fat stacks and the various easter eggs, references and jokes are all pretty clever. This game is also pretty hard to rage about, even when you lose a hand, just because of how utterly likeable and hilarious the characters are. I recommend this game to any poker fan, especially those who also love Evil Dead, the Venture Bros, Portal, Borderlands. By game mechanics alone, this game is great but when one takes into account the creativy and humor behind it, it's amazing. 10/10.			"

												I bought this game on a whim but I am definitely glad I did.Telltale Games once again deliver a game full of charm and character and there is little to complain about especially considering the price.This game is in basic a pretty good poker game, it entertains with appealing, crisp visuals and the UI makes play quick and easy. But if you don't especially like poker I wouldn't write this game off. You are joined at the table by Brock Samson from The Venture Bros, CL4P TRP from Borderlands, Ash Williams from Army of Darkness and Sam from Sam and Max. These four characters are packed full of witty and charming dialogue, their conversation and insults keep you very involved in the game and could even entertain you on their own. Each character also has distinct play-styles and always keep you on your toes. Unfortunately the dialogue has the habit of looping which can get extremely dull, most of the jokes stop being funny after about the third time. You might think this game would get fairly boring and inevitably it eventually will but it keeps play interesting with randomised challenges, customizable chips, cards and tables and unlockables for other games. This helps maintain the incentive to win despite being pitted against bots.  Overall it is definitely worth the price, full of charm and life and entertaining on multiple levels but please remember it is a poker game and it's not for everyone.			"

												Did I have fun? YesCould the games be improved? DefinitlyFun, but not enough gameplay past the cards. Should have more upgrades, characters, costumes, higher stakes, ect.The upgrades & room theme mechanic is something good, but i'm still left wanting more.The money holds no weight whatsoever (excluding the 1mil acheivment), which could have been easily fixed with upgrades from the bankroll as apposed to prize tokens that will never be at risk. The prize tokens give absolutely no weight to the upgrading system.Bankroll management is possibly the most important mechanic of poker & it really is shoved in a corner, which is dissapointing.They took away the option to minimize table talk. -_-The A.I. consistently makes nonsence plays. For example, it is not uncommon for Brock to call down three streets of value while holding nothing more than high card 8.			"

												Played this game now for a longer time. After some funny moments during the first hands, the characters and their comments become very annoying as the repeat and repeat and repeat (....) the same comments over and over. And there is no way of interrupting this. So the poker rounds become very lame. Avoid this one.			"

												It's a pretty fun game. I'll recommend it for its first couple of hours. If you buy it on sale, it'll be great value for your money.Unfortunately, PK2 overstays its welcome -- you'll get mad so many times at characters launching some of the long dialogue scenes you've been watching 8 times already and can never skip, plus there are tons of game-breaking bugs such as characters staring at nothing and the UI not allowing you to do anything but Alt+F4. Nice when you've got a winning hand. Don't expect to be able to complete the game without excellent luck, not only in your hands, but also with your computer.			"

												Telltale returns with their third poker game. This time it has Brock from Venture Bros, Claptrap from Borderlands, Evil Dead's Ash Williams, Telltale's own Sam and Max (originally of Lucas Arts fame), and finally GladOS from Portal as the dealer.The Bruce Campbell impersonator of Ash feels a little underwhelming, and I wish they could have just got Bruce himself in for the role, but all the other characters are spot on. The dialogue is charming. The gaming and betting AI is much improved from the predecessor, and the Animation is much smoother. I also like how the different styles of animation are maintained in the same engine. When you see the different kinds of cell shading on Brock and Claptrap, while having a different style of 3D renduring on Ash, GladOS, and Sam and Max while all staying true to the original styles the characters came from, it is pretty amazing.The only gripe I have is it seems the bluff vs tell animations are at random now, and there really is no longer a way to try and get a read on the characters, even after you buy them alcohol. In that way alone it feels like that is a bit of a downgrade from the previous Poker Night. Every other front seems to have improved though. They have now included Omaha as well as Texas Hold'em.  There is  now more diversified gaming AIs between the characters. For instance, Brock and Ash will constantly get into bidding wars, that everyone else should steer clear of. Finally, unlocking different table, card, and chip sets, also change the decor of the room, as well as add new themed dialoge to the characters and new elimination scenarios, which gives the game a little more longevity and adds to the fun.The cross-game unlockables are kinda meh-ish, but hopefully with so much other stuff in both Team Fortress and Borderlands, that's not the reason you're playing. I still recommend getting this game on it's own merits, and hope that Telltale revisits this franchise in the future, and maybe next time with a rotating cast of more characters.			"

												You get to play cards with some of the best, iconic characters in video games, comics, television, and movies... and also you get to play with Claptrap.In all seriousness though, this is a great game for people who felt Poker Night 1 was too easy.  Your opponents are more aggressive and smarter, and are more likely to recognize when they have a good hand, or when they know you can't afford to call their bluff.  The game may seem like it cheats, but in all honesty, that's how odds work in poker.  There are times I shouldn't have won but did.  The game requires brains AND guts, and if you have only one or the other, you may find yourself furstrated.  But don't let that discourage you - it's a great way to get your brain working and to build up your guts a bit, so I whole-heartedly recommend this game.			"

												The first Poker Night was a middle-of-the-road for me, but on the bright side it has taught me a lot of the basics of poker. Poker Night 2, however, seems to take that logic and throw it out the window.Before, your experience mainly depended on your skills with the element of chance that all card games have to offer. However, in Poker Night 2, the odds seem to be stacked against you. (Or at least is a buggy mess, but considering the types of glitches I've come across it's likely the former.)As I mentioned above, this seems to be a buggy mess. For instance, during a showdown against Claptrap, the odds meter on the top of the screen read my odds as 51%.... and Claptrap's as 52%.I've also been the victim of ""lesser readings"" as I call them, where the game interperets your hand not as the highest it possibly can, but rather as the lowest. For instance, in a 1 on 1 showdown with Max, a Flush that I had was read as a single pair of 2s; still technically right, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nonetheless.All in all, Poker Night 2 is a terribly broken trainwreck that pales in comparison to the original. Sure the new opponents are a nice change but I feel that the glitches and bugs it presents make it unworthy of most Steam libraries. "

												Total garbage as a poker game.The AI is completely absurd and plays like a dumb, drunk novice. It's essentially like playing against a random number generator. Whether the AI calls, bets, raises, bluffs or folds seems to have absolutely nothing to do with its hand or how the other players are playing the hand. It's as if the game was programmed by someone who has never played poker in their life.On top of that, the user interface is terrible and clunky. There's no option to skip dialogue. Although several of the exchanges between the characters are honestly funny the first or second time you hear them, they quickly lose their luster. Especially after you listen to Claptrap or GladOS smack talking you with the same line for the hundredth time after making a completely reasonable and statistically valid call or raise that just turned into bad luck because of a gut shot turn or river card in a hand that the AI had no business being in after the flop. Seriously, the option to skip dialogue would have gone a long way with this game.This game really has no value other than providing a cheap way to acquire some Borderlands 2 and TF2 vanity items. If you absolutely must have the items, then it's a decent buy.... iiiiiif you're willing to invest hours and hours to get the bounties for the item unlocks.If you're looking for a good poker simulator, stay the hell away from this pile.

Everytime I come close to winning, it ALWAYS comes down to the last card (The Turn or River, i don't remember which it is) and they ALWAYS beat me out.

												You should only buy this game to get the Team Fortress 2 and Borderlands 2 items. Not for actually playing poker.Pros:- Team Fortress 2 items- Borderlands 2 itemsCons:- Unable to skip dialog, thus resulting in an extremely irritating wait while you sit there in silence waiting to finish the hand. Happens constantly!I would only recommend this game if you have $2 laying around. No more. It's not worth it. In fact, I think the designers should pay YOU to play this game since it forces you to sit through the tiring dialog of these other poker players. Seriously, you have time to bake a cake, come back and they would still be talking.After I got the items I uninstalled the game with a smile gleaming from ear to ear knowing that I will never have to play this game again.

												First off all, this game is a major improvement from the first. The characters are way more interesting, you can buy drinks to accentuate your enemie's ""tells"" and when you buy a full set of cards, chips and table, the Inventory changes style to said set's world. The conversation between the character's is really great, and with the addition of GLaDOS as a dealer, gives you 1 more person that talks. I like the % that each player has in a showdown, giving you an idea of who's winning. To buy additionals, you need tokens, which you always get if you aren't the first to get eliminated. To get the special items for other games, you don't just need to eliminate the person who put it on play, you need to complete 3 challenges then win the tournament. An amazing poker simulator with something to lighten the mood.8/10			"

												Where do I start?First of all, this is a really bad poker game: dealing hands is clearly not pure chance even though that's how it should be. The computer clearly helps the AI by giving good cards to it in the river most of the time (I tested it just for the heck of it by going for the showdown all the time an at around 80% of the hands the AI won with bad cards by getting help in the river). Because of this Texas Hold'em is basically unplayable as it becomes a luck based guessing game with no strategy involved. Omaha is better so if you really want to see Sam & Max talking trash that game mode is the way to go. The AI itself is pretty bad, it makes stupid decisions while every character has a distinct playstyle that is easy to read. They never change their playstyles, they are always reacting the same way which makes the experience boring.And then there are the so called bounty challenges where completing 3 of them will unlock the chance to compete for one of the character bounties. Some of these challenges are nice and they require a bit of skill to pull off, others are purely luck based with a small percentage being outrageously luck based. This last category absolutely destroys the enjoyment of the game because if you get challenges like ""win a hand with 2 opponents going all in ""or ""win with the higher kicker"" your next move will be to just go and uninstall this mess instead of waiting for circumstances you have no chance of affecting occur. What's even worse is that you can't skip these challenges so if you get a bad 3 you're basically done for.Anyway the atmosphere is pretty cool, the unlockable decorations are nice and the characters are funny but everything gets old quickly. There's also no way to skip repeating jokes so you'll hear the same stuff all the time.Bad, really bad game.			"

												I was hoping to learn a little about poker with amusing characters to keep me entertained. What I got was a ruthless, buggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for fans who like to be kicked when they're down. The game has crashed on me repeatedly, and has forced me to restart Steam entirely. The initial back and forth between the characters is amusing, but quickly devolves into repeated dialogue and pointless insults in reponse to player behavior. I actually feel like I know less about poker than when I started. Poker Night is completely worthless.			"

												Poker night 2 is a much better sequel to an already awesome game. Poker night 2 has the most random charecters that dont mix at all Claptrap from Borderlands 2, Brock from Venture bros, Ash from Evil dead, Sam from sam and max and Galados from Portal as your dealer. Youre there because you want to play some poker. Now going in its way harder than the first game. Ai will know when youre bluffing or when you get them drunk they will use bad cards in your favour. The gameplay stays the same from the first one. Also the jokes are funny as hell but they do repeat themselfs.  Also they added a new mode which is omaha which is a nice edition but now about the loot. Not only do you get in game loot which looks amazing such as Poker felts, cards and chips but also you get Borderlands 2 skins and also Team fortress 2 items.Overall you have an awesome game which is fun as hell and worth it so go ahead and check it and if youre tight on buget pick this one instead of the first but if you have enought money for both thats awesome so go ahead and check it out i give it a 8.5/10			"

												No multiplayer is a huge downside for any card game involving multiple ""players"". But the witty banter between the iconic characters is enjoyable, I found myself not cutting to the next hand if I was out just so I could enjoy the back and forth. It's also interesting how the graphics for each character remain true to the games they are from, though I did have random frame issues (I run a 7970 and a 4GHz 8 core processor) at times for no apparent reason. Overall, I bought the game for $2.50 cents during the holiday sale and I'm not at all disappointed. Though, any higher I'm afraid I wouldn't be willing to pay simply due to the lack of multiplayer, but anyone that enjoys poker and is a fan of the characters in this game, not minding the lack of multiplayer should have no issue picking this game up.

												Absolutely shocking!. This game is the most irritating incarnation of a poker game I have ever played. They talk too much and slow the game down with constant non stop dialogue. after 30 minutes it was not funny and too intrusive to the actual gameplay. The algorithmns seem to reward a certain npc with constant favorable ""God Hands"" and none for you ever. Even when you have good hands you will always be trumped by an npc. And yes there is nothing you can do when an npc with ""God Hands"" keeps buying the pot and going all in. Overall the AI of this game feels ""cheap"" and weighted against you on purpose (apparently there are 20 number 2 cards in a deck for me to recieve one in nearly every hand lol shocking  expect better from TellTale Games).4/10			"

												Damn you Telltale.  How about making a game that works for a change.  Everybody is having startup issues with all of your games, because you make them all the exact same way and haven't found a way to fix the issue.  I tried every trick to get this game to startup.  The kicker was that once I found a way that got it working, after I closed it and started it up again it wouldn't work.  Each solution would work maybe twice, and then its back to the same old crashing before the telltale logo even comes up.  I was able to get it to start in compatibility with windows 98/ME but then it must store the save file somewhere else when you do that because it made makes you start over.  I started looking to see if I could find where the new save file is placed, but I realized that this game is taking up waaay more of my time than its worth.  I have literally spent 45 minutes starting it up and having it crash on me.  So I no longer expect Telltale games to work, because I have had the same problems with Poker Night 1 and the Walking Dead.  I paid for your games Telltale and you have repeatedly screwed me over.  I have friends who have the exact same problems, and the forums are filled with complaints about them not working but I have seen no remedy on Telltales side.  Don't buy their games.EDIT: After I building a new computer, I figured I'd redownload this game and give it a try.  It works now, but I am refraining from messing with the graphics settings because I'm pretty sure that is what caused the game to malfunction on my other computer.			"

												It's hard for me to properly express how dissapointed I am with Poker Night at the Inventory 2 when comparing it to its predecessor. However, it's not hard for me to point out all of its extremely blatent flaws so I'll cut to the chase.If you like playing Texas Hold em' or Omaha style poker for fun, move on. If you like playing Texas Hold em' or Omaha style poker at a simulated friendly table, move on. Now, if you like playing Texas Hold em' or Omaha style poker at an unfriendly table AND having the computer always stack the deck in favor of the other players, then this is the poker game for you.You are forced to play ridiculously conservatively if you want so much as a chance at winning. Have a pair of kings? The computer gets a pair of aces. You have two pair? The computer gets three of a kind. Bluffing might as well not even exist since even if the computer bluffs with a worse hand than yours, they'll still draw what they need to beat you 80% of the time.On top of feeling more akin to playing a slot machine with two of its reels broken than playing a fair game of poker, this game's dialoge gets grating fast. Most of the longer conversations in the first Poker Night at the Inventory were still about only two thirds as long as some of the drawn out gags in this game. This wouldn't be as bothersome as it is if you could decrease how often characters talk like in the first game, but for seemingly no reason, this and the difficulty option have been removed.In conclusion, if you want to buy a fun single player poker game that feels fair with entertaining characters, buy Poker Night at the Inventory and skip this sadly inferior sequel.

												Despite the characters being awesome, especially Ash from Army of Darkness, and all of them providing some pretty good dialogue while playing, I still could not keep from nodding off from boredom because IT'S A POKER VIDEO GAME. If I want to play poker I will drive one and a half hours to the Hollywood Casino in Columbus Ohio. But I don't gamble. When I play video games on the other hand, poker is just at the bottom of my list of fun. The very bottom. It is still better than point and click games I guess but that's not saying much.			"

												I purchased this because it was dirt cheap and I wanted the TF2 items, but the game is actually a lot of fun, and surprisingly addictive and enjoyable.Sometimes the long dialogue can hold up the game, and make it hard to tell what the other players are doing whilst they talk, but it doesn't happen that often. Also there is a suprisingly large amount of dialogue in the game, so even with you hear the same long piece several times, you can also end up hearing a new piece a few minutes later as well.I would certainly recommend this for anyone who previously hasn't had any interest in poker, or who wants good TF2 items (but wait for a sale if that's the only reason you're buying it).

												Fun, simple, and single player.  Probably the only thing holding it back is that it's a single player only experience but that's not to say that the comedic value of the characters isn't worth the cost of the game.  Though originally something I got to unlock Borderlands and Team Fortress 2 unlockables - I found it enjoyable enough to play it while doing other things around the house.			"

												You know how some people spill something on your shirt while playing poker and they switch the cards in their favor while you're distracted?this game reminds me of that.I have yet to win a tournament, or even reach a 1v1/duel/whatever the poker term is, and i dont think my skill is involved when someone wins a showdown when their 1% turns to 100 in one card.

												I am not really a card player. I roll through the hands just taking my best guess in hopes that chance is on my side but chance has no brain nor can it actually make things happen that won't. Listen to that logic children. Therefore, I usually lose a lot. Overall, I am pleased with the game and the dialog of the characters. After a while you do hear the same things over and over but I would rather have that then no conversation at all. The fact that it is humor kind of makes playing more pleasing. I would say it is worth a buy but maybe not if you are a hardcore poker player who wants a challenge. Afterall, it is a game as far as I am concerned to get a few laughs while playing some casual poker. There are bounties as well that can be unlocked to use in other telltale games so that is a perk as well which keeps you playing. Have fun and lighten up with some ""Poker Night 2"".			"

												I was hesistant to pick up this game knowing I dont know how to play poker but after 2 hours with the game I have had so much fun despite me still not knowing how to play. When you start the game they give you information on how to play poker but it would've been better for a tutorial that tells you what to do in the game. The dialogue of the characters is amazing with a bit of repeating but I still thought it was great. The reactions are also great to see which is what you dont see in a normal poker game. Dont hesistate its only $5 which is way to low for what the game is worth. If you know poker 9.5/10. If you dont 8/10.			"

												Prior to this game, I was under the impression that a series was supposed to get better as it went on. Apparently Telltale is losing their touch...Poker Night was a tough act to follow, and while this game had the potential to top it with its cast of characters, it fails hard on many levels, not the least of which is the CPU's blatant cheating (why on earth would they make a cheating AI when they had a perfectly-working non-cheating one in the first game? Cheating AIs are only supposed to be employed when there is no better alternative ... or when your game is Mario Kart). Went all-in after being dealt a pair of aces? Someone else got a pair of jacks, and the next card on the table is 100% going to be a jack. Game tells you you have a 99% chance of winning? Your opponent is guaranteed to get the one card that would let them win. Just folded? Oh look - THERE'S that card you needed! Too bad you'll never see it again.There is also a disproportionately large percentage of the dialog dedicated solely to insulting the player. I know it's supposed to be funny, but when your game isn't exactly relying on its own fun merit to begin with (face it, the only worthwhile takeaway is the TF2 and BL2 loot), calling the player a moron for playing it is the last thing you want to do if you expect them to keep playing.Speaking of dialog, what banter isn't used to call the player an idiot is repetitive and dull. The characters have different conversations based on the unlockable theme currently in use, but there are only maybe 4 or 5 per theme, meaning you'll hear the same crap over and over unless you change tables every tournament. They're not nearly as funny as the first game either. There are some humorous animations when others get busted out (if you aren't the first one to bust out, which you will be 90% of the time - again, cheating CPUs), but they don't always play, so you'll likely never see most of them. (Speaking of animations, characters, especially GLaDOS, get frozen mid-animation A LOT. It's these kinds of bugs that remind you why testing is necessary.)NOT recommended. Save your $5 and find something worthwhile, like Just Cause 2 when it goes on sale again, which it does often.			"

												Let's face it: Texas Hold'em is the most manly gambling game right after Russian Roulette. You have to stay focused througout the whole tournament and you have to play it cool even if the River Card is completing your Full House.The problen is: In your every day life you will not get a lot of chances to sit down at a round table in a smoke filled backroom of your local pub and play this awesome game with 4 other soldiers of fortune.So you will most likely restort to online poker. A faceless bunch of nobodies that probably play on 20 Tables at the same time will contantly fold the crap out of you. So you are doomed to collect one blind after another until one of them gets a lucky hand but blows it with the obvious tell of betting after 50 rounds of folding.Long Story short: IT SUCKS!But here comes the solution: POKER NIGHT 2Here you play with an awesome bunch of very indiviual characters that, even though they are played by the AI, are better than most online poker ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They bluff, they taunt you, they play dirty and when they are drunk they tell once in a while.You love them for the humor and hate them when their Kicker make you lose a fortune. If you liked Poker Night 1 you wil LOVE Poker Night 2.If Poker Night 1 was too easy and repetetive: Give Poker Night 2 a chance! It has WAY more Audio Recordings, the AI is WAY better and you get to do a lot of other stuff while playing Poker. Buy these guys some drinks and make them drunk. Try make them bet their Throphies. Buy new Decks, Felts and Chips.And be honest with me: GladOS as the dealer? ♥♥♥♥ YEAH!			"

And Glados constantly being supportive(yeah sarcasm).I would like to see more of Max and less of Sam, but at least Max is still in the game as he is sort of teamed up with Sam.There are now new challenges and the Omaha game type to play as well as being able to buy drinks for other players to get them drunk and act a fool.But yeah, well worth the price and if you have never played the first one, you should give it a go too.

												Really fun game even for someone who before playing this never played poker ever.  Learned quickly, easy and straight-forward to play.  Haven't had any glitches or issues.  The other players are pretty funny in their commentary, my favorite part being the appearance of Steve from Borderlands (Hey-ooooo) and his role in the game.  Seriously, there could not be enough Steve for me but he only pops up every so often.  MORE STEVE!  One downside is supposedly if you buy the other players drinks they show their tells more.  I've tried this trick a few times but it didn't really help.  Secondly the list of tells didn't help either with or without the drinks.  So I fly blind.			"

												Poker Night 2 has you facing off against Brock Sampson, Sam (from the Sam & Max games), Claptrap, and Ash Williams (from Army of Darkness) in Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha poker tournaments.  GLADOS acts as the dealer for the tournaments, and all the character banter back and forth.  The character interaction is funny and makes for an enjoyable atmosphere while you play Texas Hold 'Em or Omaha poker.  This has been a surprise hit for me, and the only small criticism I will make is that I would like to see more characters show up in the game to add some variety.  It would be great if they created some DLC that added more characters, or incorporated the characters from the first game.Fun game and totally worth the asking price.  If you can pick it up at half price during the summer sale go for it!			"

												An enjoyable game.  You'll definitely get your money's worth for the price you pay here.  I like how you can play to win unique items and such.  It's a great time waster for those times where you want to change it up from a tamer type of game.Pros:- The characters are great- Love the occasional cut scenes and the themed roomsCons:- Cards dealt can get frustrating at times.  Lot's of patience needed.			"

												A solid little poker game, highlighted by the great writing and voice-acting of your ""celebrity"" opponents.The concept is simple enough: stars from the world of geek come out to play poker against each other (and you, of course), and the winner takes all.  The game features both No Limit Texas Hold 'Em and Omaha variations, and that's it.  While the poker engine is pretty solid, it's not likely to convert hardcore players.  The real fun is in the interactions of your opponents, who include Brock Samson from the Venture Brothers cartoon series, Claptrap from the Borderlands franchise, Ash Williams from the Evil Dead series, and Sam of Sam & Max fame.  Max, of course, is on hand to make mischief, and everyone's favorite evil robot Glados deals the cards and provides sarcastic commentary about the players.  Borderlands vixen Moxxi serves as the bartender, but oddly enough, she never says a word.  Weird.The problems with the game are easy to predict: the dialog begins recycling itself after a handful of sessions, and the players never change their tells or strategies, making them fairly easy to defeat after some practice.  These issues are handily countered by the game's price, which is at most five bucks and usually less thanks to Steam sales and flash bargains.  It's unlikely that this game will be something you play hardcore for months on end, but as a low-cost slice of passing entertainment, it's hard to pass this one up.  Granted, if you don't know the characters involved, 75% of the humor might go right over your head.Bonuses include themed decks, felts, and chips for the respective franchises of each character, and bounty items from each player that unlock new skins and items in both Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.If you're a fan of poker and some of the characters involved, this is kind of a no-brainer.  The game won't hold your attention forever, but for the price, it will more than hold up its end for some good laughs and solid card-playing.			"

												I think this game is pretty fun. The way its set up, it makes new players to Texas Hold'em feel good and challeneges the experienced players. However, it's not like playing with real players when you can read their faces, which is expected in this game. Overall, I think its a great game and quite funny too. I thought Claptrap and GlaDos would be the only funny characters, (since I know them the most) but the rest are pretty funny too. Also, they all tell some interesting / funny stories, which keeps everything interesting. If I had to give this game a grade, I would give it 84/100.			"

Sometimes saves get lost.  Aside from the game  glitches, the game AI doesn't play a good game of Poker.  Each of the characters have play characteristic pattterns that once you pick up on, they're easy to beat.  You'll rarely lose.

												If you enjoy high-stakes poker with crossovers, then you will very much enjoy this game!  It's more competitive than casual, and if you keep losing, you be in a pretty bad mood for a little bit, but don't worry.  When you beat all four players, you will feel super triumphant and unlock some really cool gear for Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2.My final verdict for this game would probably be a 8.5/10, and it's definetly worth the five dollars it costs.  My only complaint is that when you're in that bad mood, GLaDOS (sometimes everyone else) will nonstop tease you through an entire tournament and make you feel bad.  Make sure to show them you're not small talk poker players!			"

												After really enjoying Poker Night at the Inventory (Poker Night 1) I thought well do I really need another poker game. Surely that one would do right. Well eventually at a slightly reduced price I jumped at Poker Night 2 and I regret never getting it sooner and at full price. This game is far better. The humour is better. The poker engine itself seems better. Poker Night 2 introduces Omaha poker which I have only really played a couple of times as I find it easier to work with a two card hand than a five but if you have a favourite type of poker you can stick with that and maybe occassionally switch to the other just to mix it up a bit.Even though theres only still a fairly limited but certainly less limited amount of lines the other characters say it is varied enough to keep those same lines interesting, and the characters refer more to you the player which brings you into the immersion more. You can buy players drinks to uncover their bluffs or make them have poor judgements. Although subjective I do prefer the characters playing here than on the first game. Brock Samson was not to familiar with before playing but it did not stop me enjoying his character enough for me to look into the Venture Brothers.It certainly is not going to be a game that you are going to play until hell freezes over but if you want the thrills of poker without the cash loss with a mix of the feeling you are playing a video game not random chance simulator 1995. I would certainly say $5 is well spent here.			"

												Thoroughly enjoyable! This game is great after a couple of beverages, on a lonely night. Feels like sitting around with a few friends, only these friends are Brock frikkin' Samson and Ash! I have to admit how sad I was not to hear Bruce Campbell's quips, but the voice actor they used did well, none the less.They created a great atmosphere with this one as even though the characters talk and jibe, it's rarely annoying.With so many lines of dialogue, the longevity of this game is extended. I must admit to only expecting a few back and forths, but I feel they really went all out.The poker side of things is fun, trying to suss out your opponents. I found myself, on more than one occasion, trying to read their tells and listen for bluffs... tried and failed (at least they couldn't see MY lousy poker face).There is the sad note however, that there is no multiplayer. Perhaps we'll see it in a future version?Anyways, right price, lots of fun, do yourself a favour and have a crack at it.You're going to giggle, I promise.			"

												Cheating AI (don't even think of contradicting me) and the eccentric game characters get a little annoying after a while. The poker is only Texas Hold-em and Omaha. It looks and sounds good and the characters are fun for a little while, but without a realistic difficulty setting and with strange AI behavior, it's just not good enough. Thankfully, the price is really low so actually that is justified. Don't buy this though if you are even a little bit serious about playing poker, let alone winning.EDIT: so I searched quite a bit more for a better poker game and turns out, despite there being a bunch of Poker games out there, this one is apparently the best one. Most of what I find is 2D online poker. Who the hell plays cards for real money? It's only in movies or once a lifetime in Vegas. Anyway, I thought you should know this.			"

												It's a poker game, it's only gameplay mechanic is playing poker. So if you don't like poker then don't play the game, it is as simple as that. The game is quite humorous because of its characters that branch from different game franchises, GLADOS from Portal, Claptrap from Borderlands and others. However the brilliant writing is ruined by the repetitiveness of them, the same jokes are constantly repeated and it got to the point where I just muted the game because I couldn't stand the repeated lines anymore. The unlocks help to customize your experience and help to keep you playing. The game suffers from only having two modes, it would be much better if the game was able to blend in some more modes. 7/10- Poker is fun, characters are fun, jokes are fun but are repeated and the game needs more modes.

												Much like the first Poker Night, the only real reason people play this game is for the cosmetic hats that can be worn in TF2, and can now be won to be worn in Borderlands 2. Again, these items do not look very special and are only cosmetic in both games. The poker is exactly the same as before with a few twists that don't really matter in the end. The characters are sometimes fun to listen to, but it quickly loses it's charm.[3/10] You just wasted 5-15 dollars on some ugly looking hats from a poker game.			"

												Poker Night 2 is not a game you can put 8 hours a day for months into. Its a fun poker sim which aims to emulate the banter and party atmosphere of a game of poker with friends. It suceeds at this admirably, the writing and voice acting is superb, where else will you find Glados, Claptrap, Ash and Sam and Max in one game mocking your ability to bluff. There are two flavoures of poker on offer, Texas Hold'em and Omaha, the tutorials for both are more than capable for total begginners or if, like me, you're a bit rusty. It won't last you long but if you can pick this up for cheap its a few hours of good entertainment			"

												Poker Night 2 is an entertaining Hold 'Em game that is more about the characters involved than the poker action. The characters all have their own stories and jokes to tell during the game (although it feels like Ash gets the short end of the stick a bit). Don't play this game expecting any kind of serious poker sim; the AI decisions are strange to say the least. It's a humorous timekiller with enough themes and dialogue from the characters to keep things fresh for several hours.			"

												Can't really recommend it, as there are many other, better poker games out there. If you are a fan of the characters you face in this game, then basically ignore the previous statement, as the sheer amount of dialogue and interaction between them is significant and probably very amusing to that particular audience. In my case, I wasn't really all that connected with most of them and even got annoyed after a while, when they started repeating all the conversations. Also, it is important to note that the game simply wouldn't work for me at the beginning. I had to, just like many, many others, google for all these different solutions to the 'crash on boot' issue. Even now, the game just crashes when you launch it from Steam and I have to find the .exe in the Steam folder to be able to play it. Strange that this never has been fixed.			"

												Poker Night 2 uses the same concept as the first game, but with a different cast of characters. While I'm fairly sure the amount of dialogue at least matches the first game, it seems to repeat the lines far more often in comparison. I haven't played the predecessor in quite a long while, but I believe it was less repetitive in that regard. Additionally to Texas Hold 'Em you can now play Omaha as well, which I highly recommend, because it is much more fun. The Poker Night 2 unlockables are felts, chips and decks for each of the represented games/movies/TV series and activating a full set completely changes the room you are playing in AND the soundtrack! The game loses a few points due to repetition and an unfair AI (Texas Hold' Em).			"

Wait for all but one opponent to be eliminated and go all in with a good initial deal.  Mathematically speaking, you should have a 50% chance of having the best hand at the end.

												if you're a fan of the fandom and love some great juxtaposition, along with gambling, you're not just a well rounded person you're probably a fan of poker night! this game brings us the great game of texas hold em (and omaha if you're into the variant of the game) and introduces us to some of the greatest characters anyone has ever fantasized shooting the breeze with. the amount of content (as far as the characters go) is staggering! not only can you also change the theme of the cards and table, but if you play your cards right, you can change the setting of the bar as well and even get the characters to comment on it! This game is great for anyone whose fans of the venture brothers, tall tell games, Portal or Bruce Campbell. there are a couple downsides....its not multiplayer and Mr. Campbell isnt actually facilitating his voice, but they found a great stand in and everyone else are the original voice actors. do yourself a favor and get this pass time game. you wont be disappointed!

It has slight improvement from the previous title, but don't use your money on it unless you're seriously bored and it's on sale for AT LEAST 50% off.EDIT: I don't know why, but the cards seem unfairly weighted to the bots' advantages... I swear everytime I have a good combo pair and the bots have a terrible pair, they always end up winning.			"

												 I'm no gambler, but even I can tell this is a terrible poker game. The character writing is funny though, and the scene changes when you use all the items in a set are fun.If you have any knowledge of poker, stay the hell away from this game because the nonsensical betting will infuriate you. If you just want the unlocks, you may get them very fast, or you may NEVER get them, depending on which of the challenges you get. I got all the items but Glados' in a couple hours, and I'm currently stuck having to win 3 hands in a row to unlock hers. That's unlikely when the other players raise like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkeys.Winning tournaments is easy - fold on any opening less than two face cards (unless you're the big blind and can get a 'free' look at the flop) and let the idiots knock each other out of the game.Winning multiple hands in a row  is just luck though. In the showdown, be prepared to have your blinds stolen a lot, unless you decide to play like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkey too.			"

												I am not a video game poker fan, but I do like the real thing, even though I am not a gambler with it in real life, I simply like the game. That said that is what is done nicely here, the game. The atmosphere being so well done from the first one to this one is also a plus. This is a lighthearted fun little tromp through the game that does not take itself too seriously. I hesitated to review it as like I said I am no e-poker afficiando, so the biggest thing on offer here, the poker AI itself is not something I can compare to other games besides the first one, briefly. Let me say that it is fun to play around with, the ai does seem uneven at times as there are really really long odds for one of the computer opponents to beat your nice flush or straight, and they get it. A Lot. It is still fun and thier banter is funny for the most part. Catching it on sale is the icing on the cake for me, but this one has already been reccomended by me to some others and it is good for some laughs and occaisonally a halfway decent round of poker breaks out.

												All the fun of Poker Night 1 but even more to offer.  An all new cast of cult classic characters will have you laughing hard at their discussions and bickering.  The poker is just as good as ever and you can read more in my Poker Night 1 review to see what I mean and this time they even added an Omaha style just to mix it up a bit.  The addition of the odds screen is a fun little aspect and something I wished was in the first one.  Again their are lots of unlockables but with the bonus that if everything is deployed for a single character the entire Inventory changes and they get a new outfit.  Speaking of, more bounty unlockables for extra content in Team Fortress 2 , Borderlands 2, etc.  The dialogue was one of the best and worst things about Poker Night 1 in that the first time you hear something funny about or from a character you especially like it's hillarious.  At least until the 6th time you've heard it.  There are much much more conversations between characters so the repitition is way less but unavoidably there is some.  The only real problem is coincidently the infamous host of this game: GlaDos.  She was the big reason everyone was talking about this game but she's actually the worst part of it because all of her dialogue is criticism of you.  You bet and she scolds you, you fold and she scolds you, you go all-in and she scolds you, you call a bet and she scolds you, you win the game and the scolds you (no, not joking).  And her lines are much fewer and are by far the most annoying and repetitive you will hear.  I've gotten a reflex when I see her come down from the cieling I mute my sound and when she leaves I unmute it and it's way better.Anyway, point is that I enjoy card games like Spades, Solitaire, and Hearts that come with computers and this is that times 100 with Moxxi's cleavage on top of it.  I play it every week.			"

And Glados constantly being supportive(yeah sarcasm).I would like to see more of Max and less of Sam, but at least Max is still in the game as he is sort of teamed up with Sam.There are now new challenges and the Omaha game type to play as well as being able to buy drinks for other players to get them drunk and act a fool.But yeah, well worth the price and if you have never played the first one, you should give it a go too.

												Prior to this game, I was under the impression that a series was supposed to get better as it went on. Apparently Telltale is losing their touch...Poker Night was a tough act to follow, and while this game had the potential to top it with its cast of characters, it fails hard on many levels, not the least of which is the CPU's blatant cheating (why on earth would they make a cheating AI when they had a perfectly-working non-cheating one in the first game? Cheating AIs are only supposed to be employed when there is no better alternative ... or when your game is Mario Kart). Went all-in after being dealt a pair of aces? Someone else got a pair of jacks, and the next card on the table is 100% going to be a jack. Game tells you you have a 99% chance of winning? Your opponent is guaranteed to get the one card that would let them win. Just folded? Oh look - THERE'S that card you needed! Too bad you'll never see it again.There is also a disproportionately large percentage of the dialog dedicated solely to insulting the player. I know it's supposed to be funny, but when your game isn't exactly relying on its own fun merit to begin with (face it, the only worthwhile takeaway is the TF2 and BL2 loot), calling the player a moron for playing it is the last thing you want to do if you expect them to keep playing.Speaking of dialog, what banter isn't used to call the player an idiot is repetitive and dull. The characters have different conversations based on the unlockable theme currently in use, but there are only maybe 4 or 5 per theme, meaning you'll hear the same crap over and over unless you change tables every tournament. They're not nearly as funny as the first game either. There are some humorous animations when others get busted out (if you aren't the first one to bust out, which you will be 90% of the time - again, cheating CPUs), but they don't always play, so you'll likely never see most of them. (Speaking of animations, characters, especially GLaDOS, get frozen mid-animation A LOT. It's these kinds of bugs that remind you why testing is necessary.)NOT recommended. Save your $5 and find something worthwhile, like Just Cause 2 when it goes on sale again, which it does often.			"

												Let's face it: Texas Hold'em is the most manly gambling game right after Russian Roulette. You have to stay focused througout the whole tournament and you have to play it cool even if the River Card is completing your Full House.The problen is: In your every day life you will not get a lot of chances to sit down at a round table in a smoke filled backroom of your local pub and play this awesome game with 4 other soldiers of fortune.So you will most likely restort to online poker. A faceless bunch of nobodies that probably play on 20 Tables at the same time will contantly fold the crap out of you. So you are doomed to collect one blind after another until one of them gets a lucky hand but blows it with the obvious tell of betting after 50 rounds of folding.Long Story short: IT SUCKS!But here comes the solution: POKER NIGHT 2Here you play with an awesome bunch of very indiviual characters that, even though they are played by the AI, are better than most online poker ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They bluff, they taunt you, they play dirty and when they are drunk they tell once in a while.You love them for the humor and hate them when their Kicker make you lose a fortune. If you liked Poker Night 1 you wil LOVE Poker Night 2.If Poker Night 1 was too easy and repetetive: Give Poker Night 2 a chance! It has WAY more Audio Recordings, the AI is WAY better and you get to do a lot of other stuff while playing Poker. Buy these guys some drinks and make them drunk. Try make them bet their Throphies. Buy new Decks, Felts and Chips.And be honest with me: GladOS as the dealer? ♥♥♥♥ YEAH!			"

												Its alot of fun to play.  The ONLY downside to making this the best gambling is is it only has Texas Hold em or Omaha. They shouldve included Blackjack or something. And maybe even a little acarde mode were you would play War, Spit, or Goldfish. But its worth the five bucks in my opinoin.			"

												More of the same, mixed up with a few new features and a new cast.New features are a new game mode (omaha, which I recommend if you want to win everytime since the A.I. is more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than normal in it), and the ability to order drinks which increase the chance of the cast giving away tells on what kind of cards they have.Overall the cast is pretty good, surprisingly Claptrap (who I've normally despised) made me laugh the most, Ash and Brock have a passable presence, and Sam is kind of lame. It also has GLaDOs as the dealer, which really adds to the proceedings.But yeah, still only good if you really like the characters or if you want to learn Texas Hold 'em or Omaha rules. "

												I tried Poker Night 1 and 2, and 1 is the more-fun game. The personalities in 2 are a little annoying, and the gameplay isn't balanced among the players (Ash won the first 8 pots I played, usually bluffing, but he had the nuts every time he was called down).  This might just be because I'm more familiar with the characters in Poker Night 1, but I didn't have as much fun with the characters in 2.  Claptrap was annoying, and GLaDOS actually became somewhat annoying quickly just by playing off of Claptrap.  Another weird fault was clicking the + and - buttons in the raise screen was not smooth: I would have to click maybe twice per click that is actually registered.  Clicking up a few hundred dollars feels like button mashing until I get there, while in 1, I just click a few times.  I recommend sticking to Poker Night 1.			"

												I bought this on sale for $0.99 which was a steal for the quality of the game. While the AI can get somewhat desperate in it's betting when you get down to just you and the last player at the table, overall this game is an excellent causal poker game. The banter amongst the AI flows pretty naturally as you're playing through the hands. Even at it's full price ($4.99), the quality of voice acting, cast of characters, and drop in, drop out tournament play combined with the above makes this another great game from Telltale Games.			"

												this game cheats so badly... especially in omaha game mode... i had a straight... and i was beaten by two pair... then in the next game i had two pair and was beaten by a straight... the rules make no sense in this game... it cant even follow the real rules of hold em poker... i have played this game often enough to know that this computer doesnt follow the generic rules for texas holdem. i'm an avid lover of the game and was hoping for ""fair play"" when it came to this game... but as usual i was disappointed to find that this game cheats, some card combinations for the ""players hand"" are completely ignored, you could have a full royal straight and you are beaten by 2 pairs of aces and 2's, you could have 2 pairs of aces and kings in the next hand and then be beaten by a flush of  A, 2, 3, 4, 5... i love this game when it follows the rules and doesnt stack the deck in the computer's favor... i have played this game often enough to see that... as well as have an at least basic understanding of video games to see it as well. this game will frustrate you over things like this... either glitches or purposefully designed... it needs to be spread as others have noticed things like this as well			"

It's probably because this has two of my favorite video game characters (GLADOS and Claptrap) and one of the best horror characters. (Ash) Even though they soon start repeating a bunch of stuff, I still love playing with them.Rating:8/10			"

If you need a little more coaxing to buy this game read first watch all the episodes of The Venture Bros, and than read ahead.If you have ever just wanted to relax, while enhancing your poker skills get this game. You'll enjoy hours of fun with the funny, and witty banter of you fellow players. The only downside is that after a certain amount of playing, the dialogue will start to repeat thus taking away from the game. But that is forgivable, and is to be expected.

												I really wanted to like this game.FIrstly I think TellTale games are amazing. I was super excited when I heard about this one.The first few hours are enjoyable and fun provided you know whom the characters are and get the references.After maybe 3 hours of gaming you will find the dialogue tedious and repetitive.The games feel rigged (of course maybe I just have horrible luck) and after a while I figure out you can just bluff big and always win the majority of the time. Throwing all in seems to win 70% of the time.But at times when you know you've got an amazing hand, three other players somehow also have super amazing hands.Check out my screen shots but one time three players had Straight Flushes... what the?!!!Biggest disappointment is Bruce Campbel DOES NOT voice Ash from Army of Darkness... what gives?!!That alone would have made this game worth while but sadly disappointing.After a while getting insulted constantly by the characters really wears you down and you will find yourself disliking them in their respective games/movies/genres... Sad that this could have had amazing potential but Tell Tale Games got lazy with this one. A real shame.Graphics: Nice and decent.Sound/Music: Decent enough but repetitive voice acting and lack of Bruce Campbell makes it lackingGame-play: There are better Hold 'em games out there sadly.

												This is something that is so worth it, especially for the small price, that I look at this review and think to myself:  ""This is such an obvious deal, what else needs to be said?""  I'll put it this way, whether you like Poker or you don't like it, it's amazing to see a cast of such popular characters co-existing in one game like this. This game is just fun, pure and simple. Win or lose, you'll enjoy it. If you don't know anything about poker, this is how you should learn .. no matter what happens, if you have a good sense of humor, you'll love the commentary from the characters as they make idle conversation, mock each other and poke fun at their own backgrounds while you guys play a ""friendly"" game of Poker. If you unlock an entire set of bonus things, like the cards, table and chips associated with one of their themes, their conversations will sometimes steer more into that particular theme. Like, if you unlock all the PORTAL stuff, and the Inventory becomes a science lab, GLADOS will make a disturbing offer to the rest of the cast. I've heard pretty much all their dialogue from playing this game as much as I have and I still find it hilarious. This is the game I play while I'm eating, or that final thing before I go to bed, or any time where I just wanna have fun without having to put any real effort into it (aside from thinking). Buy it, you'll love it if you love these characters and their worlds.			"

												This game picks up the conversational ball that the first dropped (after several hours of enjoyment) and really brings the fun with even a better and more entertaining bunch of misfits. To see Ash from Evil Dead next to Sam from Sam and Max get ejected from the table after two failed all-ins, and they then get a snarky comment from GLaDOS while the walk away from the table. Then everyones favourite dancing robot flirt with the emotionless death machine that is GLaDOS. I was so happy at that moment I didn't care that Brock Samson got a flush on the river card. This is a pure pleasure even if you don't care about poker, and just enjoy video games (or the movie/tv-series) and their characters. 8.1/10			"

One of the players almost always all-ins on the first hand, sometimes on or before the flop.  Without fail, half the table's knocked out within three hands, and the player's got to knock down someone with four times their chips.  What is the risk-reward here?			"

												I`ve always wanted a good single player poker game that actually played realistically with decent characters. This game does that.It starts you off in a dark  underground pub or bar and introduces you to 4 characters, only two of which I recognised which was Ash, and not from the crappy tv series either.  I also recognised Max, while never having played the game, know by reputation. Or is he called sam? I get mixed up between the dog and bunny. However, the characters reveal their personalities as you play the game. It`s more slow a reveal than the first game, but nicely paced in my view.The characterisations and how they play is really the best part of the game. Some of the jokes and stories are great.You can buy drinks for your opponents to weaken their skills, a bit silly really and they never refuse. I would`ve preferred it without. Sexy bar lady though with an air of `can`t be be bothered` to her.You also have a  female voiced robot that deals the cards. i prefrred when the cards where just dealth naturally in the 1st game. She can be also highly annoying both in attitude and voice. I preferred the original way without the dumb dealer robot.Game feels a little easier to win. Maybe too easy. You can free extra tables and card design but there`s not much to free up.My main wish would be for more choice in characters with just as much depth to play against. Make it about 10 with clothing variety so each game feels fresh. Yes, it would be a fair amount of work, but I`d pay £30 for it.Anyway recommended.			"

												All the fun of Poker Night 1 but even more to offer.  An all new cast of cult classic characters will have you laughing hard at their discussions and bickering.  The poker is just as good as ever and you can read more in my Poker Night 1 review to see what I mean and this time they even added an Omaha style just to mix it up a bit.  The addition of the odds screen is a fun little aspect and something I wished was in the first one.  Again their are lots of unlockables but with the bonus that if everything is deployed for a single character the entire Inventory changes and they get a new outfit.  Speaking of, more bounty unlockables for extra content in Team Fortress 2 , Borderlands 2, etc.  The dialogue was one of the best and worst things about Poker Night 1 in that the first time you hear something funny about or from a character you especially like it's hillarious.  At least until the 6th time you've heard it.  There are much much more conversations between characters so the repitition is way less but unavoidably there is some.  The only real problem is coincidently the infamous host of this game: GlaDos.  She was the big reason everyone was talking about this game but she's actually the worst part of it because all of her dialogue is criticism of you.  You bet and she scolds you, you fold and she scolds you, you go all-in and she scolds you, you call a bet and she scolds you, you win the game and the scolds you (no, not joking).  And her lines are much fewer and are by far the most annoying and repetitive you will hear.  I've gotten a reflex when I see her come down from the cieling I mute my sound and when she leaves I unmute it and it's way better.Anyway, point is that I enjoy card games like Spades, Solitaire, and Hearts that come with computers and this is that times 100 with Moxxi's cleavage on top of it.  I play it every week.			"

												Even if you have no idea what poker is or how to play it I would still recommend this game to people just because of the dialogue that exists between all of the characters. There are so many different interactions and stories and even more become available when you unlock the poker chip, table, and card sets for each individual character. Plus you get free TF2 and Borderlands 2 stuff so it's worth.			"

												Very punishing and very hard for people who don't already know how to play Poker and don't play regularly. Provided instructions seem to be bare bones, then the game throws you to the Wolves. It requires a guide if you want to know what their tells mean if you want want to spend tons of time and losses figuring it out. This game is purely for novelty. If you want to learn Poker, I'm sure there are MUCH better options than this.The only people who would say this game is easy are people who play Poker regularly and have no understanding of the pov of a regular person who's never played before or does rarely.The main lesson I've gotten from playing this game is ""Don't Play Poker for Money!""

												I will admit that I really only wanted this game for the Borderlands 2 unlocks, but I've found it really fun! In my playthrough I  managed to unlock all items after approx. 10 hours of gameplay and I'm still playing despite accomplishing my greedy, greedy goal! I haven't gotten sick of the moderately repetitive chatter at all but I will warn that if you're easily annoyed by repeated jokes and stories then you might not get as much enjoyment.I have NEVER played poker before this game, so I can't really rate the game mechanics. I will say that I've at least managed to fail less than I did when I started which gives me some (probably false) hope that maybe I won't suck playing with real people?!			"

												I really wanted to like this game.FIrstly I think TellTale games are amazing. I was super excited when I heard about this one.The first few hours are enjoyable and fun provided you know whom the characters are and get the references.After maybe 3 hours of gaming you will find the dialogue tedious and repetitive.The games feel rigged (of course maybe I just have horrible luck) and after a while I figure out you can just bluff big and always win the majority of the time. Throwing all in seems to win 70% of the time.But at times when you know you've got an amazing hand, three other players somehow also have super amazing hands.Check out my screen shots but one time three players had Straight Flushes... what the?!!!Biggest disappointment is Bruce Campbel DOES NOT voice Ash from Army of Darkness... what gives?!!That alone would have made this game worth while but sadly disappointing.After a while getting insulted constantly by the characters really wears you down and you will find yourself disliking them in their respective games/movies/genres... Sad that this could have had amazing potential but Tell Tale Games got lazy with this one. A real shame.Graphics: Nice and decent.Sound/Music: Decent enough but repetitive voice acting and lack of Bruce Campbell makes it lackingGame-play: There are better Hold 'em games out there sadly.

												This is something that is so worth it, especially for the small price, that I look at this review and think to myself:  ""This is such an obvious deal, what else needs to be said?""  I'll put it this way, whether you like Poker or you don't like it, it's amazing to see a cast of such popular characters co-existing in one game like this. This game is just fun, pure and simple. Win or lose, you'll enjoy it. If you don't know anything about poker, this is how you should learn .. no matter what happens, if you have a good sense of humor, you'll love the commentary from the characters as they make idle conversation, mock each other and poke fun at their own backgrounds while you guys play a ""friendly"" game of Poker. If you unlock an entire set of bonus things, like the cards, table and chips associated with one of their themes, their conversations will sometimes steer more into that particular theme. Like, if you unlock all the PORTAL stuff, and the Inventory becomes a science lab, GLADOS will make a disturbing offer to the rest of the cast. I've heard pretty much all their dialogue from playing this game as much as I have and I still find it hilarious. This is the game I play while I'm eating, or that final thing before I go to bed, or any time where I just wanna have fun without having to put any real effort into it (aside from thinking). Buy it, you'll love it if you love these characters and their worlds.			"

												Ehhh... Just like the last game, this one is pretty mediocre too. There's a different cast of characters, but the only real reason to get it is to hear the dialogue, and get all the cosmetics for the different games I suppose. While there is more dialogue this time around, due to the way the game is structured, it repeats a lot more, and starts to get grating. Honestly, another mediocre game, but a bit better than the last one I suppose.			"

Hearing the same thing over and over again gets really old. Also, the insults to the player are funny to begin with, but again it really starts to wear thin after the first fifty times you're called fat or stupid. I've played it a lot longer than I thought I would, but I've just been working on getting that last bountry for the unlocks. Recommended if you like poker or any of the characters (though I'm still not sure why Ash was choosen for this. He doesnt' really fit in my opinion). The first Poker Night was better in my opinion.

												I don't watch Venture Bros, I've never played Sam and Max, or Evil Dead, and I didn't like Borderlands 2. So basically I just bought it for the poker. The game at first seemed charming but after 45 minutes of play it got stale, the line that were funny, or clever fell flat after I heared them multiple times. I continued playing just for the hell of it, but the game didn't seem to become any better. In fact, the more I played the worse my luck seemed to get, and the more annoyed I got with the game. I lost multiple all-in hands when I had more than a 90% chance to win, so maybe the game is rigged or maybe just the cosmos hate me.Overall Poker Night 2 is a fairly meh game with stale repeated dialog, and decent (possibly rigged) poker. That's all it's got going for it, dialog and poker, and neither of them are even that good. If you like poker go ahead and buy it, but buy it when it's on sale.			"

												You know, if your really really really really I mean really bored one day and want to play some Poker (I honestly hate poker) but the comments the characters make and the scenary are really nice.Also I know most of you are just buying this for the in-game unlockables so theres that too.

												Ok this game is getting a bad review, and not because of the game itself. It is quite entertaining when it works. But when I have to keep setting compatibility mode farther and farther back because the game suddenly decides it doesn't want to work on the settings that it worked just fine the day before on, it has a problem. Second, losing all save data and unlocks and being forced to start over from scratch because the game keeps failing to work with any settings consistently is just plain ridiculous. If I could, I would return this game because it is not worth the time or effort just to try to enjoy 20 minutes of playing cards. I've never had a game act like this one does. Go buy a hoyle card game if you want to play poker, at the least the game works.			"

												Pretty fun alternative to losing real money. The characters playing with you are colorful and fun, and their dialog between eachother is great. You can unlock some customization items in this one for Borderlands 2 and TF 2, as well as some skins for the poker area, table, and cards which helps with replayability. Pretty good if you're into poker.			"

												To be honest, I only bought this game for the kick♥♥♥♥♥Borderlands 2 swag that you can win in it. Turned out to be a really fun casual time killer. The characters are hilarious (and faithfully-portrayed), gameplay is fun, and like I mentioned, you get the opportunity to win some really cool items for games like Borderlands 2 and Team Fortress 2. Worth the $2.50 I paid for it. 7.5/10.			"

Best moment in my life.The river comes: The last card is a second Jack, and Ash wins all the 100 000$ beating my Full house with a Four of a kind, in a single round.After a 20 minutes of raging, I'm here at the store page, to recommend this game to everyone.

												This game, while frusturating at first, quickly became addicting, as I had not known how to play poker untill this game. The dialogue from the characters always keeps you hooked, and the game is very visually catchy. If you're looking for a fun way to introduce yourself to poker, or your just looking for some fun dialogue from some of TellTale's games, then you'll love this. As an added bonus you get some TF2 hats for doing achievemnts in Poker Night (This was what drove me to buy it in the first place, little  did I know it was such a good game).			"

												Cheating AI (don't even think of contradicting me) and the eccentric game characters get a little annoying after a while. The poker is only Texas Hold-em and Omaha. It looks and sounds good and the characters are fun for a little while, but without a realistic difficulty setting and with strange AI behavior, it's just not good enough. Thankfully, the price is really low so actually that is justified. Don't buy this though if you are even a little bit serious about playing poker, let alone winning.EDIT: so I searched quite a bit more for a better poker game and turns out, despite there being a bunch of Poker games out there, this one is apparently the best one. Most of what I find is 2D online poker. Who the hell plays cards for real money? It's only in movies or once a lifetime in Vegas. Anyway, I thought you should know this.			"

												It's a poker game, it's only gameplay mechanic is playing poker. So if you don't like poker then don't play the game, it is as simple as that. The game is quite humorous because of its characters that branch from different game franchises, GLADOS from Portal, Claptrap from Borderlands and others. However the brilliant writing is ruined by the repetitiveness of them, the same jokes are constantly repeated and it got to the point where I just muted the game because I couldn't stand the repeated lines anymore. The unlocks help to customize your experience and help to keep you playing. The game suffers from only having two modes, it would be much better if the game was able to blend in some more modes. 7/10- Poker is fun, characters are fun, jokes are fun but are repeated and the game needs more modes.

												The game has some superb characters which intergrate pretty nicly together but the game itself is let down by poor card mechanics. The cards are randomly generated for the AI and will adapt depending what the player has as each hand is played (kinda hard to explain). Also the emulated card system itself is well below par of, say alot of the big online poker games. But I guess that isn't what the game is about. Even so, the game just becomes infuriating with the daft curveballs and the faults.So really unless you just want to watch alot of dialog and unusual characters gathering togather I cannot recommend this game at all. The previous game had slightly better mechanics too (if slightly less interesting characters).			"

Being able to read people or facial expression well helps too, that or make drunk as can be allowed.			"

												This game is awesome and comical! I really enjoyed playing it. the characters and their stories along with commentary keep it entertaining. One of the major things that caught my attention was the characters being from a lot of my favorite games. The characters do have tells some are harder to figure out than others and some I still haven't even figured out. It's a great way to kill time and each tournament can last a little while. I keep thinking a multiplayer side to this would be enjoyable, however, I completely understand why there isn't one.

If you think you're pretty good at poker, then this can still be a good challenge for you (provided you dont read up on the steam guides to see what everyones tells are!); and if you don't know then this game can teach you pretty well.The art style is an amalgamation of the various games the characters come from but the seamless interactions between them means that you really dont notice the fact that some are cellshaded and others like GLADOS are realistic.The humour is pretty good although theres only so many times you can hear 'Great day in the morning!' and not be annoyed by it.All in all if you want a game to kick back and relax with then this is definitely a game for you!

												Pros:-The characters. All of the opponents in Poker Night 2 are interesting. The banter between all of them is interesting (at least on the first go) and I seem to have learned something about Sam & Max, Borderlands, and The Evil Dead series from these exchanges.  However, poker Brock does seem kind of flat compared to TV Brock. Something that was obvious to me,  since I started watching the show about the same time I bought this game.-The items. They stuff you get for TF2 is the only things that really motivated me to get this game. I really want the Long Fall Boots. -The backgrounds are cool. I personally enjoyed the Venture Brothers set. Cons:-The game cheats. I could not believe how many times I’ve had a decent hand (three of a kind, straights, flushes, and at the very least really strong two pairs) and then been blown out of the water. One time during the final showdown of a tournament I had a full house (three Kings and two Aces) and I lost to a four of a kind (four Aces, yhaa for serious). Never have I been more frustrated by a game of chance in my entire life. And forget about attempting to win by bluffing or with a single pair. I’ve only down that once and a handful of times respectively. -The banter gets old/takes too long/is insulting. While the opponents will engage in story telling with each other, there isn’t a moment when the player isn’t constantly bad mouthed. It’s especially bad when you’re on a losing streaking even though you’re getting good hands. Not only that but it’s the same stories and banter that you’ve already heard a hundred times in the last few minutes. I’d be fine with that if you could skip it, but a lot of the banter locks you out from taking your turn. Overall:There really isn’t anything that needs to be said about this game. Essentially it turns your computer into a glorified video poker machine. The only real impetus that has even kept me playing was so that I could score some swag for Team Fortress 2.The game isn’t bad, but I just wish that the game’s cheap tactics didn’t kill any of the fun that I had had with it. 4/10			"

												Prior to this game, I was under the impression that a series was supposed to get better as it went on. Apparently Telltale is losing their touch...Poker Night was a tough act to follow, and while this game had the potential to top it with its cast of characters, it fails hard on many levels, not the least of which is the CPU's blatant cheating (why on earth would they make a cheating AI when they had a perfectly-working non-cheating one in the first game? Cheating AIs are only supposed to be employed when there is no better alternative ... or when your game is Mario Kart). Went all-in after being dealt a pair of aces? Someone else got a pair of jacks, and the next card on the table is 100% going to be a jack. Game tells you you have a 99% chance of winning? Your opponent is guaranteed to get the one card that would let them win. Just folded? Oh look - THERE'S that card you needed! Too bad you'll never see it again.There is also a disproportionately large percentage of the dialog dedicated solely to insulting the player. I know it's supposed to be funny, but when your game isn't exactly relying on its own fun merit to begin with (face it, the only worthwhile takeaway is the TF2 and BL2 loot), calling the player a moron for playing it is the last thing you want to do if you expect them to keep playing.Speaking of dialog, what banter isn't used to call the player an idiot is repetitive and dull. The characters have different conversations based on the unlockable theme currently in use, but there are only maybe 4 or 5 per theme, meaning you'll hear the same crap over and over unless you change tables every tournament. They're not nearly as funny as the first game either. There are some humorous animations when others get busted out (if you aren't the first one to bust out, which you will be 90% of the time - again, cheating CPUs), but they don't always play, so you'll likely never see most of them. (Speaking of animations, characters, especially GLaDOS, get frozen mid-animation A LOT. It's these kinds of bugs that remind you why testing is necessary.)NOT recommended. Save your $5 and find something worthwhile, like Just Cause 2 when it goes on sale again, which it does often.			"

												Let's face it: Texas Hold'em is the most manly gambling game right after Russian Roulette. You have to stay focused througout the whole tournament and you have to play it cool even if the River Card is completing your Full House.The problen is: In your every day life you will not get a lot of chances to sit down at a round table in a smoke filled backroom of your local pub and play this awesome game with 4 other soldiers of fortune.So you will most likely restort to online poker. A faceless bunch of nobodies that probably play on 20 Tables at the same time will contantly fold the crap out of you. So you are doomed to collect one blind after another until one of them gets a lucky hand but blows it with the obvious tell of betting after 50 rounds of folding.Long Story short: IT SUCKS!But here comes the solution: POKER NIGHT 2Here you play with an awesome bunch of very indiviual characters that, even though they are played by the AI, are better than most online poker ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They bluff, they taunt you, they play dirty and when they are drunk they tell once in a while.You love them for the humor and hate them when their Kicker make you lose a fortune. If you liked Poker Night 1 you wil LOVE Poker Night 2.If Poker Night 1 was too easy and repetetive: Give Poker Night 2 a chance! It has WAY more Audio Recordings, the AI is WAY better and you get to do a lot of other stuff while playing Poker. Buy these guys some drinks and make them drunk. Try make them bet their Throphies. Buy new Decks, Felts and Chips.And be honest with me: GladOS as the dealer? ♥♥♥♥ YEAH!			"

												The dialog is good and the poker gameplay can be fun and very challenging, But this game lacks the options of the first version to turn off voices if you get bored of them. And at time of writing has a real tendency to bug out, missing characters or semi-corrupting save/preference files.It is cheap though so you will probably have your moneys worth of fun. and you might win yourself some items for TF2 or borderlands 2			"

It also has GLaDOs as the dealer, which really adds to the proceedings.But yeah, still only good if you really like the characters or if you want to learn Texas Hold 'em or Omaha rules. "

												Okay, first, if you're buying this for the items, then you have to still not suck at poker, or else you'll never win them, as opposed to Poker Night's save scumming until you can get the other guy all in.That said, you no longer need to knock the owner out, just win the game, and a reward will stay on the table until you win it.So..  the game itself.Like Poker Night, the cast are pretty great. Especially since Sam has brought Max into the inventory once again, so he often interjects, mimics and/or brandishes his gun to humourous effect now that he's not tied to the table. Ash and Brock are fairly non-energetic conversationalists, but you need someone to balance the Claptrap/Sam+Max hilarity, and Glados just demeans everyone.The tournament organiser also interjects more often, lending an offended upper class voice to the conversation.Getting the players drunk would likely affect the conversation as well.In all, I think the conversations in this game are more humourous and varied than the first.As for the Poker, Omaha seems like a much more interesting game than Texas, purely because your hole cards afford more viability in potential flops. So your hand is far less likely to be crap or excellent until that river goes down. As a result you see more rivers and can then bet intelligently off that information.Some things could be improved, such as not looking over every characters shoulder when watching the remainder of the match. Just put the values down beneath their name or split the screen, otherwise it takes too much time.But the poker's better, the characters and conversation better (all though get back to me after I've memorised all the lines), and the prize distribution less frustrating to those who can play. This is probably the best poker game I've played.			"

												Worth picking up in a steam sale for:1) The TF2 items (if you have it!)2) The conversations - funny the first couple times. They grate after a few hours though3) Brock having Joe's voice actor4) GlaDOS5) Screwing with the clapAnnoying for:1) The way the AI works on every damn final you vs last player bit, where it just drains out your cash while never folding themselves on terrible cards before seeing the wossname cards. Also, winning by going all in with a 4-2 from different against your two aces all the time. I don't play enough poker to know the terms. It got to the point where if I had three aces after the three cards came out, I'd  lose to four 2s repeatedly. 2) Moxxi walked right through Ash.			"

												This is a good poker game, although some opponents lines and taunts are annoying as fork... for example:The robot dude is folded and then I fold too after him and he mocks me ~uh a fold I`m gonna alert the media~ or like ~you cant spell fooled without fold~ WTF man you are folded too .-. ...you annoying !@#$ (I kinda have anger issues, yes)Anyway I learned how to play poker to play this game and its a nice poker game for beginners, I recommend playing Omaha then when you catch the game move to Texas hold `em.Pros:Good for beginners;Has unlockable items for TF2 and borderlands;You can kinda change the the scenario, decks and chips appearance;Buy other players beer; LOLCons:Annoying chit chat and you cannot skip it, sure ~some~ of them are fun but after you heard it all it gets more and more annoying;Stupid taunts.I rate the game 8/10.I Recommend it!Get it in a sale :)			"

												Obviously you have to like poker. Players this time around are Brock Sampson from Venture Bros (I’ve only seen a very little bit of that show), Claptrap from Borderlands (I usually find him annoying), Ashley Williams (I didn’t know that was his name) from Army of Darkness, and Sam from Sam & Max. So yea, it’s poker, with witty banter from some interesting characters. I pretty much suck at poker, so don’t ever expect to play with me for real money. The banter was good, there were some interesting stories told, I was usually happy when claptrap was eliminated. Sam seemed to consistently lose first, Brock seemed to be the best, though Ash was up there. I lost 2-3 tourneys and won one. They added “bounties” which you have to complete so you can have the chance to win one of the “big” items from the game. I quit when I was in the middle of a tourney to win Brock’s sphere-o-mystery, whatever it was. One thing they added in this one that I thought was cool was every tourney you get tokens, and then with tokens you can buy new chips, cards, or table felt. Nothing big, but changes the look up. The banter and stories get repetitive after a while. Ash’s voice isn’t (I don’t think anyway) genuine, but it’s close. Everyone else is the original actors. \Oh yea and you can buy drinks for other players with tokens as well. The more they drink (apparently, I never actually bought anyone a drink) the worse decisions they make?Oh, and GLADoS is the narrator. She pops her head in at random times and makes various comments on how we’re all going to die “it’s a statistical certainty that 80% of you will lose and 100% of you will die. Isn’t math fun?” and other such things. Apparently players have tells, but like I said, I’m not very good at poker. Though maybe I shouldn’t be able to pick them up from only an hours play.But yea, it’s poker, so I guess there’s that. "

												It's Texas Hold 'em. Don't like it? You probably want to steer clear, then. Otherwise, this game has its share of laughs, as the NPCs interact with each other. Chances are you already do, but you have to know the source material, otherwise you may not find the humor to be funny. And if you're getting this game to get the TF2 items/Borderlands 2 skins: It takes time, depending on your skill level...and luck. And by time, I mean a good chunk. The humor wears off after you start hearing everyone go on repeat, as another head's up. It's a good purchase for the $5, don't get me wrong. It can be a bit addicting, even if you aren't a good poker player.			"

												Poker for people with no friends to play poker with.  Like me!  And probably you.Stand Out Features: True to character personas from various popular media all playing poker at your table.  Detailed stages full of little references and overall polish.  Unlockable incentives to keep playing.Pros: Sharp writing for all the characters.  Gameplay plenty engaging for novice poker players.  Characters more recognizable compared to the prior game's cast.  Claptrap, true to his character, becomes annoying.Cons: Lines start repeating after just an hour or two of gameplay.  Game becomes less stimulating as characters leave the table.  I can't confirm the game will adjust draws to create big upsets in a hand, but said upsets happen enough to warrent suspicion.  Claptrap, true to his character, becomes annoying.Would Recommend To: Fans of the specific media from which these characters come from (Anyone who considers themselves a fan of Claptrap should immediately add this to their must buy list).  Fans of poker that want to hear some clever banter and jokes during hands.			"

												I'll admit I find the game to be alot of fun, I do however say that Tell Tale Games has a chance to get into the DLC action with character packs or new skins for decks, chips and the like. While I enjoy the lines and such of the current roster, after a while it grows stale. If you want to sit down to a quick game or two of poker without risking your actual money, Poker Night 2 is the best way to do it.			"

												Sure, Poker games are practically a dime a dozen.  But this is the one you should buy.  Why?  Well, you could play poker with emotionless icons.  You could play poker with real people you can't see in virtual rooms.  Or, you can play poker with Ash Williams (Army of Darkness), Brock Samson (Venture Bros.), Cl4p-Tr4p (Borderlands), and Sam (Sam & Max), while GLADoS (Portal) deals.  They have tales, they have tells.  The game becomes much more alive.  Stakes are high, but hopefully luck will be on your side.  Amazing game, everyone should give it a shot.			"

												The quests are incredibly hard since most of them are due to luck and its not exactly about how well you play. I understand poker is a luck game but why should i want to constantly restart the game over and over until i get a flush or higher ect. And i find it most people have this game is only for the achievements not for the poker experience.But on the other hand other than that aspect i would say its a well thought out game and the dialog is incredibly interesting. So if thats what your looking i would consider it			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Poker Night 2 is a game developed and published by Telltale Games and is the sequel to Poker Night at the InventoryThe game is visually appealing and is a huge step up from the previous game. The game offers some funny dialogue but can get repetative after a while and the unlocks add incentive to continue playing the gameOne major flaw in Poker Night 2 is the very predictable AI which makes the game too easyIt's fun for a while, a nice game to relax with while enjoying an adult beverage. By the time you unlock most of the stuff, though, you'll probably be bored of itPoker Night 2 is a great poker game for people who don't really play poker RECOMMENDED :) [/h1 "

												It's fun at the beginning, but i guess only ppl not knowing the first thing about poker can like this for more than 30minutes. the ""tournament"" is a joke, as U start on blinds 400/800 with only 20 000chips, and they rais every 5 hands, . .ludicrous.Characters are funny, but that can't be the only reason why U play a game, it's a game, it must be good itself, .. and it isn't, gameplay is slow, even the menu is so slow!

												5/10, it's just not very good.  Lines start to get repeated enough to get grating early on, and GlaDOS is especially bad about it, retreading the same insults over and over every other hand. It's also buggy and poorly optimized, I'm having slowdown on my desktop and overheating on my laptop. The game desperately needs a patch.edit: January 2015 update: This game never got a proper patch.  It sucks, don't bother.  (It's even worse on PS3)edit: June 2016 update:  Something clicked in my brain and I got hooked on this game.  It's a lot of fun and really chill, but they didn't update it or anything, I just pulled a complete 180 and now I love it like an abused spouse.

I say this because the taught of being able to play poker with some of your favorite gaming characters, and listening to their dialoug really intrioughes me. I also recommend this game because it supports full controller support, which for me is a big seller for games. The only complaint i hve about this game is some minor glitches, for example giving the A.I money, even after they are supposed to be busted out, making them still in the game 7/10			"

												Contrary to so many positive reviews, there are some serious issues with this game.  1) Usability.  There are unskippable scenes within the game - even when clicking ""skip to next hand"".  You have to sit through scenes when all you want to do is play the next hand.  2) In too many cases the game doesn't know how to play Poker.  It doesn't know how to match cards - namely, when you have a flush vs. a straight vs. a full house, or even a 2 pair.  It's key that none of the issues are with how the game is played, but rather how the game counts cards.  It's up in the air whether it's more frustraing that the game can't figure out if you have 2 pair vs. waiting for some silly cutscene when you select ""skip to the next hand.""			"

												I`ve always wanted a good single player poker game that actually played realistically with decent characters. This game does that.It starts you off in a dark  underground pub or bar and introduces you to 4 characters, only two of which I recognised which was Ash, and not from the crappy tv series either.  I also recognised Max, while never having played the game, know by reputation. Or is he called sam? I get mixed up between the dog and bunny. However, the characters reveal their personalities as you play the game. It`s more slow a reveal than the first game, but nicely paced in my view.The characterisations and how they play is really the best part of the game. Some of the jokes and stories are great.You can buy drinks for your opponents to weaken their skills, a bit silly really and they never refuse. I would`ve preferred it without. Sexy bar lady though with an air of `can`t be be bothered` to her.You also have a  female voiced robot that deals the cards. i prefrred when the cards where just dealth naturally in the 1st game. She can be also highly annoying both in attitude and voice. I preferred the original way without the dumb dealer robot.Game feels a little easier to win. Maybe too easy. You can free extra tables and card design but there`s not much to free up.My main wish would be for more choice in characters with just as much depth to play against. Make it about 10 with clothing variety so each game feels fresh. Yes, it would be a fair amount of work, but I`d pay £30 for it.Anyway recommended.			"

Claptrap from Borderlands, Ash Campbell from Army of Darkness, and Brock Samson from Venture Bros. are the most noteworthy. As you get into heavier betting against the characters it will show percentages, and can teach novice poker players like myself how to recognize straights, flushes, and full houses.

												If you liked the first one, you'll like this one.  It takes the old formula (poker, familiar faces, humorous dialogue, and unlockable items) and improves upon it.  The game is more diverse with improved AI bluffing and added environmental elements, and additionally, this time around you can earn Bordlerlands and TF2 items.Bonus points for the Burn Notice references.

												Poker night 2 is the sequel to Poker Night 1 (unsuprisingly) and Telltale games only improved from PN1.  You can know buy felts, chips and decks with the Tournament tokens that you get for eliminating other players.  Also the bounty challenges are great and the design of the different sets is awesome.  Finally the people you play with; Brock, Sam, Ash and Claptrap are lively and realistic AI with many funny lines. Also a nice touch is that Each player has  aunique personality and they give tells at different times and some of them are quite cryptic			"

												Overall I enjoyed this game, it was nice to play poker against opponents from popular culture and that's exactly what I got this game for. But, in terms of just having a nice poker experience? The original was better.In my honest opinion, there are two three things to know about this game.1. The random card shuffler is not random.2. The original Poker Night 1 was better.3. Poker Night 2 is VERY repetitive.In short, the original was much more relaxed. I found the characters from the original game more fun to play with/against, and I enjoyed how it didn't play on its own gimmick. In the new version, being able to turn the entire room thematic is cool, but it really gets tiresome having the exact same ending sequence play over and over again with no variation. GLADOS as the dealer is irritating, yes insulting the player is kind of her thing, but I don't actually want to hear the dealer speaking when I'm trying to play. Many aspects of this game destroyed immersion for me, but bad stuff aside you get exactly what you asked for. A poker game with pop culture icons. Enjoy it! And make sure when you're done you open up Poker Night 1 for the full experience. "

												Poker night 2 is one of those games where i fell as though you pay for a quality title, without having to spend $60. Though the game dialogue has its fair share of hiccups, its still a well presented game. The little things is where this game shines, from the small interactions Glados has with the rest of the cash, to actually winning TF2 items that you can use in game. Even though i'm not heavily into poker, i still enjoy the game. Weather your a hardcore poker fan, or just a noob who wants the ""free"" TF2 items, i say pick up the game.			"

												Not a bad poker game. Depending on your experience with other TellTale titles you may prefer the previous version, like I do. I'm not as familiar with these characters - although the change is nice sometimes. I also enjoy playing Omaha instead of the usual hold 'em. I seem to have a few issues with Omaha mode, though. I'm not sure it's actually crediting me for my best hand, and instead crediting the lesser scoring other combination (two pair, for example) in that hand.Still, it's a pretty good game overall. I just prefer the characters, chatter, and overall presentation in the first Poker Night better.			"

												More poker!More cartoon characters!More references!GLADOS is the dealer!But seriously, it's a fun poker game, I still don't know much about poker at this point, but it's entertaining and easy to play regardless, so it doesn't feel like I'm getting punished for not knowing how to play poker.Like the last game, it offers customizeable tables, decks, etc. but with far more options than the last game. It also includes more events and interactivity than the last one as well, which I enjoyed.If you just want a straight poker sim, this is serviceable, but it has the added benefit of fun dialogue and cross franchise characters.

												Why would you play video game poker? By yourself? Because of the hilarious and charming AI, of course! And I don't just mean GlaDOS. The whole cast is funny and delightful, enough so you might not even get so upset when they keep beating you on the river. Okay you might still get upset, but hey, it's not real money! They added some nifty table felt and card designs unique to each character, and that in turn also unlocks additional cut-scenes. Also you can play Omaha! Finally! (I actually didn't know that game type existed before this game). It's not a full blown Poker sim and if you wanted a really good Poker experience close to what you find in real life there are other games that do it better. But you won't be playing with people as fun to be around with as these four, I guarantee that much.			"

Also, winning by going all in with a 4-2 from different against your two aces all the time. I don't play enough poker to know the terms. It got to the point where if I had three aces after the three cards came out, I'd  lose to four 2s repeatedly. 2) Moxxi walked right through Ash.			"

												If you're a fan of either Venture Bros, Borderlands, Army of Darkness or the Sam & Max franchise, I'd say the game is worth getting just to get the pretty sweet dialogues. As advertised, it's a Poker game, nothing fancy, just a few unlocks in the form of differently themed assets in the game - aaaand items for your TF2 inventory if you're into that.If you're worried about the writing, I think you can rest easy. There are a few in-joke game references from the franchises involved, but it doesn't come off as forced (at least in my opinion).Conclusion: A well polished poker game with dialogue and unlockables that'll keep you entertained for at least a few hours.

They grate after a few hours though3) Brock having Joe's voice actor4) GlaDOS5) Screwing with the clapAnnoying for:1) The way the AI works on every damn final you vs last player bit, where it just drains out your cash while never folding themselves on terrible cards before seeing the wossname cards. Also, winning by going all in with a 4-2 from different against your two aces all the time. I don't play enough poker to know the terms. It got to the point where if I had three aces after the three cards came out, I'd  lose to four 2s repeatedly. 2) Moxxi walked right through Ash.			"

												This is a game that I have played way to much. me like many others bought the game because the TF2 items and Borderlands 2 cosmetics, but I wouldn't believe it was so fun.This game was actual the way I learned to play poker (some thing I say every time people tells me video games make you dumb. even though how to play poker and wasting money might not be the best thing to learn)I don't think you should play it if you dont want the items for tf2 and b2, but it might be worth it if you really like the characters that you play against.

												A game designed to sell other games. Not really.A game designed to be purchased to unlock sh... stuff in games you have. Definitely. Cons:Crappy UI. Lots of Un-skippable moments that are funny the first few times; annoying after the 3rd+. Pacing! I want to hear a great dialogue, poker is the way. I want to play poker, dialogue gets in the way. SERIOUSLY Lastly, GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR UNLOCKS FROM THIS GAME, TTG has given no merit to patching. So, Their best response is: talk to the other developers, to receive your unlocks. ""Not their fault, AT ALL"", is what is coming through to people having problems.Pros:Lots of funny moments, and interactions. Characters are true, and seem real in this game.... the pacing takes away from it. But, all those moments feel real. Buy this game for unlocks..... that is about it.			"

												This is a fun game... for a  while.  For $5 or less, it is worth it.  The characters are entertaining until the dialog gets recycled, then it becomes annoying.  Especially when play completely halts until the story you've already heard is done being told.  And there's no way to skip it.  It would be nice if you could choose to get just the critical dialog to play the game, but it's all or none.  And the available subtitles are almost illegible.  The poker game itself is not that realistic.  If you played tight (only when you have good cards) you would win just about every game.  Sometimes a player will call a big bet when there's no way they can win.  I think the game is designed in your favor to make it easier and get you involved in more hands.  It seems like you get more lucky than you would in a real random draw of cards.  If you learned poker from this and were to enter a real game, I guarantee you would lose.  But if you're never going to do that and/or you realize how unrealistic the gameplay here is, then it can be fun.			"

You could play poker with real people you can't see in virtual rooms.  Or, you can play poker with Ash Williams (Army of Darkness), Brock Samson (Venture Bros.), Cl4p-Tr4p (Borderlands), and Sam (Sam & Max), while GLADoS (Portal) deals.  They have tales, they have tells.  The game becomes much more alive.  Stakes are high, but hopefully luck will be on your side.  Amazing game, everyone should give it a shot.			"

												In my opinion this game is the best simulator the exists when it comes to high-stakes poker groups. And I'm talkin' groups. Like a weekly poker group or back or the bar table. Not casinos.Because it's all about how well you can bluff and see others' tells. Every other poker game you're gonna play out there is just about the cards but this is about the people A brilliant bunch of funny characters whose jokes you'll hate to laugh at because they'll be at your own expense. But then that makes it so much sweeter when you steal the chips out from under them.My hours above don't reflect how much I've played this game. Bought it again after beating it on PS3. Play the game through till you get all the rewards and become the master. Then, you'll actually find you're better at poker in some ways. Depending on the right situation though -- don't go bettin' it all because of a video game now.			"

Don't assume that you now know how to play in real life though. The characters are highly aggresive and everyone is playing with fake unlimited money. In reality, everyone would be a lot more cautious. The banter gets repetitive but the bounty drops, customizable decks, coins and table make up for it.			"

												If you want a good poker sim, get the first Poker Night game. This one is utter garbage. I'm by no means a pro level poker player, but I still know enough about it to know that this game does not care about your level of experience.Half of the point in poker is to bluff your opponents into thinking you've got a good hand when you have a crap one or vice versa. In this game, you CANNOT bluff. The AI simply doesn't let you. It knows when you have a good hand and knows when you have a bad one.Not only that but the AI gives you two choices in 90% of the hands. 1) Fold. 2) Go all in. Seriously. The number of times the computer decides to make one of them go all in is rediculous. So you can either go all in with a pair of jacks, thinking you'll come out on top when you get a third jack on the flop, only to be sent drowning at the river because one of the others somehow got a straight. Honestly, I hate to feel like I'm complaining about this because it could just be that I'm a bad player, but the number of complaints I'm seeing about how badly the AI was programmed in this game makes me think it isn't just me.If you want this game for the TF2/Borderlands items, don't waste your time. You won't get them unless you invest a lot of agonising hours into losing tournament after tournament. You could probably craft something better in TF2 anyway.Now I'm gonna go play some poker against some real people who will actually fall for a bluff every now and again.			"

												Ever did like Poker Night 1? well it seems like they made a second one. Welcome to Poker Night 2. This isn't really a sequal but more so an updated version of its previous game. it has more features and more fun jokes than the last one. We remove the old characters from the first and bring in fresh ones. In the first game we had Strong Bad, Tycho, Max, and The Heavy though now we have Ash, Brock, the ever so loud mouth Claptrap and Sam. Poker Night 2 also contains the ability to buy drinks for characters and the more they drink the more they get drunk and eventually reveals their hand. It adds a lot of atmosphere compared to the original I give it a 9.5 out of 10.			"

												Poker is one of the most reknowned games of all time. Although i had no original interest in poker at the time, the thing that caught my eye was the inclusion of my all time icon-Ash Williams-into a poker game with video gaming characters. I believe that the gameplay and the talk between each characters is both entertaining and enlightening. It regulates between backdrops to random chit chat and funny remarks. All in all i would give the game 7/10			"

												There are tons of poker simulators out there, but this title keeps things fresh by mixing characters from different mediums.  the characters play styles tend to mimic how they would (probably) play the game, Brock is aggresive while Sam plays more conservatively.  The banter is humorous and they interact with each other constantly, with several hours of conversations to hear it keeps the game entertaining and fresh.  The only exception would be GLADOS, who does not seem to have as robust a sound library and repeats herself more than anyone else.  Overall a great time waster.			"

												Pretty unfortunate purchase. If you like dialogue which falls flat after about an hour of playing, go for this game.The poker itself is ho-hum, the banter got old fast, and options to move past the banter or turn it off were sorely missed.			"

												This game is simply F-U-N! The gameplay is easy for hobby poker players (even for beginners easy to learn), the fan-service delivered by the characters knows barely limits, and the loot- sweet, sweet loot - for tf2 and borderlands 2... Totally worth the price, in fact, it's nearly for free. If you like playing poker or are willing to learn, here's your chance. And wouldn't you like to see how a claptrap fail to seduce an other AI like GlaDos? I say, it's your duty! Have fun.			"

												GLaDOS is the dealer, with everything that entails. If it was just Poker Night 1 with GLaDOS as the dealer, it would already be worth double the price of admission. It's more than that, though; Claptrap's a riot, and Sam & Max play off each other beautifully. Brock is like the Heavy and Max from the first game combined. Ash, though, is mostly just a straight man for all the other jokes.			"

												If you like poker games, this is probably not the one for you. While it's fun to see some famous characters, the slow and clunky turns, and un-skippable quips that the characters make constantly, makes this poker game frustratingly slow. The AI seems better than some, however, so that's a plus. I could just do with out wasted exposition and time taking animations between every move and deal. Even the menu navigation is clunky.If you want to hear your favorite characters talk back and forth as much as play a poker game then you might enjoy this fairly shallow poker game. I could not.I wish there were better poker games on steam.			"

												The game gives you random objectives to unlock TF2/Borderlands items, if you get one of the near impossible objectives you will be frustrated and in agony. Also the objectives often make you do bad plays in order to have a chance at them. After 8 hours of play and nearly collecting 1,000,000$ in winnings I haven't gotten an item. Good game but mind numbing after you've heard most everything and never knowing when you will advance through the♥♥♥♥♥♥fillled objectives is enough to drive the player insane.			"
