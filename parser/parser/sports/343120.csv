												Game needs work. No option to change controls, controls screen doesn't stay on long enough to read everything. Physics seems a bit off, especially the reverse gear power. This game wasn't for me sadly.			"

Starts off with flat tracks that have slim to no obstacles while slowly getting crazy. Motorbike contains 100 stock levels but gives you access to several thousand downloadable tracks and a reasonably intuitive level editor. Includes a bunch of different riders, outfits and bikes but none seemed to have alternate stats, just graphics. Supports both local and online co-op but I've not tried my luck yet.Simple controls with a decent physics system overall but one that use some improvements. eg, Reverse gear seemed to be in overdrive, which made some of the earlier levels more difficult then they should have been. Graphics are simple by nature and much closer to the older trials games but still perfectly adequate. Music did the job and never did it feel too repetitive, just don't go expecting name artists.Considering the $5 price tag, great bang for your buck and recommended.Things that could use tweaking. 360 wired pad worked but required clicking with the mouse to change levels and such. Restart speed of runs could be quicker, want to get back into the action asap. Achievements would be a huge plus. :)			"

												DISCLAIMER : This is post Update from a few days ago!Before this update: 10/10 best pass time game that was fun, physics were insane, but were never wonky, they always consistent. You could always expect something to happen.After Update: Awful. Great graphics, but now the FPS is capped at 60 (it wasnt before), the physics are not the same, changing the way you play. The new ""features"" you can give your rider are ok i guess, but the controls are not as crisp as they used to be. My friends used to crowd around my computer and watch me launch this poor rider thousands of feet in the air because of a difficult custom map, but now its a waste of $5. Please bring back >60 fps, updated physics, and crisper controls Post-Update score : 2/10			"

												This is a great game that is very fun to play! You can go soaring off ramps, do triple backflips and ride over many different types of obstacles! I would recommend this game to anyone who loves dirtbikes or going off ramps. Great game and I hope to see more players on it soon!			"

												First Impressions:There's a lot here for the five dollar price tag...100 original maps, over 4,000 user-made maps, and a map editor so that you can create and share your own maps.  The gameplay was fun and there were definitely some LOL moments during my session.  My only gripe is the lack of a fullscreen toggle/screen resolution setting, though the window can be resized manually.  All in all, this is a fun romp that both casual and hardcore gamers can play (what with the maps ranging from easy to insanely difficult).

												Waste of money. As a big and long time fan of the (unfortunately Windows only) Trials series, i hoped that this could be like Trials Fusion for Linux, but it's not... Bad graphics (i mean really bad, even compared to Trials 2 from 2007) and i could'nt even find out how to make it fullscreen :( - It's like a Trials rippoff where someone removed everything that made it fun, enjoyable and good looking. Overall it feels more like an early access game, but it doesn't say it is one.			"

												(2.9 hours played as of writing)Motorbike is an amazing 2.5D casual stunt-racing game. It’s so good I bought it twice. Once on the dying/dead OUYA system, and then later on the computer.The overall premise of the game is very simple. You get spawned at a starting zone on the left of the map and have to make your way to the right of the map to win the level. While it may seem like an easy game, it can be VERY difficult with the tracks. Some maps are so difficult that they put checkpoints part way through the level. You have many obstacles between you and the end zone ranging from loop-de-loops, mines, and cars. The premise is so simple that it is kind of hard to write a review for it.With the game comes around 100 built in levels, but thanks to an included map editor, there are several thousand maps created by online users. The editor is hard to use at first…unless you actually bother to read the help section on it like I had too :P.For $4.99, you will get the most of your money from playing this game because it is fun as heck. The game is SUPER easy to pick up and play when you don’t have much time to play games.I rate this game a 8.5\10PS. My online level I made is number 4679.~bottlehead			"

												***warning STEAM version does not include Oculus Rift DK2 support!**Found a demo of this game on VR Share site of Oculus, visited their site, saw they launched on Steam: bought the game. No VR support.Only way to get Oculus Rift version is buying it through their site, which is crap, why put it on steam ? Without the VR integration the game is not worth €5, with VR it's worth twice that, so that's what I had to put to get the full version.Very immersive experience in VR with miniature bike and person driving approx 15-20cm from your face, very cool.The GUI and game might not be as flashy as BlazeRush (VR top-down racer) but for the lower price it does give you a few hours of enjoyment in VR now and again,Recommended game for VR, but not bought through STEAM. So recommended on steam : NO			"

												Bad game. Bad physics. Cheap tracks (random things being thrown at you from the sky to knock you off your bike as an ex). Poor track design, honestly just frustrating bs. No analog movements (haven't seen this cr** since Trials 2). WTF. NO CHECKPOINTS - which in a game like this where the first few tracks = 'Hard' Trials tracks is the stupidest (or laziest) thing I've ever seen. Waste of my $5. Do not buy. Go play Trials  or the very capable 'Urban Trials Freesyle'.			"

												Do you love the Trials series and have them all? Then you will probably want this one - I'd recommend getting the non-Ubi Urban Trial Freestyle before this one (it's better and cheaper too!) The graphics on this one are pretty primitive. One recurring sound effect sounds as if the programmer was folding his beer can. I'd say get it on sale - but it doesn't seem to go on sale. Nevertheless, I don't regret purchasing it and will end up going thru all the tracks I'm sure.			"

												I'll start with what I don't like. But bear with me, because there's a lot to like, too.The game feels quite dated, - it would keep good company with games from around 2008.  That's not an issue for me, because I still play games from the early 80s.  The graphics are far from optimised, and running this game heats up my rig a lot more than much prettier games do.  I can't find how to make it fullscreen, so I'm stuck with a title bar and start bar.  It frequently hiccups, which pauses gameplay for up to a second which, due to the technical and precise nature of play, often means death.There's also an annoying delay while the view pans from your deathpoint back to the start of the track, - annoying because the track resets at the beginning of the pan, rather than when you can actually start riding again.  If you were a long way from the start, then that's 4 or 5 seconds of panning, during which swings swing, barrels drop and other props are set in motion, and you're already too late to catch a falling swing.  It's easy enough to work around, - just tap R to restart again with no pan delay, - but its unnecessary, and needs to be addressed.If you're after something like the Trials series, don't get this.  It's not Trials.  Get Trials.But...If you remember Elastomania, and you liked it, then you'll love this.  It's all about timing moves perfectly, and it's very satisfying.  The camera angles are good, and together with a zoom feature, allowing you to see more of what's coming on the monitor,  makes for a very intuitive and playable experience.  Apart from the above glitches, and lack of optimisation, the game looks great on screen, and the physics are fluid, realistic (enough), and believeable.And a special mention goes to the soundtrack.  Instrumental rock-guitar driven, and very nicely laid down.  Is the soundtrack available? ;-)I have not tried the editor, but the stock levels are nicely put together, challenging, and very satisfying to complete.So... Not very pretty, but heaps of fun, super-easy to learn, great for a quick casual thrash (loads straight to play in seconds), and don't be surprised when, like Lemmings of old, it's 3am and you realise that you've been telling yourself ""just one more quick try"" for the last 6 hours.  Maybe that's why fullscreen isn't enabled, - so you can always see the system clock...			"

												Great fun for the low price I picked it up for. Reminds me of an old game similar to this that was 2D I used to play back in high school so some very very fond memories brought back. Way better value then Trials Fusion though also MUCH MUCH harder. A lof the user created tracks are damn near impossible but it's fun to try and see if you can beat them anyways. For $5.50 CDN it was a complete SCORE!			"
