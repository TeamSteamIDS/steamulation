												Nice enough game for what it is, but it feels more like one of those free games you play once with your friend and that's it. No real ""replay"" value. It's a fun game, but if more content was added that would be great. And yeah, the game was JUST released as I'm writing this, but I still feel like there isn't enough content for the price, and that's saying a lot considering it only costs 4 euro. If the price was, let's say, 1 euro, or hell - if it was free - I'd give it a solid 10/10 for what it is. It's still fun, just not enough content compared to the price.Overall, fun game, but not enough content to keep me interested for very long.Also, the costumes and the way your character moves is really cute, so they got that right.I do feel bad for refunding the game, but if more content is added I will 100% buy it again.
