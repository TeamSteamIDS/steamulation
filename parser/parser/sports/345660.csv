												Ride Review - see under Ride discussionsAs a keen bike owner, racer & gamer, previously having played Super Bikes Riding Challenge, I am not very happy with Ride. I have done a more lengthy review of Ride which you can find under the Ride discussions where I have discussed only some of all the problems with this game. I have since also started a Ride protest page which reveals other peoples frustrations with this game under same, which most probably like all the others in my Steam unplayable games library, will most likely not be fixed. I strongly advise against buying this or other games on Steam until such time Steam are able to support them properly			"

												This game is unfinished, and from the looks of it will not be properly supported. despite my pc being above the ideal set up that they recomend, the game will not hold 30fps on the lowst settings and its framerate is all over the place, the physics that they claim are ""realistic/simulator quality"" feel like a joke compared to  that of old ps2 games, the front breaks never lock up even if you turn in fully and mash the breaks all the way.  then we get to the ai which is terible and lazy, they hardly holde a proper line and do not respect you, they will break late every corner and then some, and somehow be able to out accelrate you on the exit of every corner unless you use proper early breaking and early acceleration, (this is on the default easy setting in the first set of cups) the ability to change setups involvs using sliders which have arbitrary numbers between 1-5, never giving you enough values to properly tune the bikes to the course, and most of them fail to offer enough of a change even at max deviation compared to what they should provide. after looking up the game and its forum, I can clearly see that the developers will not support this game, nor do they care about its success and as such I can not recomend this to anyone.  if this was a early access game I might be willing to give this a wait until release, but, as its already out. skip it.

												WARNING!!!!!!!!Ride will delete your saved data at some point. It's guaranteed. The game autosaves, and you can't manually save. You can create a rider, play a quarter, maybe a half way through the season, and the next time you start the game, EVERYTHING will be lost. Like to start over from the beginning a hundred times? If so, this is the game for you. Otherwise, STAY AWAY!			"

												Milestone set out to succeed playstation 2's Tourist Trophy as the modern motorcycle racing simulator. It however falls very short of that goal. Graphics are last generation quality that somehow taxes modern video cards. The only positive things I could say about the game is it's selection of bikes and gear. But it falls short from there. It feels very shallow and geared towards the casual gamer/racing fan. Short-comings in on track riding is what ruins the game the most. It is the same arcade style simulation (an oxymoron) engine as the previous MotoGP games. Trailbraking deep is ridiculous and offers no feedback when the front wheel is at it's limit. The reactions of the bike to too much throttle is the same for every bike. Turning into the first corner is always the same even if the race just started and the front tire is still ""cold"". Then there are the small missing details. No clutch lever use even on the older bikes. The throttle hand works but the brake lever is never used, never mind the rear brake pedal on the right foot. There are ZERO braking markers for non-track circuits. Only occasionally is there a reference point like a tree or a fence, but the rider is left with nothing to judge the approach most of the time.Then there's the ridiculously aggressive AI that has no qualms of ramming passed you because somehow collisions only penalize one bike. The AI will insist on it's line even if you're in front of it and worst of all will not brake if you plan on braking earlier than it. The AI is also on a very suboptimal line The set up of the game progression is obviously an afterthought to Milestone as there is NO QUALIFYING SESSION. YOU ARE ALWAYS 8TH. Leaving you with having to deal with the 7 AI-controlled bikes that will slow you down. Then there's the classification of the bikes into races. Some are beyond lazy such as grouping the MT07 with Ducati Monsters and Triumph Street triples because they are all below 700cc. WHAT?! That's a very ignorant way to classify a class race. The MT07 MAY have a corner speed advantage, but that advantage is completely blown away on circuits with straights. Why even bother having that bike? There was no beta testing for this game. Then there's the customization for looks and performance. The biggest mistake Milestone has in this area is completely ignoring the significance of a rear shock. The whole customization is an insult to any enthusiasts who love to customize their motorcycle's performance capability. Front forks are all stock upgrades. No chance of changing oil, springs, or even valves. Seat height, wheelbase, sprocket size, rotor size, handlebar vs clipons, removal of DOT required parts like lights. Milestone also only includes a very small amount of tracks despite having the license rights to the tracks in MotoGP15. None of those tracks appear in this game. Some tracks are ridiculously unfit for racing. Miami circuit being the most obvious because the street is too damn narrow . All in all RIDE is a game made by a casual company  meant for the casual gamer. If you want a game that shows the dedication to the sport like Tourist Trophy did for the Playstation 2, you will be very disappointed.			"

												I've probably sat here for a good few hours wondering whether to leave a positive or negative review. I think I've made my choice now.This game could of been so much more. I was so excited to play it on PC when I had a go at the Yamaha Demo at the MCN show in London. It was really looking good, but my heart sank when I purchased this at full price and recieved something I wasn't quite expecting. Pro's. -Really good customisation of Bike and Rider. -Pretty realistic movement.-Has quite a number of my favourite bikes. But I would lke to see some more earlier models.-Realistic Wheelies! (You don't pull wheelies by pulling on the handlebars like a bicycle.)-Stunning graphics and models.-Pretty awesome Multiplayer. Con's. -Only a few early models. Mostly generic modern bikes.-Only a handful of tracks.-Very random FPS drops that cause you to crash. (No, it's not my PC. My specs are on my profile.)-AI literally don't care. They just crash into you all the time.-Obvious signs of the game being unoptimized. (Laggy menu screen. Long loading times.)-Community pleads are ignored and unanswered.-Audio is pretty poor. (Lags when shifting gears up and down. Sometimes doesn't even play a sound, it's just ""Brruummm. -Silence.- Brrruuuummmmmm. -Silence.-"")-♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC. ""Yamaha Historical Bikes"" = R1, R1, R7. What happend to the FZR 750? Thundercat? FZR 1000? FZS 600? All in all, I really wish I could thumb it up. But it needs some serious patching, I feel like I'm playing a game in Early Access. "

												First of all the game looks nice. It presents a lot of options in terms of customization, but only just touches the surface in that area. The physics are below average. Bikes doesnt react to surroundings correctly, and the man himself desperately needs a ragdoll effect, which cant be that hard to make since we've seen that in lesser good games like Flatout, Flatout 2, Motocross game from 10-15 years ago. Milestone doesnt have any real competition on the Motorcycle game market and therefore do not feel the need to up their game at all. Same physics and controls as the last 2-3 MotoGP games. Poor network options - that rarely works, and when you succeed in connection to your friends, the game lags out and people disconnect with each other leaving you alone with bots.The WORST thing about MotoGP through ALL the years and now also RIDE is the quality of sound. Computer sounds, made by what obviously must be people who havent heard the real thing IN REAL LIFE. The sounds these machines make are worse than car games 15 years ago. You have the rights to MotoGP, you dont have any competition - GO out and record the ♥♥♥♥ing machines to deliver it to us when we game it. Most of the purchases unfortunately done of this game, is by people riding a motorcycle, so we KNOW the sounds. My first machine was a Yamaha MT07 with an IXIL exhaust on. That doesnt exist in the game but Akrapovic does. Its looooud like a beast with Akra on IRL - but ingame it sounds like the engine sound comes from an iPhone.Disgustingly bad :).If you can come to terms with having to mute your game, because having no sound will annoy you less than having the sound on?! - then its STILL almost a waste of money.Now RIDE 2 is on the way. People are ALREADY in the comments to RIDE's trailers and also RIDE 2's trailers writing ""WE WANT REAL SOUNDS"" - if they ignore us, us being the ones who pay for the damn thing, one more time.... i HOPE it will have consequences. Or at least give another studio the ide to start making Superbike or MotoGP bike games again!			"

If you ride a motorcycle, if you are a motorcycle enthusiast or if you enjoyed the SBK/MotoGP games, you will enjoy this game.

												This game is great but it keeps losing my data so i lose all of my rep this has happened twice to me. + The physics are good you can lose the front and you can highside so that keeps you on your toes not like tourist trophy. + The bikes feel like they have a weight to themn to pull them down to the apex requires some skill with no assists. + Allot of content I have around 30 bikes and have compleated about a quarter of the game in total not including losing my saves.+ There is a good amount of licenced parts for the bikes and for your riders gear.+ Runs well with everything at the highest and AA on x2 my 270x runs most tracks at 60fps and some like the road tracks I get around 50 avarage. The juddering from the demo is not in the final game. + AI is clever enough to make well thought out overtakes I have not once been t boned by a wild AI.- It deleted my data.- It did it again.- I'm not sure it will stand the test of time like Tourist Trophy but im sure if they added the TT mountain course then it would! Overall its a great game but the save issue needs to be sorted out ASAP.			"

												Forza with bikes pretty much. A very nice feeling bike game, which is extremely rare to come by. Last enjoyable bike themed games have to be Tourist Trophy or Moto GP2, but this game has the ability to live up to those titles.Only trouble ,for me atleast, was picking the Yamaha MT07 as a start bike, as I found it a bit difficult to get off the ground due to the ai competitors being on faster bikes. Once I got round that though, I managed to get a good bike out of a decent lineup, and have a blat round a few of the tracks, which have really amazing design/quality. Will require a pretty powerful PC to run efficiently however.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but I can't. It has fundamental flaws that make it unenjoyable for me.This is a shame because the content (the tracks, bikes, music etc) is all really good. I also got decent enough performance (outside of the load times).The worst problem is the handling. I think I figured out what the main 'cause' is, and this seems systemic of all Milestone bike games I've played:The tyres float across the track. You can see this even when not moving. Just lean left and right and look at the back tyre, it glides right and left respectively across the surface of the track when it should remain in the same place. This effect only gets worse at higher speeds, with the tyres gliding left or right by almost a whole foot when leaning.This isn't just the contact patch moving to the side of the tyre, its the whole tyre sliding as if there is no contact patch, and its not a power slide (it happens all the time), and it seemingly affects all 'modes' (pro and the rest).Overall this make the bikes horrible to handle.It's like there is no physics between the tyre and the track surface, as if the pivot point when leaning is somewhere in the middle of the bike instead of at the contact patch of the tyres. This is absolutely not a 'simulation', it's an arcade game (and, imo, a very flawed one at that).Also, some of the rider animations/'physics' are super messed up (like a crazy 'superman' somersault your rider will do during endos).And annoyingly there appears to be no practice or quali sessions, so to practice new tracks you have to go to Time Trials, which involves going through a bunch of slow loading menu screens.The other issues I had are mainly UI related:- Terrible loading screens throughout the menus.- Split time between riders not shown in-game.- Best lap time not shown in game.- Being unable to change controls in-game (have to exit out to the main menu first).- Being unable to un-assign controller buttons (so nothing is mapped to it).- Being unable to assign multiple buttons to single actions.- Unnecessary confirmation screens, like having to click proceed instead of backing out after a race, or having to re-confirm your bike (when you select a race your bike is already chosen, then get a loading screen, then have to choose your bike again - even if you only have 1 bike, then get another loading screen).- Game trying to 'sync' and failing, causing an error message you have to confirm. You can switch 'sync' off, but it re-enables itself each time the game is restarted.- Having to manually re-purchase enhanced oil after every single race.- A second or two delay between model updating when changing visual stuff (like helmets, leathers, bike parts etc), making custimising a time consuming process.- Key prompts always being for keyboard keys, even when using a controller.Some of the above may seen like nit-picking, and it is, but each little inconvenience adds up.Maybe some of the above has fixes and I missed it, but if I did its not obvious to me where it is.A real shame. So close to being a great game, yet so far.			"

												I'm going to compare this title a lot to MotoGP 14 because that's the game I've been playing alongside this.Ride has an overall feeling of being unpolished and rushed. Riding in the cockpit view reveals some horrible mirror reflections (if you can even call it that) and some messed up reflections on most wind screens. I really thought they would fix this before the official release but no, it's still there and it looks really bad. The graphics can look pretty good at times and pretty bad other times, often being somewhere in between. I feel MotoGP 14 is having a bit more consistency in the graphics department although it has some problems as well.The engine sounds are mostly uninspiring and often really dull sounding in my opinion (I play in cockpit view), although the engine sound gets a bit better on some of the supersport bikes. This problem, again, is shared at times in MotoGP 14. Sounds other than the engines are lacking as well (the wind starts to blow at 200 km/h). I can't comment on the music because I always turn it down in racing games.The handling of the bikes in Ride is stiffer and a bit more forgiving than in MotoGP 14 and this, for me, takes away from the fun. I think MotoGP 14 manages to pull off a lot better handling, although it might take a bit longer to get used to than in Ride.The implementation of upgrading your bike is very lacking in my opinion. I like that sort of thing in games like Forza or Gran Turismo but in here it just feels like a tacked on feature with a lot of unused potential. I actually prefer the ""level up"" system in MotoGP 14 even though that has some unused potential as well. Maybe a combination of the two could be pretty sweet. It's pretty cool to be able to customize the look of the bikes but again, it is lacking there as well as there are mostly minor changes that you can adjust.The carrer and the way you progress through the game is obviously taken from games like Forza and Gran Turismo but it never really captivated me here, while I often have a difficult time trying to put down the controller playing MotoGP 14.I keep trying to like this game but it just isn't that good, in my opinion. It can function as an alright break from the more solid MotoGP 14 with Ride's different types of bikes and tracks but most of the time I just can't get enough enjoyment out of this game to keep playing it for a lengthy period of time, even though it does have its moments.It is really hard to decide if I sould recommend this game or not. I'd say only get it on a sale if it's really cheap unless you're a big fan of bike games.+ A pretty nice collection of bikes and tracks you won't find in most other bike sims.+ Sometimes the graphics shine for those screenshots of you favourite bikes.+ Some events are actually pretty fun.- Bike handling feels pretty stiff in my opinion.- Graphics errors are way too prominent and hard to look past (if you're riding in cockpit view).- The sound is really lacking overall, with some exeptions.- Upgrade system feels rushed.- Prone to crash			"

												I admired the screamer games long ago. Then Milestone lost a fan with their buggy WRC game (corrupt save games).I thought I will never buy a Milestone game again, when I read about the save game errors in Ride.But I liked the demo and I like motorcycle games. Bought it finally during the sale (Read some developer feedback, they seem to care a bit more now than back with WRC). Played for 7 hours on the first day and it is a great game. (It crashed once but save game was not lost). Looking forward to tune my bikes in the next weeks!Forget what I wrote save game bug still there!Back up does fail as well. Developer is no good indeed(and steam will not refund bugged game because save game corruption struck after 12 hours gameplay)			"

												Ride is probably the best motorcycle video game since Tourist Trophy on PS2. There's been many MotoGP and WSBK games, but not many that use real-world motorcycles. I do enjoy riding some of the lesser known, or less racing-orientated bikes, its unusual.The gameplay is good, not amazing, but good. Sometimes the rider can be a little sluggish, almost like a deliberate input lag of sorts. Its most noticeable when switching directions quickly in a chicane, the rider will be noticeably delayed in swapping his body position on the bike. Sometimes the 'simulation' style of gameplay where excessively hard braking or hard acceleration causes the bike to squirm or slide aren't particularly smooth or realistic. There isn't that many tracks in the game, the selection will get repetitive after a while.The graphics are ok, the bikes and tracks look fair enough but the riders standing helmetless next to the bikes in the menus look ridiculous. 10years have passed since video game characters looked this simplistic.The audio, where do I start? Its terrible. Truly aweful. The bikes noises are appalling, I turned them off long ago, like some weird electronically generated whine. The best motorcycle engine noises in a video game ever, are in Burnout Paradise. And bikes are a side show in that game! Come on! Get your act together.Summary:Pros:- Great Selection of bikes, even some older 80's and 90's calssics.- Fast access to decent bikes, no need to spend hours riding slow bikes (unless you want to).- Decent on-bike graphics.- Decent controls.- Bike customization is limited, but still relatively well implemented. A tuned bike is still noticeably faster than the standard version.Cons:- The sound is abysmal. Bikes sound dreadful.- Some glaring omissions as far as bikes are concerned.- Helmetless riders look ridiculous, very dated.- Controls can sometimes feel delayed.- Some occassional dodgey slides where the physics don't add up.- Bike customization could have been better. Custom paint jobs, maybe even workshop support for cutom graphics kits etc. Why can I remove all the mirrors and indicators on some, but some leave the indicators when you choose this option? Where are the race fairings with no lights?- Limited number of tracks.Ultimately if you like bike racing games, this one is great, I may have been critical, but it can be very fun and its nice racing around on something that isn't necessarily a fully fledged race bike.

												Its far from perfect but still manages to be quite an enjoyable racing experience. The bikes are exquisitely detailed and theres a sizable variety of them ranging from 80s oldschool street bikes to modern electric superbikes, most of which can be modified and same goes for the rider, the tracks on the other hand... not so much, however they're still well designed and are really fun to race around in.Now what truly appeals to me with RIDE is how racing is only half the battle, the other half is actually wrestling with G-forces and keeping your rider on the bike to actually race, which adds a whole new level of depth to the experience. Knowing that if you're not gentle enough on the throttle or too hard on the brakes your rider is just gonna get launched into orbit, so finesse is a must. Compared to MotoGP(same studio) I'd say the physics are a lot more complex and feel way more realistic although it could've used some more polish in that department.The biggest issue with this game to me is how it feels like the game suffers from some occasional frametime lag, my rig is nothing fancy(2500k/gtx760/8gb) but it still manages to run [at the expense of a bad comparison] any codesmasters game like a dream with consistent frametimes and those games tracks' level of graphical of fidelity is by far superior, so after turning off some modern fluff settings i still had to tone it down even further in order to minimize the frametime lag. Another issue I have with this is how the AI racers seem a bit too rigid, and by that I mean they dont care if you're right in front of them, they wont bother braking and will just plow right through you if you happen to be in their way, it doesn't always happen but it does happen. Another minor but none the less irritating little problem I have is how the mirrors aren't actual mirrors and just look stupid in first person view, luckily you can take them off and pretend like you're just doing it for the sake of aerodynamics.Really this review just made me realize how much I want codesmasters to make this exact type of game on their engine, but until that day there's RIDE.

												Awefully good and at the same time bad. The playability and the physics is brilliant. The lack of actual communication is horrendous and takes no time in ignoring the bugs until mass repporting from the community. Even then they are vague and not connected to the ones concerned. The game has many bugs, the sounds pop and coding leaves bike components disconnected From the track surface.			"

												This game undoubtedly has a good graphical set-up with some seriously good visuals to give your eyes something nice to see. Although be it good looking, it's not exactly the best in it's entire delivery.Now, I have played motorsport racing games prior that not only include a Nintendo classic but MotoGP 13 as well. In my personal opinion, MotoGP 13 is probably one of the best racing games out there. I personally do not think Ride gives it a run for it's money but does have a few perks of it's own. Ride is a motorcycle racing game that entices players with it's various bike selection and decent gameplay. The selection of bikes ranges from naked bikes, historical bikes to super bikes each with their own sort of feel (regarding handling) and power. I start off with this point as it's the most influential part of the game as all the big names from Triumph, Kawasaki, Yamaha to KTM are all here. The rest is give or take - alright at best.The control scheme is decently immersive and accurate at certain times. There is the manual tuck that the player can choose to activate on top of other manual options (brake assistance and transmission settings). The braking system feature for example has two separate buttons for front brake and rear brake. Cool because that does make sense. The issue here though is the handling and braking throughout the turns (or before I should say). That ""stiff"" feeling of turning or tapping your stick to the right or left is still there. Instead of punishing the player for letting go of the left stick (turning control) too quickly, the rider slowly comes back to an upright position. Even if you're fooling around and tapping the stick left and right, it still has a choppy motion instead of a smooth movement.I understand the player is flicking the stick but as I've said, the game should punish sloppy or quick movements that would break a trajectory. On top of that, the turning doesn't feel as rewarding as it should. In MotoGP 13, taking a turn at a high speed and keeping that lean was what made it epic. Here, it doesn't really feel like you're doing anything epic at all, just another turn so to speak. What I will give the game credit for though is coming out of a turn. This feels like it was done right especially with higher powered bikes. If the player begins to floor the gas (so to speak) the bike's rear tire will start spinning out of control and slowly start putting the player at risk. The effects of this are cool and do make for split second decisions in how to recover. Problem is even if you do sort of muck up, the rider will go through a small animation looking like he's falling then recover given you did your part. These animations feel stiff and don't move with the bike as well as are sort of misleading. The crashes in MotoGP 13 felt a lot better than they do here (according to my personal contrast)! I think the animations could have been more relative rather than putting the same one for every situation.The graphics as I've mentioned are really good and the visuals and details on the bikes are quite excellent. Problem is games not only have to look good, they should also play well. The bike designs will make you stop for a moment and especially enjoy any modifications you've made to the bike (which can be seen). Then there are small things like nothing reflecting properly off the mirrors that could drive someone nuts. Some tracks it seems as though they put a repeating loop onto the mirrors. What is nice is that you'll see your player switching gears and letting go of the gas. The sounds are relatively good (not the best) but does give the player something different to listen to when switching bikes. Crash effects more or less sound the same and could have used a bit more diversity here (even though it's not the point of the game)! The music in-game is alright but I would argue the menus sound better.So why MotoGP 13 over this game? I feel that overall the other game albeit doesn't have as many bikes as Ride, still provides for a better motorcycle simulation game than this. If they made Ride more of an arcade sort of racer and mixed some simulation points into the game, I feel it could have gone better. What is completely appalling is the fact there are SO MANY LOADING SCREENS! Why does it load to a confirmation screen to show my bike once I've already chosen which bike I want to use!? Makes no sense! If you want more diversity in bikes, you may like this game. I play MotoGP in first person when I race whereas here I find I'm stuck playing in 3rd due to things not feeling exactly right. The game does boast a nice career mode where the player can take part of many world tours with different sets of bikes. On top of that, the maps are pretty good and could give the MotoGP 13 maps a run for their money. Also, the game clips randomly for me sometimes (and have noticed others having the same problem). This can be disastrous in key moments. Additionally, the leader boards don't seem to work either.I will recommend it but you'll definitely have to be a bike/race enthusiast to really enjoy it.RATING : 6.9/10 Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots : Probably one of my better screenshotsThe ""go-to"" animation for almost falling off a bikeI'm sure this is considered showing offStoppie and WheelieI like to start in styleWhat a naked bike looks likePeople do this in real life "

												I have generally liked Milestone products and havent jumped on the ""Milestone sucks and make's EA look like saints"" bandwagon. I have WRC4 and MXGP and thorougly enjoy them. Put 12 hours into Ride now and am very much enjoying it. Like all race games I feel there are things that can make it better but thats just me. The gameplay is fun and challenging (put it on hard/realistc on pro handling with tcs and anti wheelie off and tell me its easy!) a good selection of bikes but not enough in my opinion. The graphics on the bikes are gorgeous and being able to customise the bike is a really nice feature. I am however a little annoyed at the moment as there is a bug going round (see forums) that wipes your data randomly after an autosave. I got to rank 9 in my 12 hours and all of a sudden ""data corrupt"" I hope this will be fixed as I am now going to take a break from this game as I'm slightly bemused!Even though the game has shafted me, I still can't leave it a negative.My only 3 problems with the game,1: Lack of bikes.For example, Naked class but no Bandits or Hornets? Arguably the most famous nakeds. No 400cc Class would love some of the 400 screamers. Only one 2T? Thats unfair finally a game with 2T's again and its just 1? Why no RGV, NSR etc? Not enough Twins, Not even the awesome SV650S/10002: Sound: Has the Milestone sound crew every heard a Ducati L-Twin or even a big V-Twin like the VTR or TLR? Judging by the sound they make in this game I'm going to say no. I think its fantastic to see some twins in a game like the mighty TLR but it sounds awful, aslo if a Ducati with Termongonis sounded that weak in real life wouldent that be awful. The only bikes that sound ""right"" are the inline 4's. If fairness to Milestone most game companies get the sound wrong.3: Data LossIt wiped my bloody game at rank 9 with 12 hours gameplay ffs

												i will talk about this game in sections.1st is that from a technical standpoint the bikes are great, awesome models and great weight and feel.The sense of achievement from upgrading and racing is ""gran Turismo"" like. The difficulty makes you feel good when u get it right and punishes you for mistakes.sound quality isn't as great as i thought it would be but it doesn't break the game.Graphics are good.....textures are brilliantly detailed, But, it does use about half my 980's raw power and seems a little OTT for a racer.not too many options could limit its scalability.i am not a biker and i love car sims to pieces but this is my first foray into bikes and i love it.the track selection could be bigger and i would love the isle of man TT to be on here, but i feel DLC's will be incoming.it is worth the money i paid for it and i recommend it fully.i welcome questions on my review and hope for feedback.B.

												Been a biker, this game his all the right spots.. been a gamer, its lacking a lot... the bikes are amazing, the detail the realism of the looks.. and the rider customisation is tip top.. but sadly thats where it ends.. the bike sounds are half arsed,, the bike feeling while racing is so so.. the game graphics are very un finished. the crashes are like something off an old console game, road rash springs to mind. this game has sooooo much potential.. i just hope that they intend to finish what they started.. would be a great shame if they didnt finish polishing this up to shine like it can.

												RIDE has its flaws but there's no major problem not to recommend it to any motorcycle enthusiast. It does the job to render good riding sensation, the bikes selection is large, there could be more tracks but there's a pleasant mix of real & theme based (Japan, Wales, French riviera..) course.As you probably know, there's no real competition for motorcycle racing game. Many reviews here refers to Tourist Trophy on PS2 (2006) and even Superbike 2001 (GP500 anyone?). Now if you're one of those that have not been convinced by MotoGP piloting model, i'd suggest you give this one a try.Indeed it's rather close to Tourist Trophy in terms of sensation, bikes feels a little bit lighter and the speed effect is more convincing in RIDE. With all assistance desactivated, careful attention is needed on acceleration and braking. If you've never ride a motorcycle, it does matter to brake with the rear brake first then front (and also brake straight and never use the front brake when turning) and RIDE renders all of that.Now the flaws. First it's not very beautiful, i mentioned speed effect and i'd add motorbike models are well done, the rest is outdated. Textures are blurry, background landscape is terrible, no wow effect here. Sounds are failed for 2 cylinders engine (come on guys you're developping from italy), and changing your exhaust doesn't help. Prepare your own tracklist as well. There's also the ""AI"" that goes from buggy to terrible, at first it's funny to see an AI going wheelie at some start, but the constant ramming is ruining the fun at times.Recommended to all poor thirsty racers in need of something to keep up. After almost 10 years since Tourist Trophy guys, let's just hope it's not the last of its kind. "

												It's a racing game of a kind that is almost extinct today - beatiful fantasy tracks (here mixed with real ones), licensed machines, realistic, but accessible physics, and pure racing.Catering to different tastes, Ride offers variety of race modes, nonlinear career mode with single events and championships, optional bike customisation and tuning.I wish Milestone would make a car title like this.

												this game is really good. all of the bikes are rendered with so much detail, did I mention you can customize it.. yes you can.  you can also cusomize your rider - helmet / shields - track suits - gloves - and boots!  they also have the casual style with jeans/jackets.  Helmet designs are updated, 3 brands to choose from - SHOEI / Arai / AGV  -real helmet you see in store is in the game. using the xbox controller takes time to get used to if you havent played it, but couple of laps and  you will be flying trough those turns in no time. I'm running it on max settings and no hiccups - smooth as butter. - its the Gran Turismo for bikes -Pro's:- Good Graphics - Highly detailed bike / tracks- Plenty of Motorcycle to choose from- Different Class / from classic oldies all the way up to Prototype and electric. trust me, if you ride one in real life - you will love this game... unless maybe you're one of those grumpy old harley riders.  sorry no harleys here.- Customization is plenty for the gear headscons: - not really a con but my bike is not listed on this game :(  -  no Hayabusa !!

												This game was better than I had expected. The graphics aren't the greatest but the most important things, the bikes, look good. The controls are good but I highly recommend a controller. AI is dumb and tends to ride on rails for the most part but do pose a challenge until you upgrade your motorcycle. The customization is good but wish there was more. The rider gear selection is only limited to 3 companys but spans multiple colors and level of gear. Motorcycle customization is similar and needs a wider variety. The only complaint I have of now is I'm stuck in windowed mode and the micro stuttering but can look past it until a patch is released. I would recommend this game even with the limited customization and minor bugs to any racing fan and definitely a motorcycle enthusiast. Its a good effort of being like Forza except for motorcycles.			"

												Definitely the best motorbike racing game out so far.I'll try to list it in simple Pros and Cons to save you some time:PROS:- Wide range of difficulty and assists to suit most players- Decent range of bikes (though DLC doesn't add much more)- Good physics- Good graphics- Good bike customization- Brilliant rider customization- Tracks that the game has are good- Generally fun with a fair amount of replay valueCONS:- Not that many tracks- DLC adds virtually nothing to the game- Colour customization is limited to OEM variants- Some bikes sound pretty crappy- Awkward to play without a controller- Multiplayer is basically non-existant- Optimization is kinda shakyOverally I'd recommend the game and say it's a solid 7/10ALSO, many people complain about the game getting really low FPS, I too had this problem and struggled to get over 25 FPS with a GTX970, however this is just a dumb bug with the game that is easy to bypass, all you have to do is alt-tab out of the game and then go back onto it, and your FPS should be sorted, before vsync I went from 25 to 230 FPS using this fix, so before anybody puts you off with that bug, it is easily fixed.

Crashes animations sometimes aren't the best,but it's a thing that i don't mind at all and surely won't compromise the gameplay.

I do agree that there is lack of updating and support for the game right now. As far as I can tell, its the best modern motorcycle game there is out there, the feel of the motorcycle and the modification aspect of it all makes it quite special for me.

												Decent enough. When I bought the game over a year ago I was hoping for for it to be the Gran Turismo of motorcycles and in some ways it is, however, it falls short of being complete. It could use more of a selection of bikes, more customization, and more of a track selection. Menu inputs seem a bit laggy.On a high note the RIDE has some amazingly beautiful bike models and is a stunning game (granted you have the PC to play it).I give it a 6-7/10 overall, not bad.			"

												I have 10 hours on the game and have loved it. It’s at the point where it’s boring though.I believe there is no other motorcycle game that can compete with this game. You have real bikes, real brands (mods and clothing). The AI is incredibly hard – depending on your bike for the class it can be very difficult to podium or win on very easy mode! With a very good bike for the class you can then play on medium or easyI have not experienced the bugs that people hate (yet). Keep in mind haters will be much more vocal than people that have no issues with the game!!!!There are some very minor details that bigger developers wouldn’t miss eg saving default camera view, higher textures for the loading and menu screens, skipping bike preview while loading and saving gearbox and suspension settings for future races!Just research how to back up your save game to be safe!

												As a fan of Milestone's MotoGP series and RIDE, I can only recommend this game to everyone who loves motorcycle racing.I consider myself as an pretty experienced motorcycle racer due to those games, and RIDE feels really great.If you like motorcycles, motorcycle racing and actually know how to race a motorcycle, than you'll be saticefied with the accomplishments in RIDE. Difficulty greatly depends on your ability to RIDE, with or without any assists, AI setting on very easy or realistic AI setting. The ability to RIDE and to RIDE perfectly lies in practice, practice... and guess what... practice.  Learn each track at your own pace, feel how each bike handles diffirently due to their characteristics. Put on your helmet, choose your motorcycle... and let's RIDE			"

												Very promising game, but never buy games on promises. The whole frame work is good, but the developers leave much to be desired. They do not give any feedback or interaction in the forums. You leave bug reports and they are just ignored. The game is too unfinished and buggy. The physics are more arcadey, which for a developer that does the GP game as well, is pretty shocking. I played one of their older GP games and it was very bad. On top of all the issues, they just ignore all that and bring out DLC that does not address the main game flaws, It seems like they just want to rip people off.I have been riding bikes in RL for many years and many types of bikes. From my play time in the game, I can tell you that every bike is based off of the same poor physics template, they all handle all exactly the same, just some steer a little faster or some a little slower. They need to do a lot of work on the physics side of things, because it is far from realistic. Seems like plain lazy developers, and how they got the GP license I will never know. These developers are giving the game industry a bad name, I can't believe these people have no morals or care for what they do. I know I am being harsh, but I am fed up, Very disappointed :-(I have told all my friends and family to stay away from this. I suggest people do the same, they will never learn when your nice.			"

												I'v only had few hours on this game but normaly, after 15 hours of gameplay, I know if I want to stop playing the game or playing more and more until I'v went through every thing in the game and this one of those games I want to do a 100% with all gold medals and get every single bike avalable! I recommend this game, its fun and for people who loves motocycles like me but cant own one for several reasons, buy it!			"

												some what hard to ride a bike with a keyboard. the lean in for turns is not easy and speed is a major factor on if you stay on the track or road. This game is more than I was looking for when looking for a race game with motor bikes. But like I stated first, keyboard controls will be the hard part to learn.			"

												While this game is hands down one of the best looking and playing MC racing games I have played in a long time, the save file bug just makes this game not worth the money. I unfortunately found out about this bug after I had already put in a considerable amount of time in to the game and found that all of the bikes I had been winning in the Elite races were not in my garage.I have requested a refund from Steam due to the developer's lack of attention to the community and failure to fix such a major bug 4 months after the release of the game. I feel that I may be stuck with the game though. But that won't stop me from warning others to stay away.			"

												It's a lot of fun with a good amount content plus the DLC however it does suffer from quite a few issues... There is no proper livery editor which isn't really a big problem definetely not game-breaking but it would be nice to at least have the option, the ai even on the hardest difficulty are a breeze and when you get the opportunity to race side by side with them they are pretty much brain-dead... Unless if you are well and trully ahead of them under brakes going into a corner they will turn into you and just try to follow the racing line. I personally had A LOT of issues trying to run the game properly until after about a couple of hours of searching and testing I managed to find the right settings and was finally able to play the game but even then the gameplay felt choppy and not particurarly pretty. Even with everything turned on the game doesn't look great. Finally online is a ghost town... Basically no one is playng and it is a shame because the game isn't bad but it is unrefined. However it's only the first installment in this series of games so I think I can give the devs a break because the game in it's core is quite a lot of fun and definetely worthy of my money!			"

												Is this game good? Yes... at sale price.The pros of this game is the basic gameplay, it's a really fun hybrid of arcade and sim that really nails the balance. It reminds me alot of the old MotoGP game from the early 2000s that leaned more towards sim racing. It has a good variety of bikes, could have used more tracks and variants to keep things fresh as you play.Now the problem is the content, it really isn't anything to write home about. It very much feels like a 90s game where gameplay was pretty much what you got. I'm comparing to modern racers where there is more than just racing. Think of that Gride game where there was a progression from season to season. Think of games like NFS shift (that this game borrows from a bit) where you had different categories you raced in. Yes you kind of have it in this where you race in different classes but it's not as well done. Think of how much customisation you get nowadays.Basically this is a nice game but quite bland. There aare still some bugs and glitches but nothign that broke gameplay or crashed the game for me. It's all just unpolished and could use more game modes and content.			"

												I don't know, initial shock came from the STEEP learning curve, even with all easy options on, this game can punish you for any and all mistakes (You can use the rewind function without penalty to your winnings and 7th place still nets decent reward money). BUT, soon as you push on and practice and get better and start winning, this game is very rewarding and fun! Uh take special note though, until your skills have increased, pay attention to the lead bike during the race and what they're riding, then get the same bike and upgrade the heck out of it, and winning will become more manageable, don't just go for your favorite manufacturer (Yamaha, much love for you, but the MV Agusta destroys the FZ-07 in the straights, got to beat em' in the turns). Like, srsly the starter bike is the naked class, and if you get a twin, all the triples (Friggin MV Agusta) for the first tier races will SPANK you. There is still a decent reward even for 7th place wins while you get practice to get better, but SRSLY pay attention to what the leader is riding and the bike stats when you are buying. Rest of the races are fairly well balanced and there is a lot to Unlock, plenty of tracks, and plenty of race types. I am enjoying it! Also, get used to the Turning/Rider mechanics, even with a far inferior bike you can beat em' in the turns!			"

												Best game in the genre imo. 8.5/10I have been a biker for over 20 years, owned Harley Sportster 883 to Rice Burners and find the game to be a good balance as its more sim but has some arcade appeal. Riding down the nice scenic roads with a few friends was nice and this has that feel.The bikes seem accurate. I finally got to ride a Ducati Monster! You can upgrade your bikes with some events or grinding, they also have the option of renting tons of supersport bikes for free if you want to test them out without earning credits which is good. Tons of custom upgrades too. The competition of course increases or rides the same type of bikes making it harder since you have a less margin of error with faster bikes. Wish it had a few more tracks though, esp roads since motogp has very similar the tracks and gameplay.PROS: +Just enough tracks and nice scenic roads to cruise (could use more).+Good balance sim/arcade for casual fun but ample realistic elements+Ample bikes (some grinding for credits required), upgrades and features (front/back braking for differ impacts) You can't brake or excellerate hard in a turn without wiping out. You can turn too hard while going too slow either which is fairly accurate.Ride is very similar to Motogp15 which is also made by Milestone, so they seem to have a decent formula and by simply making a few changes, but that is mostly just race-tracks with limited scenerey so can all seem the same after awhile. Glad they made this with some nice roadways rather than all racetracks.CONS: I had some tech issues with Ride and motogp 14 on my last pc which was just below the specs, but thought I could lower the graphics quality however it froze my pc for some reason. So its not optimized the best since many AAA games played on it fine. So ensure you exceed the specs..These are my first impressions, 8 of 10 since this genre has limited options and junk like the game motorcycle club all should steer far away from. If you like bikes go to the rallies in Daytona Beach, NYC, Rott in Austin, TX etc, nice time with ladies, bikes and fun.			"

Having said that playing it without vsync on and trying to use radeon controls center to lock the framerate it still felt very sluggish. I was hoping for a decent bike game for what I paid on offer but alas absolute buggery.The configuration settings before running the game don't work, at all.

												If you're looking for a motorcycle racing game, look elsewhere. Simply put, ride just isn't very good.There are loads of problems with this game, from poor optimization to a very clunky interface. The worst thing, however, is the fact that the motorcycles just don't feel very fast or exciting.Having owned and been on several motorcycles I can tell you that real motorcycles feel much faster, and sound much better. Now I'm not suggesting that this game should completely replicate the experience, but at the very least they can get the sound right.			"

												This game is awesome.  This is basically the only street bike racing game besides the motogp series which id rather not spend money on.  I love riding motorcycles so im naturally going to like this game.  The riding is a little hard to get used to but you will get it in a few hours of playing.  Sure there are some things that are dumb and ridiculous but most games now-a-days are basically all unfinished games for top dollar. It is a little dumb you can smash on your front brake while your full lean and still able to have full stable contact with the ground.  Full lean on grass or sand is possible for some reason.  The biggest thing wrong this game has is the sounds of the motorcycles.  Theyre all basically generic stock muffler sound even though you straight piped your bike, and all the bikes basically run off the same sound with very very minor differences.They have Drag Racing in this game which is incredibly pointless. As long as your bike is fully upgraded you will win every time. Besides all that this game is fun as hell. I really don't understand why this game has so many down votes.  Sure there are flaws (what game is perfect?) but this game is completely playable and you hardly notice these flaws.8/10			"

												Is it perfect? No, it has issues. But I've not experienced anything game breaking, and ultimately I found RIDE incredibly enjoyable. In a world where the last ""Forza/GT but with bikes"" came out 10 years ago, you have to overlook what I feel a minor inconveniences and enjoy a rare release. Having played a lot of Milestone's previous bike games (all the way back to EA Sports Superbike 2001) probably helps, as they have made incremental improvements to what I feel is a rock solid riding model. Sure, its not GP Bikes, but there's a reason why no mainstream release has tackled simulating the weight shifting/countersteering that it takes to truly ride a bike, its an extra level of complication that would simply be a very large barrier for some people to overcome to find enjoyment. But all the right elements are there, braking points, lean angle and throttle application. A hold-trigger-to-go arcade racer its not. The knock against Milestone is they barely supported this game, with limited fixes and some incredibly content light DLC, and seemingly they are moving on to producing a sequel. So I can understand peoples' grievances in this regard for a self-published title (where a developer would usually be subjugated to the whims of a 3rd party publisher)I recommend this game with caveats; if you have a grunty system, and an affinity for bikes (or Milestones' previous bike sims). However I don't recommend getting anything more than the basic release, and if money's tight or you simply have a passing interest, wait for a sale.			"

												Yeah, I like this game. It reminds me of Tourist Trophy (PS2) but, dare I say, with less motorcycles. I would like to see some of the bigger bikes in a DLC, for example the Honda Blackbird, the Suzuki Hayabusa and the Kawasaki ZX1400. Maybe even some classic 6 cylinders! Some motards / super motards would also be great fun. Overall, this is a fun game with superb graphics. The modding options are impressive as well - you are able to change quite a few parts on your motorcycle, and your rider can be largely customized as well. Tracks are ample, the only downside is that the vehicle list needs to be expanded. A great effort, well worth playing it.			"

												Fun, but only in short bursts. Took several hours to pick up the controls, then tried returning it (was not able to). I would recommend this game, but would not at its current $40 mark. This is worth waiting to purchase on sale, however.			"

												I actually recommend it especially if you love bikes. The personalization on this game is quite insane. I love playing it even when it lags terribly i still comeback and play it. I bought it because i love bikes and it was on sale for 50%. I wouldn't pay it full price. There are bad sides as well like frame drops in certain parts of the track, and min. specs are too high for a motorcycle game.My specs;Intel core i3-3217U @ 1.80 GHz (4 CPUs)4 GB RamNvidia GeForce GT 635MYa see, i dont have even maybe half of the min. specs but i still gain my hours with this game because it is that enjoyable. but again, if you want a near-perfect motorcycle game you'll just have to skip this one.

												I ride motorcycles.  Canyons every Sunday and occassional  trackdays.  I have played MotoGP since 2007.  I recently purchased MotoGP 14 for xbox and it was ok.  I personally think Ride is the best motorcycle game I've played.  I really like this game.  The graphics are good enough and the handling is pretty good.  Playing on realistic difficulty actually gets my heart rate up.  Very challenging, but fun.  I would recommend this game if you love motorcycles.  Now if someone would make a handlebar controller my life would be complete!  How in 2015, has no one made a controller for motorcycles?			"

												Here is my ratings with a summary of each:Graphics 7.5/10 PROS: BIKES are b-e-a-utiful and the motorbike gear great especially the helmet visor. Cons: Pretty much everything other than the bike/rider/gear, the enviromnent is pretty poor with a total lack of atmosphere due to the substandard graphics of the crowd, track and lighting. This makes the game feel like more of a showcase than a racing game.Gameplay 6.4/10Pros: The ability to use an ""in helmet view"" is awesome as well as the settings to change the ""physics"" of the bike (easy, medium and hard to be put simply). The amount of customization for both the bike and rider is decent with a hint of riding personalisation that comes with the ""stance"" of your rider that can be customised in the settings.Cons: CONTROLLER SUPPORT. The deadzone for controllers is rediculously small. Yet again its another bike game where the movement of the bike does NOT fit in with the movement of the stick sitting on your thumb. The AI is boring to play against almost like exact copies of each other with no variation in riding styles. The online system to sign up is confusing and I actually had to go into the forums to work out how to play online (Next gen?). There is much more but tbh I cannot be bothered writting it. I love motorbikes and have been a rider since I was a kid, razed by a family or riders. So if you love bikes you might enjoy this game for that reason. But if bikes are not your passion and you just want a racing game. Don't waist your money here :)			"

												I'd recommend the game because when it works, it's great. HOWEVER, there is a major bug in this game that you should watch out for. Corrupted save games. ****MAKE BACKUP'S OF YOUR SAVEGAME.**** ( default location C:\Users\*****\AppData\Roaming\Milestone\Ride\Saves)Now, about the game and gameplay:I play on max graphics with a controller and fom 1st person view, and it's great. It feels fast, it feels smooth, it feels, well, realistic. Keep in mind it's not realy a simulator, but you can get pretty close to it.The graphics are good, as long as you don't stand still. (who stands still in a race game anyway??...) The bike models and textures look amazing. The surroundings when you're racing aren't that detailed, and look more like they belong in a 2006 game, than in a 2015 game. However, when you're shooting by at 200+km/h, combined with the motion blur, I personally never realy got bothered by it. Eyes on the road, not the flowers right?Oh, and have a compilation, race and some (read: a whole truckload of) screenshots .

												OMG. A good game about my favorite activity in the world. I'm buying a new motorcycle after a long break because of this game. Not many games can strike me to do something so major.However, despite owning a excellent machine, I still get a few rare laggy moments on this game when taking a turn and on a game like this, that is death and can ruin the last 5 minutes of work and is exceptionally fustrating.But if you like motorcycles, it is defintely worth it.

												As another reviewer mentioned already, this game is clearly unfinished. It's a blatant port from a console version and here's everything wrong with it:No controller support for g25/27 steering wheelsKeyboard controls are terrible and need to be reprogrammed every time you restart game (no way to save them)On my PC with two GTX 770s in SLI and an 8350 processor, this game stutters like MAD, making it virtually unplayableUpon closing the game, the only way to re-open it is to use task manager to close steam first, and then restart everything because the game is still shown as ""running."" This happens even if you use the menus to exit the gameThat's it for now, and I've only had the game for a day.. Virtually un-playable and I highly do not recommend it.			"

												Had to buy this one being an motorcyclist and wanting support games, which are rare to find about them. Generally speaking it's ok to good game, but it definitely has it's flaws. First is graphics. They do look good ingame, but optimization is quite poor, because it really isn't that ""special"" looking game. Also very rushed feel comes from ie. loading screens with are hilariously poor looking compared to other parts of game. Gameplay wise it's mixed bag. I was expecting it to be more simulation as I recall very old SuperBike games from Miles being (they were excellent). This is however isn't luckily build with completely arcade feel. But I started with ""simulation"" settings with first class bikes and where struggling to get races through at the beginning as races felt quite hard for me. Then managed to finish this class I could buy one of the most fastest bikes in game, tune it pretty much and it was very big surprise as races in this superbike class felt dirt easy if player has even slight control of gas.Oh yeah, and being enthusiast aimed game. WHERE THE HELL IS IOMTT?!? I would give this 9/10 IF it would include IOMTT track. With out it I'll give RIDE and solid 7/10Please, please add IOM track as and DLC. I though I'd never say that, but I'll buy it immediately :)			"

												""The hardest tracks are ones you most lack confidence and the easiest are ones you are most confident/comfortable with. Because when you lack confidence you tend to go slower but if you're comfortable you go full out because you know how to handle the track. You don't hold back since you're not afraid of crashing and all the adrenaline/excitement rushes in because you can go full out. You dominate the race and are ahead of everyone else. Yet, you get the feeling that you want to 'overtake' every section of the track itself. It's no longer about beating the competition, you're the competition"" -Me on Ride gameplay.I was foreign to the world of motorbikes because I never able appreciated riding one. I played one of the first motogp game in around 2000 and I loved the game very much though. Recently, I tried Milestone's MotoGP14 and despite the lack of support for the game I loved it! I still think riding a motobike is a dangerous and risky business but I can appreciate the thrill and freedom of bike riding.All this brought me to RIDE. I almost passed on buying until I saw a youtube video clip showing a tuned bike excellently ridden.Now that I have tried RIDE, I want to share my opinion of the game to help you decide. Overall, the game is good especially if you're a motorbike lover. However, it still lacks tracks to race in in my opinion. The game forces you to start with one of 3 naked bikes and I thought it was rather uncool to force you to start with a specific type of bike. That being said, the progression until you buy a new bike that you like is quick and I now have realized that naked bikes aren't that bad actually.The game allows you to buy parts for your bikes from aesthetic parts to performance enhancing ones. It also allows you to customize your rider avatar's face and gears (apparel) as well.The game feels easy to play even with pro physics and no assists especially if you compare it to MotoGP 14. It could be because the bikes are slower than those in MotoGP. But this brought a more arcade feeling to the game than Milestone's MotoGP 14.Other than the lack of tracks the only other gripe I have is the inability to select the number of laps in any race we participate in (with the exception of online games).Do note that there's no weather in game neither is day/night setting. I think every track is set to certain pre-programmed time setting. Milestone has a habit of giving you just good enough game without trying to make it really superb.Online is enjoyable too with stangers or even more with friends.UPDATE 2 APRIL 2015Now that I have spent more on the game I have more to share.The difficulty of the game increases as you upgrade from lower powered bikes to higher ones. Riding a supersport bike may be too easy compared to riding a motoGP bike in Milestone's other game but riding a modern superbike is not so easy. In fact it can feel a bit too difficult. That is until you adapt to the changes.Wheelie and stoppie happen a lot when you ride a bike with respectable horsepower unless you turn anti wheelie option to full (modern bikes have that tech actually!). Wheelie forces you to go easy on the throttle thus slowing you down despite  the bike's increased power rating. Opening up on the throttle aggresively will slow you down as your bike performs unintended wheelies. Furthermore, the game has its fair share of bugs and performance issues. Custom bike settings are not remembered forcing you to load your bike setting before every race which is annoying.Stutters can happen if you set the VRAM to auto which is the default setting.The game crashes to desktop when you try to  exit and sometimes when loading it just freezes although the likely occurence of the later is not that high.Perhaps one of the most annoying bug is that rewind doesn't always work and when it doesn't it costs you the race thus in-game money, prestige and REAL free timeUPDATE 3 April 2015Just want to add that many people mention the sounds of the bikes are not that good but to me ithey are decent enough. When you use helmet view, sounds are muffled a bit which is very nice and thoughful. You could also hear the whizzing of air past you....which is also muffled if you're in helmet view. Each bike sounds distinct enough although you can't quite immerse yourself in the feeling of raw power when hearing your engine purring and roaring as you race. But the sounds are decent enough.One of the best things in Ride is the inclusion of older bikes. These are a thrill to ride and race. You get to understand the advancement in motorbike technology as you try bikes from different eras. Most of the older bikes are from the mid 1990s and all throughout the first decade of the 21st century. Bike lovers will understand that they are riding not to show off or to indulge their prestige/ego by riding an expensive sport bike but for the enjoyment and thrill of riding it. Thus, being able to race these older bikes is awesome.Overall, this is a fun game and that's all that matters. Yes it is easier than Milestone's previous MotoGP 14 game but it's way more fun.UPDATE MULTIPLAYERThe multiplayer part is a blast in this game. It's made in such a way that your own riding is not affected by the ping response to the host. Your fellow players may rubber band if you have bad ping to the host but your experience of the race is flawless. This made it such that your result is almost not affected by the quality of your ping to the host's pc.It's a lot of fun playing with other people. And way safer too. ;)			"

												(EN)  (PL)As someone on YT said, this game is like if forza met bikesWelll. mainly graphics are bad1) PlayabilityBetter than motogp (as for me) , even though its just motogp 14 with different bikes and tracks, not only track going ones, and different tracks (more street type stuff). Great bike customization, as well as rider (shitloaaaddd of wear, ex. helmets, gloves).2) GraphicsAs for graphics....WEELLL, at least its optimization is fine (almost), running on my860m 4gb on ultra (only motion blur off), on 4096x2160 at around 24fps (not much, but as for a game this type, its fine ""this aint a fps, just a race game)As for 1920x1080, fps is very stable, my gpu even clocks down and locks at 48fps (48hz monitor)As for the worst part of graphics, even though i put it on ultra, with ""high res textures"" and with 4k res, lot of the textures dont even look like theyve tried FULLHD, even menus are pixelated (like loading screen), tectures like for ex. brake fluid cap are just MASSIVLEY pixelated3)PhysicsFor the physics, this thing is ok, but not great (hard to make a bike sim) in reality biking is a bit different, but u can get used to the game. The worst part is the wheelie factor. Yeah, it is there, but...well..uhm.. its pretty bad, even in pro physics.4)Bugs... The main reason i give this a 9/10, they isnt much bugs, but when they just start giving a notice, you'll have a hard time. The game worked pretty fine, but from some time, it stopped working (loading a track takes for everrr)So, pros and cons:+Fun factor+Not only track bikes+Customization of the bikes, and rider+ Smaller bikes (250cc)Cons:-price (20 euro compared to 5 euro for Motogp 14, as in my place of living)- dlc price- dlc (basicly the same bikes, but 2015)- buggines- poor optimization Mediums:~overall graphics~physics (those weelies :/ )(PL)Jak ktoś na YT powiedział, ta gra jest jak gdyby forza spotkała motocykleWięcc. głównie grafika jest zła1) GrywalnośćLepsza niż MotoGP (jak dla mnie), choć jej tylko motogp 14 z innymi motorami i torami , nie tylko torowe (więcej typowo ulicznych modeli). Wielkie możliwości dostosowanie motocykli, a także kierowcy (shitloaaaddd ubrań, np. Kaski, rękawice).2) GrafikaCo do grafiki ....więc, przynajmniej jej optymalizacja jest w porządku (prawie), działa na mojej 860m 4gb na ultra (tylko motion blur wyłączony), w 4096x2160 przy około 24fps (nie dużo, ale jak na grę tego typu, jest w porządku , to nie FPS, tylko gra wyścigowa)Co do 1920x1080, fps jest bardzo stabilny, nawet moja grafa obniżyła taktowanie i zablokowała się przy 48fps (monitor 48Hz)Najgorsze w grafice to to że, chociaż i ustawię ją na ultra, z ""High Res textures"" i 4k res, dużo tekstur nawet nie wygląda jakby próbowały być FullHD, nawet menu jest spikselowane (jak i ekran ładowania), textury jak np. przykrywkapojemnika płynu hamulcowego to tylko MASYWNE piksele3) FizykaJeśłi chodzi o fizykę, to gra jest w porządku, ale najlepsza (co prawda ciężko wyprodukować symulator motocyklowy). W motocyklowej rzeczywistości jest nieco inaczej, ale tu można przyzwyczaić się do gry. Najgorszy jest czynnik wheelie (jazdy na kole). Tak, to jest tam, ale ...cóż..ehm .. jest bardzo zła, nawet w fizyce pro.4) Bugi ... Głównym powodem, dla którego daje to 9/10, że nie ma wiele błędów, ale gdy po prostu rozpoczną swoje działanie, będziesz mieć trudny czas. Gra działa całkiem dobrze, ale od pewnego czasu przestała działać (ładowanie toru trwa do wiecznośććć)Więc Tak, plusy i minusy:+ Czynnik Zabawy+ Nie tylko motocykle torowe+ Dostosowanie motorów, i kierowcy+ Mniejsze motory (250cc)Wady:Cena (80zł w porównaniu do 20zł za MotoGP 14)- Cena dlc- Dlc (w zasadzie te same motory, ale 2015)- Błędy- Słaba optymalizacjaPośredniki:~ ogólna grafika~ fizyka (ta :jazda na jednym"" :/)			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, EVEN FOR 10$.What a terrible game. Where to even start. Let me start with my background. I am a sim racing fan and I ride a sport bike and motocross in real life. I also play all other types of games. If you enjoyed tourist trophy, then keep playing it. It is WAY better than this game. If you don't like sim games, then still don't play this game. It is just THAT bad. RIDE is no where near a motobike sim and is still bad at being an arcade racing game.Cons:-Limited controller key mapping. You HAVE to assign every button and it HAS to be on the controller. Normally not a problem but if you are familiar with bike racing games you know how important this can be. Also you can't change buttons after you have started a race. You have to quit and go back to the main menu.-Horrible physics, no high sides, no low sides, bikes don't feel heavy at all. No side to side leaning.-twitchy turning, as soon as you touch the stick the bike twitches then gets a bit smoother after, but just feels totally wrong. Even if you barely touch it.-TERRIBLE performance. 980ti with major lag and frame drops. ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING ME. And the graphics aren't even good. Feels like I'm playing a mobile game.-Sound is also terriblePros:-real bikes-menu music is ok I guess-just filling in these bullet points, really there is nothing good about this game.WHAT A JOKE OF A GAMEREFUNDED.

												It's odd of all the bad review, i've had none of the shutter problems or game deletion. I actually own a ride a BMW S1000rr and when i first picked up the controller and had a go at it, I was like this doesn't handle anything like a bike. Until I actually took the time to really learn the controls, then it all set it. Push hard to the side and you drop the bike hard into the corner like a real bike, I do beleive you have to take off the braking assist and TC to medium to get any good feel from the bike . If you do this you should really enjoy the game, the Brake assist breaks to much before a corner and while you are comming out of a corner. Try this game if you love bikes its a hoot.			"

												Great game!All the bikes I have had in real life so far I can ride again in this fantastic racing game.Good physics and controls. I do recommend a controller like X-Box, that works really well.Graphics are good and the bikes look like the real ones.Sound could be a bit better, but that doesn't do anything negative to the fun I have with this game.In order to be successful, you need to find a good line and be precise on the throttle.I have read some negative reviews here with some people having performance problems. I haven't found any game breaking ones so far. Some tracks do have a little lag while curving 90 degrees and more, but it is not so bad that it would really matter.I highly recommend this game to any biker out there! Thumbs up!!!			"

												My new rule is any game that involves jumping through firey hoops to get working automatically gets a bad review. This is one of those such cases. Kinda like GTA IV.There really are no excuses. There's hundreds of games that come out all the time that work fine on all types of computers... There is no reason one should have to go on a hunt for the Holy Grail just to get the framerate normal and eliminate input lag. No reason at all.The racing itself can be fun, albeit difficult. I was first turned onto this game from the PS4 demo (and should I have stuck with the console version?) then got it on here and the headache started.And once you do get it running it's got some design flaws. I don't usually complain about loading screens but why is there the need to interupt the loading screen to ask you to confirm the bike you want to ride that you already confirmed earlier, just to go back to the same loading screen for the same amount of time again? And this is on top of the other loading screen that doesn't look like a loading screen that can make one wonder if their game is frozen up.Anyway, just take a look at the reviews... Apparently there's also some save problems and other issues running rampant that haven't been fixed. This game's a mess and I would recommend avoid or stick with the console version or try a cracked version (I ain't afraid to say that in cases like this cause this is ridiculous).			"

												Wow what an amazing game! I ride a 2012 yzf-r6 as a weekend toy and this game is the closest I have ever played that comes close to the real thing. It can teach a lot of basic things like having a good roll on and learning to lean early into a turn, braking control and learning how to manage a wheelie. You start off wanting all the electronic assists on but end up using a RAW 2014 HP4 or YZF-R1 Race edition and feel like a Moto Gp Pro. I love this game but no where near as much as the real thing, but if you don't ride it will give you the itch like nothing I have ever played. Lol I am looking at getting a liter bike asap because I love riding the 2014 R1 in this game so much. So play this as a toy but take the MSF course and get a license for the real thing if you want the true experience.			"

												Game have lots of potential but is not even close to some other titles for car enthusiast. Clearly they want to do something spectacular and they change mind in the middle. But as I said if some flows will be addressed, especially technical mistakes regarding to bikes, ill be happy. At the moment is fine but for rider/motorcyclist something will be missing. For example; tuning bike is ok but some models already have top suspension or wheels and there is no point to do that. There is nothing about ""riding modes"" which quite few bikes have and would be nice to have them in the game for sake of authenticity. Engine as graphics could be much better. Is nowhere near CoD or Forza and I can't set it any higher so it's not hardware problem.And sound. Sound of bikes is not even close to the real life, I understand that all of those problems can be resolved with money, so hopefuly after success of this game the sequel will be much better.			"

												before you read any bad reviews read this one. after playing for about 30 minutes your probably going to want to quit out of frustration from the fact that the game is hard as hell. im a play with all the assists off kinda guy and am just saying to get all of the immersion you can, its better in any game(sim) to drive in the cockpit(helmet)cam. the problem is if you are a casual gamer you will not understand this game. like alot of simulators you have to be into it.note the graphics arent assetto corsa but there not rubbish iether if you play games for just the looks go watch a race on tv there is more to a sim then looks. i suggest this game to anyone who expects to look at physics more then comparing graphics to assetto corsa....i know i cant be the only one who drives fine on hard ai with no assists. the handling and overall physics are pretty nice compared to previous 2 wheeled games, but you will still find yourself hitting other riders at great speeds and not falling, or massive high siding recoverys			"

												First a disclaimer of sorts. I very much like motorcycles, I try to play every bike game possible and I also ride a bike in real life. It is not possible to make a motorcycle simulator where you steer by using keyboard or pad or wheel. Seriously. That's why when I play a bike game I'm looking for good physics and good fun. And Milestone almost always delivers.The bad :* horribad optimization, my GT 560 SLI barely runs it on low in windowed 1280x720* crashes once in a while* few pants and boots selection for your rider* often you just cannot win without the best bike with the best setupThe good :* lots of pretty bikes* good selection of rider gear* bike customization* game is FUNIn short, think Gran Turismo with bikes. The physics seems ok, the bikes look very very nice and there is some short info about every single one. The environment is not top notch, but at 200kph it rarely matters. If you like bikes give it a try, preferably on PS4...			"

												ALot of modern and classic bikes. Lets be honest, there isnt too many good motorcycle games on the market but this is one of the better ones. Not buggy like Milestones other games, this ones acually works.The graphic are amazing, and the rider detail is the best Ive seen in any motorcycle game to date. The sound of the bikes could be alot deeper, dont get me wrong all the bike sounds unique but the game is lacking that deep rumble you get after upgrading to a proper exhaust.The handling of the bike feel really good although the bikes feel like they drift more then a real bike would under heavy stand up braking, but not a huge problem.I love the game, its basically Forza for motorcycles. I am hoping for more tracks in future DLC.			"

												Much more in depth than any other entry in this genre. Milestone's understanding of bike physics shows well here. It's every bit the game we've been waiting for and is miles better than the last attempt by any dev at making a ""Motorcycle Gran Turismo"" This is a game that needs to succeed because it's definitely making all the right moves and moving in the right direction as far as translating and showing the Riding experience as well as a PC game can portray. The bikes present are very well modelled and detailed and vary enough that their real life personalities shine through.It was 100% worth the purchase and a must own for anyone even remotely interested in 2 wheeled motorsports			"

												TL;DR; Ride is really fun. Scratches my virtual motorcycle riding itch.Long story; the gameplay is fine, not mind blowing. Feels like a bike version of GRID, which isn't a terrible thing. Boiling the individual bike's characters down to a 0-10 scale feels misguided though. The s1000rr just is stupendously faster than most of the other bikes of it's era. That isn't really captured correctly. The actual mechanics of riding feels super correct. You wheelie / slide hammering the throttle out of corners. You lock up the front if you get on the brakes too hard into a corner. The body position feels correct. I would love more open maps / tracks. I would also love if they had the Isle of Mann course (!!).If you love bikes, definitely buy. If you like racing games, maybe buy. Try the demo first.			"

												Very entertaining and pretty game, I whish I hadn't read so many bad reviews initially, because the game itself is very decent, although there might be some minor issues, pricing of some dlc's mostly though. Also, there aren't many tracks available, but the tracks that are there are done quite well. There are a lot of variations available though, which amounts to some 20+ tracks to race. I can't say how diverse the base game is when it comes to the bikes though, because I bought the game with 2 dlc's when it was on sale, and I must say that there are plenty bikes available (however, 4 euro's for just 3 bikes is kind of expensive imho).All in all it's a good game, much to do and if you like motor race games this is certainly a title I would recommend.

												So far, I've got o say Ride hit the mark on a niche role that the MotoGP games weren't filling.Pros: -Over 100 bikes-Over 400 different paint jobs-from 390-1200cc bikes -Naked bikes/sports/supersports/superbikes/track bikes/prototypes-The actual gameplay feels smooth (when you use correct graphic settings)-Can change things like fender eliminators and mirror elminators, tires, lever colors, triple clamp colors.-Rider gear can be custumized from helmet (they even have my skin of the AGV K3), gloves, boots, suits, pants, and jackets-Riding position can be made custom, and that's really cool little feature for me personally-You can REALLY feel the difference in bikes. Went form an R6 600cc bikes to the Ducati Penigale 1199s, and it took about 5-8 races for me to actually get used to the feel of the Duc. I power wheeied up several times, hit the throttle too hard out of corners and slid out. Things I was doing that aren't always good practice (powering early out of turns, opening wide up in lower gears) were fine on the R6, but on the Duc, double the power it was very clear that I had to race much cleaner. Cons:-I feel the ""Racing Line"" they have is a tad off at times, there's definitely points where I can clearly break after it tells me to/lines that are more optimal to take wide/short. Looking at you Road America-The racing line isn't always clear on when to lean, Often times I can go early to get a jump on the apex. While other times if I turn when it wants me to I'll come up short on the turn.-The starting bikes are incredibly lopsided. I went with the 636 Monster, and it was a clear loser to the speed triple. I struggled very much to even finish on the podium with the Ducati. But when I started over, with the triple, it was a walk in the park to finish top.-I don't feel the tracks are varied enough in world tour mode. I've seen Road America, Imola, and Miami plenty of times. I've only seen Wales once, and yet to see Sierra Nevada. -I wish they did more with the salt flats track, It's a big relaxer to just drag it up, but I think they could do a little more with it. Maybe a mode where you try to beat your top speed?-Bike damage is nonexistant, I'd like to see a hardcore mode.Overall, I think Ride is shaping up to be the niche motorcycle riders, enthusiants, and race enthusiants are looking for. However, there are minor tweaks that need to be made, and some content as far as tracks go I'd love to see added (Isle of Man TT [PLEASE, even if it's just a segement of the track] , Leguna Seca, Catalunya, Mugello).For now, I'd give it an 8/10, hopefully Milestone actually sticks with this to provice patches, and new content.For $40, I'd say it's definitely a save bet for any motorcycle rider.

Sure there are not many tracks but all the tracks look really nice. The details on the bikes are just gorgeous! I want later on buy myself a real bike and now that I play this game I got so much more respect for all the bikers out there.

												Amazing, hom much potential is wasted with that game.The first glance is guite nice. Grafx look nice, but a closer look reveals, the background details are pretty poor. No intro video, no fancy visual efx. But, that's ok. Driving feels very good. Probably the most realistic motor bike driving expierence in a game for me so far. Compared to MotoGp15 the sounds did get a little better, at least  the cbr1000 sounds like ok and gives the player a slight feeling of having 200 Hp under your balls hammering. Unfortunately the Ducati 1199 sounds like an c64 emlation on an iphone 3. As many players mentioned before, it's all about the importance of realistic sounds, and that's what have not been taking care of with RIDE.  The game is fun though ""ok to play"" , but definately needs some polishing.The bikes look awesome. Tuning and setting is pretty cool.  The menu structure seems unfinished and buggy. No game servers or other players of online game available when I tried. No website available (Ride 2 only) Couldn't find any official info of this 1 year old game.No updates! Worth 40€? I don't know. The game could be so much better with 5 % more development.It's actual state is more like a 15 -20  Euro beta. But right now, it's still the best game on the market.Let's see, what Ride 2 Demo brings us. "

												Bought this game when it went on sale from 40 to 10 bux. Game is not worth the 10 bux I paid. Contolls are absolutley horrible. Driving and races are way to hard. You can be driving at 2 mph and bump into a guard rail and it will throw your off your bike?!?!? You basically have to complete each race with perfection in order to win. They over thought this one, they took the fun out of racing.			"

												This game, is a real shame. It had such an oppurtunity to be a fantastic game, unfortunately, it's fallen flat on it's face. Let me explain, now, Ride, as you might guess is a production motorbike racing game. Something I have been wanting for ages. The problems start at the thing the game is about, motorbikes. Or the lack there of. ***CONS***- Now we have some bikes on here for sure, don't get me wrong. But we are missing some essentials. Hayabusa, ZXR1400, etc. The bigger bikes. - The sounds of the bikes. Some are pretty good, others? Crap. I mean really, really bad. The 2 strokes? They sound like a smaller 4 stroke. Annoying. - Stuttering, low FPS around corners. It runs at 60FPS constant until it suddenly decides to dip to around 10. Usually happens when going around corners. RIG:Intel i5 4670KGTX 6908GB 1866Mhz bla bla bla- Sometimes you come off for no reason. It just happens. You'll be flung off your bike, for apparently no reason. No idea why, but you do.- Menu's are not good. Pretty ugly, slow, not very well laid out.- Small one, but very annoying for me, changing your exhaust doesn't effect the sound of the bike at all.- The AI seem almost impossible to knock off, where as you come off very easily.- The walls can sometimes just push you off your bike even if you aren't touching them.- You cannot practise, or even qualify for a race. You are straight into it. This is so annoying.- Not much customization for bikes. When you first play it, it seems like a lot. But then you realise, most of it is the same for every bike. I'd like more exhausts, own decals, racing fairing, that sort of thing.But now the good bits.***PROS***- The ability to change your ride style. How far you lean, how far you tilt your head, the lot.- Being able to change your kit.- There is nothing else like it. The closest is Tourist Trophy back on PS2.TL;DRI don't like it.			"

												1 of the best motorcycle racing sims ive played in a very long time (sonce tourist trophy matter of fact). The controls are easy and feel realistic even though ive never once driven a bike. The AI are intelligent, and depending on the difficulty you set them too sometimes TOO intelligent. The tracks are challenging, and the mix of traditional races and challange races are refreshing as well. If you love the Forza Motorsport series and also love sport bikes definitely give this a try.			"

												Alright.. this game is good, but only if you can get it for a cheaper price, I got it for £15 during the summer sale. At it's current price it really isnt worth it.Good points:- You can feel the weight of the bikes- Great customization- Good amount of makes of models of bikes in the game- Tracks are good- Plenty of races to do over the World Tour with all the different types of bikes- Lots of fun to just go and do wheelies and stunt with the bikes Bad points:- From what I've seen from other reviews, seems to be a problem with file loss, not had this problem YET- Not very well optimised for lower end PCs (Seems to work well on mine w/ GTX 760, AMD FX-4350, 8GB RAM)- Does suffer from some random FPS drops here and there, not been a massive problem for me though- AI is a bit hit and miss, some times there really easy to beat, other times it's like you are racing Valentino Rossi.. (might just be my bad driving though)Overall this game is a lot of fun for any keen motorcyclists, probably one of the best motorbike games I've played, only buy this game if you can get it for a cheaper price as I mentioned before "

												I've read lots of reviews about Ride being unplayable;  I had to agree with this at first, but after many tweaks and playing with settings I finaly got the game to run moslty trouble free. I had the track detail set to about 3GB and the AA at 2x.  with everythign else set to high. This setting seemed to work well and would jump between 30fps-48ish, with only a few tracks and sections of the game dropping to unplayable fps. I recently installed windows 10 and tried the game again. with everythign set to high and AA at 2x ( for now ) I get a constant 50fps. have played about 7 races on different tracks and had no trouble at all. Defnitely an improvement.The game itself is great. looks beautiful, bikes sound awesome and the game play is fun. If you've had trouble with the game in the past, give it a go with windows 10 and see if that helps. I'm not saying it will make it better, but it appears that way on my system. enjoy,MI ran the game using an fx 6300 / R9 290x,  hopefully that helps you make a judgment on how it may  run with your spec.

												if you've played Fora Motorsport on Xbox. This feels like a poorly executed version of that but in motorbike form. The physics engine is leaning more towards arcade style rather than simulation. The customization aspect seems half ♥♥♥♥♥. AI is boring. Campagin mode is basically 3 lap races on any given track. Dull as hell.Exhaust sounds arent very nice to listen to.This game feels like the guinea pig for them and MotoGP 15 was the real show. And the show sucked i heard. "

												The overall game is well presented and after you set your graphics the game looks very nice, if you don't have a bike racer, then your going to like this one, there are a few issues with the game the reaction of the bike for one banking from one to the other can be slow sometimes and you miss the racing line out of a corner, taking it wide or worse hitting a wall and getting knock off thus the lose of position, which can be frustrating after all that hard work gaining the lead, but up to now enjoying the game.

												The game is looking awesome and is quite fun to play, I also like the bike customisation options and the bike selection. Only thing I miss is the proper tutorial for people who don't know squat about bike racing like me. The in-game tutorial is very short and only explains the game mechanics, but tells you nothing about physics and track racing. I actualy own the bike and ride on it casualy, but obviously have no experience with this type of tyres, riding at top speeds or sharp leaning and I would welcome the game to be more lenient towards amateurs. 9/10 otherwise			"

												A brief analysis:- A could-have-been-better-but-not-bad list of motorcycles:  there are some emblematic bikes, such as the Yamaha YZF R1 and R6, Kawasaki Ninja, Ducati 1199, Honda Fireblade and others, along with some older models like the FZR750R, but the list of available bikes feels somewhat incomplete, especially when compared to Tourist Trophy, which boasted a much more varied list of available vehicles;- On the other hand, RIDE has got a good selection of tracks, with plenty of challenging tracks and well-modeled environments. There are some courses that may be familiar to most racing game aficionados, like Donington Park and Imola, along with original tracks;- Gameplay is OK. Handling feels realistic (and becomes really unforgiving with riding aids turned off), the bikes have a good response to input (some of the more powerful motorcycles may be tricky to control), and there are different camera angles to choose from (dashboard view's the best for riding, in my opinion). However, framerate is very unstable (and too laggy when the screen's crowded; it sometimes gets to a point where this problem actually has the potential of ruining your races) and, sadly, it never reaches the oft-desired 60 frames per second.- Sound is great. The bikes sound like their real-life counterparts, and the ambient sound is also OK. Soundtrack is forgettable, but not bad.Need some high-speed two-wheeled action? RIDE may be the game you're looking for. It has the potential to be onde of the best riding games available once you learn to deal with failures, but it definitely feels like something is missing. If you prefer a wider variety of tracks and vehicles, you should stick with Tourst Trophy instead. - 8/10			"

												Gotta give it to Milestone on this one, this game really hits the fun factor. tons of bikes, not just new but classics too. the physics,graphics,general feel of the game and layout is really satisfying and its guaranteed to please any fellow biker out there. The graphics are absolutely awesome  regarding bike models and ground textures, the enviroment outside the course itself tho is somewhat to be desired, but you buy a bike racing game to race bikes not to look at people in a crowd or a pretty little house. (i have a 4gb card so can use the 4gb textures).The detailed customisation is brilliant too, you can even edit your riding stance completely, change elbow pitch,knee stretch etc.so far i have no complaints and am really enjoying this game. really love all the customisation and it features drag racing which is also awesome!  I certainly hope Milestone use this new approach to MXGP. big thumbs up here Milestone. The user interface however needs to display xbox overlay when you have the controller connected. I recommend this game defo. i just hope Milestone actually continue to update the game tho rather than ALL there previous titles! :) ignore the hater reviews. Just peoplethay don't know how to set their gfx settings properly for milestone games or people that hate milestone and criticise life. The physics are fine when you turn assists off and handle just like the moto gp games. My only gripe is the Xbox overlay not present and lack of clutch! I paid £18 for this tho on   k I n g u I n.netMy rig:I5 4690kMSI GTX 770 4GB16GB RAMIf you struggle with FPS and have an Nvidia card then i can give you my ""Milestone Preset"" which works perfect at 60fps.

Has very realistic handling of bikes, loads and loads of tracks and bikes, and all bikes have loads of upgrades. Physics are great, sand will jacknife you, and grass will make you slide. Tracks cover GP racing tracks like Magny cours for example, drag racing strips like Salt Lake, and Country roads tracks. Best Motorbike game i have ever played. Got it on sale, very happy with it.

												As someone who rides a motorcycle in reality yet can't ride anything bigger than 125cc due to some stupid British law, I figured buying this game would somewhat alleviate the desire for more speed, and it has. Not entirely but to some degree it has. In terms of gameplay this game is fantastic, going round corners at god knows what speed looks and feels awesome, the physics seem lifelike (from what I can tell), and it is genuinely challenging if you turn up the AI difficulty and turn the assists off. Racing in this game is by far the best fun I've had in a video game this year. The only thing that's bad about the gameplay is the godawful engine sounds. The Aprillia RS250 sounds like the various speeds on a marital aid as you go up through the revs, the Suzuki GSXR1000 K5 sounds muffled, as if you've got your ears plugged and all of the V-Twin Ducati's just sound boring. One of the most significant things about a motorcycle is that they resemble what hell would sound like, not what a hairdryer sounds like. Aside's from the barely viable engine sounds, the gameplay is fantastic.The menu's however are not. Sure, the backgrounds are pretty, but the text and text boxes are just bland. Navigating the menu's is like trying to force spaghetti up a cat's backside. I have spent a good 3 out of my current 16.7 hours playing this game sidescrolling left and right, be it trying to choose/upgrade a bike, pick an event or simply change my character's helmet. However, ironically, when you're about to purchase yourself a new motorcycle and you go to pick a manufacturer to choose from, all of said manufacturer's are laid out in a nice, easy to navigate grid menu, yet once you pick your desired motorcycle manufacturer you go back to the slow, dimwitted sidescrolling mess that they call a  menu, it's like being stuck in a world of Soup with only a fork. Why is that simple, easy to use grid menu not implemented in ANY OF THE OTHER MENU'S? So in conclusion, if you manage to make it through the seven levels of menu hell and start a race, you will enjoy yourself. Hopefully they'll improve the engine sounds because right now they barely resemble anything that combusts. TL:DRGameplay is good, apart from the poor engine sounds.Menus are difficult to navigate and as aesthetically pleasing as a small bowl of vomit balanced on Emma Watson's nose.			"

												Despite all the negative reviews, I decided to give this a try..and boy, how wrong these reviews are is incredible! When it comes to the bike models, the level of details and customization, it is a masterpiece. You will spend 80% of the first race just looking at your bike and be impressed, they look awesome! The bikers customization is also on par with many options and gear to choose from. The sounds though..might use some improvements, but they are not as bad to force you stop playing. The ingame options are limited to sound and hud, the rest is either managed by your GPU's control panel or the game's launcher. Overall it is an ARCADE, don't expect super physics, feedback from the tires or anything that could make it feel more realistic or sim-like, it is 100% arcade. They clearly spent all the money on the licenses and the amazingly good looking models and left the gameplay and overall feels somwhere..far from the game xD. I will list the things you will read the most in the negative reviews and try to explain/solve them if possible:FPS drops - Yes, the drops were there when no fps lock was in place, from 120 to 80 on different areas on the same track. As this game is a console port you can't expect it to work over 60 fps without drops. Lock to 60 using your GPU's control panel and you will be fine. It NEVER dropped below 60 for me. Long loading times - Lies. Got the OS on SSD and the game running from a 5900 rpms HDD and it takes like 15 seconds, sometimes less, to start racing. Corrupt saves - As simple as backing up your save after each session. Yes, it is a pain in the ♥♥♥, but if you are a bike nurrrrd and like the game, you won't have any problems with doing a simple copy-paste. Game keeps running in the background. Close Logitech's Profiler and problem solved.Crash on loading screen. Don't press any buttons at all during loading screens and voila, no crashes. Bad AI. I agree, to a certain point. The AI is not bad, it can be a real challenge, specially at the beginning, even more if you go with the Yamaha as your first bike, but from time to time they might act like you are not there, crash into you and force you to either finish in the last positions or restart. It is annoying, yes, but, you can simply avoid them by keeping your distance or using the rewind thingy to go back in time. Xbox controller not working. I am guessing these people were using third party ""xbox"" controllers and they did not work because the original one from MS works pefectly fine. In menus and in races. For 9.99 € it is worth every cent. "

[edit- ran the game on a 4770k @ 4.4ghz with a 980. no fps inprovement. same issues, multiple CTD's)graphics are OK. looks like, Gran turismo 5 but with far less detailed landscapes and tracks... bikes look good. sound like they are from gran turismo....without the backfires though, seriously.""pimp your bike"" want to change the colour of your bike, well you can but it's from a select few liverys. customisation is limited...take off you mirrors, numberplate, change your wheels, colored front brake lines...gta san andreas had a better range.racing is fun, all the tracks are baby butt smooth.. no bumps.. not even rumble strips. this is not a simulator. ai might  jsut aswell be moving roadblocks, they don't give a damn about anything.hardly any bikes really...... no cafe racers, no motards etc...to sum  up..forza 1, on 2 wheels, portrted to pc, with hell expensive dlc.. (3 bikes for $5usd? holy crap...)devs could fix the game easy but they don't appear to listen to feedback or open up mod support.racing is fun, game is addicive if you are usualy the competitive sort with racing games.online race lobby search could really use some more information on where the servers are located and a ping shown as a number, it's pretty fustrating connecting to a server with 3 seconds left till race, then you find out you have a ping of 400 to the other client. .. 4/10buy if it's $20-25if your a biker, and you really want to ride virtual bikes.. this is almost as good as it gets unfortuantly. this game has huge potential but the devloper/publisher don't have a good record in customer satisfaction so don't get your hopes up.-nothing wrong with my pc or my internet. please do not comment with ""amd is ♥♥♥♥ cunt"" all you are proving is that you're a compete philistine. tested on both amd and nvidia gpu'sboth have issues. seems to suffer from alot of memory errors and these- 0x402e0d13 @ 0x00000058i will edit this review as the game is patched and updated. currently it's the first full stable release. feels very much like a beta.

If you've followed the game on Facebook you'll see the ton of customers screaming their pain with no hint of a response from this shocking company!There are no news of patches, i've heard other milestone games are also left to rot by this company.

												At this moment in time I cannot recommend this game for the simple reason your save will be corrupted, not really acceptable on any game let alone 1 that costs £30! When this has been resolved this review will be re-evaluated however wait till this fundamental flaw is resolved before purchasing.Other issues I have currently noted are the ability to stoppie on grass, the rider still uses the clutch for up-shifts when the quickshifter is installed and the tuck feature has little to no effect on aero performance.

												I don't know what the other reviewers were playing but it wasn't this game, it's terrible.Graphics - ok for a console game. I had all settings maxed out and it is very poor in comparison to something like Assetto Corsa. Bike models are obviously where most of the time was spent but everything else, rider, track, trackside objects all look like something from 10 years back. Poor textures no matter how high you set them.Controls - very bad, weight shifting doesn't seem to do anything, no popping wheelies with ease on this game. Holding a button to 'tuck in' seems at odds with the separate controls for weight shifting, surely this is the same as placing your weight over the front wheel?UI - No gamepad overlay, picky but standard in almost every game released these days.I would not waste your money.

Obvious quick port to PC. No social modules for chat, or user interface for mouse selections.This one is a gem that needed more time being cut.With hardly any competition in the 2 wheel market, a polished version of this might have cornered the whole niche.Recommending with a large dose of ""It's far from perfect, but it has good potential.""

Ones rider style has been adjusted to match your own style, your own riding lines are just correct...just like in real life.I don't use any aiding systems, but they are availably. So game can be adjusted between simulation and acrade.I'm very pleased that game features different types of bikes. I love sport bikes, but it's fun to try make decent laptimes  with e.g. XJR1300 (could be nice bike for crusing, but not time attack :) I hope they add more bikes like XJR1300).I ride bikes (mostly sport / track bikes) in reali life, have lot's of experience of riding and I'm bike enthustiatic.

												There are tons of bikes to choose from, and there is so much to do to keep you busy. The bikes sound relatively the same in real life, but if you put an aftermarket can there is no difference which sucks.  The graphics are pretty good, when you get up to speed the whole screen shakes, you can hear the wind which creates a real life feel. There are an overwhelming amount of upgrades that you can do with all of the bikes. Overall I say its worth the money.			"

												I really want to like this game.However... the arcade-feel controls, the lack of customizable control schemes and force feedback, and generally limited venues in which to race pretty much kill the whole 'simulator' vibe that they were clearly going for. Tourist Trophy is still the number one motorcycle simulator... and it was an afterthought. Why are there no good motorcycle games?			"

												tl;dr Game doesn't have any technical issues for me (though I advise doing your own research first), bikes are absolutely beautiful and a joy to ride. Get it if you're a motorcycle fan.Full review: Doesn't honestly deserve the flak it gets. Encountered no save game issues, and the game runs buttery smooth on my rig. The bikes are beautifully modelled and rendered, and the engines sound fantastic on headphones. The tracks pass by fast enough while I'm riding that the supposed lower quality details do not stand out at all. Riders are believable and very well animated, and the amount of control finesse you can get over the bike is huge, from extremely hand-holdy assistance to letting you have full control over the brakes individually, and shifting gears manually.The attention to detail is appreciable especially in the first person helmet view available, it even muffles the engine sound, simulating wearing a full-face helmet. Though no game can really ever come close to capturing the physical aspect of actually riding a motorcycle, RIDE does a respectable job of it. A solid purchase for motorcycle fanatics and riders, in my mind.			"

												Before I purchased this on Steam I had hopelessly waited forever for this game to come out. To me it looked almost identical to Forza Motorsports for motorcycles. Kind of a simulator but designed to have arcade abilities to enable less experienced sim folk to enjoy. Well I eventually give up after a year of watching everyone else get it . Time goes on and I build a PC and sure enough here it is. I get excited and make my purchase. I am ready to delve in to deep upgrades and competitive racing enjoying the real sounding and feeling machines so I thought.   What I will complement them on is the 3rd person view and graphics in most cases seem pretty decent but it ends there. Upon starting the game for the first time I realize that the amount of options to enhance graphics or disable depending on your build was absolutely pathetic. The online doesnt work at all despite it telling you you have created a valid account. It just keeps telling me ""failed to authenticate"" which is dismal to say the least. For the sake of a short""ish"" review I will move on and not get too hung up. Now I am in the game and buy my first bike. The sound is nothing like the real thing and obviously it looks like a stock bike so I head on over to the garage to upgrade and maybe see some info on my bike. By the way the dealership completely sucks. It has no interaction or detail. Its just 5 bar stats going from 0-10 and basic specs. Well inside the parts list I realize there are only oil change, port work in two stages, two brands of exhaust (and obviously Akropovic paid the higher dollar to have their exhaust used here because their exhausts give way more power which is completely wrong in the real world) and wait for it.......... two brands of air filter. The supposive ""customize your machine"" is a load of crock also. You can change brake lines, remove fender eliminator, and pick between usually two to three factory colors for your machine. Not even a paint shop on this game its so plain and empty.  The mechanics of the game seem to be very similar to MotoGP while on the track excluding the tire slippage and spinning are lacking in a realistic way. There is no clutch option at all. The tuning is also a joke. Its pretty much a slider bar for five basic catagories of suspension and a few on and off switches for TCS . I think you are stuck in ABS on .  The boards become old quickly because there isnt many and the ones that are there are just the same things. I also noticed a stock bike on the drag strip is just as competitive as a ""completely modified"" version. Everything costs the same for each bike also. I did notice the prices of the machines are around real world price but because the game gives you money so quickly you are in a top notch machine in less than an hour and no real feeling of any campaign or point system outside of a fake ""world ranking"" they give you that basically moves up a couple spots each time you win a race. The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and bounces off walls or you and loves to cut you off frequently.  Overall guys this game looked to be something huge so my hopes were high and I was completely let down. This felt far more like a demo or BETA than an actual game. I cant believe I paid 65$ for this. I doubt we see a Ride 2. Trust me by taking your money and going back to MotoGP and deal with no real upgrade system. At least then you get real simulation feeling and competitive racing. Overall 5 out of 10.  "

												ok so i put some good hours into this game and i will review this game in a state as of january 2016TECHNICAL and HW - game has been patched.. i play it on two rigs.. one is i7 4790s 16gb ram, gtx 960, SSHD and on i7 3930k six core, 32gb ram gtx 970, SSD, on both rigs game is running insanely well.. well beyond 60 fps and if you dont enable vsync there is no lag whatsoever.. some menu graphical bugs and most annoyingly Suzuki TL 1000 R is kinda bugged and looks grey like it is dirty...crashing.. well yes game crashed on me upon loading screen couple times on both rigs.. nothing dramatic.. in about 20 hrs of run happened 5-6 timesGameplayI LOVE THIS GAME !!! it is so amazing on so many levels for a bike nut like me.. i used to ride sportsbikes and boy this brings back good memories without risk of loosing life :) dont ride anymore sold my last GSXR 750 6 years ago.. so this game lets me relive it all.. thank you milestone for that... u got insane amount of bikes to play with.. all are little different and they ride slightly different...game is difficult.. to really enjoy it you have to learn the tracks to perfection...bigest power for me is not in races with desperately  STUPID AI but in riding alone and just enjoying yourself.. only reason i play carreer is to make money for purchasing bikes.. tuning is nice little touch too but i ride my bikes stock just some exhaust or some little mods here and there.. so i can ride them authentic...controler: well this was the tricky part.. i decided to play on Xbox controler.. but it is so sensitive virtualy unplayable.. so i made my steering stick 3 cm longer with eraser rubber glued on top and surrounded the stick with foam to make little more resistance and it was spot on ! now i can enjoy authenticity unmatched by keyboard...but boy i spent so many hours learning it...Tracks: some fictional are very good.. but all in all not too many of them.. but learning each track spot on takes so much time that replayability of this game is virtualy endles..  i play this game in a hunt for ""THE PERFECT LAP"" so i love it. physics are  + - same as all SBK games from milestone.. i havent played GP but physics are just strong and it feels very authentic...so all you bike nuts out there GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT.. BE PATIENT WITH IT... GIVE IT A CHANCE and the game will sooner or later reward you ! for me it was the controls and learning totaly new or different tracks...but now i am just chasing my perfect lap on already 30 bikes in my garage and counting :) "

												Very nice game, Although has a console feel that I really dont like that much (going between menus with bizarre loading times)The driving feel is very good. I played SBK X for a while and I liked that one as well, IF you've played a milestone bike game you should feel at home.Still some problems with the not so realistic feel of the bike sometimes, I mean a bike is VERY nimble in real life, you can lean from one side to the other very quickly : in this game you have to change suspension settings to get closer to reality, and you get negative effects from that (less stability).Still this is acceptable and you can have a lot of fun.Does not have a lot of tracks at the moment, which is strange because they already had them in earlier games (in SBK X and previous moto GP games you had most popular tracks like brno, mugello, mazda raceway laguna seca etc. A few open road tracks : need way more real open roads (and i mean not going in circles with laps, i mean a real road like there are sometimes in rally games)Also city tracks , which I dont like so much (all 90° turn... it gets old)Lots of bikes ! That's awesome. very well detailed, many categories like historical, naked, sportbikes, of all displacements. Some groups are unbalanced for racing (you get MT07 or 696 pitted against a 848 , I think they should categorize in relation with horsepower instead of displacement.)Other example in supersport category: 600cbr, 636 ninja, MV agusta 800 3 cylinder : too much difference in hpWasn't very expensive so I got what a paid for but.. I really hope they develop on this base because it could very well be a wonderful title.I won't hesitate to buy DLC's to expand on it (bikes, tracks)So.. why do I not recommend it ? -Milestone is deaf and mute , PR is nowhere to be seen, many users have game breaking bugs and nothing happens-Loading screens are actually preventing me from launching the game right now, I mean it feels like playing playstation 1 back in the day			"

												Huge Moto-GP fan and generally really into bikes. Love the customisation of the bikes, and the detail put into accurate and realistic motorcycles. The customisation of the characters could be improved. And the appearance of the backgrounds could also be improved. However, these aren't game breaking. There are some issues with the physics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tcmjk0OAvco&feature=youtu.be) which do have a high-reproduction rate, but the replay system compensates for this. Really enjoy this game, and reccomend to anyone intrested in bikes. The only thing close to the feeling of riding a bike!			"

												I'll try and keep it short.Overall:Fun game, looking forward to the developers using the profits from this game to either make improvements or release a second, better RIDE game. The sounds are pretty bad (which is VERY important for a motorcycle game), but the bike graphics are good. The environmental graphics aren't the best but they are easy to ignore. Would very much like to see added customization, dramatically improved sounds (including the in-helmet muffling), a free ride mode (open worldish), weather, time of day, and CLUTCH CONTROL. There is currently no clutch control so you can't just pop a wheelie at anytime, but otherwise it is a fun game. It's only $30 so I think it's worth the price.Pros:Physics aren't terrible like MotoGP.Good bike graphics.Fun.Decent number of tracks.Decent amount of customization.Good number of bikes.Nice GUI.Cons:Terrible sounds.Poor environment graphics.Some unnecessarily slow animations between menus.Missing Ducati 899 Panigale (Only because its the bike I have).Could be missing some cons.

												This game just makes me miss MotoGP 07 (Last Moto GP series that was made by THQ - Then Capcom bought it and quickly ruined the it - R.I.P THQ)ProsAs close to MotoGP 07 as I have found so far.Lots of settings and bike customization.Good ""World Tour"" mode with lots of races.Lots of Tracks and BikesConsTraction / physics just feels so off. The gearing and tuning leaves alot to be desired. You can choose between 1 - 6 for each gear. And no presets.The game studders every once in a while which is really annoying.AI riders are practically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will NOT brake if you are in their line. They will slam into you.Dont know whether to put the visuals/graphics in the pro or con category. It looks really good for the most part but some edges around the bikes look like cut outs or something. Bike sound is OK but I havent messed with the audio settings so it could be better than I know...I will continue to play this game and would recommend it if you are into bike racing games. But If you are like me and in search of the MotoGP 07 greatness then you will be disapointed.			"

												Very realistic and fun. Ones rider style has been adjusted to match your own style, your own riding lines are just correct...just like in real life.I don't use any aiding systems, but they are availably. So game can be adjusted between simulation and acrade.I'm very pleased that game features different types of bikes. I love sport bikes, but it's fun to try make decent laptimes  with e.g. XJR1300 (could be nice bike for crusing, but not time attack :) I hope they add more bikes like XJR1300).I ride bikes (mostly sport / track bikes) in reali life, have lot's of experience of riding and I'm bike enthustiatic.

												Love this game. Best motorcycle racing game ever imo. Somehow they seemed to captured the essence of what it really means to ride. I really appreciate the differences in the feels of the different bike classes. The ducatis and bimotas are torque monsters like real life, you really get an idea of the subtle nuances of each machines confirguration.The racing intros when you select a new class for the first time totally makes me feel like I'm watching a street shootout by MCN on youtube or something. It really delivers on the excitement of enthusiasts and displays the developers understanding of what riding means to them. Graphics?-- great as far as im concerned. Its mayhaps not THE most graphically impressive game ever made, but its certainly head and shoulders above anything else available in the miniscule genre of realistic motorcycle racing (semi)simulation. Maybe it wont blow your socks off, or melt your eye balls out of their sockets, but when IM riding along almost any course or draggin down the salt flats against that sky, seeing the salt granules strecthing practically forever in all directions, its something that really gets my motor running.  I love the customization, the real sense of personalization with some unexpected (by me) small but still aesthetically important items like actual aftermarket mirrors, fender eliminator kit, levers, brake lines, quickshifters, etc. and how some of the seemingly ""less important"" items DO actually have a small impact on  how your bikes performs; like buying a better quality chain upgrade will slightly improve your acceleration...duh but still a nice touch! Legit, licensed accessories gives this game a real air of authenticity. I thoroughly enjoy the controls. Something like a slightly enhanced MotoGP controls (this game IS made by the same people) but having played MotoGP 14, I can definitely feel the additional attention that was paid to this game. I love the weightier feeling (technically I could argue that there really arent any non-fast, heavy-ish bikes in MotoGP so they kinda feel too light and too fast to feel the feedback from the road or predictably manuever around the track. Picture a formula 1 race car. Those things turn on the EDGE of a dime! ok.....not so much fun when youre moving so fast and most of the tracks in MotoGP are super tight-ish circuit tracks that dont let you enjoy the track and let you bikes legs stretch out a little bit. A tiny bit too technical to be fun which is fine for that purposes if super serial is your thing but I ride production bikes, I enjoy riding along highways, roads, and especially twisting canyon passes....not a hundred hairpin turns from hell on a honda that cant break the lightspeed barrier.) So to wrap up, THIS game, RIDE, is more FUN, TO ME, imo; while still retaining the respect and understanding the love riders have for riding, it allows for more of the technical aspects of moto racing if youre so inclined, (ofcourse not as technical as MotoGP-lightspeed rescue) while still not forgetting its about the FREEDOM, the experience; THE RIDE! @PandAtomsk			"

												** Edit: having spent more time with the game and not experiencing any save game issues, I think it's fair to change this review to a positive and assume that it was a one off/has been fixed. I still have a few issues with the game, namely a lack of developer support and little individuality between the bikes (they all feel like the same bike with different handling, braking, and power stats, there are no handling quirks to make them interesting beside some bikes being more wheelie prone than others), but overall I think it is a fun enough game to recommend to anyone who likes bikes or racing.**I really like this game. As someone who races motorcycles IRL this is about as close as you can get to the real thing (apart from the ridiculous amount of trail braking you can do) with a screen and controller while still being fun to play. The bikes will slide, wheelie and stoppie in a similar way to their real life counterparts, but the game is more forgiving which makes it much more enjoyable. The tracks are well designed even if the environments are a little repetitive, and the bikes look good and there are some interesting options, even though the bike list is lacking in some areas (very few small bikes, no super motos) and they sound a little flat. Over all I would say if you have even a passing interest in bikes you will find joy in this game.With that said the reason I am giving this a negative review is the saving issues. With 8 hours play time I have had my save corrupted twice, and one of those times the game created a 84GB junk file which maxed out my hard disk and caused all sorts of problems with my computer until I found it and deleted it. Even now that I have started a new save I am still having issues with it, the game has given me the starting bike and 3000cr but is still saying I have already won the races I completed on my previous save, meaning all the races my bike has a hope of winning pay out  a measly 2500cr instead of the normal 10000cr for a first time completion. There is no point in playing the game if all I am able to do is complete the same races on the same bike until my save is corrupted again and I have to start all over. It's a shame because I really enjoy the game itself, but with the current  issues the fun isn't worth the frustration, especially when I payed full price for it when it was released.			"

Obvious quick port to PC. No social modules for chat, or user interface for mouse selections.This one is a gem that needed more time being cut.With hardly any competition in the 2 wheel market, a polished version of this might have cornered the whole niche.Recommending with a large dose of ""It's far from perfect, but it has good potential.""

												Best motorcycle sim I've seen.  A few bugs and crashes to work out, but well worth it if you love motorcycles.  It's like trackday with a controller!			"

												As a real world rider and racer, this is amazing!!! Finally a bike game with dynamics true to form, it's essentially Gran Turismo for bikes. Fully customizable real named brand performance products to mod and adjust every bike with. Tricky to get at first but amazing once you've got it, just like the real thing!!! 10/10			"

												There are tons of bikes to choose from, and there is so much to do to keep you busy. The bikes sound relatively the same in real life, but if you put an aftermarket can there is no difference which sucks.  The graphics are pretty good, when you get up to speed the whole screen shakes, you can hear the wind which creates a real life feel. There are an overwhelming amount of upgrades that you can do with all of the bikes. Overall I say its worth the money.			"

												Well, only problem with the game i could find is the fact that there are no low capacity motorcycles(under 600) other than that i put a copy of the game in a usb stick, liquidized it and now injecting it into my arm.This is a game you need in your peasent library!			"

												Very nice game, Although has a console feel that I really dont like that much (going between menus with bizarre loading times)The driving feel is very good. I played SBK X for a while and I liked that one as well, IF you've played a milestone bike game you should feel at home.Still some problems with the not so realistic feel of the bike sometimes, I mean a bike is VERY nimble in real life, you can lean from one side to the other very quickly : in this game you have to change suspension settings to get closer to reality, and you get negative effects from that (less stability).Still this is acceptable and you can have a lot of fun.Does not have a lot of tracks at the moment, which is strange because they already had them in earlier games (in SBK X and previous moto GP games you had most popular tracks like brno, mugello, mazda raceway laguna seca etc. A few open road tracks : need way more real open roads (and i mean not going in circles with laps, i mean a real road like there are sometimes in rally games)Also city tracks , which I dont like so much (all 90° turn... it gets old)Lots of bikes ! That's awesome. very well detailed, many categories like historical, naked, sportbikes, of all displacements. Some groups are unbalanced for racing (you get MT07 or 696 pitted against a 848 , I think they should categorize in relation with horsepower instead of displacement.)Other example in supersport category: 600cbr, 636 ninja, MV agusta 800 3 cylinder : too much difference in hpWasn't very expensive so I got what a paid for but.. I really hope they develop on this base because it could very well be a wonderful title.I won't hesitate to buy DLC's to expand on it (bikes, tracks)So.. why do I not recommend it ? -Milestone is deaf and mute , PR is nowhere to be seen, many users have game breaking bugs and nothing happens-Loading screens are actually preventing me from launching the game right now, I mean it feels like playing playstation 1 back in the day			"

												This game may not give you the simulator feel some where looking for in Ride, but what it doe's give you is a fantastic arcade style racer with a tonne of bikes thrown in.The visuals are very nice, not top of the line but still eye-catching and the game itself runs without a hitch.The choice of bikes and tracks are vast and the career path is one that might have been re-tuned to maybe allow the player to hop onto the better bikes quicker and mix up some of the action with different bikes.Overall I give Ride a 7.5/10			"

												It will be cool if there's a feature where instead of the standard fairings,we can choose to buy different race fairings eg : no headlights) and have the option to customize them in our own color, decals, pattern, race numbers etc.. "

												This game has to be the best Moto Game so far!You start off with a 700cc Bike and race events to gather Credits to buy/upgrade/customize to make your bike perform better. You can change the gear ratio (although it would  be cool if it was a little more detailed).You have to make your way up the world rankings in order to participate in the elite trophy where you unlock Bikes to use for different events.I am enjoying my experience playing this game. Would love to see more updates and content added in the future!!!10/10			"

												I LOVE this game.It does have some issues but for the most part its great, a suggestion would be some moto GP tracks like PL and IMOTT track and maybe some support for triple screen gaming.If you like Forza its kinda like that with bikes, not at the same level but the best your going to get.

												Very realistic and fun. Ones rider style has been adjusted to match your own style, your own riding lines are just correct...just like in real life.I don't use any aiding systems, but they are availably. So game can be adjusted between simulation and acrade.I'm very pleased that game features different types of bikes. I love sport bikes, but it's fun to try make decent laptimes  with e.g. XJR1300 (could be nice bike for crusing, but not time attack :) I hope they add more bikes like XJR1300).I ride bikes (mostly sport / track bikes) in reali life, have lot's of experience of riding and I'm bike enthustiatic.

												I'm not much into bikes. As a lover of car racing simulators, I took a bet on this game and thankfully, I have no regrets. Its an awesome, wonderfully polished, sim. While many complained of bugs, I got to the party late and found no issues with the game whatsoever. For motorsport and sim lovers, I cannot find a better introduction to bike racing. Period.			"

												I love this game so much!! I enjoy winning every gold in world tour mode with pro physics and realistic AI difficulty. I'm using x360 controller for pc. The control is good. This is like a dream come true having the opportunity to try out many real bikes with realistic physics without having to buy them in real life. I own a Hyosung Gt650r which is not in the game :( and i've also ridden my friend's Kawasaki Z800 and a KTM Duke 200. I could say that the all the bikes behave realistically in pro physics. The handling is quite realistic and a little bit forgiving compared to some other hardcore bike sims out there. And that is why it is pretty enjoyable. To bike enthusiast, this is a must have!!! Thank u Milestone :)10/10 will race again			"

												4-5hrs in and I can honestly say I'm having a lot of fun playing Ride , GFX are very nice on m@x settings , the game has a lot to offer bike fans, for best results a beefy PC is required..I have encountered  a few minor issues, mainly with frame ratess , nothing too drastic and  easily resolved by some tweaking, but nothing I would even consider game breaking or anywhere close, some early reviewers may have experienced more serious issues , but as it stands Ride is pretty solid for me @ this time.If your having any framerate issues I would strongly suggest locking the FPS to 60, that worked best for me as in game menu's were exceeding  1000FPS lol , no point in that senario in my opinion.Some hardcore simmers out there would probably regard Ride as an arcade title, the truth ? Ride on m@x difficulty with all aids and assists off and helmet cam on, Ride is more sim than most PC racing titles available and twice as difficult. physics are spot on and the sense of immersion is for a bike game second to none.Highly recommended.9.5/10.

												DON'T BUY THIS CRAP.That is what i thought when i purchased this game it was poor, Not sure if it was my system or what but it ran like absolute crap.But after about a year finally thought you know what i should try this game again as i love motorcycles and i love racing games. I think i judged this game too soon maybe it  just needing a few patchs i do not know but now it is really fun and can be a blast. It isn't a great game but it does what it should well which is more than i thought before.I always like to come back to games i have revieved as Not Recommended and see if they have changed and this game has , so from now on i can only recommend this game. I cannot see the dev's going backwards.This game is worth of your money.7/10			"

												Terrible.I've liked previous games by the developer on a variety of platforms. I can live with the graphics not being amazing or how the game handles because I enjoy playing their other titles. Unfortunatley I've never made it past the first career race as the game keeps corrupting the save file and checking online this has been a fault since the game launched a couple of years ago. I wish I'd read this before purchasing.Avoid.			"

												Where to start. Firstly the game itself is fantastic, the graphics are beautiful, the physics are breath taking and its extremely addictive. However, when I bought the game the multiplayer servers were down (According to comments from other players they had been down for nearly a month) now their fixed, I cant create an online account. Theres no support from the Devs, infact the last message from them was in 2015. Game crashs quite often and occationally decides not to save your game, and single player only took me 20hrs to clock.So in short, If the game is on sale (around $5), your not interested in multiplayer/online gameplay and are happy enough with it crashing on you every now again, I would recommend this game. As the game is awesome the problem seems to be the Dev team itself.For me personally, the complete lack of communication/support from the Dev's, along with the fact this 2 year old game is still full of bugs and issues, makes me wonder if ride 2 will be any different. They seem to make their money and move on to the next game without completely fixing the first one. This experiance has put me off purchasing any more products from Milestone games.			"
