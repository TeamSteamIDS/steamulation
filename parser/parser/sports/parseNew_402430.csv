												Out of the Park Baseball (OOTP for short) 17 is a text based baseball simulation.  It contains features for historical gameplay, single player gameplay, custom universe/leagues gameplay and online multiplayer gameplay.  The game allows you to take an active role in developing rosters and teams, or managing them.  This is done through being a General manager, a manager and even play as the commissioner(you are able to play all three at once, or any combination of the two).OOTP 17 offers new features over previous editions.  They now have full support from MLB and MLBPA(obtained through licensing), so you will have accurate rosters, faces(done through facegen models) and with no worries that they will disappear.  Simulation speed has been increased as the new code is allowing the use of multicore processors, which is a huge benefit.  The AI also has been enhanced to be smarter in how they draft players, manage players, and develop teams.  They will also make decisions depending on your goals and strategy.  These are just some of the major changes that OOTP has offered over previous editions.OOTP has one of the strongest modding communities around for sport simulation games.  The community greatly enhances the vanilla gameplay.  For instance, historical gameplay has accurate rosters, player attributes, statistics and settings for the era you choose to play(you can play from the grass roots of baseball, negro leagues, or any specific season).  You can choose to play it as a single season campaign or start a franchise and build your league from the 1880’s to whenever you choose to end(the starting point is up to you!).  The community also offers tools to develop uniforms and baseball caps, and there’s literally thousands already pre-made for you to use if you want to choose from them.The gaming modes available(and some of this is a repeat of above, I apologize), are single player, and multiplayer.  Single player modes allow you to play out single exhibition games with modern and historical teams.  You can play as MLB teams, which will have player accurate rosters and attributes.  You are also able to create your own fictional leagues, which is a massively popular feature for many players in the OOTP community.  You can start from any time frame, and you can customize the league to fit your needs or gameplay style(there are many sliders to adjust to your likings, and needs).  Regardless of the league, the game will track and keep a massive history of your statistics as your world/league develops.The game also features multiplayer gameplay where you can compete in leagues against others, which will put you against the most difficult of opponents(or easy, if they don’t know what they’re doing ;) ).  The league will track statistics as if you were in a single player franchise.  Many leagues out there have dedicated websites where you can follow the action of the league as it unfolds.  It is really a neat feature.The development team is very active and proactive in fixing bugs and glitches within their games.  You don’t have to worry about issues going unnoticed or fixed, and they are very open minded to additional features they may have fixed(as long as they are deemed reasonable of course).  The best way to suggest and fill out bug notifications is to use the main forums on their websites, which is ootpdevelopments.com .  The community is also very helpful in helping new players learn and teach players about the game(I myself have helped a few players learn the game of baseball and the workings of OOTP).In conclusion, after 2000+ hours of OOTP 16 gameplay, and 1200+ hours of OOTP15 gameplay, I can honestly say this is the best addition to the series to date.  I have never had a game give back so much in value then what OOTP has.  It is simply the best baseball simulation on the market(possibly the best sports simulation as well).  The game is very polished, and if you are a baseball fan, or a sports fan, I highly recommend that you take a chance on OOTP17.  You will NOT be disappointed.This game is a 10/10 for me.  I hope to see you on the field! Feel free to add me if you need any help with this game, or series!  I am always willing to help out new players get established in this great sports simulation!			"

												Do you like baseball?I didn't. I really didn't. I liked a lot of different sports but I always thought baseball was boring, archaic and more an excuse to sit outside, drink beer and gawk at the occasional on-field event.But then, for whatever reason -- I didn't have much else going on -- I started to watch baseball, because it was always on, pretty much every day, and it started to wrap itself around my brain in a pleasing way. Baseball is low-intensity matched with extreme peaks and valleys of emotion. More importantly -- Baseball is a long continuous set of calculations based on the manipulation of variables in series after series of problems. Every at-bat, every pitch, every inning, every game is a test of odds and outcomes based on the pitcher, the batter, the fielders, the field, the weather, past results obscuring present values... Baseball is a worthwhile flux.So - OOTP 17. This is the most advanced and ridiculously satisfying way to run your own personal baseball simulations. So maybe I should rephrase - Do you like Baseball as a concept? Because you will love OOTP.(Also this year they added little moving pawns to the broadcast view, so it's starting to get satisfyingly similar to half-watching an actual baseball game.)For those already owning OOTP 16 and mulling an upgrade I would say - the engine runs much faster this year on x64, some under the hood stuff has been nicely tweaked, bells and whistles (the pawns) aren't nothing, and of course, I feel pretty good about supporting this developer, given their track record.

												I bought OOTP 15 because it was £2 on offer because I like sport management simulators and played it for 50 hours without a clue about the rules of baseball, strategy or the league.  I deciced to buy OOTP17 because i was enjoying 15 so much and I now have over 200 hours spent on it as well as MLB online subscription to watch games.  Do not be put off if you have never watched baseball (for the non-US players), if you like sport simulators, building a team, analysing stats, managing wages and transfers and finding the next superstar then give it a go.  Beginners tip however, you need more than one starting pitcher......... "

												This is the first review I have written here on steam.I admit, I was a bit skeptical about this game at first.Part of me seemed like it might be boring and another part thought that it may be too complicated to get into. Though it did seem like it was unique and potentiall fun to play.I played baseball for 16 years up through high school and into college and coached for two years following that. I have to say the level of detail from every single aspect of the game is present in this title. I was astonished how the attitudes of the players could effect the teams just like they do in real life. That is just one example. THERE ARE SO MANY TINY DETAILS. It must have been painstaking to research and input all this information into the game.To top it off, I figured that the actual game simulations would be boring but nope, I was very wrong there. It brought back my old days of coaching calling the shots from the dugout or sending signals, trying to direct your team to a big win. I simply cannot say enough. I have been gaming ever since I can remember and I have never gotten into a simulator. If you enjoy baseball, you will love this game. If you kind of like baseball, you will love this game. Chances are even if you do not like baseball, you will love this game.			"

												The classic just keeps getting better year after year.For those new to the series, this is strictly a management sim.  No action aside from the outstanding baseball extravaganza your imagination cooks up from the play-by-play (if you so choose). (EDIT! There IS action now!  There is a 3D mode to put a little bit of animation to your imagination)  Guide your team over decades as a GM, manage your team pitch-by-pitch, or do both.  It's entirely up to you. If you're like me and in every baseball game you've ever played you've found yourself saying ""but wouldn't it be great if it had (X) in it?""  Well this is your dream game.  Whatever your X was, every time, since Triple Play Baseball on NES, this game has it.  And more.  It has literally everything in it that baseball has in it.  It is an outstanding work and is infinitely enjoyable for a baseball fan.  The only negative I can think of is that I imagine the learning curve is fairly steep (although I've been playing the series for 11 years now so I forget how it was to pick up).  A must have for any baseball fan.  10/10 (year, after year, after year)			"

												This is my first year playing OOTP and I must say I am very impressed with the game. Altho the mass amount of menu screens makes it look daunting, A few games in and it just gets easier to use and navigate. Currently it is spring training and after playing the first 5 games of the season on the game it really feels like baseball is back in real life. The detail and numbers that goes into this game is incredible! I will definietly be buying OOTP every year now. Great game and I strongly recommend it			"

												Former Microleague player, yea back in the mid 80's I started getting into that game. I had all the floppy disk and finally the editor so I could edit and add all the major league players individually, which I did.  Played a whole season with each individual team then.  I can tell you that was a lot of games I had to play and I loved every minute.  This is just to tell you how dedicated I was to simming a entire one season of baseball.  Then came Tony Larussa Baseball, and then OOTP, where I can sim entire season in one day instead of one year of my life.  Last OOTP I played was OOTP 11 which was  few years ago.  Enjoyed the game but it had a few faults in it, especially the not so friendly interface.   I haven't bought baseball sim game since, thinking my joy for the game had faded.  So you ask why I bought this game?  Well it peeked my interest from the high reviews I have read about it.  So I said to myself why not, lets see if we can spark that old flame again.  It not only sparked the flame, it has caused a three alarm fire.  This game is going to be a classic.   It has surprassed any of my expectectations I had for it.The Quick Sim is now extremely fast because of the 4 processor support.  No more simming and waiting for few minutes, just a quick click and a few seconds delay and the day is done.   I love how technology has made it this easy, instead of the days of me individually going to play each game for each team. One thing I truely love and pretty much look forward to is the unique things that pop in a season.  Things can put your player out, not just basic injuries either.  You might have caused one of your players to be overworked one game, for example a pitcher.  That said pitcher you push him to his limits trying to get him a complete game and his arm figuratively falls off with a tired arm syndrome. So you loss him for few starts.   Stuff like that and players being suspended for fighting is all in this game. Also players age as years go by and you can see how this effects them on thier portrait.  Aging also has effect on how well and bad they play.  Like a upcoming player  starting to reach thier potential or a aging star fading away during his twighlight of his career.  There is soo much content in this game,  I am only skimming the surface of what this game has.If you want to be just a coach for minor league team, you can.  If you want to control every aspect of your franchise you can too.  The choice is yours,  if you want to relive your childhood and see your favorite heros from the past play, you can.  Having every authentic player from both minor leagues and majors makes this game so realistic.I am probably just babbling now.  But for me this game has been enlightening and has taken me back to when I was a kid and when I was playing Microleague,  I had wished a computer game just like this.  I mean some of the extra stuff they did to this game is stuff I never thought off back then, but boy I am enjoying each and every new surprise each day.Buy it if you love Baseball, buy it if you like micromanaging, buy it if your a strategy fan, buy it if you like history, and  buy it if you like gaming.  This is just a game, but its more then game.  If you get my meaning.  This is the Best and I mean ""The Best Sim Game"" out there bar none.			"

												  I've now put quite a few hours into OOTP 17 now since buying it in July so I can now fairly give a review and also compare to last years OOTP 16.  First thing I noticed different from last year was the design and colors of the screens. Much better imo and easier to read. Something else that is much improved over last years game is the trading. You can actually now make a list of needs you are wanting so the computer makes more offers to you making the game more realistic in that area. Now I'm not saying the trades are easier to make, I still always get the they want two five star players for their 4 star and 3 star thing happening but overall this new function really adds to the game.    Now to just go over the game in general and not comparing to last years game. If you like baseball and sims you will absolutley LOVE this game. The options to starting leagues are never ending. There is almost nothing you can't make your league into with all the options given. You can base a league on current MLB seasons, historical MLB seasons. You can dump all the MLB players into a pool and draft them into new teams. You can start fictional leagues. You can decide on whether its an offensive league, pitching league or neutral league. You can start foreign leagues. It's endless.   The interface can be a bit tricky to learn to start but after a bit it starts to fall into place for you as things are designed well for the most part. My biggest complaint about the game is when setting individual player game strategies you can't always see all the players stats needed to adjust you strategies. Otherwise they have done a great job on making sure you can almost always find what you are looking for easily after a bit of practice.    I highly recommend this game to baseball fans and sim fans, you can't do any better than this game. If you are wanting to learn more about basebal I also recommend this game as well, so much can be learned while playing the game, it won't take long before you know you've improved your baseball IQ.

												Last week, I didn't know the difference between a bunt and a line drive. Being British, we aren't supposed to. But this game is phenomenal. I've been studying baseball all week because of it. Amazing work by the developers, so many choices, so much depth and so much addiction. Thank you. 10/10. I got it on the humble bundle and now feel a bit guilty I didn't pay full price. However, I will make that up to them on all their following releases!			"

												I've always been a fan of sports games. Not in being the rising star player in career mode, not in dominating my opponents online (because, being honest, that doesn't really happen) or in the now everpresent card collecting mode found in almost every sports game. I am, through and through, a franchise mode player. I love to build up my team, scout, draft and trade my way to being the next dynasty. It's doable in the console based sports games out there. Some do it better than others. OOTP Baseball gives a deeper dive into the shoes of being a GM and provides the most satisfying sports management experience I've found.I'll get this out of the way first. If you're looking to actually play a game of baseball, you should move on. The game is completely text based with outcomes generated by formulas. You are able to manage a game from ""10,000 feet"" if you will, but there is no playing a baseball game. This is not MLB the Show for the computer. This is about handling the front office functions of the team more than the actual playing of the game of baseball. I'll also say that if you're looking for a hardcore baseaball management sim, you probably know a fair amount about baseball. If you're not very familiar with baseball, you will probably get overwhelmed and should learn a bit about the management side of baseball beforehand. There's just so much to it that if you're coming in without a base of knowledge you'll probably be turned off. Losing a prized prospect to the rule 5 draft or not understanding service time and suddenly have a player hit arbitration and become expensive could easily ruin the experience when you're just getting your feet wet.If what you're looking for is a deep dive into being a GM of a baseball organization OOTP 17 is great follow up to OOTP 16. You can play in the real MLB as GM of a team, as the GM of a team in another real world league, or create your own baseball universe. You can run more than one organization, but you would have the same controls over each. If you play in the real MLB the game has full rosters with minor league teams containing the real life players and even top prospects for the upcoming drafts. Upon creation, the game world you want is customizable. From things like the size of the active roster and how many rounds the draft go to modifiers for how rapidly players decline as they age and swing and miss rates. There are pages and pages of options you can modify to make the game to your liking. Most of the settings are also modifiable in game if you find you don't like a particular setting, though it's best to modify them in the offseason otherwise you can run into issues. You can also play as just a manager, or running a minor league team, or work your way up, but everything short of GM + Manager is just a restriction on what you can do.Once you're actually in game it functions like a browser, with various tabs and subsections you can navigate to manage your team or see what's going on around the league or even in other international leagues. You manage your major league roster and minor league farm teams. You set your scouting budget and priority as well as review international free agents as they are discovered by your scouts. Set ticket prices, work to make your team's owner happy and balance your budget while fielding a competitive team. The list would go on for quite some time. It's baseball. You're in charge of a baseball team. Rule 5 drafts, arbitration, player postings, PED usage suspensions, it's all there unless you turn it off in the customization tab at the league creation.There is a very in depth system for managing your roster with scouting reports not only on a player's ability and future potential, but also on things like their personality, leadership ability and work ethic. This system is in place for all players: majors, minors, amateur draft and international. Going through the amateur draft you'll look at a player who looks like he has off the charts athletic ability, but poor work ethic and would be a bad teammate versus a player that looks like a solid, above average player who is a hard worker that could become a leader in your clubhouse. Those decisions have an impact down the road. Team chemistry or a leaderless clubhouse can have an impact on your team's ability to perform and desire to play for your team like losing do. It's like the real world. When you're winning, things look better. Losing, worse. Good teammates make things better. Bad ones, worse. You need to figure out how to field a team that works, not only on the field but off.Along with team performance you have to manage your finances. Each team has a market size, fan base loyalty and stadium capacity that are bases modified by fan interest and attendance which go hand in hand. Each team has a floor of a national media contract along with local media contracts, but the major differentiator from team to team is game attendance. If you field a bad team with no big name players, people won't show up and you won't have the resources to improve your team. Winning and player popularity play a major part in your team's finances through boosting ticket sales. As players are in the majors longer and do better they become more popular, and people want to show up to watch them. You will most likely develop most of your big name players in house, but signing big name free agents or trading away big names on your team will change fan interest. Losing minor leaguers can have an oddly large impact on fan interest. I remember one season in particular where I let five minor league players who were late round draft picks that never made it above rookie ball walk and my fan interest dropped 12 percentage points. It made no sense.There are also random events factored into the game like would happen in real life. I have yet to see anything exciting happen, like a league expansion. What I've seen have been things like lengthening the time of DL stints. The mundane, every day stuff that actually happens. Maybe someday I'll see that league expansion I'd be so excited for, but so far nothing.While the game is an amazing sports management sim, there are a few issues in the game. As a note all of this is with the default settings. I wanted the real deal of managing a baseball team so everything is with the default settings. International trades are a bit arcane. Some leagues are willing to trade players or post players, but others are not. There isn't any explanation or guide in the game as to why.The game, like every other sports sim, can be gamed. It's not hard to trade up to get both the first, second, third and sometimes fourth overall draft picks, though the rest of the draft will be pretty thin to nonexistent for you. Minor league players, or even players almost to arbitration will sign ridiculous long term contracts. In the end, it's not such a terrible thing. You want to be able to be amazing. It is, after all, your world so figuring out the tricks and being a perennial world series contender is fun. It is a little unrealistic, but you play and you build an amazing team, one that you built and one you take to the world series.There are a number of improvements over OOTP 16. AI controlled teams are no longer willing to give up prized prospects for a pile of mediocre. The AI is also better at managing its finances. No longer are all AI controlled teams chronically running in the red. The rate of decline in players is also more varied and feels more realistic. No longer is it someone's arm falling off at 32. Young promising players will fizzle out after a season or 2 sometimes and some players will have a slow decline over years allowing them to go from perennial all-star at 30 to riding off into the sunset at 40. The game also touted adding dual core functionality for processing. It does better and worse in certain ways. There will be quite a few hang ups when scouting players and going into the various tabs			"

Also auto-post game wrteups is reat and it makes everything go smoother. And the 3D animations that move while the games are being simmed are a nice touch too.

												This game has been on my radar for years. I've played a few sports sims (Football Manager series, Eastside Hockey, Front Office Football), all very good (with Football Manager being the king of sport sims).I hadn't followed baseball religiously since the 94-95 playoff lock-out. Not sure why, but just lost the love for baseball at that point. I've followed with a mild interest since then. Enter OOTP 17. Because I don't have a good grasp of the current MLB rosters, I decided to start a league in 1982. A year when I really started to love baseball, read every stat line in the newspaper, and collected baseball cards. A year that produced some of the era's best baseball players and brought back a ton of memories for me. Commissioner mode allowed me to put together a ball club of personal favorites. This game is deep and lots of fun. The immersion in this game is fantastic. The flavor text, the mounds of stats, the interactive playcalling, roster management....this game has everything I could have dreamed of in a baseball sim.Yes, the graphics could be better. I'd love to have the option to add additional sounds to the game...BUT, those are minor gripes.At the end of the day, this rivals Football Manager in many ways. The only area it doesn't, is the 3D presentation. But again, this is such a small thing for me, because the flavor text is so dynamic and well written. Thanks, OOTP team, for bringing back some great baseball memories and renewing my interest in baseball.			"

												I have only played OOTP baseball since OOTP 15, but this year, just like last year's, is even better. Pros: Great community. Rarely do you see a 'do a search dumb azze' response. Even if the question is asked a million times. You can choose how much immersion you want. You can control almost every detail of the game. Yes, this can have drawbacks, and from my personal experience, I wish I would have let the AI control more when I first began playing. But now, I like having almost full control and then letting the stats and RNGesus determine everything else Constant bug fixes throughout the year. Obviously this game just came out, but Markus and the gang are always adding features and fixing bugs. Really, too many pros to nameCons The game will let me cheat and pick Pedro whenever he is available for the draft. To be fair, he is the only player I will do this for. And to be fair, we would all cheat to have Pedro.  I have learned a lot about confirmation bias. Which has led me to realize I may have other flaws as well. Hey OOTP, I don't need to be psychoanalyzing myself. I just want to live out a dream of being a GM. But, this game is only 34.99. My shrink charges more, so I guess it cancels out. My shrink gives me benzos also. Any chance of that next year????In all seriousness, no real cons I can think of. I'm not saying they aren't there, but I don't want to say ""X"" is a con when I don't even have a solution.Also, to avoid the should I get ""OOTP or the Show"" types of questions I have seen the past couple of years, I will preemptively say they aren't the same types of games. Its not fair to compare them. I personally love them both. But, one thing OOTP does that the Show doesn't is truly upgrade from year to year. I'm not saying there aren't improvements with The Show each year, but that they just seem more minor. I highly recommend. This is a game that could easily cost more and still be worth it. And they don't have any competition (Yeah, I know what some are thinking, and no that isn't competition).  "

												Fantastic game!  I'll admit when I was younger I didn't prefer OOTP as much as, say, Baseball Mogul because there was too much information and Mogul was a lot more simple.  Well I've mellowed as I've aged and actually took the time to learn all the aspects of the game and lemme tell ya: it's phenomenal.  PLUS it's now licensed by MLB!  I've in the middle of playing as my 2005 White Sox and it's addicting!  Kids can keep there Pokemon Go; I'm going to sit here and try to win the World Series!			"

Product received for free
Out of the Park Baseball 17 is a sports strategy game where you can bring your very own baseball team to success. You can play both against bots or real people.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are a manager of a baseball team. You have to ensure that your team wins as much as possible by choosing the best prepared players and making the best moves in the game. If you know any other team management games or previous OOTP games, this one very similar to them, just with many improvements and added features.Pros: Clean Interface | I'm not a big baseball fan, but it was very clear what I had to do in the game. The menus look really nice and colourful, everything seems to be in order and the placement of all the options are really intuitive. Ease of Use | As soon as I opened the game, it offered to help me with everything I might need to know in the game. Most things in the games are well explained, just in case you don't know everything about baseball. You can open one of the official tutorials at any time if something is not clear enough in the game. I got a lot of useful information in this game since I'm not living in a country where baseball is very popular. Bug-Free Gameplay | I have not experienced a single bug in this game. I always encounter at least something, a typo, something a bit misplaced ... something. But not in this game. It's stunning since there is so much content included in this game. Performance | This year's edition of Out of the Park Baseball finally has support for multi-core processors, which obviously means better performance on most computers. On my computer, the game was running without any performance drops at all times. Loading times were very short (sometimes, I wasn't able to read the text on the loading screens, which made me a bit sad, I confess) and there weren't many loading screens at all, so pretty much all the time dedicated to this game went to playing it, not waiting for it to load. Multiplayer Support | I find it really impressive that you can also play this game with other players. I always thought that such games were meant to be more single player, but it seems like multiplayer support actually fits the genre perfectly. I mean, sports is about competing with others, isn't it? If someone doesn't believe that the game is not cheating and rigging the game, playing against real people is most certainly fair. Supports Linux and MacOS | You can also play OOTP 17 on Linux and MacOS. I heard there are some issues with the Linux port, but it only occurs for some people. Frequent Updates | Developers of this game often release updates that bring new content and fix bugs and glitches. It's good to see a developer paying attention to their game, even though they release a new major version every year anyway.Cons: Pricing | I know some people are willing to pay a lot for such games, but I still think that $40 is a bit too much for a game like this. I know that a lot of work went into it, but I just don't think that this price is justified. It's fun, it has a lot of content, but just not enough for the price. GTA V is often discounted to a price below $40 and it's well worth its money, which is something that I can't say for this game. Sadly. Replayability | I'm going to say something that a lot of people won't agree with, but I'm going to say it anyway: the game is fun for some hours, but then it kind of lost its charm for me. I am not going to blame it on the game, it's probably just because I'm not so used to baseball. So if you are into this kind of games and you know for yourself that you like The final verdict:The game is good, but the high price can be an obstacle when considering purchasing. If you have played any OOTP games before, you should know that this game is just like the old ones, but improved in many ways. If that is something you are willing to pay for, go for it. If you haven't played any previous games, you should consider purchasing it when it gets discounted. It offers solid gameplay and it can be quite fun and challenging at moments. I know people who spent hundreds of hours into such game so if you're one of such people, this might be a game for you.Although the price is an issue, I'm going to recommend this game as every game gets discounted if you wait for a little. Also, OOTP is a well-made game and deserves to be supported.With love,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review. "

												Ignore most of the review bombing on sites like metacritic, as most people probably haven't even played the game. OOTP 17 is probably the best and most in-depth GM sim I've played. Almost everything that'd you'd want in a sim is here: official MLB license, hundreds of years of historical data, fictional leagues that can be customized to perfection, option to either play your games or sim them, the ability to play in any other baseball league in the world, and more. It's a niche kind of game, but if you have any interest in baseball or even sports management sims in general: BUY THIS GAME.			"

												This simulator is awesome. I'm hugely obsessed with both baseball and statistics, and this game has tons of both. It's extremely costumizable and has a huge and accurate database of players from this season and over a nearly a hundred previous seasons. That's just incredible. If you like statistics and being able to act as a GM/Manager, this is he eprfect game for you. The game gives you cotnrol of so much stuff, so it keeps you busy and entertained.			"

												Best sports simulation game out there. But I cannot play the game. After weeks playing my Chicago Cubs to its first title since 1908 (we were almost there!), the game started to crash at load screen. for no aparent reason. ""Error 41"". Zero support from the developers. Be carefull in buying this - it does not matter if this is the best game if it could not be played.Edit: I am altering my recommedation to positive. After a few days (four or five days), the OOTP support team contacted me and solved the problem. They are a not so big team and I understood the time lapse between my ""support ticket"" and the solution. The problem was not solved by Valve, but by the OOTP team.It continues to be the best sports simulation in the market - but now I can play it again!			"

												OOTP17 is a great baseball sim, but if you like using add ons, DO NOT GET THE STEAM VERSION. It's not crippled, but just doesn't allow you access to add ons which can enhance your gaming experience.The steam version forces you to use workshop central for adding add ons, but it only has a couple of add ons while the version bought directly from OOTP uses add on central which has a few dozen add ons. It's a shame that the developers created a different version of OOTP17 for steam users. Both OOTP16 versions used add on central. Next year I will no longer buy OOTP from steam because of this.The steam version of OOTP17 still plays fine, but you can't do as much with it if you had the version sold directly from OOTP development and that's a shame. I hope that they change this next year.			"

												I never thought a text-based simulation could be this fun. This game has unlimited replayability. You can start at any point in the history of baseball. Whether you'd want to start in todays league, go back in time and pick Pedro Martinez and Barry Bonds in the amateur draft, or start from the very beginning in 1871, you can do that. To make each game more unpredictable, storylines are added so players can miss games for anything under the sun. I have 50 hours raked in the last week, and you'll take time out of your schedule to play this game. I rarely buy games for full price, and I'd buy this even if it was twice as much as the $40 list price. Even if you don't like baseball, this game is a must have.			"

												The entire OOTP franchise is great!  A must for any baseball fan who wishes they were a Manager or General Manager.Think you're as good as Billy Bean?  Give it a try.  Do you like stats and watching players rack them up?  Want to see that 3rd round draft pick work his way thorugh the minors to make it in the bigs?  Give it a try.Oh no your 3rd baseman has a 3 month injury and has to go on the DL, who shall you put in his place?  Bring up a prospect from the minors?  Use the 2nd stringer? Use that utility guy who has been bouncing from AAA to the majors all season?  Or check the waver wire and free agents, maybe you can find a guy there. Situations like this are all abound.  Strategy! Excitement! Complexity! Customability! This game has it all!Just get it and be that Manager or General Manager you always wanted to be!!!  DO IT! "

												I've played OOTP for years now, and it has never dissapointed me. It just gets better really. OOTP 17 is most likely the best sports sim/manager available on steam, and well anywhere really.Its the best sim ever I think. I  logged soooo many ours in to ootp 16, and I believe that trend will continue ;).Out of the Park Developments is an amazing company. They have excellent customer support, a good sized community, and provide constant upgrades. I believe in this company and love the game, so, GO BUY IT! ;)			"

												I do not know jack sh*t about baseball. That being said I love spreadsheets and micromanaging. I also love simulator games.So I thought why not, I will give this a try, and I picked it up in a Humble Bundle. Also if you do not know what Humble Bundle is, stop reading this review and check it out. Seriously. So all of that back story aside. I would give this game a 4.5/5. It is damn near perfect. I think the only way they could make it better would be by having more in game tutorials or explantions of what the hell all of these stats meant. So be prepared to watch some really boring and drawn out youtube videos. That is acutally a big problem for me they don't even have the videos in game, you have to have a second computer or phone ready to go if you need to watch a explation. Mind you the explations on their Youtube video are good, but still come on, it is 2017 lets get it in game.That being said, if you also like editing your team to be like Gods, you can also do that. This is not particularly hard or difficult. You have no real control in the actual individual games themselves.			"

												I've been playing these types of games since Tony Larussa Babeball 2, and this is the best I've found.  It still contains many of the same glitches as previous versions (JIM UNKOWN anyone?), but I have noticed a few subtle improvements.  It takes a bit more finese to rake the AI over the coals in a trade.  Contracts, especially for rookies, more closely resemble real life.  My biggest pet peeve, figuring out how many staters to use in a rotation as my historical team progresses through the eras, isn't an issue anymore.  Let the hours I have spent playing OOTP 2016, stand as a testament to this product.  2017 is more of the same, updated and refined.			"

												When I play a baseball game I NEED it to do certain things. I need strikeouts and walks to be in line with real life - I need ugly fielding errors that cost games. I need everything that makes baseball - well baseball. All of that requires a certain level of patience and commitment. And that's why besides when I didn't know any better when I was a wee lad - Ive only played statistical simulators like OOTP. Console baseball games for the most part are catering to segment of populaton who only wants to play glorified homerun derby. More power to them - I'm not here to deny them the fun they seek.But if you desire the same which is ultimately realism - check OOTP out. Its hard for me to imagine you will be disappointed.			"

												The most dependable product/developer in the business.  I have played since OOTP10 or so and they never fail to improve the game without taking away from the core experience with every release.  Whatever your baseball fantasy is, be it as a Manager or General Manager/Manager playing current seasons, replaying past years, rewriting history, or creating a whole fictional baseball universe... you can do it here, and they are all addictively fun ways to play.  The addition of the MLB license is a well deserved honor for the franchise and will likely allow the already prolific modding community to get even more creative.  My personal favorite addition this year though is the inclusion of historical minor leagues.  Remember that soon to be nobody you idolized when you went to watch the local minor league team, that guy who never even got a cup of coffee in the bigs?  Well he's included.  Not just recommended, highly recommended.			"

												Way back in the Commodore 64 era, I remember spending hours creating custom rosters for Microleague baseball, mostly comprised of me and my friends with comically high ratings.   We'd gather around the screen, taking on the legends of the game, arguing about who got to hit the button next and making fun of the one member of our group who was 'only' hitting .560.    I bought this game in a fit of nostalgia, hoping to recreate a little of that magic.   I've been pleasantly surprised so far; this game brings the magic like David Copperfield after a Barry Bonds smoothie.  You may initially be overwhelmed by the numbers of screens and info thrown at you, but the user-friendly interface makes it very easy to control.   You can do as much, or as little, as you'd like.  If you wish to rule the world, make yourself Commissioner and have a hand in everything.  If you'd like to earn your way to the top, start as a manager for the Brevard County Manatees or some other minor-league team.  Go back in time and GM the Yankees in the 70's and 80's for the sheer fun of hiring and firing Billy Martin.  OOTP is clearly not a graphics-driven, but anyone who played Microleague back in the day will appreciate the 3D presentation of the individual games.  I refuse to sim because I'm having so much fun playing each game.  But if you're more into the long-term, sim entire seasons in minutes.  This game is whatever you decide to make it.It's not perfect; the trade AI is a hot mess which seems almost impossible to reasonably deal with, until they make you an offer out of nowhere that is so good that you never would have thought to make it yourself.   And I can't seem to get my manager to pull pitchers when I'd like, no matter how I fiddle with their settings.   Overall, this game is just plain fun, provided you're into baseball, simulations, or reliving childhood fantasies.  While I'm no longer putting myself on rosters with inflated stats, I'm now undertaking something just as unrealistic; making winners out of the 1980 Mets.  9/10  "

												Wow, I'm new to this game. I love no other sport like I do baseball. I find every detail interesting and have friends that I could talk to about baseball for hours. I downloaded this game because it was on sale, there seems to be a learning curve to it but i can say that it would be a fantasy job working with baseball managers, much less as a manager. I have logged less 24 hours so far, but it was intersting. I didn't do so well on the one season I played as the Red Sox manager for last year. While the Red Sox in real life did much better without me managing for them, I can say at least I beat the Yankees. Maybe I dedicated more time to those games. Where other teams, I just let them run until I got to a game that I wanted to control every at bat.If you like baseball, and like text based type games, then you might be interested in this. I would recommend it as I had more fun playing it than many other videogames.			"

												As always, OOTP hits a homerun with Baseball 17.  With over a hundred hours already played, I will continue to enjoy the game while leading teams in a variety of ways.  The deep statistical analysis grows with each release.  The new features of 17 have added highlights to an already glorious game. If you are a baseball fan or statistics dork, OOTP Baseball 17 is the game for you.			"

												If you're like me, and you've always played Franchise Mode in sports games but preferred the trading/drafting/etc to playing the actual games, then OOTP is perfect for you. There is an insane amount of depth, which could be overwhelming...except you can autmomate whatever tasks you dont want to deal with or assign them to your coaches, basically allowing you to make the game as deep, complex, and involved as you would like. If you do prefer to be hands on, however, you have an absurd amount of content at your fingertips. Games can be automated batter by batter, inning by inning, or just skipped/automated entirely. A crazy amount of players to draft and develop, including International League players. Very detailed and realistic in ways that most sports games are not (for instance, it is not uncommon for a high draft pick to refuse to sign with the team that drafted him, allowing him to re-enter the draft pool next season).Insane amount of customization.Great attention to detail, enjoy the flavor text and play-by-play.Realistic player development. A seemingly can't-miss prospect can end up being a bust without the proper coaching, playing time, if they're rushed through the minors too quickly, etc etc.. On the other hand, a seemingly average prospect can end up being a stud under the right conditions.Absolutely recommended for anybody who prefers the GM and coaching aspects of sports games.			"

												I could not recommend this game any higher. I have played every version since v6. If you are a baseball lover there is nothing better than taking the reigns of your favorite team and see if you can change history. But, my absolut favorite part of this game is the devs. I have played many many games thru the years but no dev team is more willing to listen and fix something if it is wrong.			"

												OOTP17, Markus and his team made another baseball world wonder.  The first version of animated 3D players are so sweet to watch, you will get attached to them. Over 150,000 players included, start any year you want now it will include all the affiliated minor teams of all MLB teams.  Just awesome, can this game get any better? Well it those every year and #17 doesn't disappoint .  My usual words of warning: THIS GAME IS EXTREMELY ADDICTIVE.Nice 3D parks included.  Loads of improvements with of course a long list of new features.  Don't miss out on the fun, get this gem of a game now!10/10  Best supported game on the planet!PS.  I have over 1100 hrs logged with OOTP 16.  Enjoyed every minute.			"

												If you are a fan of intricacies of baseball, a fan of managing players, teams and organizations then this is the game for you.  If you want to play out the current season to see if you can do better than your team's management, you can do that.  If you want to experience the likes of Ty Cobb, Lou Gehrig and Ducky Medwick, you can do that. Play out the 1919 world series and see if the Reds can pull off the win without the Black Sox selling out.  You can even see how JR Richard, Steve Carlton, Roy Halladay, and Bob Gibson would fair against Ruth, Gehrig and Williams.  If you just like the idea of managing your own dynasty and writing your own history you can create your own fictional baseball universe where only you get to know the players.  You can do all this in a solo game but you can take it to the next level by either starting your own or joining one of the many online leagues where you can compete against other baseball geeks.  It's your game and you play it however you wish.  Besides the intricacies and nuances of the game you get every player that has played in the MLB along with over 150,000 real minor league players and they all come with the game, no season's to buy.  Best sports simulation that I have ever played from a small company dedicated to making it the best that it can be.  I can't recommend it highly enough.			"

												Where do you even start when talking about Out of the Park Baseball? This is now the second edition of the game I have played, and this game easily tops what was given in OOTP16. A note to those who are new to the series, the game is a baseball management simulator with insane amounts of depth and detail. It allows for customization of just about any rule you can think of, and allows to you Manage or GM your favorite MLB team or a team in a fictional league you make yourself. And a note for those who have played an OOTP Baseball game before, this game is definatly worth the upgrade. The new features, ranging from the greatly improved 3D Ballparks to the MLBPA License, give the game an entire new feel and level of depth.Game is an easy 10/10 and I forsee myself easily playing 200+ hours of this game in the coming year.

												I've been playing this game since OOTP Baseball 9 came out.  It's not just a realistic and fun game.  It has actually taught me a ton about the game of baseball - minor leagues, Rule 5, the draft, the CBA agreement - things I never knew about or cared about.  Glad that Markus and gang continue to improve the product every year.  The game can be played in so many ways - with a real MLB roster, an historical roster, a fiction league that you can customize to your hearts content.  You can play solo, or online.  It's really up to you.			"

If you've ever though you could do better than yor team's real life GM, then this is the game for you.  With the new historical exhibition games you can even replay previous world series or answer questions like who was better, the 1927 or 1998 New York Yankees.			"

I assure you, starting with OOTP 14, I have logged countless hours playing OOTP: the greatest sports simulation known to man. If you love baseball but don't own OOTP, all I can say is, man, you are missing out. I knew of OOTP for years before I finally decided to give it a try with version 14. Once I got the hang of things, I could not believe I had put off playing this game for so long. This is literally the sports game of my dreams, and of any baseball fan's dreams. It is absolutely on my Top 5 Games I'd Take to A Desert Island list (...everyone should have one of those lists...)How anyone could give OOTP a Negative review is utterly beyond me. This is the deepest, most flexible and immersive sports simulation on the market, hands down. Deeper than Football Manager. The only thing I can think of is, perhaps the negative reviews think all sports games need to look like MLB The Show or NBA 2K. Those are great games in their own right, but OOTP is every inch a baseball game as ""The Show"" and then some. Since version 16, OOTP has been officially licensed by MLB, so anyone who avoided OOTP because it couldn't give you the ""official MLB"" experience offered by The Show, well, that problem has been put to rest. There is almost nothing you can't do in OOTP. Feel like GMing the Tokyo Yakult Swallows in the Nippon Professional Baseball League? Be my guest. Want to manage the Red Sox' AAA Pawsox affiliate? Go to it. Feel like skippering the 1925 New York Yankees and the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Bob Meusel? Have at. Feel like setting up a completely fictional league tailored exactly to your specifications? Why not. The depth and flexibility of OOTP are simply breathtaking. You won't believe it until you experience it for yourself.All that said -- yes, get ready for a learning curve. The game is DEEP. I've heard it described as the 'Dwarf Fortress' of sports games. (I've also heard Dwarf Fortress described as the OOTP of roguelike/simulations...)  The complexity and depth can be intimidating. But what amazes me is, OOTP is not just played by die-hard baseball fans. Plenty of players with little interest in baseball have given OOTP a try and gotten hooked. (The fact that OOTP is developed by a team of Germans tells you all you need to know about its broad international appeal!)  And there is no question you may have that you cannot get an answer to in the OOTP Developments forums -- there is an extremely knowledgable and dedicated fanbase there who are very happy to answer even the most basic questions about baseball and OOTP -- they are more than happy to welcome new players!TL:DR --  If you (A) love baseball, (B) love sports, and / or (C) love in depth immersive management games, don't overthink it:  BUY OOTP 17 NOW  !!!

												I want to preface this by saying I have played OOTP16 for over 200 hours, and gave it a glowingly positive review. Great improvement over OOTP16. The only issue I had with '16 was the slow sim times and overall lagginess of the game. It takes a matter of minutes to sim an entire season in '17, and I find myself spending 99% of my play time making decisions and playing the game rather than waiting for the game to load. The other major improvement I see is the ""needs"" you can set. It prevents all of those, ""I'll give you my 76 year old $30mil/yr first baseman for Chris Sale"" type trade offers you would get in previous versions. Now you get offers that are only in the area you want them to be in. I find myself accepting far more trades offered to me by the AI teams than last year.I suspect that the game has messed with many ""under the hood"" details as the progression of young players, AI evaluations of players (it seems like prospects are valued wildly different by teams), overall player rating changes seem to be much different in this version. However, take that with a grain of salt as I cannot confirm this is the case. If these changes did occur I like them quite a lot, and you can consider this another positive change.The only negative thing I can say about this game is the price. For me, the $40 is well spent for the faster load times alone. If you don't mind waiting, I would advise you to not purchase this version, as the changes outside of the performance boost don't warrant a full-price purchase. Overall, this version of the game had little tweaks, and a huge performance boost, along with updated 2017 MLB rosters. If you liked the previous version, you'll like the new faster version even better.			"

												With little time spent so far (but additional time spent in the pre-release Gold Master Beta) I can already see the significant improvements made in OOTP17 from last year's version. Having spent about 200 hours on a game that I wasn't sure was for me, I became an instant believer. With the 3D visualization added this year, plus the full MLBPA license and tons of historically accurate minor league rosters added this game has a ridiculous amount of depth for the serious baseball fan. There are so many ways to play it's hard to imagine tiring of it well after this year's World Series has concluded. If you have been afraid of statistical management simulators, please dip your toes in the water with OOTP17. I'm sure you'll soon take the plunge like I have.			"

												On the outside looking in, someone who's never played OOTP and is used to simulating Franchises in MLB The Show might be disappointed by how it looks. And they're correct - most text-based games rarely give off an esthetic appeal. This game is one giant exception.While you can easily simulate in The Show, OOTP offers something beyond that. An intense and intricate look at the life of a GM or Manager. Every small detail is present and history actually matters in this game. Everything goes at turtle speed. Playing as a GM and only looking at surface stats, it'll take you anywhere from 8 to 10 hours to simulate a full season. You're obsessed with the finer statistics and you're really combing every team to get you that reliever that will give you the impact you want in the playoffs? Or you're trying by all means to liquidate assets in order to retrieve money to offer an extension to one of your players? Say goodbye to your social life. This game will suck you in and totally make you feel like every insignificant decision is a franchise altering decision. Out-freaking-standing.10/10 with extra gravy.			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. The only drawback is that the interface is not exactly user-friendly but it gets the job done and OOTP does provide tutorial videos/online manual links just before you immerse yourself into the game. If you're expecting ground-breaking graphics like the Show, you're in tough luck, but the amount of control and depth this game supplies users with is extraordinary. Perfect for the ultimate baseball junkie.Would recommend this to anyone. And yes, including non-baseball fans. This game does an excellent job of portraying how the game works and what the job of being a Manager and/or GM entails. Rating: 10/10 "

												It is as good if not better than its reputation. However, still room for improvement there is.Probably not very fair comparing it to Football Manager, but having played both games (FM for years), I have to say the user interface is sub par. Also, when playing FM, a simple tapping of the spacebar moves forward. But ootp doesn't have any keyboard shortcuts(apart from F1 which is HELP) and neither does it allow users to set them.(In case if it is only me who doesn't know where the feature is, I apologise.)Still, I'd recommend this game to anybody who loves baseball and longs to play a baseball management game.

												There's no deeper baseball simulation out there today unless you manage to get a job in a MLB front office. I've been mildly addicted to the franchise for years and this is another great outing but where it really excels is how the customization options allow for the creation of fantastic stories.  The forum on the OOTP website is awash with stories of baseball leagues incorporating the fiction of Fallout(complete with occasional deaths from radiation, drug addiction, and deathclaws), Tolkien(orcs make surprisingly good catchers), Star Wars(Wookie umpires, don't argue with them), or spurring users to create totally new(though probably derivative) fictional universes.If that appeals to you check it out, I can almost guarantee it'll be money well spent for a baseball fan.What follows is a brief story from my first OOTP 17 game. Relatively brief anyway.The universe is mostly ours but the major pro baseball league is the United Nations Baseball League featuring 32 teams, 16 in the Americas(North American Pro League-DH), 16 in the Pacific Rim(Pan-Asian Super League-No DH) each league features four divisions of four teams each, division winners make the playoffs. No interleague play because well the travel would be sort of ridiculous. I started with an opening draft where I'll be guiding my Perth Koalas as GM so I'm relying on the AI to handle the gameday management under manager Shugo Endo. Notable players include local boy Adrian Wall(1B), power hitting Jordan Najera(C), the 22 million dollar man Jesus Suarez(CF), the all-around excellent Alex Ozeguera(RF), and team leader Andy Varner(OF). Despite all those position players the real power is on the mound, where I spent our first three picks on starters Rickey O'Dowd, Mike Davis, and the great Canadian hope Willard Hayward, we also have one of the best closers in the league in Jose Reyes a 21 year old fireballer out of Cuba and a top notch setup guy in Ryan Nance. So that team sounds pretty good, what's the problem? Glad you asked. For starters this GM does not like his manager and most of these players have their own fatal flaws, such as defense Wall, Suarez and Najera would all be better suited to DH work, the guys I have to play defense to shore up these niggling issues like Varner cannot hit period. One of the great things about OOTP(sorry this probably belonged up top) is that you'll see two sets of players ratings, one regarding the view of the league at large and one for your scout's opinion, those two will start to converge, but with that opening draft I'll find myself wondering how much to trust my scout and how much his opinion differs from that of the league in general and I'll be repeating the process in amateur drafts. This is a problem for my Perth Koalas because Varner, our shortstop Davon Jones, and outfield prospect Freddie Kozak are among many players where my scout thinks they are way better than the league does. Luckily pitching cures a lot of ills and with 4 of our top 6 draft picks in the rotation O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward, and Darren Fyfe are cleaning up while fifth starter Frank Rosales is performing above expectations, it helps that Reyes is mostly unhittable and Suarez is playing like the best outfielder on our side of the Pacific. There are injuries to deal with but the first two months of the season sees us pulling away from our division rivals the Melbourne Emus, Brisbane Dragoons, and Taipei Liberty, competing with the Beijing Reds(amusingly because of the name the Reds initially were setup to play in the Great American Ballpark) for the best record in the PASL. Injuries popped up from time to time, but mostly involved our mediocre left field situation(starter Nick Bailey has a .302 OBP and his backup Kenichi Takeuchi hits .217) until the chaos started.A few relievers started to get hurt, annoying but something I can work around as long as the rest of the staff is healthy. The biggest issue was losing talented middle reliever Soetsu Tanaka for the season, but hey at least he isn't Nance or Reyes. Then Reyes blows out his arm, he'll need Tommy John surgery and the man had a 0.99 ERA at the time.Okay, going into June without 2 of our top 3 relievers, As long as Nance is still around and the rotation's intact. We keep on plowing through the PASL, seven all-stars O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward Suarez, Najera, Wall and our third baseman Johnathan Lugo. Our lead in the division is from 15-20 games for months, we are dominant. How dominant, well aside from the massive divisional lead for almost a month Najera and Suarez were in the top five in the league in homers. What I'm saying is that things are good Nance is filling in admirably for Reyes, my biggest problem is that my potential free agents want to be paid and for some reason they want to be paid in American dollars not Australian ones.Najera, leading the league in homers- 20 mil(currently making 10)Aaron Biles(2B) leading the team in average and OBP- 10 mil(currently making 1.4)Suarez(CF) best all around player and fastest man around- not interested doesn't like manager Shugo EndoThen actual problems started. In late July we lose O'Dowd, down for the O'Season. Which means I need more starters and Frank Rosales the initial 5 starter has been traded away because his personality description is literally 'Clubhouse cancer. The kind that gets managers fired' I'm not a fan of Endo, but with Suarez wanting out of Australia I need this clubhouse functional, this may very well be our best shot for a championship for years. The only counter to Rosales' disruptive influence is Varner and he's hovering around or below .200, so I shipped out Rosales for reliever Hideki Sato in early June. Now O'Dowd's gone and I could really have used Rosales right about now instead of an expendable middle reliever. Luckily the lead we've built up is so massive that it won't matter in the division, but in the postseason I wanted to be able to line up O'Dowd, Davis, Hayward, and Fyfe, now it's Davis, Hayward, Fyfe, and some random dude. That's an issue and it's late July so I have five days to look into a replacement. Nobody's available for a reasonable price, so I figure you can win with two and a half dominant pitchers, especially as long as Nance's healthy.In mid-September(after we clinched) Nance goes down for the season. Sato, that guy I got for Rosales in early June is our new closer and he has about a week to settle into it before the playoffs.We win the division with 93 wins, ending the season on a 7 game losing streak and in the process lose Nick Bailey the good left fielder and Ozeguera(RF hitting .298) picks up a nagging back injury that'll last a couple of weeks. Ozeguera can play but he'll be hampered. So we start the playoffs against the 92 win Yokohama Anglers without our best left fielder, best starter, 3 of our top 4 relievers, and with our right fielder constantly complaining about tightness in his back. This isn't ideal. To digress a little this is one of the things that makes OOTP great, in a game like XCOM if you lost that many major soldiers going into the endgame you might reload an earlier save or just start a new game, in OOTP you keep going because there's always another season and maybe just maybe our leadership crew of Varner(hitting .188), Sato(new to closing), and Endo(despised by our star CF) can hold it together and pull off a Grand Championship Series win.Davis starts game one and we immediately hand him a three-run lead, then the offense stops. Yokohama scores one in the seventh, eighth and ninth to tie. Sato's first save chance is also his first blown save. Unfortunately Endo has pulled Suarez, Wall, Ozeguera, and Najera so we don't have any offense left. In the eleventh both teams score two. It goes to the fifteenth before we win on a walkoff slam from Lugo(3B). Only 11 wins to go.If you read through all of this, sorry it's longer than I thought it would be, but I think you get what I'm saying.			"

												I do and do not recommend this game.  Hands down, this is the best organized baseball sim in the market with so much depth.  You can get lost in it for hours.  That said, they desperately need to improve online play.  Beating AI doesn't mean much to me.  I've played online baseball sims close to 10 years.  I really hope the developers see the value in online play and make it more stable and user friendly.  My friend and I run a league and we get so many technical headaches.  He's a web developer and I'm in the tech world too.  It shouldn't be such a challenge.A web based application would be ideal and would bring in a new customer group to OOTP.  So many of my old buddies from the sim world wouldn't even try OOTP because they couldn't be bothered using a program or they simply don't even have a computer anymore.  Tablets and phones rule the world today as evidenced by Intel's latest layoffs.Our league is running on OOTP 15.  I didn't see the need to make my members upgrade since zero has been done for online play.  I guess the file sizes are smaller now, so that's great for my limited bandwidth.  I did buy OOTP 17 and love it solo, but will not buy another OOTP product until I can easily and enjoyably play with my friends.			"

												I've always been a fan of ""Dynasty Modes"" in sports games. I love the feeling of seeing your team win the championship because of the moves you made. That is why I love this game. The amount of detail that was put into this game blows all other game's dynasty modes out of the water. There are multiple leagues of baseball for you to choose from. If you don't want to manage an MLB team then you can manage a Japanese team or a Korean team. That is just to name a few. If you want to just manage what your team does on the field then you can decide to be a manager. This lets the AI do all the team management, but you get to choose who plays. This game is addicting. I have had this game for about a week and already have 35 hours in it. Time goes by so quickly while playing. Who would've thought that a game that could basically run in your web browser could have so much to do?			"

												Incredible, addicting game. There is a reason that this series was the #1 PC game in Metacritic history. It's got everything. Sometimes takes a little while to do the things you want to do to setup a season (everyone wants to dump all the real players in a pool and do a fantasy draft their first time out!) but once you get going it is SO MUCH FUN.

												The first one I had was OOTP 11... and this is not a whole lot different externally, but I have a feeling they've tightened up the trade logic and things like that internally. With 17 it's VERY hard to deal with the computer when trading and come out feeling like you really fleeced the other guy. Which honestly I'm OK with because that's a lot more realistic. So trade-wise it makes you work a lot harder than previous versions I think. The amateur draft also seems a little deeper to me - seems like the draft pool has more guys with higher ratings now - where as before you would look through maybe the first 2 rounds and then there'd be nothing left but 3-stars at the best. Now you have a lot of 4, 4.5 and even some 5-star's still left after like 10 rounds, mostly because their signing demands are ridiculous. Doesn't mean you can't sign them, but you really have to make sure you can handle what they're going to cost you.They've added a 3D game view when playing the actual games where the ball moves a little more realistically... but it's not designed to show the play with complete accuracy... for example, with a runner on 2nd, the ball might get hit to shallow Lt field and the outfielder will field it and quickly throw it to the cutoff but then the cutoff guy will hold it instead of sending it home even though by the timing of it it appears as if it would be an easy out at home if the ball were thrown in. Or when a runner steals second, the pitch will come in and the catcher will hold the ball for 1/2 a second before throwing - so the computer sort of determines the result of a play and the 3D view just accomodates that result irregardless of what the timing of the play really looks like with the ball moving. I still like it better than the 2D view though - especially for home runs - there's almost never a doubt that it's gone when the ball comes off the bat and you can see the shadow of the ball tracking on the ground. All in all, same good old OOTP - lots of hour-killing baseball management fun! And oh yeah one more thing - you can get FIRED if you don't meet the owners demands and/or are just sucking at putting together a winning team! So yeah, hasn't happened to me yet but honestly I think I might be close if my current team doesn't get it done this year hehe... we'll see!So if you've owned previous OOTP versions and liked them or if you're just looking for an ultra-deep baseball management sim, I highly recommend OOTP 17. Pretty much everything you could ask for IMO.			"

Posted: April 5
												Now that I've put a few hours into this game, I feel qualified to give a competent review.I have played baseball simulations my entire life.  I played the Strat-O-Matic Baseball tabletop game as a kid, and I invested in the game on my Commodore 64.  The limitation was that I could only buy one season at a time, and even back then, you could play a season pretty quickly on a computer.  To keep playing, you had to buy additional seasons.  That gets expensive in a hurry, and it's one of the biggest reasons why Strat-O-Matic isn't my game of choice anymore.In 1997, Baseball Mogul came along.  That was a great game for its time, but it was extremely limited in the different displays and statistical breakdowns you could view.  OOTP Baseball debuted two years later, but the first time I heard of it was when I saw a copy of ""Season Ticket Baseball 2003"" on the shelves a few years later.  I bought it, and I was amazed.  You could use the Lehman Database to import actual Major League Players!   Season Ticket Baseball was a rebranding that OOTP did for two years in 2002 and 2003 before reverting back to the OOTP Baseball name.My strategy is pretty simple.  I upgrade my baseball simulator every 3-4 years.  I have owned copies of OOTP Baseball from 2007, 2010, 2014, and 2017.  My reasoning is simple.  The game improves a little bit every year, but it doesn't improve drastically until you get three to four seasons along.  Therefore, I will probably be looking to buy a new copy in 2020 or 2021.  I will promise you, though, that if I'm still alive, I will be buying another copy.I think the biggest way the game has chagned since 2014 are in 1) the fact that they can actually now use real Major League logos and 2) the fact that career progression seems to have improved immensely.  With past versions of the game.  I tend to prefer to play the historical career mode, and it just seemed like declining players had their skill drop off way too quickly on a fairly consistent basis.  That aspect of the game seems to be better mixed now, except I still do think that defensive ability tends to drop off too quickly.  Other than that, I truly think that the only way the game could be improved further would be in adding more reporting options and abilities.  And make everything exportable so I can play with it in Excel.  The GUI is relatively clean, which seems pretty rare in this day and age.  There are so many things you can do with the settings in the game, though, perhaps some of the menus could be organized better.  I'm also happy that they have not succumbed to the modern day tendency to use icons instead of words to label menus because if they did that, the learning curve would be almost impossible.I'm currently playing a truly epic simulation starting as the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1901, and I'm doing as much as the game will allow me to do without cheating.  I unloaded all of my starters except Zach Wheat to land the number one pick in the 1913 draft so I could bring Babe Ruth to town.  A last place finish allowed me to draft Rogers Hornsby and George Kelly in 1914, I won a championship in 1916.  And again in 1918.  Two more in 1919 and 1920.  Now it's 1923, and I'm trying to figure out how to get back to the top.   My pitching sucks in a bad way, and Ruth seems to get hurt a lot.  When Ruth is hurt, I can't win.  In 1921, he was hurt trying to steal a base in game one of the World Series.  I ended up losing against the Athletics in nine games in one of the most epic World Series showdowns imaginable.  In 1922, it got better.  My top four outfielders, including Wheat and Ruth, were shelved for over half the season, and it was only through a late season surge that I was able to catch the Reds and clinch the pennant on the second to the last day of the season.  That was the same game that Ruth was hurt again, this time by a collision in the field.  I got the Athletics in the World Series again, but all hopes of retribution were lost when they took the first four games.  I made a show of it by winning the next three, but it was too little too late.  Now it's 1923.  My entire team is healthy, it's the end of June, and I'm under .500.  What gives? Despite the fact that my pitching, anchored by Dazzy Vance and a newly acuired Walter Johnson, who some are saying is over-the-hill, is much stronger than it has been in some time, my role players are not playing well.  I have plenty of options at C, 2B, SS, and CF who are all defensive stalwarts, but none of them can seem to hit .200 this year.  Did I mention that this game is awesome?I highly recommend the latest version of this game to anyone who likes baseball.  I would estimate that I've put in over 100,000 hours in baseball simulations over the years, so I fashion myself as a bit of an expert.   I can promise you that this is as good as it gets.   "

												If you're looking for a baseball simulator, there's not many, but yet they've almost perfected it. They seem to choose their own terms at times for names of pitches and such, but they're easily googlable. Historic seasons to modern, the simulation runs deep. Very good game with to me a good interface. And for those annoyed that sometimes you pitch and 3 balls happen at once, there's a one-pitch mode and a pitch-by-pitch mode that change that :)			"

												This is a massive game, seriously its insane. You can jump right in and manage any MLB team from as far back as like 1919 or something. You can play with the internation leagues, you can manage a minor league team. The amount of options and control you have is almost limitless. If you ever played 2k myGM or madden or something this is 1000 times more in depth. I really wish something like this existed for basketball, because now looking at 2k myGM just makes you want to play this game. This game fills a pretty niche market, If you like sports, strategy and simulation this is for you. If you don't like all three of those things you probably wont enjoy this game. That's your own fault though, this game leaves nothing not done.			"

												OOTP baseball has now added ""facegen"" pictures of major league players (i.e. some of hte computer-generated images now look like the players due to the MLBPA involvement) and a much-improved 3d screen.  They also added the ability to quickly generate the play of a series between any two teams in history, so you can pit the 1927 Yankees against the 1967 Cardinals in a seven-game series or replay any World Series matchup.As far as the game itself, you can do what you've been able to do in the past. You can take control of your favorite team this year, or other years throughout history and win and lose with them.  Manage a MLB team, trade players, work with minor league teams.  Haven't watched baseball since '94?  Start from there or create a new fictional league (complete with personalities, nicknames, faces) to call your own.  This is a great game, and an improvement over an already great game from last year.			"

												OOTP 17 is a great baseball sim. You get to play with your favorite team while acting as a GM, Manager or both. I like that both the authentic emblems and the authentic major and minor league system rosters are intact. The simulation between days or games is a quick process. What I would like for the game is the upgrade in ball placement around the field. The statistics for defense should be more of an accurate read on the game. And, the 3d view should show more of an detailed improvement. Overall I think this game is a good buy both for those baseball fans who love moding their teams from top to bottom and casual fans who like to have fun as a GM, Manager or both.			"

												This review falls into the ""great game, but ... "" category.I played a ton of OOTP about 10 years ago. Created a custom league, played a dozen or more seasons, and LOVED IT. Spent a lot of time on their forum, and enjoyed the community. Sure, there were some minor problems with the game, but they were just that -- minor.I've kept an eye on the title since then, knowing that sooner or later I'd be back for more. The recent mid-summer sale was the final bit of incentive I needed. I took the plunge and bought OOTP 17.All the new stuff that's been thrown in during the last decade looks damn cool. Problem is, the entire thing seems to be a house of cards. I played 7-8 historical games, and had some problems that took away a lot of the fun. For instance, when starting a new game, and trying to decide on lineups/batting order, the damn game won't show me statistics for one of the teams. (And yes, I've set it to ""human"" control for both teams.) All I get are a bunch of zeros in the stat categories, no matter how I toggle the display.Then there's the play-by-play itself. Very frequently (several times a game), the animation will show a ball hit to one side, while the text pbp tells you someone on the other side of the field made the play. Talk about losing that feeling of immersion.And now the last straw. The third time I tried to open the game, it refused. Turns out this is a fairly common problem, but none of the fixes I found online worked for me. I could keep trying, or wait until the developers work it out (because I'm sure they will, eventually). But there are just too many glitches in the product at this point for me to invest more time in it. Even if I could get it running again, I'm not going to take the chance of getting halfway through a season (or through several seasons) before some other fatal flaw rears its head.Love the game and what the developer is doing. Not willing to pay for a product with these kind of problems.			"

												This is the best baseball sim I've ever played! I got sucked into this game the other night and didn't realize how many hours I had logged. But basically, if you LOVE baseball.. especially the general manage aspect of things then OTTP 17 is a MUST buy.			"

												I just recently got interested in Baseball and was looking for a good video game. A friend of mine recommended that I check this out because the level of detail would help me learn about the game and boy was he right. I've played other baseball games and this blows them out of the water. It's not your usual game where you try to use the controller to hit or pitch to the point it's all about your ability to mash buttons. This game really embraces the thinking aspect of baseball that often gets overlooked. I could not recommend this game enough. I will warn you that the learning curve is kind of steep, but thankfully the OOTP Development website is stocked full of useful information.One interesting example of how this game models baseball so well is that I decided to start a game as Commissioner and GM and picked one of the lowest ranking teams in MLB. I thought it would be fun to stack the team with all the best players from around the league and enjoy the fun of offering low level prospects for superstars and then force the trade. There was just something fun about fleecing some of the best teams of their star players. Once that was done I expected to just run away with the season. Boy was I surprised. Even when simming a game I found myself barely above .500. I had to go back and retool my team because while I may have had bats made of fire that launched balls into the parking lot, my defense was a open as a the US border and let just about everything through. This game taught me that there is more to baseball than just star players, there are subtle tactics that only true disciples of baseball ever really see. With what I've learned from this game I started looking around the real league and suddenly Managers choices started making a whole  lot of sense.			"

												I've played OOTP since 2015 and I would've played it a lot sooner had I heard of it. For such an amazing series, arguably my favorite sports game and favorite sim ever, it needs more recognition than what it has right now. It's everything you could ask for in a sports simulator, and if you've always wanted to just manage a team and not have to worry about playing than it's perfect for you. The most realistic experience you can get with a sports game and the best simulator I've played by far. I'd recommend it to any baseball fan.			"

												I played the hell out of this game, then took a break.  when ootp18 came out, i decided to pick it up again.  i dont know if there was an update but this game is hella flakey now....1st, its a good thing you can edit your players or you would never get any hits.2nd, my complaint originally was that they turn an inordinate amout of double plays...that is still a thing.3rd, and maybe the most frustrating...they get way too many in-field hits.  whether its due to errors caused by my players or just a slow, lobbing throw, they get too many where as my players dont get any.  in a recent game, they got an in-field hit when the ball was hit to first base....yet somehow, still safe.4th, the errors are off balance.  ive played 1/4 of a new season and average an error a game.  i think my opponents have one all together.5th, pitcher stamina makes no sense.  on 5 player rotation my guys are always tired.6th, in-fielder decision making is off...if the ss gets it, why would he throw the man out at first when he clearly has a chance for a double play.  this happens a lot..individually, these issues may not seem like a lot but, overall it makes for a frustrating gaming experience when your guys are doing things that dont make sense...or when you need just one more out and the opponent gets yet another in-field hit...or your team gets an error....i know this is a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥ing but something has changed in this game.  overall it is still deep and fun, but issues like the above almost make it intolerable.  at this rate, i think id take your chances with ootp18 and hope they got the bugs fixed.

(example) 1952 mickey mantel will come into the league, or 1980 rickey henderson rookie year. has many options for management like force trade (i use this alot XD) fast  auto play seasons, or you can play and manage each game and each play. every aspect of the game is in your hands. this is great for those that really get into baseball. PROS:1: the customization2: the data base3: accuracy4: non-demanding5: fantasy teamCONS:1: trading players (wish they would still show up in your roster right after trading) kind of a con2: lots of options (this is a good and bad thing, great for cutomization, but has a big learning curve)3: could be a little more graphical.  but still great for what it is.9/10			"

I know nothing about baseball, but this is the most insanely complex simulation I have ever encountered. Baseball is a game with a lot of stats, and this has every historical league from 1871 to the present day, with the performance stats of 100,000+ actual players. The detail level is crazy. You can almostfeel the rumbling of gigantic gears beneath your feet as the simulation factory churns all this data as you play. It really is quite impressive.

												I have already logged more time playing two games, on OOTP 17 than I did the entire time I have owned 16.Currently playing an ""Exihibition Series""  between the 34 Cardinals and the 78 Yankees, me managing the Cardinals.I'm down 0-2.  Using the 1934 style of play.    First game was a classic Pitchers Duel, between Dizzy Dean, and that Cajum fella, Ron Guidrey,  That went 14 innings, before I lost is 4-2.  The second game was Tex Carelton vs their Jim Beatte, that was a total blowout,  9-0.   Carelton a lunchbox pitcher, gave up 4 runs to a Chris Chambliss Grandslam.  The late great Thurman Munson batting in the 2nd Spot of the order went 5-5.Be advised, I am a Cardfinal Fan,  and I totally despise, the NY Yankee Organization. Seriously, the only gripe I have.  Is the face gens are not right.  For these two clubs.  I can understand, the 34 cards having nothing but white faces.  But the 78 Yankees had  Rivers, Jackson, Randolph and Chambliss, are all Americans, of dark pigmentation, in their starting lineup.It wierds me out, seing these guys, at bat, and on the field and they are as lilly white looking as me.  It is not historically correct.			"

It then launches the application and throws an error that the OOTP.exe has stopped working and closes out. I just purchased this and it has never launched properly. Please advise.I received a response and it gave me instructions to uninstal/reinstall and then set up the trace. I did as instructed and added to the ticket.  Same result. That was on August first.  No response.  Have sent a follow up on the ticket, still no response.  I was really looking forward to this game....I am really unhappy with the result and support.

												I really can't recommend this game at all unless you already know how to play this game or have no problem researching on forums how to properly play the game.  The first thing I noticed when I first started the game was that there is no tutorial on how to begin playing the game.  It literally gives you a message saying visit the forums for more information on how to play....really?  Very poor and lazy on the developers part.  There needs to be some sort of introduction into the game instead of just tossing you into it with no real directions oncesoever.  Also, if you have ever used Windows 3.1 then these boxes will look very familiar.  It looks a bit sharper in the screenshots provided but when you start playing, you will notice the ugly edges on all the charts/messages/etc and it feels incredibly cheap.  I expected quite a bit more polish out of an officially licensed game.  I saw the screenshots but it looks much poorer once you actually start it up and feels like it was meant to be played on an old box monitor instead of on crisp hd monitors.  Some chart boxes looked so poor they almost seemed like they overlapped.  It's like if you took nearly a dozen Windows 3.1 boxes and put them all together and added in some pictures/icons/colored font/etc.The two things I liked about the game was how in depth it is and the player portraits.  The portraits were all in some kind of weird but somewhat realistic looking shots.  David Ortiz looked almost like a claymation version of himself which I thought was neat and looked closed enough.  This is great for a simulation game since once you progress to a point where you need fake players created as rookies then they can just use any random faces and it won't look weird next to the other real players since there are no real player photos in the game to begin with.All in all, I honestly can't recommend this game.  I'm a huge fan of sports, sports simulations and tycoon games but this feels much more appropriate for gaming in the early 1990's than an officially licensed game in 2016.  I do like the direction they are going in and I may revisit this series if they release a game in the future that adds a proper introduction to the game, better looking boxes/charts and possibly some larger bolder font.

												Ugh.  I just can't recommend this.  Look, if you're seeking great major league simulator with all the default options, etc., this is a great game.  Truly, it is.  So if that's all you're looking for and don't have a somewhat recent version of it already, go for it.  You'll love it and it'll be worth your money.  If you're looking for for some non standard action that's going to delve deep into the games various options.  Just don't.  It's buggy.  And worse, several options just flat out exist but don't work.  I set up non standard leagues, really trying to stretch the imagination and utilize many of the games highly detailed options and it's painful to see them flat out not work.  Aaron Harang being drafted in a High School league where you have set the age from 14-17?  Yeah, totally makes sense.  Why even have the option of setting age requirements if you have nothing within the system that actually prevents teams from acquiring them?  Mind boggling.  But hey, if you're not worried about that level of detail, little things like that won't bother you.  And you'll enjoy it.  BUT, if you've bought a previous version in the last few years (I moved from 15), you'll be sorely disappointed.  For $35-$40, not only is it a technical downgrade in some ways (bug related), but there's just not that significant an update.  Madden provides more updates in two years than this.			"

												After playing the game for a bit, I have noticed major flaws with it. I love playing baseball games but this is not the one. For being a simulation based game, the simulation is rough. For example, runners dont tag up on deep fly balls or infielders wont turn what looks like an easy double play instead only goes to first. Also the game has bugs like multiple times a batter has bunted and the ball goes to the outfield before the catcher runs out and throws out the runner at first. And since this game claims to have accurate rosters, it was strange to see Mickey Moniak (2016 1st overall pick to the Phillies) on Cleveland's roster and Riley Pint (4th overall pick to the Rockies) on Oakland's. I was highly disappointed with the game but I believe it has the potential to be the best baseball game on the market, over MLB The Show. I hope the developers can fix some major issues with game in the near future, but for right now, OOTP 17 is not worth $40.			"

												Anyone who is a true Baseball sim fan has bought this already.  But if you are playing it any way other than strict historical, it still doesn't hold up.  Every time I generate a full league of random people and do an inaugural draft, I win 95+ games a season and win the Series in 2-4 years.  Every time.  The AI still can't draft.  (I started on '15.)  For historical players, there must be some sort of extra hidden info that players have to help the AI work.  So if you are playing with real people, of course it is the best baseball sim ever made.  But if you want a baseball sim instead of a Baseball Sim it will just fall flat.Still love it, but wouldn't recommend it.			"

												Game is text oriented with sparce game play animation and a poor but optional text audio engine. Tthe mechanics of play overtake the enjoyment factor by making you focus on the how     to because of the multi page presentation.  The state of  the computer  graphics is a decade or more  behind current game examples. All those news report sections can be removed from the menu of pages and  turned into a radio program which can be set to the level desired.  This would help simplify the menu page display system.The accuracy of the simulattion  is good  and could be the best available,.but when watching in  the 3D mode the AI seems to  makes fielding errors for the losing team  to achieve predetermined results. This takes away from the fantasy of watching a real game being played out. The most desired improvement would be to remove setup of leagues and teams from the active side menus and put it up top where the file menus are and call it options. Second is to make minor league player promotion and demotion as close to a one click operation as possible like clicking on the graphic arrow that displays the move suggestion.Thirdly;   When assigning management of an aspect of the game to an AI manager , like finance, then take away the option from the active side selections.   Illuminate the side bar selection when it is the active screen so player can see where in the process of management they are.			"

												Heavy recommend from a baseball fan that's not usually a big fan of highly complex, paradox style simulations. If you're someone who always checks the box scores religiously, you'll enjoy this game.  Fair warning: the first couple of hours will consist mainly of you stumbling around trying to figure out how everything works.  Pick your favorite team when you start -- it's more fun when you recognize all of the players and the prospects -- but recognize that the first months are going to be rocky given the length of time it's going to take you to figure out how to release that veteran starter that isn't working out, or promote that prospect tearing it up in triple a.  I personally played through half of a season -- one of the great mid 90s Cleveland lineups -- and then started over again once I was confident I was capable of being a competent general manager.Bottom line, if you like baseball and have the patience to spend a couple of hours  mastering the underlying systems, you'll get many hours of enjoyment out of this game.

												A must have for baseball fans. I've played OOTP '15 and '16 and loved both of them. I was initially looking for a live action baseball game and couldn't find one, so I settled on this sim. It is very in-depth and detailed, and almost overwhelming. I learned a lot about baseball from playing this game. As a casual fan I could understand OOTP, but it gives players a deeper understanding and appreciation for baseball. With time, you start to figure out the interface and menus. It is very rewarding to steer your team to victory, sign prospects and watch them flourish, negotiate with free agents/personnel, achieve goals, etc. I WOULD NOT recommend OOTP '17 for people who like to play as GM only. I only play as GM and don't mangae individual games. I really only play to make roster moves. As a result, I don't see this as much of an upgrade from OOTP '16. AI is perhaps marginally improved. If you only want to play as GM, save yourself $20 bucks and get last year's version (unless if updated rosters are that important to you). Other than that, great franchise and worth the money.			"

												I've been playing for years and every year seems to get better. I tend to play historical games starting in 1977.. I'd go through at the end of the offseasons and change the minors to line up with the upcoming season. Now, I don't need to since they added the minor league database to the game! There's a lot to enjoy. You can create completely fictional universes and play from there. You can go back in time and take over your favourite team. You can start in the current day and take over your team and lead them to the World Series.			"

I was lucky to get it the 4 days earlier than available on steam, and am very much so pleased. The core game is the same, but the engine behind it improved, which is the perfect situation for a sim game. On top of that, the speed of the simulations is much faster than the previous version. Definitely worth the upgrade from '16 to '17.			"

												Having played and been suitably impressed with OOTP 16, I re-signed for another year when I learned that OOTP 17 had negotiated with the MLBPA to use actual names instead of random ones, as well as making other, incremental enhancements. As I'm heading into my sixth OOTP 17 sim-season, I felt it was time to share my thoughts on the game while it's fresh. In general, my thoughts are overwhelming positive. Still, it has some rough edges.Pros:- The big one: ""Is it fun?"" Yes, especially if you're a real fan or a serious nerd. (If you're not, it might be overwhelming.)- Incredible level of depth and detail, with deep financial and roster rules that are there if you want to use them, but that can be turned off or delegated if you don't.- The game engine runs from values that are generated from statistics instead of directly from statistics. This is superior to older stat-based systems as they can be more easily adjusted by the game for stat anomalies. It also allows the system to more easily project career stats forward for players who want to use multi-season fictional leagues based on real players.- The AI plays a pretty good game, both when you're against a sim manager and when you're letting the game auto-play. (Just don't let the AI do too much, or you might come back after a month and find out that you have a totally different team than the one you drafted.)- As a GM, you can delegate almost anything you want to your staff. You can choose your level of micromanagement. However, beware ceding control to the AI...- The ""owner goals"" option allows you to work for a fickle bonehead like George Steinbrenner if you want the challenge. (Just be aware that the AI might ask you to do something that truly is impossible, like most real bosses.)Cons (AKA room for improvement):- Like many niche games, the graphics are functional. They're fine for baseball sim grognards, but they won't win many design awards.- The likelihood of anomalies cropping up seem a little higher than they should be in real life, and some things seem to be impossible (I don't think that a Lou Gehrig or Cal Ripkin could ever make their historical streaks).- The UI could still use some optimization.--- I find myself having to click to transition between screens often, and sometimes, the process involves several screen transitions to move back and forth. I think it either needs more keyboard shortcuts (with mouseover tooltips so you can learn them) or perhaps a user-configurable ""most used"" button bar or something.--- There are a number of terms used in the UI that required googling outside of the online documentation to find the answer.--- It's often difficult to find things when you need them, and (see above) the online manual does not have entries for all the screens/options you might need. The game is complex, so it's not surprising, but it's nonetheless annoying at times.--- It took me about five tries to get my fantasy league set up. Using the wizards provided make it easier to do if you want all the defaults, but some of the options I wanted to use lay in the advanced options, and there was no way to enable them if you used the wizard.- The AI trading algorithm could use some work. I had to disable it and run trades manually because my assistant GM kept trading off my key players for minor league prospects in the middle of the season. I hated to do that, because once or twice it spotted a good roster move that I didn't see, but on balance, the AI trading and free agent hiring did much more harm than good.- The player personality and morale system is not ready for the major leagues yet. Use it at your own risk. When something goes wrong on your team (particularly if you have one or two ""problem"" players, it is **nigh-impossible** to narrow down the cause, and the team morale problems it can cause will snowball rapidly. After four playoff seasons, I had something odd happen in the clubhouse, and I could not narrow down the cause. It destroyed the team and caused me my greatest frustration as a player. Fortunately, you can turn it off. I hope they can work out the kinks, because it's a good idea—just needs some more work.			"

												Still the best baseball sim out there.  It can be a bit intimidating at first, but there is nothing that even comes close in terms of realism.  If you love baseball and text sims, this is by far the best on the market.  If you already have OOTP 16, you probably don't *need* to upgrade, but having current rosters is nice, and there are a handful of new features.  The most notable are game recaps and win probability graphs being shown in box scores (this adds very nicely to the immersion) and the 3D view.  I've found 3D to be more of a novelty than a necessity, but your mileage may vary.  On the whole, upgrading to 17 isn't strictly necessary, but you won't regret it if you do.			"

												It's my birthday, so how about I make this year special with my first steam review? I have been playing OOTP since OOTP 15. I have logged 78 hours into the current iteration so far using my Macbook Pro. The gameplay is as great as ever, the details on par with last year with a few minor upgrades. What really bugs me though are the bugs. I recognize that it is still relatively early as  far as patches go, but so far the game has crashed about six times over the duration of that 78 hour stretch. This is extremely frustrating considering that it takes a long time to load your league back up. There is an auto save feature. You can choose to save daily, once a week (which is my default), once a month, or once a year. The auto save feature is handy, but it too takes a long enough time to be a teadious hassle. This is the third time I have had to go from several regular season games in to restarting spring training all over again in one save file. I should add that this is the first season of the save file, so it isn't as if there are dozens of seasons causing a crash. Don't get me wrong, OOTP is great as a series, and I would still recommend OOTP 17 to fans of the sports microsim genre, but the crashes are killing me.			"

												About as detailed a baseball management simulation as you could ever want. Works perfectly well taking over on Opening Day of this season as your team of choice without any modifications, and given the level of detail and the tremendous set of options to tweak that's an excellent place to start. But playing OotP 17 and only running forward from this season is putting a nuclear reactor to work powering a desk fan. Among other features offered by the simulation not only is there nearly the entire history of the MLB as potential starting points at a formidible level of detail (and if that isn't enough detail, the community around this game has added more), but also the ability to invent an entire fictional history of baseball, again with extensive tools already in-game and even more provided by modders.

Keyboard shortcuts would be really nice though as well bit of information on certain affects of playing a guy out of position and maybe options for training would be nice. Overall a real good sim nothing really like nowadays.			"

												My first OOTP game was in 09 and i have enjoyed it then and i enjoy it even moore now it is so much far in advance sence then but now that i have so much to keep me busy for many game years i'm working on right now is a Cali/Nevada high school league or possiable have a Cali/NV sub league something to work on my own and not keep down loading but nothings wrong with that, but I want to work on my own league. I think This is a great game and if it is not rated 10.5 then it is under rated so right now I will get back to my OOTP 17 once I get close to the finish I will post in the forum.			"

												Let me preface this by saying I have played every baseball game created in the last decade, and Out of the Park Baseball 17 is the greatest one ever made.I am a lifelong Mariners, (the pain) and baseball fan. I have a passion in the sport and can rattle off statistics and random info better than I can the Pledge of Allegiance. And I'm not even sorry.This game has everything the inner baseball fanatic in me wants. Complete control of roster, to player sliders, to creating ballparks, expanding the league, accurate minor league systems, actually accurate simulations, and realistic decision making. Yes, ""all you do is stare at a screen"". But it hearkens back to a day of text based Sims that gets me nostalgic just like the great American pastime does.The only downside I have for this game is that I wish I could actually play the games instead of siming them, as in being the player, not the manager, but it's a small sacrifice.Some other cons: the game tends to crash semi often. I am talking about once every few hours for me. But I also play the crap out of it, so I may just be too hard.The salary players demand becomes unrealistic if you max their stats. For example: I traded Mike Trout to my team, and maxed his stats because I wanted to see him crush a bunch of records. He did. But, after his contract was up, he wanted $55 million a year for 10 years. Uhm. My team salary is $200 million lol. That said, you can lower their stats and sign them for cheaper, then raise them again, but I don't like doing that because I want to keep it slightly realistic. The other solution is editing your finances to have a bigger pay roll.All in all, this is an incredible game that any stat minded player will love. Their are endless statistics to pour through, which I love. If you are a fan of baseball, and like number based Sim games, this is what you have been missing your whole life.			"

												About as detailed a baseball management simulation as you could ever want. Works perfectly well taking over on Opening Day of this season as your team of choice without any modifications, and given the level of detail and the tremendous set of options to tweak that's an excellent place to start. But playing OotP 17 and only running forward from this season is putting a nuclear reactor to work powering a desk fan. Among other features offered by the simulation not only is there nearly the entire history of the MLB as potential starting points at a formidible level of detail (and if that isn't enough detail, the community around this game has added more), but also the ability to invent an entire fictional history of baseball, again with extensive tools already in-game and even more provided by modders.

After absolutely loving the game's intrinsic statistics and analasis I got OOTP 17 at 50% off. I've loved the game ever since, putting many more hours that I would of thought into it, from leading my hometown team to a championship, to taking a great team and making it better, this game is just great. Every player has full history and stats, even in the many minor leagues. If you like any kind of strategy game, give this a try. There's always steam refund ;)			"

												Just an incredible game that lets you simulate every aspect of Major League Baseball. OOTP has been a favorite of mine for over a decade and this is the best version of the game since the old 6.51 days. The simulations are deep and realistic. The amount of data at your disposal is incredible. For those who enjoy Football Manager, this is essentially the baseball version of it.With a few tweaks to the AI and 3D system, this could be the perfect baseball game. Highly recommend to any fan of baseball.			"

												This is a remarkable game. I took over the 2016 Mets and loved playing an alternate reality season where Harvey, Wright, Duda (etc.) stayed healthy. I traded for Billy Hamilton and Andrelton Simmons and got as far as the NLCS, which I lost to the Giants in 7. Now I'm halfway through 2017, playing obsessively. The game has such depth, so many details, that you believe you are steering a MLB team for better and worse. Victories are glorious; defeats sting bitterly. I think I'll play these Mets for a decade, until my draft picks are starting players. Dynasty!			"

												OOTP is the gold standard of Sports SIms for a reason, infinitely configurable, customizable - you can be as realistic or as fantasy oriented as you want. Play with strict spending guidelines and current players or go full sandbox with unlimited cash and the ability to draft any player who played the game since 1904. You want Ken Griffey Jr., Honus Wagner, and Mickey Mantle on the same roster? No problem.Playing historically accurate clubs (with historically accurate farm systems) is awesome for an aggrieved Expos fan like myself. It gives me the chance to go back and get the 1994 season Expos fans deserved.If you love baseball, you'll love this game. If you love sports sims, you'll love this game. I picked up the game after the season ended and got it on sale. Glad I did.UPDATE: I nominated this game for the test of time award. The inifite replayability and the infinite possibilities means this sports sim will be installed and played on my PC for along time to come.			"

												As someone who used to play the Championship Manager type football games many years ago, this series has brought all those immersion memories flooding back. Baseball particularly lends itself to this type of stat-heavy game and OOTP17 delivers brilliantly. For those keen on replicating real world scenarios all player names, team and league logos are there. If you want to build your own fictional universe the game will allow you to do that and there are plenty of mods out there that can further enhance that fiction - I've lost countless hours designing logos and jerseys with the tools provided by the extremely talented modders out there. As with most of these annual iterations you have to look at the new features and decide whether they are worth the investment. For me, I benefitted from the recent World Series sale with this version and love the new 3D animation. It's a great alternative to the full match commentary and I'm sure I'll continue to enjoy both options. The FaceGen images are remarkable and, although I haven't played long enough to see this yet, the player images apparently ""age"" over multiple seasons. And I haven't even started looking at the historical replay options yet.Recommended			"

												If you like baseball management simulations, I highly recommend Out Of The Park Baseball 17. It's currently on sale for $10 on Steam, and it is by far the most in-depth simulation of baseball management I've ever played. For example... I live in Grand Prairie, Texas, and my local independent-league team (the Texas AirHogs) is in the game. With the real Texas AirHogs roster. And the simulated players play like the real-life players I've seen play in person. That is an unprecedented level of simulation accuracy, and it really shows how much attention to detail these devs have.Speaking of accuracy... I started this year off as the Cubs (because I'm originally from Chicago and they're my team, World Series or not). At the All-Star break, they had the best record in the majors... two games ahead of the Indians. I also managed to best the real-life Cubbies by having not only my 1B/2B/SS/3B/CF/SP starting the All-Star Game... but I also managed to toss in an all-star catcher as well (Montero, who for some reason became an all-world catcher this season in-game). To put an even finer point on the accuracy... my starting infielders of Rizzo, Zobrist, and Bryant were three of the four guys the real-life Cubs sent to the real-life All Star game, the exception being Russell who according to OOTP is now a 4.5-star-rated SS coming off the bench as a pinch hitter (the game has Baez starting at SS instead of Russell). The CF? Fowler. The SP? Arrieta. Just. Like. Real. Life. The only thing not-real-life about this game is Jason Heyward is hitting like a madman (seriously, in one week he had six homers and 17 RBI)... although not for me 'cause I traded him to the Diamondbacks for Zach Grienke (who's 9-3 with a 3.15 ERA, so I can't complain, lol). Basically, my in-game Cubbies are the boss of the league just like real life. (Now watch them lose Game 6 tonight... :\)If you like simulations of this type, this game will absolutely hook you in. You'll be going to sleep dreaming about how you're going to pull off that killer trade to get your team over the hump... just like real-life GMs.So what are you waiting for? You read this far, now buy the game and go play! Or at least leave me alone so I can finish getting my Cubbies to the Fall Classic!			"

Out of the Park Baseball features a sandbox baseball mode - fictional, historical, modern- all with the MLB blessing, OOTP 17 gives hours of endless fun. The only mistake is the lack of tournaments in the mold of the World Baseball Classic and support for other languages (eg. Spanish, Japanese). Perhaps the MLB license gives a full simming of the WBC in time for OOTP 18, but in spite of this, this is fully recommended for baseball lovers.			"

If you like sports and ever thought of managing a baseball team or starting your own baseball league, I highly recommend getting this game.For those who want to manage, it has a lot. Real players, real teams, and real leagues (from all over the world.) You can start in any year you want starting from 1871 and play as any team from that year. You can also custom the leagues all you want too. It's a really fun manager game.For those who want to run their own league, you can do anything. Teams, players, leagues, ballparks.

												I had been playing a competitor's  baseball sim for a couple of years and was unhappy with their program as the out come of the game could be predicted.  Then came across OOTP in 2010 and found that the outcome was not very predictable, and have been playing OOTP ever since.OOTP is a statistical based game; it can be played historically, historically with fictional players, or make your own league. Regardless of what type of league you want to play, the game puts you in the manager or GM seat.  Build your own team anyway you want, in any era, in any type of league.   Be careful, as your reputation is everything, especially if you want to get a GM position with a more prestigious team.  Be aware of the owner's goals, you could be fired if the team does not produce.  Or, if you don't want to deal with ownership, just play in ""can't be fired mode"".Bottomline, if you want just want to play a mindless ""homerun derby"" sim, thisis not for you.  If you want to play an indepth game that is based on stats that is always being made more realistic, you can't go wrong with OOTP baseball. "

												It's a great baseball sim game, but only recommendable to business and strategy players. One of my favorite features is the historical section keeping records of your team. I would like to see the game have former players and coaches die when they get older. It's odd that a 150 year old man can return and play or coach through commissioner mode (unless anyone has seen it happen other ways).  I would like to see an improved trading dynamic where you could shop a player (say an All Star) and be offered very good prospects or players in return. I have only received one offer of multiple players for one of my own. In addition, the option to pay a certain amount of a player's remaining salary should be available during a trade (think Ricky Nolasco for the Twins). I'm not sure if anyone else has had any trouble with this but I have never been able to develop that guy that hits .300/30HR/100RBI. I've had several guys that could have done it and should do it easily but always fail. My biggest issue with the game is that some star players experience a MASSIVE decline at around 30-32. I made a huge trade for Sonny Gray and got 4 great years out of him but when he hit 31 he was a completely worthless $22m man. The same is happening for Max Kepler now; won 2 consecutive batting titles, MVP and now he struggles to hit .260. I really want that to be fixed.			"

												If building franchises is your thing, OOTP will not disappoint. Countless enjoyable hours can be spent building the team to your specifications.The combination of graphics,strategy and presentation, IMHO, make Football Manager the best sports sim of this genre. There is some debate on the OOTP forums if graphical content is an issue or important at all. Again, IMHO, graphics are important and improved game graphics would make this sim so much more entertaining. Perhaps an investor or two from Shark Tank or the MLB could help speed development.Keep going OOTP, love your sim, it is great, grahpical content would only increase the pleasure.			"

												As someone who used to play the Championship Manager type football games many years ago, this series has brought all those immersion memories flooding back. Baseball particularly lends itself to this type of stat-heavy game and OOTP17 delivers brilliantly. For those keen on replicating real world scenarios all player names, team and league logos are there. If you want to build your own fictional universe the game will allow you to do that and there are plenty of mods out there that can further enhance that fiction - I've lost countless hours designing logos and jerseys with the tools provided by the extremely talented modders out there. As with most of these annual iterations you have to look at the new features and decide whether they are worth the investment. For me, I benefitted from the recent World Series sale with this version and love the new 3D animation. It's a great alternative to the full match commentary and I'm sure I'll continue to enjoy both options. The FaceGen images are remarkable and, although I haven't played long enough to see this yet, the player images apparently ""age"" over multiple seasons. And I haven't even started looking at the historical replay options yet.Recommended			"

I'm now back onto an actual gaming desktop and instead of playing a lot of the AAA games that I own, I'm still sticking with this game.No greater feeling in this game than watching a prospect your draft/sign turn into an abosulte beast and becoming the franshice player for your team for the next decade+.This game is easily money well spent be it on sale or full price.

												I've logged more hours on the OOTP series than I ever would care to admit.  As someone who is a huge baseball and sports sim fan, the game's pretty much got it all.  At this point it's really just a matter of tweaking and improving existing features each year.  Maybe implement something wherein your salary as a GM or Manager actually means or gets you something.  But I've built dynasties in NPB, MLB, and even PECOS when I was looking for that next challenge.  While the learning curve is a bit steep at first with the sheer amount of options available and things to manage, it becomes considerably easier to manage and the simming day-by-day throughout an entire year seems less tedious as you recognize the sheer amount of moving parts you have to tend to as GM of a baseball team.  For the ambitious sports sim fan, or the Baseball Mogul player looking for more, I'd highly reccomend.			"

												This game was absolutely not what I expected it to be. I just expected it to be one of those lame baseball simulation machines that you just played until you were so bored out of your mind that you had to stop playing or else you would go mad. This was certainly not so. The simulation engine is surprisingly realistic, as the results of a simulated season came out quite similar to how the MLB is in real life. Even the breakout players like Vincent Velasquez had a breakout season in the simulation, even though I could not find any major indicators of how this was so. The interest stories in the game make it all the more fun, and the overall control one can have over a team, or a league for that matter, is intxicating. The amount of work put into the game has shown in its quality gameplay, while some games work tirelessly on improving graphics while trying to have the player play a full 9 inning game where the mechanics engine doesn't run realistically, the developers have worked on the actual simulation experience, while working on making the season as realistic as possible. I honestly don't believe that any one person could experience every situation and human interest story possible in the game in even so much as a full 1000 hours of gameplay. This is a franchise that is like good cheese, (and I know what good cheese is like!) it only gets better the older it gets. Also, this is far more enjoyable that any 2K baseball game that I have ever played, although I know that's not really saying much anyways. This is all I can say about this game, that it is well worth your money and countless hours that you will inevitably waste on it as well.			"

But now that I own 17, I must say it's the best yet. The new game recaps are really nice for adding more detail and interest to each game, on top of the new additions to the minor league depth and adding minor leagues to the historical side.Of course my main style of play is still the fictional mode, which is still just as good as it's been. Due to spending most of my time on that, I haven't really done a lot in the modern mode yet. But if you love baseball or management simulations for sports, this is worth getting.			"

												This years edition of OOTP doesn't disappoint, as usual. This game has never failed to build off the previous year, and 17 is certainly no exception. The first thing you notice when you open the game is the official MLBPA and MLB licenceing (yes!). Personally, I have been awaiting this feature since I began playing with OOTP 15. The new design is sleek and original. And finally you don't need mods to get the player faces which is definetly a plus. I do wish that generated players had faces as well, but that's obviously a minor thing and definetly doesn't impact gameplay.I've never been one to really watch games often, but the options you have in game are just fine. Sure, I wish there was an option to choose your plan for every pitch and be able to play the game (like most people) but that's not really the point of the game. Playing the games does however give you plenty of control and gives you the feel of being the manager.Where this game really shines as always is the deep variety of options to truly make each league your own. I messed around with a lot of the settings in previous years and have found the formula that works for me. This games mechanics are nearly flawless, the only slight issues being the AI trade proposals (which, as usual, are as dumb as ever that it's impossible to keep them on), and that the game seems to run a tad slower with other programs running on the computer, as opposed to prior years. In addition, injuries seem to occur MUCH more often, which isn't necessarily a terrible thing, especially because you can change those options. A lot more players seem to become ""wrecked"" in comparison to previous games, which can become annoying. However, these problems do not come close to bringing this game down.As usual, the OOTP developers have not tried to reinvent the wheel, which they don't need to. This series has given me hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The official licencing by MLB is no doubt the biggest change and upgrade over last year. For the casual OOTP player who doesn't care too much about updated rosters and the forementioned changes can stick with last year. This game, however, is worth the price, for $10 or $40, as there is endless fun and no micro transactions (please please please don't). My Yankees franchise is 18 years in, and have 4 championships. I know, not great but hopefully many more to come. "

The online forums are good to and a great place to get tips on the game. Now, I just need to find me an online league that interests me. I recommend this game to any and all baseball fans.			"

												The best baseball simulator out there.  Really the best sports simulator.  Very deep if you want to micromanage everything.  I typically set all the minor league stuff and even the major league depth charts to automatic and just focus my energies on the stuff the GM would normally do (trade, sign/resign players, draft, etc.)  I don't play GM mode though because I like the option of jumping in and managing if needed.One tip to new players - check the 'cannot be fired' box.  It is frustrating to no end getting let go right before the year your hot prospects were going to pay off.			"

												I've played this game since OOTP 14, and still recommend it to everyone. Highly polished and is open ended enough where you can play as minimal or granular as you like. The simulations are fantastic but playing the game leaves a bit to be desired in regards to graphics and immersion - the playing of the actual games, not the game itself, is rather coin flippy and I dont feel if I pitch outside, or swing every time really plays a role in the outcome - ive yet to hit a homerun, but everything else is rock solid. Give it a shot if you enjoy simming. This is a gem.			"

												I've been playing iterations of this game for about 6 or so years now, and have played ""franchise""/general manager modes in baseball video games for about 15 years. As it should, this game does it the best. The game is more accurate than any other simulation in terms of player progression and strategy's effect on team performance. The game really shines in its historical replays - not only do player statistics stay reasonably close to real life, but putting past prospects who never panned out into different organizations or roles can actually yield some pretty realistic results. However, the game does have its rather frustrating moments from time to time. For example, in the most recent franchise I started, the league expanded after 2016. I tried going into ""commissioner mode"" to undo this since I didn't want to play 2017 with the ""Indianapolis Beavers"" in the NL Central, but was only able to delete teams - the expansion draft was still scheduled and unable to cancel. I know there are advanced settings you can manipulate before starting each playthrough, but I like having these changes happening in the game's future. It's just that sometimes OOTP seems too quick in making those changes (another playthrough had the NL adopting the DH rule after 2016, although I'm a little more okay with that). Another qualm I have is with player progression. Although I did mention that this game is more accurate than any other (well, I guess that means more accurate than The Show since that's really the only other baseball game left on the market), past playthroughs seemed to continually favor the same players over and over again. Example - in one of the more recent versions of the game, Matt Adams would consistently break through in every playthrough and slug 40+ homers every year, to the point where I'd just start every season with trading for Matt Adams for an easy 10+ years of Hall of Fame-caliber play at First Base. I haven't played enough of this year's version to say that this is still the case, but the game still seems to mostly ignore fringe cases where old players make huge comebacks (ex: Bartolo Colon) or minor league journeymen finally getting it together and putting up superstar seasons (ex: Josh Donaldson). In this sense, the game seems fairly linear - only the players with high ""potential"" ratings will flesh out into solid everyday players and anyone past 30 years old is incapable of improving or making a comeback. Still, though, the game is more complete than anything before it and seems like it'll stay that way for a while. This year made some great improvements in the coaching system, allowing you to fill your organization with coaches aligned with your baseball philosophy (smallball, sabermetric, etc.) and the opposing General Manager AI seems improved, as negotiating trades on ""normal"" difficulty is much more tougher and realistic (although there are still some holes here and there). If you're a baseball nerd and haven't played OOTP, I definitely recommend this game. However, if you own past versions of the game, I'd say OOTP 17 is pretty much only worth it for the statistic and development updates - if you're on the fence, it might be more worth it to you to wait until a Steam sale as the core aspects of the game (player progression, AI, etc.) haven't changed too much.

												This game was absolutely not what I expected it to be. I just expected it to be one of those lame baseball simulation machines that you just played until you were so bored out of your mind that you had to stop playing or else you would go mad. This was certainly not so. The simulation engine is surprisingly realistic, as the results of a simulated season came out quite similar to how the MLB is in real life. Even the breakout players like Vincent Velasquez had a breakout season in the simulation, even though I could not find any major indicators of how this was so. The interest stories in the game make it all the more fun, and the overall control one can have over a team, or a league for that matter, is intxicating. The amount of work put into the game has shown in its quality gameplay, while some games work tirelessly on improving graphics while trying to have the player play a full 9 inning game where the mechanics engine doesn't run realistically, the developers have worked on the actual simulation experience, while working on making the season as realistic as possible. I honestly don't believe that any one person could experience every situation and human interest story possible in the game in even so much as a full 1000 hours of gameplay. This is a franchise that is like good cheese, (and I know what good cheese is like!) it only gets better the older it gets. Also, this is far more enjoyable that any 2K baseball game that I have ever played, although I know that's not really saying much anyways. This is all I can say about this game, that it is well worth your money and countless hours that you will inevitably waste on it as well.			"

												As many of the other people posting a review here have stated, this is the best sim available if you want to work in the front office for any major league team.  I waited until I had finished a complete season before posting this review, and I can honestly say it was better than I expected.  Trying to improve your team over the course of the year, looking for players, dealing with injuries, it's all here.  The only negative I have is that it seems like the AI always wants to send you very unfair/unbalanced trades.  Maybe it's because I'm on a rebuilding team, but if I'm trying to rebuild, why do I want to trade away my only 5* player for a 1* prospect with a ceiling of 1.5*?Unbalanced AI initiated trades aside, this game is a great value for any baseball fan and I highly recommend it!

												Like all great Strategy games, OOTP creates a believeable world you can immerse yourself in, always leaving you one more thing to do before you go to bed.Amazingly it does it with what are in effect just spreadsheets, and a highly technical subject (dont know what Rule 5 drafts are - you will).  This will be quite a barrier for a lot of people to get over.  But it is worth it.The game is a winner because of the stories it creates that linger in the mind.I am in the 20th year of my fictional league.   It is bottom of the ninth in the 7th game of the 2036 world series and my team is down by three runs.First up to the plate is my catcher Okuma.  This guy has been a big disappointment.  He was a great player who I signed to a big $ long term deal.  But he has had a bad year - so bad I brought up a minor leaguer at the end of the year to catch.  But I put him into my playoff roster as cover and my manager has decided to use him.  He gets a hit.Next we have Rodriguez.  He is my 'moneyball' guy.  Just great at getting onto base and on minimum wage.  My scouts hate him as does my manager.  But I have forced him to be used as a starter and he has put up great numbers.  He walks.Herrara now comes to the plate.  I picked him up as a throw-in on a big trade many years ago and he has been pretty good (although the guy I traded has been better).  However my owner has set me a goal to get a better centre fielder, so keeping him on is risky.  He gets a walk.Bases loaded and Koot comes up.  This guy is Mr Mediocre. He is only on my playoff roster because I had one space left and could not think of a good reason not to use him.  I have never really paid him much attention - he is one of those guys you have to rest your real players.  Why my manager has put him into the game in the bottom of the 9th is a mystery.  And then he hits a walk off Grand Slam home run to win the World Series.No doubt Mr Koot will soon be playing elsewhere, I will still be annoyed at the money I am wasting on Okuma, I will still be battling my manager to use Rodriguez as a starter, and Herrara will have gone to make my owner happy. But I will remember those guys...It is stories like this that makes this a great game.			"

												Pay no attention to the just under two hours playtime I have. I've been playing OOTP ever since the first iteration in 1999. OOTP has established itself as THE premiere hardcore baseball simulation dethroning the venerable - and still very good - Diamond Mind Baseball. OOTP 17 is the best iteration yet and the AI manages like a pro so do not underestimate it. That said, be prepared for surprises as baseball is a very unpredictable game. Perhaps the best way to review OOTP is to compare it to other textbased baseball simulations. I've decided to compare it to Baseball Mogul 2015, Diamond Mind Baseball, and APBA Baseball for Windows.1. Seasons: All seasons from 1871 to 2016 are free in OOTP. Similarly all seasons are also free in Baseball Mogul. In what I consider a boneheaded move, APBA has stopped free seasons with its newest iteration. The old game was glorious with Ernie Harwell announcing the game. Seasons were imported from the Bill James Baseball Encyclopedia. Now, there is no way to import seasons. Like Diamond Mind - which charges 25.00 or more per season - , you will be paying hundreds of dollars or more to have a complete history of Major League Baseball.2. Endorsements: OOTP is the ONLY baseball sim endorsed both by MLB and the MLBPA.3. Customization: OOTP rules the roost and the other sims cannot compare. Perhaps the closest would be Baseball Mogul as it allows you to creat a universe of any teams in MLB history with a few clicks. I would love to see this feature implemented in OOTP. But, OOTP allows you to creat real minor league seasons; something the others simply do not do.You really are free to create the baseball universe that is your very own, When you compare the proverbial bang for the buck there simply is no contest. OOTP is the king of baseball sims. I should add that this iteration is the most user friendly. OOTP has a great user community as well as a number of excellent videos for th baseball neophyte.PLAY BALL!!			"

												Let me preface this by saying I have played every baseball game created in the last decade, and Out of the Park Baseball 17 is the greatest one ever made.I am a lifelong Mariners, (the pain) and baseball fan. I have a passion in the sport and can rattle off statistics and random info better than I can the Pledge of Allegiance. And I'm not even sorry.This game has everything the inner baseball fanatic in me wants. Complete control of roster, to player sliders, to creating ballparks, expanding the league, accurate minor league systems, actually accurate simulations, and realistic decision making. Yes, ""all you do is stare at a screen"". But it hearkens back to a day of text based Sims that gets me nostalgic just like the great American pastime does.The only downside I have for this game is that I wish I could actually play the games instead of siming them, as in being the player, not the manager, but it's a small sacrifice.Some other cons: the game tends to crash semi often. I am talking about once every few hours for me. But I also play the crap out of it, so I may just be too hard.The salary players demand becomes unrealistic if you max their stats. For example: I traded Mike Trout to my team, and maxed his stats because I wanted to see him crush a bunch of records. He did. But, after his contract was up, he wanted $55 million a year for 10 years. Uhm. My team salary is $200 million lol. That said, you can lower their stats and sign them for cheaper, then raise them again, but I don't like doing that because I want to keep it slightly realistic. The other solution is editing your finances to have a bigger pay roll.All in all, this is an incredible game that any stat minded player will love. Their are endless statistics to pour through, which I love. If you are a fan of baseball, and like number based Sim games, this is what you have been missing your whole life.			"

My only gripe is that like every simulator, they fail to account for something with Kansas City and rountinely have them hugging the bottom of the rankings. While concurrent real life events unfold entirely differently. I find this a bit annoying. But if you tinker with the editor you can compesate this for the most part. I will say this:  READ THE MANUAL.  Everything you need to know is there. But sometimes stuff is hidden too deeply. A better tutorial for new players would be greatly appreciated. That being said, there is no denying that if you are a casual or hardcore baseball nerd you'll love this one. I do.			"

Previously, this was the main problem with this series)- the overall game have a better engine- the difficulty is still intriguing and have been improvedThere are, however, still some problems:- the AI works really well in some ways, terrible in others. In particular, seems to manage the trade system not really well and doesn't recognize so well the ability of the players- the main interface is still difficult to navigate, I still miss some sections after 20 hours of play! It have to be improved.Ways for improvement, excepting what was already said:- more leagues, at the same speed simulation... difficult, but this can be great- and a particular request: earnings calculated also for minor league players :)			"

												I've been playing iterations of this game for about 6 or so years now, and have played ""franchise""/general manager modes in baseball video games for about 15 years. As it should, this game does it the best. The game is more accurate than any other simulation in terms of player progression and strategy's effect on team performance. The game really shines in its historical replays - not only do player statistics stay reasonably close to real life, but putting past prospects who never panned out into different organizations or roles can actually yield some pretty realistic results. However, the game does have its rather frustrating moments from time to time. For example, in the most recent franchise I started, the league expanded after 2016. I tried going into ""commissioner mode"" to undo this since I didn't want to play 2017 with the ""Indianapolis Beavers"" in the NL Central, but was only able to delete teams - the expansion draft was still scheduled and unable to cancel. I know there are advanced settings you can manipulate before starting each playthrough, but I like having these changes happening in the game's future. It's just that sometimes OOTP seems too quick in making those changes (another playthrough had the NL adopting the DH rule after 2016, although I'm a little more okay with that). Another qualm I have is with player progression. Although I did mention that this game is more accurate than any other (well, I guess that means more accurate than The Show since that's really the only other baseball game left on the market), past playthroughs seemed to continually favor the same players over and over again. Example - in one of the more recent versions of the game, Matt Adams would consistently break through in every playthrough and slug 40+ homers every year, to the point where I'd just start every season with trading for Matt Adams for an easy 10+ years of Hall of Fame-caliber play at First Base. I haven't played enough of this year's version to say that this is still the case, but the game still seems to mostly ignore fringe cases where old players make huge comebacks (ex: Bartolo Colon) or minor league journeymen finally getting it together and putting up superstar seasons (ex: Josh Donaldson). In this sense, the game seems fairly linear - only the players with high ""potential"" ratings will flesh out into solid everyday players and anyone past 30 years old is incapable of improving or making a comeback. Still, though, the game is more complete than anything before it and seems like it'll stay that way for a while. This year made some great improvements in the coaching system, allowing you to fill your organization with coaches aligned with your baseball philosophy (smallball, sabermetric, etc.) and the opposing General Manager AI seems improved, as negotiating trades on ""normal"" difficulty is much more tougher and realistic (although there are still some holes here and there). If you're a baseball nerd and haven't played OOTP, I definitely recommend this game. However, if you own past versions of the game, I'd say OOTP 17 is pretty much only worth it for the statistic and development updates - if you're on the fence, it might be more worth it to you to wait until a Steam sale as the core aspects of the game (player progression, AI, etc.) haven't changed too much.

												Like all great Strategy games, OOTP creates a believeable world you can immerse yourself in, always leaving you one more thing to do before you go to bed.Amazingly it does it with what are in effect just spreadsheets, and a highly technical subject (dont know what Rule 5 drafts are - you will).  This will be quite a barrier for a lot of people to get over.  But it is worth it.The game is a winner because of the stories it creates that linger in the mind.I am in the 20th year of my fictional league.   It is bottom of the ninth in the 7th game of the 2036 world series and my team is down by three runs.First up to the plate is my catcher Okuma.  This guy has been a big disappointment.  He was a great player who I signed to a big $ long term deal.  But he has had a bad year - so bad I brought up a minor leaguer at the end of the year to catch.  But I put him into my playoff roster as cover and my manager has decided to use him.  He gets a hit.Next we have Rodriguez.  He is my 'moneyball' guy.  Just great at getting onto base and on minimum wage.  My scouts hate him as does my manager.  But I have forced him to be used as a starter and he has put up great numbers.  He walks.Herrara now comes to the plate.  I picked him up as a throw-in on a big trade many years ago and he has been pretty good (although the guy I traded has been better).  However my owner has set me a goal to get a better centre fielder, so keeping him on is risky.  He gets a walk.Bases loaded and Koot comes up.  This guy is Mr Mediocre. He is only on my playoff roster because I had one space left and could not think of a good reason not to use him.  I have never really paid him much attention - he is one of those guys you have to rest your real players.  Why my manager has put him into the game in the bottom of the 9th is a mystery.  And then he hits a walk off Grand Slam home run to win the World Series.No doubt Mr Koot will soon be playing elsewhere, I will still be annoyed at the money I am wasting on Okuma, I will still be battling my manager to use Rodriguez as a starter, and Herrara will have gone to make my owner happy. But I will remember those guys...It is stories like this that makes this a great game.			"

												Well, this is the fourth straight year I've purchased OOTP, and it's a baseball sim that gets better every time. It's one of those rare simulators that if you can think about doing it, you probably CAN do it. Looking forward to poring over the new feature that now has every minor league player dating back to 1919. Will a world exist out there that has Michael Jordan making the major leagues? Possibly.

												Great game for the most part if you like management games. In game graphics getting better also from 16, otherwise more or less the same. Here are the bad things: 1. Trades don't work properly. Normal is too hard, easy is too easy... there needs to be a setting where the trades are fair. 2. Schedules are far far too difficult. If you want a standard 3 year schedule it's almost impossible to figure out how... and whem you think you set it up properly you can't prove it. Would be simple to create an interface to do this since the hard work of creating the schedule files has been done...  but obviously not a prioritiy3. AI Managers make mistakes on where to field people... something is a little off in the algorithm that sometimes ends up with a fielder playing out of position unnecessarily.			"

												I've been a baseball fan my whole life and have played baseball videogames my whole life and I have to say OOTP17 is one of a kind. If you're looking for an MLB The Show clone or something along those lines this isn't it. OOTP is a purely GM/Manager game but it's jam packed with depth. I currently have 40 hours in to the game and I haven't come anywhere close to scratching the surface. You get to manage your whole franchise from Dominican Rookie Leagues all the way up to the MLB. Even if your present day team isn't good you can go back and relive the glory days by starting in ANY YEAR EVER in MLB history.Overall this game has an amazing amount of depth and I would highly recommend it to any baseball fans.

												I've logged more hours on the OOTP series than I ever would care to admit.  As someone who is a huge baseball and sports sim fan, the game's pretty much got it all.  At this point it's really just a matter of tweaking and improving existing features each year.  Maybe implement something wherein your salary as a GM or Manager actually means or gets you something.  But I've built dynasties in NPB, MLB, and even PECOS when I was looking for that next challenge.  While the learning curve is a bit steep at first with the sheer amount of options available and things to manage, it becomes considerably easier to manage and the simming day-by-day throughout an entire year seems less tedious as you recognize the sheer amount of moving parts you have to tend to as GM of a baseball team.  For the ambitious sports sim fan, or the Baseball Mogul player looking for more, I'd highly reccomend.			"

												If you like baseball management simulations, I highly recommend Out Of The Park Baseball 17. It's currently on sale for $10 on Steam, and it is by far the most in-depth simulation of baseball management I've ever played. For example... I live in Grand Prairie, Texas, and my local independent-league team (the Texas AirHogs) is in the game. With the real Texas AirHogs roster. And the simulated players play like the real-life players I've seen play in person. That is an unprecedented level of simulation accuracy, and it really shows how much attention to detail these devs have.Speaking of accuracy... I started this year off as the Cubs (because I'm originally from Chicago and they're my team, World Series or not). At the All-Star break, they had the best record in the majors... two games ahead of the Indians. I also managed to best the real-life Cubbies by having not only my 1B/2B/SS/3B/CF/SP starting the All-Star Game... but I also managed to toss in an all-star catcher as well (Montero, who for some reason became an all-world catcher this season in-game). To put an even finer point on the accuracy... my starting infielders of Rizzo, Zobrist, and Bryant were three of the four guys the real-life Cubs sent to the real-life All Star game, the exception being Russell who according to OOTP is now a 4.5-star-rated SS coming off the bench as a pinch hitter (the game has Baez starting at SS instead of Russell). The CF? Fowler. The SP? Arrieta. Just. Like. Real. Life. The only thing not-real-life about this game is Jason Heyward is hitting like a madman (seriously, in one week he had six homers and 17 RBI)... although not for me 'cause I traded him to the Diamondbacks for Zach Grienke (who's 9-3 with a 3.15 ERA, so I can't complain, lol). Basically, my in-game Cubbies are the boss of the league just like real life. (Now watch them lose Game 6 tonight... :\)If you like simulations of this type, this game will absolutely hook you in. You'll be going to sleep dreaming about how you're going to pull off that killer trade to get your team over the hump... just like real-life GMs.So what are you waiting for? You read this far, now buy the game and go play! Or at least leave me alone so I can finish getting my Cubbies to the Fall Classic!			"

Out of the Park Baseball features a sandbox baseball mode - fictional, historical, modern- all with the MLB blessing, OOTP 17 gives hours of endless fun. The only mistake is the lack of tournaments in the mold of the World Baseball Classic and support for other languages (eg. Spanish, Japanese).

AI demands are just insane and I end rarely to complete a fair trade. You can just fool the AI by including 5 stars prospects that you know they will never be a major league player in the trade.Pick it up during this sale and you will probably be sastisfied for hundreds hour of gaming.

												OOTP is the gold standard of Sports SIms for a reason, infinitely configurable, customizable - you can be as realistic or as fantasy oriented as you want. Play with strict spending guidelines and current players or go full sandbox with unlimited cash and the ability to draft any player who played the game since 1904. You want Ken Griffey Jr., Honus Wagner, and Mickey Mantle on the same roster? No problem.Playing historically accurate clubs (with historically accurate farm systems) is awesome for an aggrieved Expos fan like myself. It gives me the chance to go back and get the 1994 season Expos fans deserved.If you love baseball, you'll love this game. If you love sports sims, you'll love this game. I picked up the game after the season ended and got it on sale. Glad I did.UPDATE: I nominated this game for the test of time award. The inifite replayability and the infinite possibilities means this sports sim will be installed and played on my PC for along time to come.			"

												This game has just about everything. It gets better and better every year with no signs of stopping anytime soon! And I'm sure if somebody wanted to add close-up VR-type action to this franchise, they could. I dont mind if they do. I love this statistical♥♥♥♥♥♥ Numbers are baseball. A person could just look at the stats and see the ballgame just like they were in the stands watching it! Keep doin what you're doin, guys! Thanks!rpl593			"

												If a baseball simulation can be called ""sexy"" it is OOTP17.  This is not a casual simulation either, there are bells and whistles buried in layer upon layer of simulation tweaks.  The only aspect of this excellent baseball simulation which I found less than  great is the rather less than intuitive navigation at times.  Finding the right page in the encyclopedic volumes of this game in order to execute sometimes simple actions can be much like trying to make contact with a Hoyt Wilhelm knuckleball.   Aside from the aforementioned pickiness on my part, OOTP17 excels in all of the aspects of an excellent sports simulation/management game.   What I would like to see next year....a more realistic 3D play mode...go for it guys and put PC Sports Gaming back in the map, in every way!			"

I learned to love baseball because of this game.Obviously it's a little hard to pick up as it is so intricate, but it's so much fun once you get it. Thank you so much developers for making such a gem. Thanks!			"

												I've loved baseball for my whole life, and it seems hard to explain to many in my generation why.  A lot of people think baseball is boring, but more than any other it's the thinking man's sport.  This game focuses on the strategy of it all, the sheer amount of numbers and math is probably more massive than most other sports combined.  I've always felt there's a lot for strategy gamers to like in baseball, and this game scratches that itch better than any other management simulation I can think of.  There are a few interface niggles (some more tooltips on icons, and a few menus are placed in unexpected locations) but overall it's a monumental achievement.			"

You can transfer your save files when the new version comes out every year, which is a huge plus to get the gameplay additions while not having to start over your franchise.			"

Only basic stat categories and how its played. But for you to truly appreciate achievements of players or teams knowledge is a must. Iz may not be for europeans :)But from management pwrspective its 10/10. Even back stories and news aroud the league are great.Would recommend it.			"

You can play any team from any year in major league league history, or create your own teams and leagues.  I prefer to play it like it's Baseball Executive Simulator, but you can also play as the manager on the field.  I can't recommend this game enough if you're a baseball fan and looking for a very detailed, customizable, and fun baseball simulator.			"

Since they came to steam I have been more than happy to always support the guys.This is truly one of the most customizable sports games one can get, they're always adding new features and rules when they come into play.Three years ago I had a huge 90 team league, I then shrunk it down to 4. I just turned on the evolution mode so the league will expand at it's own rate. So far nothing has happened but I'm eagerly awaiting changes.			"

You can even configure the league to do things like decrease the accuracy of scouting so the game can be more unpredictable. Nice game.			"

												I've just been playing OOTP baseball for the past two weeks, but I am really enjoying it.  The amount of options are simply incredible. You can play the game on the surface, playing individual games, or quickly replaying World Series, or you can go as in-depth as you want, recreating entire seasons, developing your minor league system, play international leagues, etc.  I've also discovered that there is  a big mod community, that offers even more diversity to an already immense baseball simulation. The only downside is the technical aspects of game itself.  Because the game is so large, you are almost forced to customize it to your liking, and this is not a simple task.  The manual is not what I would call user-friendly, as it had my head spinning a few times with its assumption that I knew what it was talking about.  Now this is all ok if you have some computer expertise, but I am a simple fan of gaming, and have never been even remotely been a computer wizard.  So I am rather baffled much of what the game could offer. The answer to this problem is simple.  The Developers could have done this work for the user, and had every coded to allow for more options via hotkey buttons.  Instead, you have to find such-and-such a directory, and start typing in lines of code.  Hate that, as that is not what I expect to see when I buy a game. So right now ... after two weeks ... it is very much a love it/hate it, kind of thing.  I love the power of the game, and its ability to use every player who ever played major league baseball.  But hate that it makes me feel ignorant and stupid with regards to computers.   Conclusion:  I will keep playing it, and I would recommend it to someone who enjoys baseball, but with a warning that it is very complex and not for the faint of heart. Likely not the answer for the very casual gamer.			"

												What an absolute MASTERPIECE.I am absoultely in love with this game. From the ridicoulously well created historic teams, to the perfectly constructed current rosters; this game has it all. The pure amount of customization available for your league is mind-numbing. You can tinker, and explore any and every kind of setting that you can think of for your league (obviously within reason.)But with all that in mind, my most favourite mode has to be Fictional League. Creating your own baseball world that lays down it's roots as teams grow and expand, along with enriching your history... has to be one of the most satisfying and interesting gaming experiences I've ever had. Sometimes, it will take me 30mins - 1hr to even play a game when I boot it up, because I'm looking back on history from my league (CBL - Canadian Baseball League)As you may have guessed - I am a baseball fanatic. As a baseball fanatic (As I'm sure many of you are), there is so much that can go wrong with a sim like this. Some how, OOTP Developments swerves it's way through the obstacles, and created this classic sim, that I will continue to play for a long, long time.EDIT: Even my best friend, who is not a baseball fan WHATSOEVER, tried the game out when he came over to my house. Even he - who has no interest in simulation games, let along baseball - had a blast created a fictional baseball world and drafting his team from scratch.			"

I cannot stress how well-developed this game is. Even not being a huge baseball fan, the development of the game really drew me in and I am truly addicted. The historical basis of the game, being able to start anywhere at anytime, is so massive. You can start your league in the 1960's and simulate all the way to the present day and see how different MLB would be. It awesome.			"

												If you love management sims and baseball then this game is for you. Out of the Park Baseball 17 provides a deep simulation experience that any baseball fan can enjoy. Keep in mind that you're not controlling the player like you do in games such as the show. You manage things behind the scenes as the GM, Manager, or both. The game really comes into it's own when you get creative with your personal goals and the teams you control. If you can think of it OOTP probably allows you to do it.			"

												The ultimate game for a baseball junkie. I can't think of anything that you can't simulate in this game. However: If you are just a casual baseball fan and/or not really interested in the management side of the sport, this is not the game for you. For those who don't know, you can't 'play' the game yourself, but you can act as the manager. It's kind of like the Football manager series vs Fifa/pes. I would only say that this game isn't as much build as a 'game' in terms of the presentation, and that can be good or bad depending on what type of player you are.			"
