												If you like Surgeon Simulator, or QWOP for that matter, then perhaps this game is for you. Not for the impatient, this game has you using several keys to align and aim a shot, nock an arrow, and ""attempt"" to hit a target. Simple concept, not easy to execute. If you're willing to sit for a bit twiddling around your keyboard then maybe you'd be able to get the controls to at least shoot after about a half hour. When your patience runs as thin as mine, you'll find yourself rather frustrated rather than entertained. For those who can perform a fun run of QWOP, then go for this game because I'm sure if you can get that down, this should be a piece of cake. If you're impatient, skip it. Now excuse me while I bang the last ten minutes out of my head by smashing my head on my desk repetitively. 1/10			"

												This game- can make you beat the cr*p out of your computer. it's an awkward FPS. And if you think the game is easy, well, it isn't. You have to manipulate you wrists, shoulders and elbows (and shoot, obviously).  Although the game becomes easier once the commands are mastered and lacks replay value, Probably Archery is effective in achieving its goal: applying a cumbersome control scheme to a skill-based shooter.  PA features a lot variety of gamemodes (including shooting a horde of muscular apple-headed men running towards you,training mode,some multiplayer gamemodes,etc). Once you master the controls a bit, you can find the game quite funny.7/10			"

												Probably Archery is just that, a game about archery. It seems like it's some sort of simulation, but I'm not quite sure. The controls take some getting used to, and hitting targets takes a lot of practice. The key element, fun, is missing here. There's no fun to be had, and it's all thanks to the controls. The controls are so awkward and unnatural that it takes longer to hit a target than it should. The graphics look fine for an archery game but they won't blow anyone away.I personally expected a more casual experience here, but I guess I should've known better. If you don't shy away from difficult games, then this might just be for you.[Rating: 55/100]			"

												Tried to shoot a target. Shot through the air instead. Tried to nock my arrow..the arrow ended up on the wrong side of the bow (making aiming impossible). Tried to shoot an apple off a guys head while he was sucking down liquid bravery....I killed he and his cronies...never quite killed the apple. Tried to eliminate a flying egg infestation....knocked over a table, destroyed a bunch of china, got three of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s! I then got hacked up by a warrior before I could nock an arrow. Hence the Probably in the Probably Archery title. You probably can do it....if you practice, practice, practice, lol. Try not to hurt yourself in the process.One of a number of games that feature wrist, elbow, and shoulder controls or the like (Surgeon Simulator and Ampu-tea are a couple other titles like this). So, it can be frustrating, but the results are better when you fail miserably lol. I intend to keep letting the arrows fly.Yet to be rated. Probably ends up a solid quiver full of arrows with a few broken shafts.			"

												I'm sad other reviewers don't recommend it due its difficulty. If you buy an archery game and you mean only to shoot arrows like you do in Skyrim, TF2, etc, then archery isn't for you, don't buy it.This is an archery game where you take control of every single move you make:Left upper armLeft forearmLeft fistRight upper armRight forearmRight fistYou take an arrow, put it on the bow, aim and shoot, simple as that but it isn't simple.It's like Surgeon Simulator, I'm a bread, QWOP, Octodad but with bows and arrows.PROS+ Kinda unique+ Fun+ Hard, but not THAT hard.+ Nice theme (well, I've always liked archery)+ Various game modesCONS+ Bad models, you aren't even a person :/+ Takes some time to fully understand how to properly control it.+ Not taken very seriously, it had potential.It isn't great but it isn't bad either, I liked it, it's a casual game 7/10			"

												I was challenged to play this game for at least 15 minutes and then write a review. Well, after 15 minutes I still couldn’t effectively draw an arrow, knock it and successfully shoot it anywhere near the target. The controls are like trying to sew a button onto a silk shirt with square hands. This game has your hands all over the keyboard.  So I moved onto another mode after failing at target practice. I found 10 modes, such as; the berserker, Noose, Zombie Soccer, and more. Since I never could master nocking an arrow and aiming, I certainly couldn’t play any of these panic style modes.  I wanted to write a witty review for this game, but I just want to be done and far away from it. 3/10, would SteamTroll			"

												This game is absolutely zany.  I'd recommend this for people who like to tinker or concentrate *REALLY* hard on playing a game well.It's an archery simulation from a FPS view, where you have individual control of each of the shooter's arm joints.  You can only control either left or right wrist/elbow/shoulder at a time, not simultaneously.At first, it is confusing as hell.  Then shortly after, it becomes a little sensible but still extremely difficult to control.  With time you can learn to shoot rushing bad guys, moving targets, or even cut a rope from a person who is about to be hanged, Robin Hood style.Check out a few videos, like this, before you purchase.

												MY GOD THIS GAME! It took me almost two freaking hours to complete target practice, eight simple still targets. I can't even think about ADVANCED targets where they actually move around. The controls are god awful, half the time you're struggling to nock the friggin arrow because even though my hand is right on the string it says my arrow is too far to nock, because apparently your balloon head can't send the appropriate brain signals to your sack of potato body to complete a simple task! Then if you miss (witch you will, many many times) it's such a pain in the butt to draw your arrow and line your arms up correctly, and make a sad attempt at shooting. I could keeping going on on how bad the controls are but, for the sake of this review I'll leave it for you to experience. The game was meant to have bad controls after all.Despite how much I wanted to shoot myself with an arrow and end it all, I can't help but love it. I love the charm of the game and the feel of it, the sountrack is great, and it's a very humorous game.As much as I wanted to rage quit I persevered, and it felt so rewarding when I finally beat target practice. I could live in peace knowing I wasn't a failure at life. Once you think you get the feel for the game you are challanged with a whopping 10 game modes! (including Target Practice, Advanced Target Practice, The Berserker, Don't Miss, Warband witch is my personal favorite, Eggsterminator, The Noose, Zero G, Zombie Soccer, and Multiplayer). Each having their own unique premise and challanging your archery skills to the max!Do I recomend this game? Surprisingly I do, but that is IF you're up for the challange and how well you can handle rage inducing controls. Like I said it feels good when you manage to beat target practice or any of the others, I mean can you blame your potato sack for being such a horrible archer? Seriously if you're looking for a game that offers a challange look no farther. 7/10			"

												I've played this game since the 7DFPS version and trialed the demo when it was on Greenlight. The concept of the game is unique and interesting, but the execution of the full release leaves a bit to be desired and seems to be a stray shot.Getting the hang of the controls is half the fun. However, once you understand how the bow and the arms work (as a veteran of Probably Archery, and probably a real-life archer), the challenge is significantly diminished since repetition of the correct technique is not at all difficult. Unless you're going for pinpoint accuracy and high scores, you can beat all the minigames within 20 minutes.The minigames need much more depth. There are several shooting gallery-like levels, with the more interesting ones including the charging Berserker and the Warband, and the need Eggsterminator one is a chuckle and the most fun. The problem is that these minigames are single-level experiences, with the exception of the Berserker, which only has four very quick levels. I don't imagine it's difficult to code in different levels for each minigame (different target layout, more challenges, etc.). Unfortunately, you'll get the feeling of ""Wait, that's it?"" when you complete a minigame.I can't get into any multiplayer games. I don't know whether it's because not many people are playing it, or not many people around me are playing it. Nonetheless, that seems to be where the most replay is, with Team Deathmatch and Horde Mode with multiple waves. But it'd be nice to have single-player versions of those too.I have no idea why Zombie Soccer is part of this game. It feels like a side-project tacked onto the game to add value. I haven't been able to actually play an online match, but it otherwise doesn't look or feel good.Basically, the game has good mechanics but poor replay value. There's simply no depth to the minigame experience. Most of the time spent in the game is figuring out how the controls work, but once you've mastered that, it's not something you'd probably go back to. In some ways, the free Greenlight Demo was more enjoyable -- and free. To pay ~$10 for this game, I'd expect more replay value.			"

They have to change the both-hands-elbow-shoulder-controls to something else. Otherwise this is literally bull♥♥♥♥.In the real life, this is easier than this.

												If you feel you'd appreciate a game where archery isn't just aim-slightly-higher-than-the-target then this is for you.It lets you do stupid things like notch it at the top of the string and draw the arrow out sideways (instead of directly away from the bow)!Obviously this level control begets difficulty, but with practice the controls become usable.I don't think I'll ever get swift at it, but competency isn't impossible.That said the humour is excellent and they have included an array of gamemodes (including a few multiplayer types).It's not a ""long game"", and for some it will just be for the novelty.Great to see someone making this kind of stuff.

												I have never negatively judged a game as quickly as I have Probably Archery, and I hope I never get another game that gives me the same reaction as this game has.I'll preface this by saying that I don't own any of the Sungeon Simulator-type games, so maybe I'm not the target audience for this game.  I received a coupon for the game and gave it a shot. While I've had buyer's remorse over games that delivered with content I wasn't expecting, this the first game I bought where I felt I was ripped off based on the underwhelming content-to-price ratio.What this game has is promise and premise. That's where the beauty of this game ends, and the ugliness emerges. I'll start by saying the controls are not user-friendly or intuitive at all. Some games, especially games that require reflex controls, have a higher learning curve to fully get into the game. I don't think this is one of those games. I would go as far to say that it feels like the controls were selected arbitrarily, without any real feel to the mechanics.This game, like QWOP, is a testament to how over-burdened controls hinder a game's potential, unless it's a cult-favorite. Judging by my experience, and others, this game doesn't qualify as a cult-favorite.			"

												Literally QWOP archery. There's no 'trick' to it though. it requires good 'depth perception' in a flat 3d environment and it takes a lot of time to get used to and learn how to play. I don't recommend it unless you want a difficult to learn but interesting physics 3d experience.			"

												Playing with Rift + HydraThis is absolutely great fun, and it's just the perfect example of how to get the best from your Hydra. It takes a little practice to work out how to draw the bow without feeling like you've got some sort of physical deformity, but in the end it rocks like a geological formation thing.Persist with the practice, and then have some great fun with the Warpack mode or whatever it's called - it's almost as tense as playing COD Zombies!

												Intuitive interface. Almost like QWOP, but actually playable.Surprisingly, this is one of the most enjoyable games I've played as of late. The hassle of attempting to control all of your joints, and fire a few shots before getting utterly obliterated, is an absolute blast.Worth it. Even if it's still in development, it can only get better at this point.			"

												I played this game for about a half hour.  Or rather I tried to actually put the arrow on the bow for about 5 mins total.then I adjusted my bow and arrow for 23 mins total. I acutally shot the arrows for about 2 mins. I hit one target by carefully aiming and  resetting the bow and trial and error. I hit another one outta pure luck. I guess if you like the frustrating nature of these kinds of games, you will have fun. Or have OCD. I may be a little bit of column A and a little bit of column B.			"

												probably archery is like being drunk and having no control over your own arms while trying to shoot a bow and arrow at near impossible targets. if you are looking for a game where you can shoot arrows at nothing (even with a decent amount of practice) and drop arrows all over the ground and feel like a complete moron, then this is the game for you. there are many different exciting modes in this game to fail hard at, and with hours of practice you might be able to hit the edge of the closest stationary target in the target practice mode, then you can take 5 minutes to load another arrow and take just as long to get your arms where they were before and probably miss. if you love shooting things with bows and arrows play skyrim or farcry if you want to feel like you have ALS and a irresponsible jerk hands you a bow and says i guess you might be able to do this but probably not. then this game is for your sorry @ss and may god have mercy on your soul. -9/10			"

												The Game in which Rambo learned to use his bow. I rarely felt so accomplished when hitting a target like in this game, or even get my first arrow fly through the air. I play the game with the XBox360 Controller. The game itself is really difficult at first. If you play it for the first time you most likely think, wtf controls?!? but after a few minutes you get used to them, and from this point on, you start to improve continuously.

												Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/probably-archery-game-review/Well, this is certainly unlike anything I've ever played. Think QWOP and Surgeon Simulator, but with archery and an extreme increase in difficulty.I can't even play the game properly. I cannot fire an accurate shot to save my life. I spent a good while in the target practice mode and not once did I hit any of the targets. I had some luck in another mode, where there were these apple-headed humans running towards me with swords. I would fire my arrow just as they were in front of me. That worked up until the game sent two of these guys at me simultaneously, then I failed, just like I did in every other mode.Both hands need to be manipulated in order to fire an arrow. The left hand wields the bow, while the right wields an arrow. There's several different methods to adjusting your aim, but good luck getting anywhere with it. It takes some serious skill to be anywhere near good.There's plenty of modes to try out, even a multiplayer zombie soccer mode, which I was not able to play due to lack of players online. There's actually a few multiplayer modes, including team deathmatch and a co-op wave-based 'horde' mode (all of which I was unable to try). I had the most fun with the target practice mode though. So many objects to hit, yet I missed every single shot. I was amused at my abysmal performance. I'll probably never be good at the game anytime soon.Probably Archery does support gamepads, so maybe I would have had more luck there, but the game is fun nonetheless.			"

												Probably Archery could probably try a little harder in the controls department.  Some of the menus such as after a match such as Berserker cant be navigated with the controller.  Using a mouse is no big deal since their just menus not gameplay parts.  Playing the game is very complicated, to fire an arrow you need to adjust your two arms, each arm has three joints the, wrist, elbow, and shoulder.  Once you get them aligned you can fire, the big down side is once you draw a new arrow for some reason the positions switch all over so if you miss its difficult to realign your target again.  This game seems like it could be interesting if you master the controls to get a high score, but players who dont care about a high score might not be interested in this.Rating:  1/10  Value:  $0.50			"

												Great game for people willing to stick it out. It seemed a bit arbitrary to me how the character works the bow, half the time he was stringing it wrong but it makes sense once you've played it enough and remember to work both the arms rather than try and minimalize the use of one. I've yet to get how to play Zombie Soccer or any of the other Multiplayer games, but then I also haven't had much luck finding a lagfree game. The single player modes for the game seemed ridiculously difficult to me at first, but after sticking it out I've so far completed ""The Noose"" and ""Don't Miss"". Once again, I recommend this to players willing to stick it out and learn the mechanics (if you've played games like Toribash and learned to play this probably applies to you). I'm hoping to see how the multiplayer fares once there are more players out there, but this was definitely worth the $12 and is currently, as I'm writing this, going for $9.			"

												As a owner of the Razer Hydra and the Oculus Rift Def Edition, almoust every game with a support is a musthave for me.1.The Oculus Rift support works fine for me. Just the Crosshair in the menu is not in the middle, what makes it a bit strange ( not hard ) to fix the gamemode i want to play. -  Would be nice if you could fix this, but it isn't a must have.2.The Razer Hydra support sucks a little bit. Seriously, i want to hold my razer hydra controller for the bow like a bow and not like a fishingrod straight ahead. You know? I mean bow like this -> I , fishingrod like this -> -- . Cause it makes it realy hard to aim in this position and after a few minutes my wrist began to hurt. - Would be REALY REALY nice if u could fix that issue, soon, cause games like this are the reason why i baught a hydra controller and my heard is bleeding if the movement sucks in the end.3.I didn't tried it out with the keys and the mouse jet, but with hydra and oculus i managed to hit a few targets realy as i want.Just had to stop after a while cause my wristpain was getting to big as i explained. But i think if you fix the two points it would be with surogeon simulator one of the most enjoyable and most playable games which supports oculus rift and razer hydra.Looking forward to see new Updates :)Ps: Sry for my (eventualy) bad english :D			"

												At time of writing, I am going to not recomend this game. Probably Archery is, a good idea with a flawed exacution.  It is trying to be in the same vein as Surgon Simulator, or QWOP, or Ampu-tea, where the idea is simplistic and the controls want to make you break your keyboard over your knee.However in exacution, the design is horriable, complicated and far to frustraiting to be enjoyable.  You control three diffrent aspects of the arm, shoulder, elbow then wrist for aiming.  You have to notch your arrow and draw back and let it fly.  There are no crosshairs, and is done by pure blind luck.This is fine for this kinda game, you shouldn't need crosshairs, however, is I re-string my arrow, I should be aiming at the same place, not with this game, the type of strange controls you need to adjust your arms and aim is so frustraiting it isn't even fun.  Also some of the game modes expect you to work absurdly quick and be precise, which is asking quite alot of the player with these kind of sluggish controls.There are plenty of diffrent game modes to keep anyone intrested, and none of them are serious, its silly and kinda unique, I really do applaud the developers creativity for this game, and I honestly want to like it.However there is hope!  The developers have been doing minor updates, giving even more game modes and are tweaking the controls to make it slightly smoother, so, maybe one day they will overhaul it.  When they do I will overhaul this review to praise it right up there with Surgon Simulator.If the game is on sale and you really want to pratice archery in strange settings I would say buy it if its at a decent price.  There are alot of neat ideas here on display, and it has a load of potential to be fun instead of frustraiting.			"

												This is basically ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY: THE GAMEThe controls are HORRIBLE:>It forces inverse Y and X axes for your mouse movements. It makes manipulating your wrists and arms very complicated, and that's bad considering this is an aiming game. You know why is there no option to change this? BECAUSE ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY.>Every time you shoot and then grab a new arrow, your right arm does not go back to its previous position. It insists on going somewhere else, and you have to fiddle around with your elbow and wrist controls just to nock the arrow again; AND if you don't position your hand exactly like you did on your previous shot (which is very likely), you will have nocked the arrow in a completely different direction and now you either have to redo it or have to adjust your left arm holding the bow to compensate, which is just as annoying.The game would probably be fun if you're extremely good with the controls, but it is not at all worth the effort to get to that level. I really believe this game would have been great, but the controls are just really bad. No, don't think that they're challenging, they are just bad. Unplayable bad.CONCLUSION: DON'T GET THIS GAME			"

												It's almost fun, and it's almost interesting, but it isn't. I wish it was, beacuse this game could have been a lot of fun. I know the idea is that it's supposed to be goofy, and I get the controls are intentionally difficult, but there's not really any desire to learn them. The modes are all just forms of target practice. It's a shooting gallery game with broken arms and absurd expectations. The environments are typically just open grassy fields. Space and the gallows are the only interesting maps, due to their unique themes- zero-g archery and a timed perfect shot. It just feels like there's nothing really to this game, you know? The art isn't appealing, or the seemingly random bits of lag you may get going between pause and gameplay or after a key shot, and neither is spending three minutes aiming at something less than 10 meters away to not hit it, lather, rinse, and repeat.Ultimately, I'm just glad this was from a bundle, and that I didn't pay $10 for this. 4/10			"

												Probably Archery is amusing.  The controls are pretty horrendous, but that's kind of the point.  You struggle and try as hard as you can to figure it out, then fail miserable and fire an arrow straight into the ground... or the sky... or you accidentally drop it because you let go of the wrong button.I spent just under an hour playing the game.  In that time, I went from struggling to grasp what was needed and having trouble grabbing the bowstring to being able to fire off arrows rapidly (but with no accuracy or sense of direction).  After some practice, I was able to complete the basic targets.  I tried shooting the hangman's rope, but couldn't get the accuracy down in the short time you have to succeed.  I tried shooting an apple off of a person's head like William Tell.  It did not go so well.  Fun, but I managed to sink an arrow into the target's head and its neck instead of the apple.  I also tried shooting flying eggs in a china shop.  I managed to hit 6 before I was fired for breaking too much stuff.  I strongly recommend using a controller for the game.  I found it to be less frustrating than the keyboard/mouse.The primary reason I purchased it, however, was for the VR support.  Unfortunately, the game will not detect the Rift (DK2) and I have been unable to fix it.  The development team has also been quiet on and future support or updates, so it is hard to know if they will be doing anything about it.  I cannot recommend the game without knowing if bugs or issues will be fixed.So short version:Fun, frustrating game, but VR support is not working with DK2.  If you bought it for a fun, frustrating game like Surgeon Simulator, you'll be happy.  If you bought it for VR support, you'll be disappointed.			"

												The idea is nice, feels like it has potential, then you spend lengths of time getting punished for not learning the ropes fast enough.Everything here just feels thrown together aside from the arms themselves. Nocking the arrow is one of the more abysmal features, which could have worked, but there is no actual indicator of if you got it in right or not, seeing how I put the mid of the arrow against the middle of the bow, nothing happened there, but something happened touching it with the point of the arrow...Every single asset is stock-made, and I can't get that out of my head while playing the entire way through. Heard/seen them all before, and the full price says otherwise. Change it for honesty's sake.Okay, maybe one non-stock asset, the balloon guy... that face of doomsday's texturing and holey arms are just painful to look at.One thing to consider when you release a game like this... is this what you would spend on? Or is this better played on a free games hosting site? Compare your game to both of those, then to your own. This feels like a game I would play on a free games hosting site... I mean there are a good amount of game modes, so there are in plenty of those games on the hosting site. This game has no depth, goes as deep as your arrow flew, aiming around every joint in your arms to fire is about all they are centered around and don't go far beyond, seeing the only change is the targets.Learning the game started fun, but all you are learning further than how to shoot is just shoot faster... which you work out by yourself mind you. You might just need to stay in target practice for most of your time playing to get there, while all the other game types are tempting which you WILL lose at trying if you haven't gotten your speed to perfection... in a QWOP-styled game, where the aim isn't on completion for QWOP, this one here calls apon completing objectives... Re-play QWOP, devs. There is a bit you missed if you are referencing that at all.Now... that zombie soccer game thats slapped in hereI ran into a few bugs launching it, and more than I can stand for a launch.firstly, it loaded available servers. Saw one, then hit back to go back to the main menu... it connects me to that server on the list as I hit the back button.when I joined I actually could not join a team/play/do anything aside from alt-F4 my way out. Not boding well.in conclusion: Waste of all my resources getting to play this gameyou will start, you will see potential, then it will be shot down by your unwanted time just in training.			"

You don't have cross-hair and to position the arms and the hands are really an annoying thing, have to move it milimeter per milimeter.The idea from the game is good and can be enjoyable for few people, but is frustating at the same time.

However I do not reccomend this game for the simply fact that I believe that a game have to be something to entertain people not annoy. "

												Attempted to play this game for ten minutes. It was an absolutely horrible experience. It's also extremely uninspiring to put in the time to master the overly complex controls, as the game just looks all around terrible. DO NOT BUY.			"

												Review as of version 1.0Horid mechanics, keyboard is damn near impossible to use.  Xbox 360 remote works a bit better, But it is still completley f()cked upI give it a 1 out of 10 , just for  the concept.-------------------------------------New review played on 4/12/15After giving this game another try I have seen they fixed some of the problems. The keyboard is still too difficult for some NON simulation game players. I switched to a  gamepad and It made it alot easier to move.If you are not a Simulator game player, I would not buy this game. It is more complicated mechanic wise than other Sims I have played.If you are a Simulator Game Fan . you will love the complexity of the game  that keeps it feeling real.I would give it a 5/10			"

												There is nothing probable about it: Probably Archery is a game that Most Definitely BLOWS. One of the worst things I have ever tried on Steam. It came in a bundle I got for something else. You can't just shoot the bow like you can in any other game. You have to painstakingly maneuver the hand by moving the mouse, and hold other buttons to move the arm at the elbow and the shoulder to move your arms and joints correctly to shoot. They can work my joint for making such a unnecessary used tampon of a game. I quit trying after about five minutes because this is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid lol. I would rather give myself a bunch of paper cuts on my tongue then clean urinals with it than ever play this again.And no I didn't buy this. It came in a bundle I bought for something else.-714/50			"

												Stupid difficult and not even enjoyable in the slightest. Do not buy, cannot possibly recommend as its difficulty is beyond comprehension or reasoning, Surgeon Simulator is the way to handle clunky controls and still manage to be fun and challenging, this game is just flat out hard, unfair, and unfun.

												This game is a lot like surgeon simulator, only with a bow. Just as frustrating as surgeon simulator can be, but without all the messy blood spraying everywhere, and with bows instead of a saw. Interesting game, and I would recommend it to people who enjoy the same mechanical game play as surgeon simulator.			"

												NOT RECOMMENDED. If you liked Surgeon Simulator for some reason, then you might enjoy this. For the other 99.9999% of people out there, avoid this like the plague.PROS:-NoneCONS:-AWFUL controls-Zombie Soccer mode has no relation to the rest of the game. It is a very poorly implemented flash-quality multiplayer ONLY mode (but no players)-Noone plays multiplayer (obviously, since the game is awful)I really don't understand why people waste time developing this garbage. Only reason I got it was part of a bundle with other games I wanted.			"
