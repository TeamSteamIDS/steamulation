												Like mini golf? Well then you're going to love this game. It does a great job simulating it with some good humor , this game is great for all ages. The holes to be played aren't too hard, and its just a great casual game that is fun all around. Highly recommended!			",3024,1129,139,313,428,33,475

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/10140		

Cute game nothing fantastic but there are only a few mini-gulf games on steam right now.There are 4 characters with 2 outfits in 2 colors each to pick from that all play the same.You can also change the ball color too if you want to spice things up a bit.The courses have themes like wild west, Inca(or Mayan) temple, space, amusement park, and a few others.Most have more than one way to complete them with off & hidden paths that make it easier to get a hole in one.There will be power-up in most levels like jump, fire, glue, bomb and a few more but most don't seem to help much.2-4 player mode is only allowed on the same system but there is no timer so you're not rushed swapping people.The editor is vary basic and just lets you build on a 4x4 grid and you can't use any of the themed stuff.Overall its not bad the themes are interesting and feel very different from each other. Looking for the best way through some levels add replay ability.It won't blow you away but it's a good mini gulf game.			",2247,770,108,301,266,34,404

												The graphics are okay and the hole designs are creative but the gameplay leaves something to be desired. Carefully planning and crafting an approach to each hole followed by watching your perfectly executed shot drop delicately into the cup is the magic in mini-golf. This game lacks that appeal for several reasons. The controls are limited (you only control direction and power) as there is no ability to put backspin on the ball or angle the ball off of your club. The physics are cartoonish leading to frustrating moments where reality does not align with your plan. Additionally, certain objects and boundaries/walls within the holes themselves are not modeled very well and can never be trusted to bounce where one would expect (imagine running in an action-oriented game in a wide-open field then being halted by an invisible wall).Edit: Realized this game was made in 2006. My expectations are lowered but the comments above are still applicable today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looking for something completely insane and totally useless. This is the game for you. Four courses of unbelievable mini golf impossibility, four crazy characters, power-ups, obstacles, tournaments and a course editor. 3d Ultra have made some interesting games out of simple ideas and this is another of those. May not have the longevity of games like Killing Floor, but will leave you a zombie none-the-less and the kids will enjoy it.			",416,157,32,26,54,11,60

												I had a lot of fun with this game.  It's a very light-hearted approach to mini golf, and the music is really cool in a lot of places.  The controls are a bit frustrating at times, but how many games get those right?  A completely G-rated, easy going game that everyone can enjoy.  Or when you need a break from blowing things up.

												Removed after just 1 hour playing: with the ball I have ended in a ""no man land"" where there is no way to exit (any kind of touch just gave ""out of bounds"", whatever the intensity or the direction). Moreover, controls are awfully weird. This kind of bugs and the low quality user interface make the game impossible to be played. Just a waste of money and time. DON'T TAKE IT EVEN FOR FREE!
