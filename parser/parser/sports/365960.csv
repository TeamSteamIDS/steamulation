												I ve played hundrets if not thousands of hours of the non-steam version so dont get tricked by the hours played here on steam. rFactor2 is the most realistic, hardcore racing simulator out there. It most certainly lacks in some departments compared to the competitor sims but what matters the most to me- the driving experience, rFactor2 destroys anything else on the market. Its tyre model is so detailed you really need to know what you are doing in order to replicate results from real life race. This is the sim that helped me to understand how hard racing can be and showed me atleast small fraction of what real life racing drivers have to go through in pursue of victory. The rF2 community takes full advantage of the wide moddability and thanks to the steam workshop, this is now made even better and easier with everything being updated automatically. Realistic day and night cycles allow players to replicate some amazing WEC races. There isnt anything more rewarding than finishing 8 hour race after 2 driver swaps. Long races is where all the features of rF2 come to life. If you are here just for a 10 lap quickies, rF2 is not going to shine as much as on realistic race lenghs.Combining the fact that rF2 is the most pure and raw hardcore experience available with the fact that Image Space Inc are not bunch of profit seeking leeches, rF2 is a nobrainer.All new content released by ISI is free for all people already own rF2, no paid DLCs, no microtransactions.Love this sim.

												I've been playing rFactor 2 since the beta was released in 2012. I will tell you this - rFactor 2 is the best driving race sim out there, bar none. The force Feedback is sublime (with a decent wheel), the AI is the best in the industry and the overall race experience is just unparalleled. Unfortunately, if you're looking for multiplayer racing, the online component has always been, let's just say, unpopulated... The only way to really get any good MP racing has always been to join a league (of which there are plenty). Hopefully this move to STEAM will fix that and we'll finally have some populated pub servers for pick-up racing.I'll be honest, nowadays I get my MP fix with iRacing, but rF2 is my go too sim for single player racing. It's just so damn good. I'd really love to see that change now that rF2 is on STEAM. Just need to get some new players to take the plunge. Pretty decent modding scene as well, that's only getting better.Fair warning, rFactor 2 does take a pretty beastly rig to run and is really only truly enjoyed with a decent FFB wheel and pedal set. This is not one for the hand-me-down old laptop users. For those I'd recommend rF1/GTR 2/Game Stock Car.			"

												After owning pretty much most sims in the market - I was skeptical about this one- especially after trying the demo-But i kept hearing good things about it and the demo doesnt seem to reflect that- so i thought i took the risk and get this- Put it this way i own 100% content  for all tracks and cars in iRacing(not trying to compare) i still love iracing- but after owning this and the lifetime membership and racing online and felt the tyre deg feel on this one- i have not log on to the other sim. Its that freaking good- not gonna lie it takes a bit to learn and just like a good coffee- its much harder to grind and press your own cup vs getting nespresso capsule and putting it into the machine- but the ""taste"" is totally different - you'll know it- thats what I felt with Rfactor 2 - the real coffee that is grounded fresh and pressed properly- it takes patience to get it right - but oh boy but when its right -need I say anymore.

												I've had this game well before the steam release and let me say this: the core of this game is being a sim and I haven't found another that does it as well.Each sim has it's strengths and weaknesses, the strengths with this one is the hardcore simulation of a car on the dynamic track coupled with some of the best racing a.i I've experienced, top of the line FFB and it does this all the while not being the most friendly in the first 5 minutes. Don't flip it on, run a lap and give up. This is a simulator, you have to ease in and likely make some tweaks to set it up exactly how you want.Assetto Corsa has more drift car mods, pCars has better graphics, RF2 has better simulation.

												Confession of an Assetto Corsa fanboy...Rf2 is the better simulation. If you love racing it's a must buy. Quick pros and cons+ The tire physics and force feedback is the best I've felt in any racing game. You really feel connected to your car and the track.+ The AI in Rf2 is fun to race with..my internet is crap so multiplayer is not an option for me.+ Graphics look great imo, Assetto is the better looking game but Rf2 is not ugly..make sure to turn the HDR on+ Performance with AMD cards have greatly improved since a year ago. My 7990 hd system can run 20 cars at steady 60fps now with all settings turned up. A year ago it was unplayable with constant stuttering. + Good variety of cars...from a 60s grandprix car to a modern stock car.+AC cobra...OMG the cobra in RF2 is AMAZING...way better than Assetto's.+Sounds overall is great esp the AC cobra...however some cars sound a bit weak like the NSX+New content regularly and not DLC-Loading times...wtf ISI sometimes it take a full 2 mins to start a race..unacceptable. -Not enough licensed content..No Ferrari! :(-Not enough road cars-Huge difference in the quality of tracks...Lime rock park looks terrible compared to Spa 66.-Hard to find good mod content...community not as active as Rf1.-No DLC? Maybe a good idea to have quality cars/tracks for paid DLC-Takes a lot of fiddling with the options to get it to run and look great.-No documentation..will be confusing for new players-Menu system is not pretty and is confusing.-Sort of feels like a beta...but HEAPS better than a year ago.

												Currently the best racing simulator on the market for physics, ffb, A.I and dynamic track/weather. Definitely not the best for graphics, multiplayer or usability. Hopefully the online component will improve when the U.I gets updated and is a bit more user friendly. The driving model has a pretty steep learning curve, but once you put in the hours you'll discover the depth of the physics engine comapred to other titles. I've read the usual 'not enough grip' comments, and they are based on ignorance. It's been said before but I'll say it again - you REALLY need to wait for the tires to warm up, and then for the track surface to become 'rubbered in'. Once you do that there's plenty of grip, provided you don't just mindlessly crank the steering into the corner carrying way too much speed. You must be smooth with the steering and have the front tires pointed in the right direction (sounds obvious but takes practice), and be very gentle on the throttle mid corner. Look at the speedo and realize how fast you are traveling before you conclude that there isn't enough grip. The ffb is the benchmark in the genre, though it takes quite a while to tweak it to your liking. I've read comments such as 'too much vibration' or 'too much rattling'. This is caused by two things, firstly a flat spotted tire from a lock up, secondly, rF2's ffb is extremely detailed and some consumer wheels (such as the G27) can't handle it - this isn't a problem, simply turn up the 'smoothing' and it's fine. A.I is fantastic to race against, provided you know racing etiquette and are respectful of the A.I's track position. They will race you hard, overtake, and defend thier position. Not perfect by any stretch, but agian, the best in the business. Leans heavily toward racing cars as far as content goes, though the road cars included are great.Objectively the most advanced physics and tire model.Ultimately it comes down to this - if you have time, patience, the ability to focus, and enough intelligence to understand the dynamics of car handling, this is the most harcore racing experience and is the sim for you. It will feel totally different from what you are used to, but give it time and you'll see why this is the sim of choice for the most serious racers. If you're just after quick fun, go buy another game, this will be an exercise in frustration.			"

												After getting a cheap G29 and shifter in a sale before christmas I bought:Assetto CorsaProject CarsRace 07Dirt + Dirt 3F1 2010,11,12,14,15 and 16Automobilistaand Rfactor 2Rfactor 2 is where I have found myself returning to time and again.Yes Assetto Corsa and Project Cars are lovely and Assetto especially is where the modding community are focused on with a great range of interesting cars but the physics and driving experience of rfactor 2 just brings you back.It is so challenging to master, especially the '70's stock car like Howston Dissenter, and really seems to model tyre deformation, heat, pressure and the contact patch that Assetto and the others just feel like wooden tyres in comparison.I might be being a bit harsh on the other sims and some of it might be in the mind since I know the others model tyres in a much simpler way, but once you have spent some time on rfactor 2 then nothing else is really that satisfying tbh.It's that, 'just one more try' scenario, trying to get the last bit out of the tyres and track.I spent so long practicing on one track that the sun set and the track light came on! Really suprised that this is not more popular.			"

												Played time only shows the Steam version but I have plenty of time in rFactor 2. It is, far and away, the most realistic racing experience you will find. It also has some of the most fun and interesting AI to race against as well as some really major racing leagues that utilize it. Now that it is on steam, with Workshop support, it should be even easier to maintain mods and updates than ever before. At the (current) discount of 40% off, it is basically a no brainer to grab the lifetime subscriptions for just $51. Even at $85 it was well worth the asking price. If you like realistic racing games you owe it to yourself to at least try rFactor2.			"

												Update V2, A call to arms: Just to update everyone: rFactor 2 is still better than Assetto Corsa, and both the iRacing and rFactor 2 fanbases need to get journalist to not just talk about the ""pretty games"". Seriously, IGN still has the release date for this listed as TBA. Like, wtf is that. Even I have more respect for rF2 than that! :(Update: I stand by my initial review, which has remained unchanged below. However, while I don't recommend the game in it's current state as something for the starting user, if you love racing I highly recommend you buy it anyways! The game offers one of the best physics engines, if not the best, in the industry, and supporting ISI will only make the entire game better in the future. It gets updated often and already has an amazing feature set. The issues I have with the game can only be improved with time and support!I've also updated my thoughts on Force Feedback and explained what I ment by ""faked effects"", as I do not believe other users realized I was speaking about the vibration effects that cannot be done realistically by most current hardware. I also am cleaning up the pros and cons to give a much more concise list of positives and negatives. Again, please support ISI and buy this game if you love racing, but please do your research if you haven't played many racing sims and your experience is limited to Need for Speed and Project Cars.Pros:Amazing physicsMod supportCustom Rule pluginsDay/Night CyclesRainAI is uncomparable to any other game. (I swear one stayed stopped on the side of the road until after a set of cars passed after it spun out!)Cons:Physics are not 100% perfect despite anyone's comments. Rubber buildup isn't perfect, and the damage model is lacking (heavily lacking. Some cars don't even get damaged visually)Sounds are strangeUnoptimized graphics systemRain does not appear on car/windshieldNot all the cars are kept up to datePoor mulitplayer system (great for leagues, sucks for public racing)rFactor 2 is a fantastic sim for a cost-saving consumer, offering more in physics compared to Assetto Corsa or Project Cars. Rubber builds up pretty realistically, tracks made directly by ISI are gorgeous, and many of the mods are fantastic.It's great in league settings and playing against AI, but unfortunately that's where my excitement about the game ends. While many users may disagree with me, I feel it's physics are a bit half-baked in some areas. While it's real-road system is pretty cool, it's no longer unique and does not offer the temp-based system that a competitor, iRacing, offers. The other issue comes with the accuracy of the tracks. While it's true that, often times, a surveyed track can compare to a scanned track in terms of looks, it does not matter if it doesn't feel right. This is often commented on the mod version of Nurburgring, where the rFactor 2 version is often not accurate in terms of the bumps found on the track when compared to other games, such as assetto corsa, that uses a laser scan copy of the track.Other issues I find with the game is it's confusing UI, the outdated engine that is struggling to keep up, and the community. I gave this game plenty of chance. I played it for over 2 years and nearly exclusivly for almost 4 months this past summer [I didn't have internet], letting my iRacing sub lapse and really trying to give it a go for my money's worth...It left me bored. Without an online ranking system, there isn't a point. I don't have the time or energy to join a league, and the AI is great but still doesn't compare to the thrill of racing a human driver. While the tire physics are quite out of this world, the FFB has obvious faked effects to try to make it easier to tell what's going on, but it disrupts my driving. This is mostly noticable when it tries to make ""vibration"" effects, something that cannot be done by 90% of hardware on the market, and is ineffectivly done by the Fanatec BMW racing wheel, as most racing wheels only contain rotational FFB hardware.The only other major thing it had going for it, the real road effect, has been brought to other games in some effect, whether it's the lap-by-lap system done by AC or the real-time dynamic track brought in by iRacing. In terms of the buy-and-drive games without a subscription, the lifetime version of rFactor 2 is the best simulation out there. Unfortunately, it's plagued by multiple issues that have yet to be fixed after a near 6 years in development. I hope the release on Steam creates enough income to let them proceed faster with their development, but at this current time I cannot recommend this game to anyone but true racing enthusiasts, if only to try it out to see what's in the current competition or to those who want an EXCELLENT offline experience. As of their latest updates, iRacing and rFactor 2 feel quite similar. rFactor 2 no longer suffers from it's wonky tire physics,  and iRacing hasn't felt like ice in over a year. I can drive the stock cars almost identically between the two games. Other cars are harder to test due to differences in tracks and the cars available. It's the package itself that bothers me. rFactor 2 could do great things, but it feels their development team does not put enough effort into providing content and rely on third party creations, which lowers the overal value of the game to me.Creating a world that is consistant, that is how racing thrives. iRacing has accomplished this. Assetto Corsa is good about this too. rFactor 2 suffers solely on this issue, which is in truth, it's only major flaw.I will update my review when rFactor 2 shows the world that it is truly capable of being a place for sim racers.(Please note that I bought the life time upgrade after paying for 2 yearly subscriptions over the past 3-4 years. I want the developers to improve this game, so I gave them support in terms of my wallet. I also bought this game for 3 of my friends, because I wanted them to try it out and, again, to give ISI some support. I do not hate this game, nor do I feel that iRacing is 100% the answer either. Everyone will have their own opinion, but I hope that people do not feel blinded by passion. [Although I will admit I am a bit of a David K fanboy, but even I admit that the NTMv1-4 was garbage]			"

IntroductionrFactor 2 is one of the most realistic racing simulators currently available on the market. Where most racing games allow you to plunk yourself down into a race car of your choosing and then just gives you the option to drive in automatic or in manual, rFactor 2 takes it much further.  It takes it so far that it is actually a little overwhelming when you first start playing as there is the need or at least the option to customize your car to suit the track you are taking it out on! Gameplay ImpressionWhen you first start rFactor2 you can be a little overwhelmed with all the options that are available to you while at the same time being a little underwhelmed at how few cars or courses there are. The reason for the latter is the fact that Developer has opted to integrate Steam Workshop into the game in such a way that they actually release pretty much all new cars and tracks to the Workshop itself.  This leaves it up to you to decide which cars and tracks you want. It is a good design as it allows you to personalize your experience by only installing the elements you want. Due to the large download required just to install the base game, those of us with data capped Internet can still play the base game and then just cherry pick the add on Workshop content we actually want right away. This leaves us free to download the rest at some point later on.Where this game really shines is how realistic the simulation is. Before the rubber even hits the road, there are quite a few settings for you to play with that go well beyond the standard options. Almost every car can be tuned to suit your desires and the track you will be driving it on. It isn’t simply a copy pasted feature either; each type of car has its own unique tuning options that make each car type feel completely different in game.  There are number of different kinds of cars for you to choose from, ranging from vintage and modern day racers to junior go-karts and everything in between.Once you manage to make your way to the racetrack, the simulation gets even more immersive. With realistically working headlights to pierce the darkness, daylight slowly transitions into night and back again. Most games nowadays have rain which will reduce visibility and that is about that, when it stops raining everything reverts to normal. In rFactor 2, rain actually makes the road more slippery which impacts your ability to maintain traction and control of your vehicle. Even once it stops raining, the roads remain slick until the water on them evaporates much like it does in real life. Another bit of realism is something you might not even notice right away. As vehicles speed around on the road surfaces, their tires wear down and take damage. This rubber doesn’t magically just vanish, it actually gets embedded into the road itself, meaning that as the race goes on, your traction will actually improve. Even the outside temperature impacts your car’s behaviour, so you will want to pay attention to the expected weather conditions and outfit your car accordingly. Damage in this game also affects performance. In some games, damage is all cosmetic until you destroy your engine completely. In rFactor 2, the damage you take accumulates over time, which in turn impacts your overall car performance. For example, tires (or tyres) depending on where you live, take damage  just by being used. They wear down, they blister, vibrate, flex, overheat, and take damage from your careless driving. Same with the engine, gearbox, suspension, steering column, aerodynamics, etc. all can take damage. The more damaged your car becomes, the worse it will perform. Taking trips to the Pit are necessary to ensure your car operates at peak efficiency. When in the Pit, you can even control what gets done to your car, so even that isn’t just automatically done for you. Do you find yourself overheating? Adjust your radiator grill! Tires not performing that well? Adjust the air pressure or just change them entirely! So many things to do! Visually the game is a bit mixed. Most of the game looks great, but it does look quite dated in some areas.  Things like the tires themselves are visually stunning. The attention to detail is fantastic. Even the cars themselves look great. The roadways and general tracks look fine as well. The people not so much, but really that doesn’t matter all that much. The sound effects in the game are great and immersive; it gives the feeling like you are actually there racing the car. Some of the vehicles have an odd clicking sound, as if a certain sound effect is supposed to be playing but isn’t, but I am willing to chock that up to not having a dedicated sound card.The game has its faults, as many games do, and I feel compelled to point them out. The first one I have to mention is the settings. When first starting out you will likely find that it is quite overwhelming. I know for a fact that I really messed up my settings because the very first thing it did was automatically drive my car out of the Pit (like it was supposed to) then it proceeded to do a U-turn and crashed into the garage it came out of. It did that every single time. Even turning off my input device caused it to happen. Turning off Auto-pit fixed that, but it meant I had to drive it myself (which was fine!). I did a few practice laps, finding it difficult to turn regardless of the settings or controls I used. Spinning the wheel as hard as I could, even at lower speeds, often had me careening in a straight line off the track and into a wall. Worse yet, after fixing that issue, it had me spinning out completely on a straight stretch while attempting to center myself in the lane. Playing with the settings some more made it easier to turn. Unfortunately, turning steering assist to full caused the go-kart I was driving at the time to drive out of the pit and blow past the flagman telling me to stop. It then proceeded to drive like crazy nowhere near the track, basically simulating what it would be like to be very drunk while go-karting, mowing down any pedestrians that happened to be in the fields. Stepping on the brakes even lightly seemed to make the car want to lock the brakes, meaning you had to press lightly unless you felt like drifting around a corner backwards. It would have been nice if when you pushed the pedal all the way down , it locked the wheels rather than locking it at anything after the half way point. Again, this could be a configuration issue on my part, or an incompatibility issue.Pros:
Very immersive, you feel like you are actually driving a race car rather than just playing a racing gameAbility to tune your car to the track you are going to drive it on, rather than just having general purpose cars for all tracks like most racing gamesSome of the visuals are fantastic, the tires in this game are amount the most detailed I have ever seenRealistic Weather. Wet tracks are slippery and do not dry the instant it stops rainingRoads “rubber up” with use which realistically increases tractionCons:Setting options are a little overwhelming at first. You need to find a guide and do some trial and error to figure out what works best for you. Getting the settings wrong can create some really wacky gameplay issuesSome visuals look at little dated, for example, the people in the game, such has the flagman and spectatorsThis game has multiplayer, although there is a bit of a Paywall there. This unfortunately seems to make the multiplayer component a bit quiet outside of really hard core players. Mind you I did not attempt Multiplayer that much, due to still learning the game, so it could just have been a bad nightIf you are looking for a casual racing sim that can give you hours of enjoyment, look elsewhere. If you want an extremely realistic simulator that is very immersive, then look no further than rFactor 2!			"

1. IntroI have to write this review because I've been searching for the perfect nextgen racesim for more than a year. I've tested Assetto Corsa and RaceRoom extensively, and I have to admit: I love them, and still spend a lot of time with them.I just bought rF2 earlier this year because everyone said that it is a serious sim, and I'm a serious man.2. First impressionsTo be honest, it took some time to get into it. I immediately felt that physics is completely different here - the car is actually a living being, with feelings and a tendency for revenge (if you push her too hard). I love how you can feel the change in FFB when you change from medium to soft tires in the Formula ISI, to give just one specific example. AI was convincing too, I had some really good fights against them in the Civic as well as in other cars. But still, something was missing.3. The online experienceYes, but. The ""but"" part was that I really struggled to find online races to compete in. I'm part of a club but people seem to prefer the above mentioned titles there, so races were rare and then only with a few people.  Eventually, I found a league, and it changed everything. How? Let me explain it with a summary of my first race ending with a win in the Honda Civic BTCC.4. My first online league victoryI start from pole. I mess up, and lose P1 instantly. I have to be really careful with my tires, so I'm not pushing hard - fall back to P3. With the unsolicited help of lapped folks, I get back into P1 in a couple of laps. Ok, but we are not halfway through yet in a 30 mins race. Some people start pitting and change tires. I made a simulation before, I know it can last 30 mins, if I'm careful. It must. The guy in P2 seems to be on the same strategy, 4-5 secs behind me. He is closing, and I cannot really get more speed, or I will instantly kill the front left. Fortunately, there are cars to be lapped. In the last two laps, I have no grip at all, so I'm iceskating instead of driving. But he is on the same strategy, he can't have too much grip either. Carefully, but on the threshold because being chased, I tend the car in and it's P1. It was really hard work, I feel fatigue.EDIT: I have made a short vid of the highlights:

5. ConclusionWhy did I tell this? Because this is precisely what was missing for me in the other sims that I tried. That in each and every sec, you have to adjust yourself to the ever changing conditions. It's not simply about putting extremely fast lap times, it is a struggle for survival, a mutual collaboration between you and your car. And in that respect, THIS is what gets closest to what you see in the telly or on a real racetrack.So if you are not impressed by the youtube videos (I was not, for one), if you lack the eyecandy seen elsewhere - forget about them. This is really a game about the experience itself, which is, in my opinion, unmatched by any of the other sims on the market at this time.6. Further adviceTo experience this, however, you really have to try rF2 in a good online environment. For pickup-like racing, I recommend race2play, where you can get a lot of miles with dedicated fellow racers (EDIT: unfortunately closed at the end of 2016]. Sooner or later, however, you must find a league. And then your free time is gone, I assure you. A good place to start is the Rookie League organised by http://SimRacing-GP.net. Search the Studio397 forums[forum.studio-397.com] for others, and If you are there, make sure to take a look at the available apps as well. Trackmap gives you not only a map, but also real-time telemetry and timing information. There is a spotter that is highly customisable and gives you all the info you ever wished. rF2 log analyser provides you with all the post-session info you need with beautiful tables and graphs, it also helps you to implement offline championships.

												For me as a simracer who wants to do nothing but organized league and club-racing, this is a great, almost perfect sim.From preparing and setting up your car into every detail and managing the weather-conditions, your tires, the lighting conditions ect. during races, rF2 contains all the great details that makes an online racing career very exciting :)The driving for me is the most enjoying of all the sim-titles so far, which gives the game a very long shelf-life.I'm now 4 years into it since the beta-release and I don't see any reason to abandon it in the next couple of years :)Just to clarify again, this is all from the view of a dedicated organized online league-racer, as the enjoyment of this title can vary a lot if you are looking for something different in a racing title.

												I'm fairly new to sim racing, but I can say that this is one of my favorite sims!(Note: I have about 70-ish hours logged on the pre-steam version.)The graphics are slightly outdated compared to others, there is no denying that. While graphics are an important part of simulation, I personally believe that the physics model and overall 'feel' of the cars/tracks is far more important. rFactor 2 does not disappoint in these fields. From my experience, rFactor 2 has the absolute best physics simulation out of any racing sim.I haven't actually done any online racing yet, so I can't comment on that... but if you're looking for a good offline experience, rFactor 2 has the best AI by far. I have heard some (much) better racers say that the AI is a little slow for them, but as a newbie, They are very challenging even at lower difficutly/aggression settings. I have not yet been wrecked by a stupid AI flaw....(but many times by my own mistakes.)FFB feels great. Not sure what else to say about that!Basically, if you can get past the graphics and/or are looking for a great offline racing simulation, I would highly recommend picking this up!			"

												If people were more honest to make a difference between what they prefer and what is actually better would be impossible for them to give a negative review to rF2. When you put together the amount of simulated stuff + the quality of simulation from ALL sims you can see rF2 is ahead of any other in the market right now. No wonder why professional teams use ISI stuff. You may prefer something else for whatever reasons (like me, I prefer Stock Car Extreme over rF2). But to give a negative review for this sim would be senseless. So buy it, you won't regret if you want simulation. Yeah not all ISI decisions are good, but on the simulation part other groups just can't beat them and this won't change for a while even if they are getting closer they still have a long way to go (except for iRacing, in part...)Just my 2 cents. Or my $80. Kidding, I won a lifetime key in a live stream, it didn't cost me anything xD			"

												ISI makes the only true driving sim engine, even some other games used it in the past (GTR2 etc.).Seeing score that Assetto Corsa has, I just need to put out here that rFactor is much better as a driving sim than AC, speaking of which it is way harder and good force feedback wheel is simply a must. Sure, lifetime sub is costly, but you will get everything that will be made for this game, AC on the other hand chargers very good for it's DLC-s.Not to mention that wheelspin/tyre grip in general is very sloppy compared to rF2. I won't even compare Project Cars which is miles behind both of the mentioned sims in terms of driving physics.rFactor 2 a ""game"" (simulator is the most accurate word) for people who enjoy racing in it's purest form and the closest thing you will get to the real deal.10/10			"

												As a long-time fan of Assetto Corsa, I recently picked up rF2 after reading numerous reviews commending how advanced and detailed its physics are. The move to a free online model was also a big plus in my book. I wanted to experience some of the best physics that sim-racing has to offer so took the plunge!After a few weeks with the sim I can honestly say that I consider it my go-to racing title. The physics and force feedback truly are top notch. The tire model is phenomenal. The damage model is robust. The ""live"" track rubbering and racing lines are great. The day/night cycle and dynamic weather patterns are awesome, especially in how the tracks respond to rain and drying. The pitstops are convincing and well implemented (minus the lack of visible crew). And the AI, wow! It can drive and definitely give you a run for your money! It's very convincing and responds well to the player and to each other, makes little ""mistakes"" here and there, feels very alive and intuitive. The official content engine sounds, tire squeals, wind noises, etc etc all are very well done overall! I also really appreciate the attention given to the player's head movement in how it responds both to the aerodynamics of the car and the forces of the engine. The movements even blend nicely with headtracking, very cool!. Being able to race online with AI populating the track is also a welcome feature.(I could go on, but you get the idea... Big thumbs up in my book in almost every category. Almost...)The only knock I have against the title, and how I would summarize it in its current state is that it's kind of an Arma 2/3 (military simulation) equivalent of racing sims. When it comes together with high quality cars and tracks, the experience is sublime and I consider the experience second to none! But when a car or track is lacking, it's quite noticeable. The community made content can feel hit and miss at times and some of the content seems to be carry-overs from rF1. Given that much of it is free to download, I can't really complain and I applaud everyone's efforts and contributions. From what I gather it's a tall order indeed to mod a car properly for this game. Much more nuance and detail involved to properly implement all the things it has cracking under its hood. While part of me wishes laser-scanned tracks were officially implemented (AC has me spoiled!) I can honestly say that while I notice the added fidelity of a lasered track, a well modeled and detailed non-scanned road mesh can be nearly as enjoyable, especially when paired with vehicle physics simulation of rF2's calibre. And yeah, while I wish the car roster was larger and the devs collaborated with the manufacturer's directly (again, AC has me spoiled!) I can't say that I miss it much. I'd take rF2 over AC pretty much any day of the week unless I have a hankering to shred the LaFerrari, FXX K, or Aventador. Or P1. Or Mercedes 190E EVO II, the Alfa 155 TI, the BMW DTM... Or the Zonda R, Porsche 911, 918, 919, Scuderia...  Dang, that's *such* a nice roster, way to go Kunos! haha  But who am I kidding!? At the end of the day, while I do consider rF2 the gold-standard and in a class of its own, it's a great time to drive sims and rather than nitpick the finer points of each title, it may be best to just settle in for a ride and enjoy yourself, eh?I'm excited for what Studio-397, the new owner and content creator, has in store for rF2. If it can put out a few more cars and tracks every now and then (even as paid DLC, I'd *love* to give the devs some more money for their hard work!), it's good times for racing indeed :)			"

												IT'S LESS OF A CAR GAME AND MORE OF A DRIVER'S GAMEAt first impression, rFactor 2 could feel underwhelming. The graphics look outdated, the car selection might not feel very exciting, and the tracks not that many either.However, the game is true to its sim racing theme. It's the only racing game that I own that actually teaches me the importance of paying attention to weight shifting during cornering. If you don't pay attention to your car's weight distribution during cornering you're going to lose traction (skidding, eventually losing control of the car in cornering), oversteer, or spin out due to both longitudinal and lateral forces that are acting on your car that affect your car's grip. You can minimize these forces by actually respecting the racing line. The racing line is the line on which you can maximize pushing each car to the edge of its performance envelope and this is done through applying gentle weight transfer on your car by following the racing line. Now, don't misunderstand me that I was saying that the game taught me to follow the race line. Other racing sims do that too but rFactor 2 is unique that it teaches me WHY I should follow the racing line other than to be fast. The racing line enables you to get the maximum out of your car by not pushing the car beyond the car's performance envelope, mainly by minimizing weight transfer so that your car is driven on the edge of its optimum performance. Each car has a different performance envelope but each nevertheless needs to follow the racing line to be driven optimally. Some cars have smaller performance envelopes and others bigger enabling you to make more mistakes and mostly get away with them although it will hurt your lap time. To put it short, it's a racing sim that actually teaches you how to be a proper race driver. Its excellent physics simulation teaches you the why that you don't get in ANY OTHER RACING TITLES (I own Project CARS, Assetto Corsa, and Dirt Rally). If you have a passion on driving fast, this is the game for you. Now, this is not quite the game for people who just simply love cars. This is THE game for people who love TO DRIVE on a permanent roadcourse (track). It's LESS OF A CAR GAME and MORE OF A DRIVER'S GAME.So, if you're not a 'driver' or lack the passion to be a technical race driver this may not be the game for you. But if you're interested in the intricacies of being a race driver, then this is THE game for you (load 'Skip Barber' car and 'Lime Rock Full Chicanes' track with at least stability control assist OFF).As a plus side, the game is playable with a keyboard too. Yes, this is a full fledged driver's sim that plays very well with a wheel but is also playable with a keyboard. There's a Steam guide on how you  can set up the game propely to be played with a keyboard as the default settings aren't meant for keyboard.			"

												   There is no simracing software out there to beat this one at the moment. Complex physics and environment model is its strengh, based on professional software used by most racing teams (rFactor Pro).   Unfortunately, it does not look so beautiful with AMD video cards.   Requires wheels and pedal set. Can be played casually, but better with skill and practice.   Its AI is a little bit better than Stock Car Extreme, so it is currently the best out there in my humble opinion.   As a typical PC simracing software, it is not polished with ""gaming"" features. No carrer or any mode to be finished. You just choose a car and a track to pratice, qualify and race.  At its best through simracing leagues.			"

												I can recommend rFactor 2. The historic cars are so much fun! The dynamic track system and the dynamic tyers (the flatspots are visible, effect your driving, ffb and look awesome!). IMO the graphics are just right because I havent a high end system. If you set up everything right the racing is very immersive and realistic. Same with the AI. Just one con: It can be very difficult to find the right settings for a car/track combination. But the reward ... just amazing.I recommend 40% aggressivness for the AI (maybe even more).			"

												I have hundreds of hours on the none Steam version so do not be put off by my hours at this current moment in time!I have been professionally sim-racing for almost a year and I have all the sims, however you will never find a more realistic representation of driving a car than in this game. Especially some of the more fleshed out cars will really test your driving ability.To make the experience even more authentic I recommend you have a good steering wheel with solid FFB (Without this it can be harder to drive certain cars, especially those with a tendancy to spin out of corners!) The car setup tool gives you the ability to create setups for your car, this can go really in depth but there are tutorials around that can help you get started.The one drawback this game has is the graphics, not a problem for many people as most just want to drive, if you are here for the graphics then I suggest you look at some other games as this is not what the simulation is about.Overall, this is the best simulation available. (There is a reason almost all Formula 1 teams and other top tier racing teams use rFactor Pro and not Project Cars!).			"

												I have rF2 since initial release. At that time, the biggest issue for me was GUI and overall user-unfriendly interface. After few months Assetto Corsa came out and I ""left"" rF2. Now I added it to my steam library, checked it and WOW! It is much more user-friendly than before, new menu is great and I was able to easily find everything I wanted. I am seriously considering renewal of my online license.Physics&stuff: everything is top of the class, it compares with Assetto Corsa and iRacing. It is hard to choose a winner, at this level it is more of personal choice, because all three are top. I personally prefer Assetto Corsa, but I still respect rF2 mostly because of great dynamic track and weather simulation.			"

												Despite the hours played on Steam I've owned this game for a couple of years already (transferred the license to a steam key) and it has come leaps and bounds since it's initial release.If you want the very best simulator it comes at a price. That price is time. If you can invest the time to get the most out of rFactor 2 it is an unmatched driving experience. Don't bother with this title unless you have a wheel + pedals. Until recently I was using a 10+ year old Logitech Momo and it was fine.rFactor 2 isn't very gamey at all. No career mode. Very little hand holding. Not much in the way of fancy trinkets to appeal to the masses, but if you want the best approximation of how a car performs on a track this is it. So much so that real racing teams (including F1) use this software to train drivers and test car setups.It should be noted that it has the best racing AI of any game. With a few exceptions on some modded tracks, they will challenge each other and you to the point where you might think they are human.I am not a petrol-head. In the grand scheme of things I understand very little when it comes to car setups. For those that do you have a lot to work with. For those like myself that don't, this is still a hugely fun and rewarding experience.Okay, for those getting this, there are a couple of things that will make a huge difference that you should take the time to do (20 mins?).1. Grab the TrackMap plugin from here: http://isiforums.net/f/showthread.php/23056-TrackMapPlugin-V0-96-32bit-64bitThis basically adds an extra HUD with a ton of useful information. It's fully customizable in game - just press ALT + SPACE to get the menu then use arrow keys and Enter to navigate. With an object selected move your mouse to reposition it. Simple.2. Set up your force feedback (FFB) correctly using the guide found here: http://isiforums.net/f/showthread.php/19034-Guide-Optimal-FFB-settings-for-rFactor-2-The-key-to-being-in-the-Zone-DThis guide is not particularly well written, in that he makes corrections at the end of the text but doesn't fix some of the main body with those corrections. Basically each step you do just check the edits at the end to make sure it's the most up to date information. For example you don't have to edit any files, the FFB torque parameter is available in game.Those two are what I would consider pretty essential improvements to the game, particularly the second. By default there can be a lot of software clipping going on. Imagine listening to your favourite classical music with a heavily distorting pre-amp, then hearing it with correct levels in all it's dynamic glory. Note that this is set on a per car basis, and not all cars will be the same. The process is very quick after you've done it once. I found that a great track to use was Spa*, as going up the hill at full speed after you exit the pits will clip the FFB if it's going to clip. Makes tuning it very fast.3. If you're FOV challenged, or just want the extra help in avoiding collisions, there is a great radar plug-in that will keep you aware of what's going on around you. Available here: http://isiforums.net/f/showthread.php/28648-Curs-o-Radar-released.Be aware that much of the content you may end up playing will be mods. So don't think you're limited to the selection of cars and tracks ISI have developed.* The version of Spa I used to test FFB clipping is available here: http://www.internationalsimracing.com/forum/index.php?topic=3304.0 "

												I am a race sim fan since I played REVS on C64 (a long time ago).Now I have a very good PC with a three monitor setup, racing seat, wheel, shifter and everything else what a hardcore racer should have :-)rfactor 2 is for sim racing experts and people for want to become a real sim racers.So before give the rfactor 2 demo a try before you buy it and invest some time. Play with the settings.The default car setups are not very good to drive. Main reason: They want to force you to take sim timewith the car setup. Every race driver has to know a lot of thing about car setups. I have all race sim games since REVS on C64 and that are a lot of games.rfactor 2 is different so these games, it is a race simulator. If you like games where you enter, play a few laps and be happy,choose something different. In rfactor 2 you have to lern a lot of things about driving, car setups and race technics. You have play arounddifferent configuration (graphics, sound and FFB) before you are happy.But if you invest time and money for good hardware you got the best available racing sim. For me its part of the game to lern how to drive the cars at the different track.Its takes some time to lern that not every car makes fun on every track.You must find a good combination car and track. E.g. try the Palatow D4 at Mills Inner Loop C: Amazing.Set race start time at 5:30 PM, time acceleration 10x and drive a 10 lap race.Then you will get a perfect sim experience. The sun goes down and the lighting beside the track goeson and you recognise that it becomes much harder to drive without daylight.I have rf2 now since more then 2 years and since 2 month I back to this sim. Public online racing is pretty dead, but nearly all public online racing lobbies are empty. You will find most players in AC but these server are not good for real racing.Too many wreckers :-(Its no problem to find a good rf2 league with fair drivers.Even the public servers are filled with a few good drivers. Nothing for a quick game, but a great area to improve your driving skills. You take a look how these drivers perform. You can lern a lot while watching.If unsure try the rf2 demo I dont like the rf2 demo content. Silverstone is boring. Believe me, the others tracks are much more beautiful.Or start with the offline version. Its not very expensive. You get through steam workshop at lot of content for free !With a good setup, rf2 can look like this:

												I have most of the top racing sims including AC,PC,Dirt rally,F1 and R Factor 2 is the best one of the bunch!  I'm guessing it's the physics and the AI that has me most impressed.  I heard a lot of negative reviews about the graphics but the graphics look damn good to me.  Ok not as good as the above mentioned but the graphics are just a non issue when the sim feels as good as this one.  That brings me to the FFB.   It's probably the best of all the above.  If PC could adapt the physics, AI, and FFB of R Factor 2 then PC would reign supreme but until then this sim is number 1.  Just my humble opinion.			"

												Struggling for grip in my car, then gradually becoming better as the track rubbers up. Because of the difference in grip on and off the racing line, it's getting harder to overtake put I can push more than on a green track. Then it starts to rain for a short time and I have to evade the racing line because the rubber gets slippery. Soon the sky clears and racing line starts to dry. Back to my normal line.It's slowly getting dark but I continue racing even through the beautiful sunrise. Yes, I have 0 problems to say that this is the most in depth racing simulator available to the general public.			"

												Having read a few reviews and watched many youtube videos on the progress that rFactor 2 has made since it's initial release in 2013, I decided to take the plunge and buy myself the Steam version (Dec 2015) ,  I had previously downloaded a demo in 2014 which to be honest was not a very good experience (A complete nightmare even to get it running)So here are some of the things you can expect to see in rFactor 2.1. Some of the best driving physics found on any racing sim to date, especially the tyre model which is extremely realistic.2. Based on realism the graphics in rFactor 2 are in my opinion outstanding , the draw distance, colour pallette and hdr textures, especially on the road surface are pretty much as good as it gets.3 The UI is pretty basic at first glance but does offer indepth configuration for every aspect of the game.4. Force Feedback , easily one of the best Force feedback systems you will find in any game, this is due to the fact that is directly linked to the tyre model, which means you can accurately detect loss of traction/grip at any speed,unlike many force feedback systems which feel predictable.5.Dedicated server support and online multiplayer are available to those who subscribe. (optional)6. Customisation and mod support has always been a big part of rFactor , rFactor 2 is no different , however being a newer game and the jump in technical ability requirments, this has led to less quantity and less quality mods being released. (give it some more time)7. The AI in rFactor 2 are configurable which allows you to set skill/speed and aggression, definitely the least frustrating AI I have played against in all modern sims.8. Superb performance , I run rFactor 2 in surround mode (triple screens 5760x1080) with everything maxed out , the game looks amazong and framerates are consistantly 100+ depending on track, always above 75fps though.What not to expect from rFactor 21. The main thing most newcomers will notice is the lack of branding or licensing. ( for me this is not a problem)2. A mainstream game which has a limited life expectancy,3. A game that holds your hand.4..DLCrFactor 2 accurately simulates a speeding race car (really well) , be it a formula or stock car, as well as any simulator I have ever used , there are many other well known great sims on the market, rFactor 2 deserves to sit at the top table of racing sims and imo is an absolute must buy sim for anyone who loves motorsport or racing sims.an easy 10/10.

 The most technically detailed racing sim. If you want to customise pretty much anything about a race weekend - then rF2 is just for you. Its tyre model is incredibly complex and included real-life challenges that IRL drivers have to contend with. Dynamic track, tires, weather, day/night etc. It has it all. It doesn't have that much content (after about 500hrs pre-steam I've worn out most of the content), and VR isnt supported yet (although this will happen real soon!)7/10 "

												Been playing rFactor 2 since early 2013 and just migrated my copy over to Steam.  To cut to the chase, rFactor2 is a brilliant racing simulator.  It offers a very robust and detailed physics engine, coupled with an excellent tyre model, which will punish bad driving and reward good driving, in a way I have yet to see in other games/sims .  As well as employing some very cool features, such as proper tyre deformation, both physical and visual, this includes the ability to flatspot a tyre(s) and also tyre curing (hardening of the tyre from overheating).  rFactor2 also features full 24 hour day/night cycles and dynamic weather.  Although the latter is still, to a certain degree, a work in progress.  rFactor2 also features a dynamic track surface, aka real road, which means a track will ""rubber in"", based on where and how cars drive on the track.   This also applies to a wet track which is drying out too, so you will see a dry line start to form.  The force feedback is, in my honest opinion, the best there is at the moment, however results may vary based on the type of wheel you are using, but this is the case for any racing game, in my experience.  I currently use a Thrustmaster T500rs, and it pretty much works perfectly on default settings, although you will most likely want to tweak settings here and there to suit your own personal preferences.rFactor2 is a ""constantly evolving product"" which means new updates to the game itself, as well as the content, are released on a regualr basis (generally every 6-8 weeks there will be something new/updated, although there is no official timescale for releases/updates).  Because of this constantly evolving nature, there are, some areas of rFactor2, where it is a little rough round the edges.  A good example of this is the weather system, at least from a visual standpoint, needs to be finished at this present time, however it will no doubt be addressed in the near future.The game can seem quite daunting to someone who has never played any of ISI's earlier titles i.e. rFactor (1) and indeed there is a huge amount of settings/customisation that can be done, either via the in-game UI or through fiddling with settings in the JSON game files.Online multiplayer is good, but don't expect the same as something like iRacing, unless you join a organised league.To sum up, here are my PRO's and CON's for rF2.PROS:1.)  Excellent physics engine.2.)  State of the art tyre model.3.)  Very detailed force feedback.4.)  Dynamic track surface.5.)  Dynamic weather6.)  Full 24 hour cycle 7.)  Continually evolving product, meaning new features and content are reguarly added, as well as exisiting content and features updated too.8.)  All ISI released content and updates are FREE and always will be.  Even if you let your online subscription run out.9.)  Lots of 3rd party content available.10.)  Excellent AI for some truly epic offline races.CONS:1.)  Some aspects/features are a bit unfinshed at the time of writing this review.2.)  As with many racing games/sims, rFactor 2 is quite resource hungry and requires a reasonably good PC to run it with all the graphics turned up and lots of cars on track.3.)  Online multiplayer can be hit and miss sometimes, unless you sign up to an organised league.4.)  rFactor 2 can be quite complicated to use and setup, to someone new.In short, if you like racing games and you like them hyper realistic and packed with features, get rFactor 2, you won't regret it!

It doesn't have the latest graphics like RR3 or AC, but the driving physics make up for it.  The brakes really work and under the right conditions I can stab the throttle without spinning out.  The AI seem very intelligent.  So, I'm tickled pink I got the game.  Lots and lots of tracks and cars.  Its going to be a long while before I get tired of this sim.			"

												This is one of the top sim racing games!  The AI quality is so good that it takes away the need for racing games like Iracing or multiplay.  This may be a negative for some, but for me it's great.  And although there aren't many mods out there right now, the ones out are pure quality.  Now, I also have the advatage of not having played RF1 before.  So recently I downloaded it, installed physics patches, and mods as people recommended, and OMG is there a MASSIVE difference!  The game has improved so much it can't even really be compared.  I do however have Game Stock Car Extreme, and what they have done to the RF1 physics engine to make it drive the way it does is master class!I do realize that everyone is slowly moving toward Assetto Corsa, but I hope RF2 developers continue with what is a pure racing sim.  We need these, and I for one would highly recommend it.			"

Also get the FVR2014 V8 Supercars mod while you're at it and then the Bathurst battles can commence.A decent ffb Wheel is recommend/necessary. If you want to be a true nerd (I am) one extra plugin and rfactor 2 can export race data to MoTec analysis software, which is free from the MoTec website.

												Better than iRacing?as i have said in other reviews this is by far the best game in terms of the physics, proven by the F1, indy car and nascar teams who use rFactor pro for their simulators and CAD models. I as a guy who has driven a formula renault car can say that every feedback i got from the car was the same in the game but good physics do not make a good game. The tracks are the closest to real life they can be without laserscan. Furthermore i think this game has alongside f1 2015 the best AI in terms of pace and racecraft. Some people critize the graphics of the game but i think that this game has the best physics so i do not mind about the graphics too much at least they have unlike iRacing real road transmission, a day-night cyclus and rain.Of course the online part is almost non excistent but i can have alot of fun in singleplayer aswell although it took me some 40h to get up to some decent speed, the longest it ever took me at a rscing game P2 in that terms is iRacing where it took me just 15h. Now to the comparision between the two most advanced sims out there:iRacing:pros: -good graphics-great community ( the karting/ racing school of the next generation)-a lot real race drivers drive itcons:-bad price model-no singleplayer+ AI-no day-night transmission, rain, dynamic roadrFactor2:pros:-realistic physics  prooven by F1 teams ( for all of you who say:"" But that is the pro version, not the customer version"". I have driven a simulator using Rfactor pro i can tell you the vehicle dynamics are the same in Rfactor2 just the mechanics and aerodynamics are way more complicated/ complex e.g. the overheating issues or the set up)- still decent graphics- singleplayer+ AI-day-night transmission, rain , dynamic road-good price modellcons:- almost no excistent multiplayer leagueMy winner, favourite and trainig tool is rFactor 2 but it needs to get some big updates such as an actual F1 car, maybe a few lasescanned tracks and at least one professional league with real prices because iRacing has done/ improved the right things recently and is very close to Rfactor2, if they get the rain and day-night transmission they will overtake Rfactor 2 inn my opinion			"

												I can tell you the sole reason for why I bought this game: Mclaren MP4/6. Yep. That's it.I have several other racing sim games that all are good, but when I heard that car's screaming V12 I just had to drive it.So, how does it stand against the other sims?First thing, it's DX9 only. For better or for worse. Now, I don't really care that much about graphics in these kind of games since it's way more about the physics that is important. With that said, yes, it does look like it's older cousins (GTR2, Race07 e t c) so it's definitely not ugly but don't expect all that fancy stuff that PCars, Assetto and the others bring to the table. In all honesty, with DX9 being the base, I would actually expect a bit higher FPS. Graphics: 6/10 (maybe a 7/10 if you consider it's DX9)Now to the important stuff, the physics.It's well on par with all the rest of them. I had 0 issues getting the FF and everything else to work with my G27.It delivers what you expect a sim racer to deliver and it feels very dynamic. You will have to spend time tinkering with your car to get it to suit your driving style but that's why we play these kind of games. Like I said, if you have another sim game you will get what you expect. I have one critisism though and that is that track edges and curbs are a bit exaggerated in the handling. I don't know if it's the cars or if it's the engine itself, but YES, you can drive the curbs without losing traction completely in real life. Physics 9/10. (That's actually what I would give all the sim racers I have including the new ones).Connecting back to the reason for why I bought the game, content. It's actually kind of slim out of the box both with cars and tracks. I myself am in no way whatsoever interested in 10 different oval tracks. But.. here is where modding comes in. The game supports Steam Workshop and I don't think I've ever had a racing game where it's easier to add more stuff. Browse the Steam WS, click subscribe and the next time you fire up the launcher the stuff is there. It will, of course, also keep track of any updates to what you have subscribed to. But wait, it doesn't end there (I know, that sounds like TV shopping). There are tons of tracks, cars and entire leagues you can download and it's almost as easy as Steam WS. Download and extract if necessary to a folder somewhere, point the launcher to include that folder, refresh and it shows up and you can install. Brilliant. I simply love racing from the 80's (F1 or Group C or 5 doesn't matter). I love the pureness and raw feeling without ESC, ABS and TC. The downside is that from what I've seen, rFactor had more enthusiasts that made stuff than to rFactor 2. But, with one install I got all the teams from F1 1992. You can't go wrong with that.Content and modding support: 10/10Last but not least, Online racing (yes ladies and germs, that is what you eventually have to do if you want to prove that you can handle 800bhp on a track). Of course racing against your brothers and sisters is way more fun than the AI. And here is where I think they messed up. They chose a subscription model similar to iRacing and even if I can see that it keeps the riff-raff out of the lobbies, it also limits the population. Remember, PCars and the others have no extra fees for online racing. They even support dedicated servers that you can rent. So, yes, this is a mistake since I think that the user base is the most important thing for keeping it alive and, in this case, the mods to keep coming. And with this subscription model you simply will only get the die hard fans (likely the same guys that race rFactor) to pay up. I don't agree to this model since I can't see what added value it would give me. It feels like a pay wall.Online: 0/10With all this said, do I recommend it? Yep, I do. Without a doubt. And I think if they get rid of that silly online subscription model, this game will have many more years going for it.			"

												So where do I start? There is so much good to say about this game.Let's start with the realism: Cars handle very nicely and realisticly. The handling kinda reminds me off iRacing, which in my mind is a good thing as iRacing's physics is 10/10. I would actually say that rFactor 2 has slightly better physics, no doubt. They pushed it to 11/10, and how? Well one example that blew my mind happened in a 3 hour race I did in a GT2 Corvette. I was battling with the AI (we will look at the AI later) and in the exciting battle I got a small hit, went sideways and stood on the brakes while the cars was going sideways on asphalt or concrete. When I continued everything was fine until I reached higher speed or high speed corners and experienced lots of vibrations in my FFB wheel. Why? Because the game simulates flat spots really well. You might say that Assetto Corsa also simulates this, but not as well as rFactor 2.Then we have the AI. Let me first talk quickly about Assetto Corsa. Assetto Corsa is, at least for me, a game where you do hotlapping, often around the Nurburgring. It is a very fun game, but the level of simulation, the way the cars feel, its not really a racing game, more like a hotlapping game where you drive different cars around different tracks either online of offline for fun. The AI isn't that enjoyable to race with in Assetto Corsa, but when it comes to rFactor 2 they AI is just amazing! If you are close to them they will, not always but often, move to the inside line and give up the ideal racing line to defend their position. They will also dive bomb you if you are going slow into a corner. The AI can also do things wrong, just like a normal person, like get one wheel on the grass and spinout. The AI is also extremely fun to battle with in rFactor 2. I did a 3 hour race in GT2 Corvettes mixed with LMP2 cars. I was in a Corvette. The faster LMP2 AI cars would respect you and find a safe way past you, but they could also cut somewhat close in front of you once they pass you, it just feels so realistic.There are lots of leagues for this game and race series for the fast and good sim racers out there. Like VEC, Virtual Endurance Championship. It really is a game for racing unlike Assetto Corsa, and obviously you have day night cycles, rain, etc. Not that many cars or tracks included, some cars and tracks are also fictional, but as this is a game for league racing you will find LOTS of HIGH QUALITY cars and tracks. I downloaded a Sebring 12hour track with a league configuration. It is just so good, with the bumps, etc. This is a MUST have game if you're into sim racing. It is kinda like iRacing but with singleplayer and extremely good AI. Obviously you have online racing as there is league racing, but this costs money. You can buy lifetime online service or a subscription.Solid 11/10 sim racing game.			"

												rFactor 2 is the most misunderstood racing sim out there I would dare to say....Certainly lacks ""polish"" and ease of use however, if you have a decent wheel and pedals and take the time to set the game up according to your system and wheel, then you will quickly see why it is one of top racing platforms there is. I won't write a book as to how and why this is that way, but if your interested in owning a ""professional grade"" simulator and take a little time to get to know it, then rFactor 2 will become a permanent resident on your hard drive.When you find your favourite setup, cars and tracks, it will be the racing game you end up spending the most time in one shot compared to the others as it will capture your attention and focus for longer periods of actual racing...I didn't give rF2 a fair shot at first, mostly due to the graphics and I was impatient, but I tweaked the graphics, FFB and ended up downloading the ASR Williams 14b 1992 Formula 1 car a couple of months ago and it is now one of my favorite games. I also suggest taking out the Corvette Z06 street car (original ISI content) on any of the original tracks if you want a quick glimpse to see what kind of physics and tyre model rFactor 2 has to offer.Cheers.

												rFactor 2 may very well be the sim title with the most potential. But the best thing I can say about it is it feels incomplete.The things that rfactor 2 does, it does best. It has fantastic FFB & driving dynamics. Ever changing track conditions, tires, temps, to my eyes one of the most natural & realistic visuals, great A.I, and on and on. But it somehow feels unfinished. It is a little short on content, but does have a decent modding community which is now a part of Steam's workshop. rFactor 2 is an ever evolving title, and if you can stick with it, it will reward you from time to time. It is beautifully immersive with great sounds, 24hr day cycles (hello night racing!) full weather cycles, full car systems such as tire temps, brake temps, water, and oil, etc. I recommend this game for driving purists. It is a demanding title, and will require you to work on your driving technique & style, car set up, constantly aware of track conditions, line racing, and fighting for position.  If this sounds overwhelming to you, perhaps check out other titles such as Assetto Corsa. If not, you cannot go wrong with rFactor 2, and similarly Automobilista.Over all 7.5/10.PS: Keep in mind that online racing is paid via subscription. However, it is one of the best titles for offline racing.			"

												Don't be fooled by my Steam time with RF2, I've played this game since the very first beta in 2012. Since that time ISI have done tremendous work in bringing to life one of - if not the best racing simulations of today. The AI are great, the best in the business, the tracks & cars are very well detailed and fully immerse you into their world if you let them. Graphics are not the greatest compared to some others but ISI more than make up for that with A Grade Physics & Tire Model, I'll add that even with a mid-range PC you can get a decent FPS count with decent looking graphics, a top end PC will benefit greatly and at the end of the day it's the feeling that counts. Speaking of which the FFB is superb on my T300 (and G25 before that).Anyway I won't go into full feature length details as nothing beats trying for yourself, so go and grab the demo and give it whirl, I highly recommend this game/sim.

												Best simulator in the market right now. It's a true simulator, and it tends to be more perfessional than other popular sims like AC, PCAR. The ffb is one of the best, the most realistic one, I use it as a standard guide to setup my ffb in other games. (Raceroom Racing Experience's ffb system is as superior as rfactors', but the physics is way behind it.) Overall, it has pcar's weather, day night cycle, AC's physics (even better somehow), and highly modifiable content.)			"

												Although it only says 40 Hours as of typing, I've put many many more hours into it before it was bought overt Steam.rFactor 2 is the best Sim I have played to date, sure, if you're looking for a visual experience, go to Project Cars, however they have said that visual improvements and a move to DX11 is in the works, giving more FPS and better graphics. The AI are fantastic and the most realistic I've seen, they are competitive and know how to defend a position.Now I've never driven a GT3 at Silverstone, or a NASCAR Chevy round Daytona in real life, but it feels like I am, I feel like I'm taming a beast that could escape from my hands at any moment.Of course, the game does rely heavily on mods, I will admit, the game does suffer from many poor conversions of cars and tracks from other lower quality games, but there is a big selection of fantastic reworks of some great tracks, you just need to have an extensive look, once you find the golden mods, you'll love the experience. People need to understand rFactor 2 IS A SIM, it does not have a career mode, it is not marketed to the casual gamer, it's focus is on competitive driving, and race fans.If you're a race fan go and buy, if you're looking for a mario kart fix, wrong platform m8.EDIT (90 Hours): Welp I'm at 90, I'm chucked many hours into this title since my last review of the game, and since then, many great things have happened to the title, Studio 397 have taken over, and development of the game is flying, with better graphics on the way, as well as VR support, and tracks and cars coming to the game. The AI are unbelievably real, can't wrap my head around it, turn 1 they're 3 wide fighting for position, when a car gets a blue flag they will hold their line so the faster car can pass. I've had many fun hours in this amazing title, and i plan to have many more, who knows what the game will be like when I've invested another 90 hours :)			"

												Don't let my Steam hours played fool you -- I've got hundreds of hours in this title. And it's the one that most feels like home to me.For online racing, rFactor 2 is   the most complete package available of the current crop of racing sim titles (I don't do iRacing $$$$, so....).  You're not going to fire up the game and start winning races immediately. You'll be lucky to finish a couple of laps without spinning. Once it clicks and you get used to ""driving on ice"", rather than unrealistically throwing your car at turns, you'll find the driving to be the most rewarding experience out there.Then, you'll switch cars, and you'll hate it again :)It isn't pretty, but the handling and FFB are what this game is all about.We're not here to take screenshots.

It comes down to what series suits you.Paying a yearly sum to play online is going to ♥♥♥♥ some people off and im not going there are this point in time as i can play R3E, Project cars , Assetto Corsa, SCE , and more online when i buy the game.If you loved RFactor 1 you will get into RFactor 2 and at least in steam/workshop the less experianced can keep track of updating and modding a bit easier.

												Rfactor 2 is a whole lot harder than Gran Turismo 6.  The learning curve is steep.  Quake 3/Live was that way.  The feeling of accomplishment keeps me going.  When I make a mistake in Rfactor 2, I understand what it is.  The physics engine feels intuitive.3rd party content is scattered across a dozen fan sites.  Fan-made tracks are decent to good quality.  Some are rough around the edges.  All are harder to find than they should be.  I've managed to download all of the real world circuits found in Forza 6.  I have several friends who run a weekly Forza racing league.  We'll see if practicing in Rfactor 2 translates to better skill in Forza, or Gran Turismo for that matter.  I picked Rfactor 2 because it's cheaper than buying an Xbox One, game and compatible wheel.  $650 total, minimum.In terms of fun factor, Gran Turismo/Forza wins.  In terms of feelings of accomplishment, Rfactor 2 is better.  I think it's easier for me to learn tracks in Gran Turismo; however, learning racing lines is easier to do in Rfactor 2...because it's a requirement to avoid spinning.I recommend this game if you want to learn to handle a car better and are patient.

												Often disregarded for not being a pageant beauty queen, rFactor 2's take on the racing genre may not make it the easiet to pick up and play racing titles, but if you can look past its unglossy exterior it may just be one of the most rewarding. But does rFactor 2's approach to the racing genre make it a title that's too easily discredited? Or are there certain things that make rFactor 2 one of the most accurate racing simulations created yet?

												Considering that most Formula 1 and NASCAR teams use the ISI engine to run their simulators, it's fairly safe to say that this has got to be the most realistic sim out there at the moment. The first rfactor was (and still is) awesome, but rfactor 2 introduced an even more realistic approach, with its RealRoad system.The graphics are obviously not as good as the ones from its competitors, but if you are a hardcore simracer, this shouldn't bother you, as they are still decent. Besides, this game was made for hardcore simracers anyway, so casual racers may have a hard time enjoying this. If you want to be really competitive, it's imperative to invest a lot of time to practice setups, etc.In my opinion to fully enjoy rfactor 2 one should join one of the many online simracing leagues that use this simulation and race online. Because the online mode is what this game is really made for (as was its predecessor). It might take a little time to get into it, as especially for rookies or people coming from more arcade-like games as Forza the start may be difficult, but with enough practice, this really is the most realistic simulation when it comes to driving physics right now on the market.

												The quality content is limited, and without mods, you are only looking at a handful of high quality cars and tracks. That said, it blows every other sim out of the water when it comes to Force Feedback and Physics. Seriously, I can spen more time in one car, on one track, then I can in most sims. The tire wear, damage model, weather system and real road are some of he most incredible features, and make every single lap a different experience. When I hop in the GT2 Corvette, I am immediately transported to the track, so much so, that I am having trouble going back to other sims. And the historics...you will NOT find any better anywhere. Honestly, RF2 has spoiled me, and it made even my favorite sims fall second. It's not without it's faults though, as it is only DX9, and runs worse on my Asus ROG than any other sim. Where I would regularly get 115 FPS on high (NOT ULTRA), I am lucky to get 60 fps in RF2, and that is with certain settings (such as road reflections) turned to low. Bare in mind that the ASUS ROG in question has 12 GB of Ram and a GTX 965m, which while not the most powerful, is certainly no slouch. Coming from other platforms, the extremely detailed FFB and physics do feel odd at first, they quickly become incredible desireable, and I now depend on them. The Mod community is okay, but nothing compared to it's predeccessor, and even Assetto Corsa, though there are a few very high quality mods. They aren't as good as newer ISI content, but they still are much better than most of what you find elsewhere. Overall, I would recommend this sim for anybody with a decent wheel and a powerful enough computer, especially if they are looking for the best and most realistic SIMULATION out there. If you just want a pick up and play racing game, where you can set decent laps after your first 5 minutes though, you should probably look elsewhere. UPDATE: After spending another 250+ hours in RFACTOR 2, I can safely say that it is my favorite sim. The historics are incredible, and the open wheelers are insanely accurate. I have recently tried a professional F1 training simulator, (and had some more on track experience) and ignoring the fact that I have obviously inferior hardware, nothing else comes as close to the real deal. Rfactor 2 on the other hand is getting real close, and at times indistinguishable from what the pros use. There is a reason the Pro simulators use RFACTOR PRO. 10/10 from me and the strongest recommendation I can give....IF you think you can handle it			"

												As what it says, ""describe what you liked or disliked about this game"", ill do exactly like it.But this is all my thoughts and it might be different for other people.Ill try to keep it as simple and short, and straight to the point.I did this review with a g29.Likes:-the force feedback, I can feel the car at its max potential grip and is about to fall off! damn swag!-graphics are good, still provides a good feel of realism-offline racing is good-race options are very dynamic; rubber, weather, wind, time, laps, formation lap, rolling, fast rolling, number of AIs-wet weather simulates amazingly, dry line, wet line, water spray on wet line and so on.-AI defends on the inside if it ""detects"" a driver about to attack him (one of my favourites if compared to rF1)-AI races you well, and doesnt back out in some cases, but that depends on the track youre playing. If its a mod, it might have some flaws and sections where the AI drives weirdly. Official tracks performs optimally.-stock content feels complete, eventhough it contains fantasy series, such as the FormulaISI, stockcars, etc.-tyre models looks great visually, and I bet the physics are really good ( I dont know how they do it, I wont overeact over it)-car setup is really detailed, I had to read a bunch of guides in order to fully understand them, but its worth it, at least for me.-cool marshals waving the flags, safety car (depends on the track)-online racing, wait, its not really good. However, you can join leagues that have various types of racing.The ones that I pay attention the most :FSR - F1 racingVEC - Endurance racing based on the WECISEC - Same thing as VEC but its a lower level compared to VEC (im racing in it :D )Some organizations :ISRSimRacingClubXtremeRPM-most people say that mods keep the game alive. For me personally, I think the same, but, if ISI continues to bring in more content regularly, then that point isnt really accurate. But its ISI, i think their busy with their lives just like us.-there are free mods and there are the paid onesfree mods are good, some are not that good, but I still appreciate their work trying to model a car with such complexity!-paid ones, havent seen any mods that are overly expensivemy favourite payware mod is the URD PX and the EGTs.-PX is basically a replica of the LMP1, LMP2 category, and the EGT are the replica of the GTEs.-Ok why the hell am i talking about the mod. sorry mate.im kinda lazy to type about my dislikes because it takes some time to find them, ohhhhh, rekt.ok thanks for reading, hope you buy this gameoh and remember, I think its better to buy the lifetime online services, but you can choose wahtever bla bla bla.good bye "

If You take a look at the forums, they have announced graphical changes that will implemented soon and those changes are a move to a different DX version among other things.

												Ive played rFactor on disc since 07 and i spent hours and hours on it with no mods (no internet), since then ive downloaded it played loads of mods... easily my favourite game, rFactor 2 is very similar and now even easier to install mods, ive spent some time on it playing the 2014 Verizon IndyCar Series mod and F1 2013... first thing i noticed was the flat spots on the after locking up and when racing with rain a dry line apears and when u go off the dry line on slicks you go straight to the scene of the accident. All these things are small updates to the original game but make a fantastic difference. This is a quick first impression... If you are looking at buying it, i would go for the life time subscription as this game wont get old as mods are made for each season of nearly every form of motorsport, there arnt loads of mods but give it time. try the demo to make sure you can run it! 10/10 worth every penny. thanks for reading :P			"

You will hear lots of fans of other driving sims complain about having to pay for online services of £8 a year, these are the same people paying for DLC cars and tracks in other sims without crying a tear about it.ALL cars and ALL tracks are always going to be FREE here with RF2. That is much better value than free online services while having to BUY ALL future tracks and cars like in MOST other titles.They will try and get your attention saying ""You have to pay for online, wtf!!!!!!"", when dollar for dollar, the content you will get with this far outshines those other titles.BUY IT, RACE IT, LOVE  IT :)			"

												So i have a nice setup. Projector screen. Fanatec wheel. RealFOV. I played project cars, assetto, f1 series etc and never ever was i so blown out of the water as the rfactor experience. I finally feel in control and its not all or nothing racing... but racing. I love this game. Needed to add some juicy mods, love the 1988 f1 mod and some plugins. Took me a lot of time tweakin the ffb and the key was downtune and set a high deadzone (old wheel). Now its flawless. Can only but recommend. What an experience. As for the graphics. I actually think they are more then sufficient. Betyer alwayd cool of course but i notice the racing grabs me like no other game has managed. Assetto ranks 2nd i guess for me although my ffb on assetto seems weird, which is probably my settings instead of the game. Anywayz rfactor 2 rocks... bad ♥♥♥			"

												i heard mixed reviews about this game but  i thought i would give it a go, coming from stock car extreme, and raceroom experience, i think this game has the best physics. graphics are pretty good of course room for improvement, but its about the racing. the game does lack content which u would hope isi dont give up on this game it got great future if they continue to improve the game, the main reason i got this was for flat 6 mod , but there some great mods of other cars as well.

												I've owned Rfactor 2 since the very first beta release, long before steam. For me at least it's a strange title to place, I find the level of realism and quality of simulation with Rfactor is only as good as the current car and track that you're in, with a very wildly varying experience, the player also really needs to have at least a basic knowledge of car setup and a good understanding of wheel peripheral setup to get the right experience, it's not a fantastic ""plug and play"" experience.At it's best Rfactor 2 is perhaps the best driving simulator out there, or at the very least it's on a par, but at it's worst it's let down by less than fantastic content quality that isn't helped by the equally inconsistent default setups. The graphics were already dated when it came out back in 2012, but a bit of artistic flair and some quality lighting can make them hold up even today. The same can be said about the sounds, they range from really great to hopelessly dated and weak sounding. The UI really doesn't hold up, it's neither functionally well designed nor is it good to look at, it's about as basic barebones minimal effort as can be. Tracks take an unreasonably long time to load, so if you're running on a traditional hard drive you might wanna put your favourite trilogy on while you wait.It sounds like a negative review but it's not given what Rfactor 2 is. Rfactor 2 is a simulator for serious driving simulator fans, for people who want a tool for driver training. If you put enough effort into Rfactor 2 to source the best quality content, to optimise your control setup, to work with the car setups and to maximise your experience then you will have a must have driving sim. But if you're looking for an out of the box driving sim experience there are better options out there.			"

												rF2 is a great Simulator. It has a ton of content in the steam workshop and more can be found online. The graphics are not flashy and bright like other racing games. It has a more ""actual vision"" look. This means that it shows you what your eye would see instead of what a camera would see (Lens flares, overly saturated colors. Etc)Game uses DX9 but will be gettign it's DX 11 update in Q1 of 2017. This will usher in VR compatability as well as significant increases in graphical overhead resulting in better FPS and room for more graphical eyecandy to be added.Studio 397, who now owns rF2, is a much larger studio and has quite a large number of developers working on rF2 development. They will eb releasing content and updartes significantly faster than ISI ever could. EVen if Studio 397 never made any further content or physics improvements the game would still be worth every penny spent on it.Online mode is now free with game purchase and the serves are begining to fill with new rF2 racers.For me, I have rF2 and Assetto Corsa. I prefer rF2 and it is my Goto sim racer. For me AC does not have nearly the same feel as rF2. Breaking, FFB, Sense of speed, real road, physics in general. It all feels better to me. Your mileage may vary.Remember that rF2 has both its fanboys and haters. Both groups do their part to try and make rF2 look good and bad. The real deal is that the game is still in development and I think the furure is bright for rF2. It is worth having in your game list. "

												After plenty of ours playing the non-Steam version and coming to play the game on Steam after a multitude of updates, rFactor 2 is finally on track (pardon the pun) thanks to Studio 397. The launch was really rough and first few years of development weren't that exciting. However, now that Studio 397 has purchased the rights, things are moving along nicely.I definitely recommend this to any avid sim-racing fan or mod fan. With an incredible amount of mods (cars, tracks) rFactor 2 will deliver for a few years more!			"

												Has to be the most advanced sim on the market. No championship. Best move was coming to steam. Pick up rooms are bad like every where. Still needs work done on issues that ppl tell ISI about not what they think needs doing 1st. Damage needs work. Has more ISI content than rfactor1. Less content by modders than rfactor1 by a country mile but mods and tracks always getting released if you can find them as no 1 uses 3rd party mods section at ISI forum and is not maintained by ISI thats probably the reason lets hope they use steam more than there.buy it you wont regret it			"

												Having probably 1000 hours into the non steam version, i can say that this game isn't without it's problems. The main one for me is that I have to run 4x sparse grid super sampling with 4x mxaa through nvidia inspector to get it to look right. But all the slight shortcoming don't change the fact that this is the best single player racing experience out there right now. The AI at 120% are quite quick and rarely are the cause of incident. A must buy in my opinion.			"

												This is the best, but also the most sad, underestimated and ignored racing simulator ever, because literally everyone is convinced that Assetto Corsa is easier to mod and it's more realistic. This is very, very sad... because Assetto Corsa will never support mods without breaking them with an update, and there are many things that Assetto Corsa doesn't simulate, like water temp, brake temp, flags...

												Writing this review to counter the review below me in most recent.In the review, they claimed that the developer (ISI Studios, at that time) and publisher (still ISI) did not give Steam keys for non-Steam copies of the game, prior to the game becoming a Steam-only title. This is incorrect.The developers gave free Steam keys for non-Steam copies of the game for almost a year, and sent several emails reminding people of the deadline for converting your copy.(I grabbed mine a long time ago, hence the key on my review.)The previous reviewer has blocked me some time ago, so I can't comment on that review, so I'm writing this review by way of a refutation.Link to the review that I am refuting: http://steamcommunity.com/id/DriftMachine/recommended/365960/The review seems to have been deleted.

												 Rfactor 2 has got to be the best online racing game out there, the single player mode I cant comment on as I don't normally run it. Don't let my time fool you. I've been racing rfactor gfor over 5 yrs, and have about a year in ther non-steam version of the game.  I usually run the Stockcar mod and there is no comparison to the other games out there, Iracing/Forza/Project Cars/Grand Turismo/Dirt, This game makes them all arcady. The imersion, driving feel, how the car reacts to set up changes and over the fuel run is certainly challanging. Its not a game its a simulation. There are a few leagues out there that are now runnning fixed setup races, so if your no so good at setting the cars up, help is available.   If your into online racing and are tired of all the wreckeres out there, give rfactor2 a try, bang for buck this the best there is, without the high prices and memberships, you buy it you have it all, no additional purchases for cars/tracks etc.Thumbs up Thumbs up Thumbs up Thumbs up    GREAT GAME WELL WORTH IT			"

												rFactor 2 is one of the most complete racing simulator out there currently. The AI, the racing, the singleplayer features, the game engine - all of it unmatched by any other sim that I have.The physics feel pretty demanding in rFactor 2. In pCARS, Raceroom and even Assetto Corsa, it's very easy to just jump in a car and drive around. In rFactor 2, you need to have finesse if you want to drive fast. It's easy to overdrive your car, causing you to overheat your tires and lose grip. You can also flatspot your tires if you lockup your brakes or lose control at a high speed, causing heavy vibrations in your wheel. I usually have similar driving styles for all the sims I have, but I have to be extra careful when I step in to rFactor 2. Bear in mind that I'm no race driver in real life. I do race karts but all I've said was based from experience in all those sims.The AI is probably the best feature of this sim. Where else can you find AI that actively tries to defend its line when you're coming from behind? When you get behind an AI's draft, the closer you get, the more they move to the inside line to try and defend their position. You're both coming in side by side for the braking point. The AI won't give up that position so easily. He will try to outbrake you, either forcing you to go wide or go for the undercut.When you're ahead and the AI is behind, don't expect them to just let you be in the front in peace either. They will pressure you into mistakes. They will take advantage of the mistakes you make and they're really good at it too. They will stick their nose in the inside if they're close enough. They go 3 wide in some corners if there's enough room.The best part is that no contact is made by the AI, usually. They still make mistakes but nothing you wouldm't expect.I've had many enjoyable races in rFactor 2 with the AI. I would even go as far and say that I've had the same level of excitement racing real people on iRacing.$85 for a lifetime subscription though? Not gonna buy that.			"

												Early Issues: With many games on Steam once you’ve downloaded the game it’s easy to log in and get going. Unfortunately, that’s not the case with rFactor 2. You’ll download the game which includes the game’s launch program. From here the game wanted to – and needed to – download modifications from the Steam Workshop. This wasn’t a big problem. However, it then also wanted to set things up which took a small amount of time. From here I went into the game. I tried to select my controller from the load options. The game has no load option for the XBox One Controller. However, it does have a presetting for the 360 controller so that is what I selected. It never recognized my controller. I searched the Internet for a solution hoping that someone else would have experienced this issue. No luck. I did, however, find someone making a complaint about them not recognizing an entirely different controller and someone telling them to exit the game entirely and to reload. This was the solution I needed. However, I then noticed that the default settings were set to controller 2. The work through here was easy because all I needed to do from here was to set my controller settings. You’re going to want to persevere with this as the representative that I spoke with at Image Space Incorporated, Tim Whately advised that driving with keys while doable is ‘hard as hell.’Uber realism: Hard as hell describing the keyboards makes it sound nightmarish. Driving with an Xbox One controller wasn’t much easier.It’s definitely playable but you can see with the amount of hard work and effort that the dev team have put into the game that uber realism has been the absolute premium. You’re not going to be playing this because it’s some arcade racer. Oh, no, it’s a fully fledged entry into the uber-realistic simulation games that have become very popular over the past couple of years. That means that the game is hard as hell and will punish you for the tiniest mistake you make on the road just as a driver’s error in professional racing would. If this sounds like the type of game that’s not for you then I don’t believe Image Space Incorporated would be apologetic – they understand that they are filling a niche and they’re doing the best job possible of being the most significant ‘game’ in that niche.A technical marvel: rFactor 2 is a technical marvel. There may be other racing games with fancier graphics. There may be other racing games with better sound. There may be other racing games that may argue that their physics system is better. However, no racing game puts all three components to a better combined quality than rFactor 2. The only area that I genuinely believe the title is let down is in a decidedly average pre-racing presentation. The menu system and other design choices before you’re out on the track could do with a complete makeover. Further, the launch program could do with a little bit of clarification. It’s more than a little confusing for your first time players let alone the casual gamers who are passionate racing fans. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy but just something a little more user friendly.All substance: What you will find most of all in rFactor 2 is that the game is all substance. The game does not make outrageous boasts that it cannot live up to. Everything in the game is substance. It is as deep a racing experience as what you could possibly hope to find on any gaming platform. Where other games waste their budget adding unnecessary features Image Space Corporation have put in the effort on maximizing what they do have. Quite frankly, it’s one of the best racing games – of any sort – ever developed and I hope it receives the attention it deserves from the Steam universe.Finally on Steam: The game was originally released back in 2013 but only made its way onto Steam in late-2015. This gave the developers an opportunity to work on the game with their core user base without the pressure of it being classified as an Early Access title or being rushed into release before it was ready. I believe that this is a smart decision for some games and it certainly was in the case of rFactor 2.rFactor 2 is unapologetically not for everyone. The majority of those who speak out against the game are the crowd who Image Space Corporation did not make the game for. If you’re a part of the target audience, however, you’ll likely not find a better racing experience on Steam.For more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/ "

Many would argue this is a true sim and therefor racing against real people is the only measure you need, but there is nearly no one online.Racing online will require you to join a league.This is the truest definition of “not a game”.

												I don't have many hours in the Steam version of the game but that's because I've had this game since it originally came out in ""early access"" on it's website a few years ago.  It's got the best road course AI out there.  They can actually be raced and had fun with unlike my experience with Assetto Corsa and Project Cars.  This game like rFactor 1 before it is about deep customization.  I like that I can setup races that go a set number of laps or if I want to race a specific amount of time and I can set the races to being timed races.   The FFB and tire model make the cars feel more realistic to me than any game I've driven.  The first time I figured out my FF started vibrating during a race because I'd flatspotted my tires was pretty awesome.  Real Road that has rubber build up added to the racing surface depending on where the cars are actually driving during the race is pretty cool as well.  The only other game which currenly has something like that is iRacing and they just added it a month or two ago.  I also love the night racing or racing at dusk into the night.  This is also something very few games have ever had and something most of the current games do not have.If you're not sure you'll like this game then try the demo.  Hardcore racing simulations aren't for everyone.  Personally I like driving the slower cars because they're easier to handle.  You should also try the demo because it's true the UI can be unfriendly to people who just want to get in and drive.  It was designed at a time when PC gamers were more into tinkering with their games and machines to get the most out of them without the user manual being part of the UI.  Something that's never really made sense is there are several useful settings in a text file in the game folder that aren't in the UI.  ISI has always done it this way with their games.			"

												Superb! All other racing games pale in comparison. The FFB is sublime (even on my £50 DFGT wheel) I've been playing racing sims since the first Gran Turismo and it's developments like this that keep me coming back. I have the fancy PC that lets me play the 'pretty' sims on full graphical settings but I just don't because this is just so much more engaging. I also think that visually, this game is not that far behind the other sims and that by every other measure, it is on another level. The cars! the cars! The default content is magnificent – each vehicle is so characterful and it takes time to learn and tame this charm and quirkyness, but it's very rewarding. The modding community is very dedicated and create some amazing machines and tracks.			"

												Like Automobilista, this is a great simulation. The physics are stunning, as well as the force feedback. There are also great mods available. You can set your races / seasons, having complete race weekends. Set these as you desire. Drive at day / night, or have transitions between these (you could also multiplier time changes). It's also possible to drive in rain. It's dynamic, so it's possible the rain start and stop. The driving itself feels great, like iRacing. The A.I. is really great, and you can have great races and improve your skills by using rFactor 2. To me, I like driving in Automobilista and rFactor 2 much more, then Assetto Corsa. This is like iRacing, but offline to me. But having more cars / tracks, and I'm not sure yet, but the physics could be better. And off course, you could drive in night more often, and have rain (iRacing doesn't support rain - yet)			"

- Much smaller mod list then assetto corsa. suprisingly.-- Online subscription needed for multiplayer.get this for the extreme experience, or get assetto corsa for more causal play and mods. and if you are really serious about racing or in an online league, i suggest the lifetime subscription.

Brief ReviewRacing is a dynamic sport, and for my money rFactor2 captures this changeable nature better than any simulation on the market. The sensation of its driving is pronounced and tangiblePros and ConsProsRealistic gameplayExcellent handlingSuperb physicsExtremely mod-friendlyDynamic weatherReal Road (Heats and cools down etc)Great content through modsConsNo actual gameplay structureStill a very much a  work-in-progressLimited cars and tracks with stock gameVisual and Mechincal damageAn EndingIt's a shame that my hard-fought victory won't really be celebrated, though, because as much effort as developer ISI has put into the driving, it has thus far neglected just about everything else. rFactor2 remains far from finished despite development was made public through a screenshot in March 2009. It offically came out first in January 2012 when the beta was realeased. It ""went out"" of beta in early 2013 yet being 7+ years in development it still feels far from finished.  And will it ever be finished I dont think so			"

												Note: I have 800~ hours in RF2, most of them put into the game before it moved to Steam.Recently ISI sold RF2 off to another developer, a newcomer who plans to add paid DLC and paid mods to the game. I've bought many copies of RF1 over the past decade, numerous LIFETIMES of RF2 since 2011, and I consider this bait-and-switch a flat out betrayal by ISI. I'm never supporting them again. NEVER. ""Absolutely furious"" doesn't begin to describe my feelings.----UPDATE 12/19/2016 - The subscription model is apparently, inexplicably, now being phased out, leaving all of us lifetime subscribers standing there holding a bag that says ""I'm stupid"" on it.

												First words. Yes it´s a great game, worthy of owning if you love racing simulations.I´ve had this game from the release, and personally i enjoy the physics most of any ""current"" sims. It was about time it got on Steam, but what the hell is up with the pricing? Do ISI really even want to see this product get a proper boost for sales? 80e for a full featured product, where Assetto Corsa is 40e and Project Cars is 30e. Do they really think many people who aren´t properly familiar with the game will actually pick it up over either of those? Fix the pricing and hopefully much larger number of people might buy it. It is definitely a worthy sim to spend time on.. but im a fan and still don´t think it´s worth the 80e.. It´s less with one year of online. I suppose thats somewhat more justified price, but again.. hard to think many unfamiliar with rF2 see it that way.			"

												I really hate to write a negative review, But at it's current price, I connot recommend this game. The graphics are not as good as they are in the video, and I have a very high-end PC. The NASCARs are not licensed, and therefore have been changed, and look like kids toys (Not a good thing) The cars are difficult to drive, and spin whenever you go near the throttle, and the crash graphics are the worst I've seen in a car game for a long timeDont get me wrong, this game has done some things right-The car and track selection range is pretty big, and there are mods out there (Although the community is not very active) And when you do manage to get them moving, the cars handle very realistically.Overall, If this game was a lot cheaper, it would be amazing, but I am disappointed that I paid $44 Australian for this, and it did not meet expectations. I am going to reccomend this game, because I trust that it is better than it seems at first, And will change this review  if I can get some assitance.Rating-Physics-7/10Range-9/10Crash graphics-There isnt a low enough numberAI-8/10Price-2/10EDIT: I have just discovered the workshop, and will update this review based on the content I find there.

												UPDATE 3: Now I bought a new graphics card. I had to reinstall the game to get it running. I just tried to install it on my SSD again and everything worked. So maybe they fixed this issue in the mean time. rfactor2 is the most realistic racing simulation at this moment.But: On this Steam Version, just a very limited combination of cars and tracks does not lead to a crash (rfactor2 has stopped worked...).When the crashes are fixed I will change this review and write something about the game :)UPDATE 1: Day Later: Now the source of the problem seems to be obvious: When I start the game now it says ""Downloading Workshop Items - 59 items remaining"". This situation does not change after an hour, so there is a problem to download the content. This is why most tracks and cars do not work as they have not been downloaded yet. As rFactor2 is not able to download them (I just use the official Workshop Mods which are subscribed by default), this review will stay negativ until the game has been fixedUPDATE 2: Now I have reinstalled the game the second time. This time, I installed it to my normal HDD (not SSD). The reason for this was, that my Steam Folder on the SSD was unter C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam. So, maybe the (x86) was a problem for rfactor2, that it cant download to a location with special letters. Now everything works fine, my Steam Folder on my HDD is ""D:\Games\Steam"". Maybe this was a reason. I hope that the game will gun smoothly on the HDD and wont lod too long :)			"

												Having owned all the current gen of sims (apart from iRacing) & past generations, rF2 has been my favourite by far, purely for the feel of the race.  By that I mean the physics, the FFB, the dynamic changes as the race happens (tyres, weather, lighting), & the AI.  The races have a sense of speed to them, a thrill, not stale as I find with AC, the FFB is the best I've experienced through my CSWv2 and the selection of cars and tracks available by ISI, 3rd part associates or independent modders covers pretty much all aspects of motorsports on 4 wheels.The cons of rF2 for me are that it does not have a structured career mode or even a simple championship allowing you to create and compete with the AI over a series of tracks with leaderboards.  This is a real shame as the AI is one of the best you will see in any current sim.  Also, I'm sure you have all heard about how outdated the dx9 graphics are, and at times you will agree but other times the game does look very good.  It's not bad but it does not have the polish of pCARS or the post processing of AC.  But what the graphics do achieve, is a real sense of speed which for me AC fails to do.  In summary:Pros:+ Physics & FFB very convincing and make the 'feel' of the game superior+ Dynamic tracks, lighting & weather+ Moddable platform with some excellent free mods+ Very convincing AI makes single player races challenging & enjoyable, with a sense of speed and thrill that R3E achieves too.Cons:- Graphical quality lacks polish- No career or championships, especially upsetting after you have such good AI- Sounds are not as good as R3E, AC or PCars.  - The weather effects are incomplete- UI is not as polished as AC			"

												I'm actually a little bit on the fence with rFactor 2. I respect the incredible technical achievements and amazing features that ISI have packed into the sim and I support them as licensing the rFactor 1 engine has given birth to other sims that I love, but rFactor 2 largely feels a bit lifeless and clinical - like it takes itself too seriously to be much fun. The free content that ISI offers on Steam Workshop is a nice addition because otherwise the game comes with very little in the way of stock content. The problem is that older content ""feels"" old and newer content gets the physics and graphics updates, but they never go back to update all of the rest of the existing content.The AI are decent and the sounds and graphics are okay. The FFB is detailed but there are way too many canned effects added with spring and damper and the only way to adjust it is to close the sim, edit the files, and then start it up again to see if you like the new settings... it's a bit of a chore, honestly. They do provide some ability to tune FFB and control inputs from the settings within the game, but there are a few things missing here and there.Also, you have to buy the online subscription services if you want access to multiplayer, the Steam version doesn't come with the complimentary 12-month subscription like the non-Steam version did. It's a silly and archaic model held over from their attempts to stop the rampant piracy of rFactor from the pre-Steam era and they should really just do away with it now. I only got the base game so I haven't tried the multiplayer.Final notes: make sure you set the track to have at least light rubber, if not medium rubber, on the surface. A pristine ""green"" track surface will drive like ice and is no fun at all. Also, the modding community isn't super active but there are some worthwhile third party mods and tracks. I would recommend you try out the demo from ISI's website before deciding to purchase. It's not my everyday ""go-to"" sim, but rFactor 2 has day/night cycle and rain/weather combined with ""real road"" technology, so it's worth booting up every now and then.			"

												After removing the online season pass, and making this a one time only purchase, this simulator is a must buy.I have already improved my braking technique by using this sim (2 seconds gained!), the physics simulation and FF is the best in the market and even if the number of good mods is quite small now, after integration with steam workshop it can only grow.Pros:- The physics are (probably) the best among all the simulators.- Online subscription permanently removed.- The hardware requirements are not extreme, I can run the software with good frame rates in a machine that's 5 years old.- Driving the cars in this simulator is a delightful and rewarding experience.- Mods can be managed with Steam Workshop, I like to manage everything with Steam. New mods will be added here, and it supports paid content (good bye rfactorcentral).Cons:- VR is still not supported (December 2016).- The online servers are either empty or private. iRacing is still the best for competitive multiplayer.- The AI drivers are not good. (The other simulator I drive has no AI drivers, which is the logical option.)- The amount of good mods is small compared to the first rFactor.- The graphics are not as good as the graphics in non-simulator driving games. This is not important for me, but may be it is for the person reading this review.Therefore this simulator can be recommended to anyone wanting to practice their driving, to improve their technique, to shorten their lap times and to master the nuances of the difficult cars like the Brabham, in practice mode or racing against the AI. Disable all driving aids for a good wheel experience.I can only recommend this simulator for multiplayer if you already are member of a league and they want to use rFactor2. Otherwise stick with iRacing.			"

												Best racing game for realism bar none. If you want to know what real racing is and how to manage tyres and have other cars affect your aero and other things like that, then there is no comparison. Its why most the professional leagues use it. Equal to iRacing without the associated cost. Install the best mods and the ISI content and you really cant go wrong. Not always a pick up and play fun thing but then its not a game, its a true racing sim and you have to work on setup to get the best out of your car. Endlessly tweakable with many many settings.

												rF2 is an improvement over the most excellent rF1 (king of online racing of yesteryear) but it needs a lot of polish around the edges to compete with other current titles of the genre. The physics model, tyre & weather simulation and top notch FFB are what differentiates rF2 and makes it ""just about"" worth its current price-tag (p2p online).On the other hand the dated graphics, interiors/cockpits, lacklustre tracks (laser scanned anyone?), no official licenses, minimalist steam workshop implementation and non-existent multiplayer lobby beg the question of choosing rF2 (pay to play online) over racing titles like iRacing (sub and fees) or Assetto Corsa (perhaps Project Cars too), which are seemingly more accomplished in much less development time. To put it in perspective, in a mere couple of years, Assetto Corsa has improved by leaps and bounds and currently established as the preferred choice of the modding community and online league racing sim enthusiasts.In spite of the stiff competition, I would recommend rF2 to dedicated and serious racing enthusiasts for the sim experience. In addition, now that Studio 397 have taken over, the development road-map looks very promising (monthly updates, DX11 at long long last, UI revamp, VR, spotting, mp lobby etc) which at long last will bring rF2 a much wider recognition (not just for purists) and instead of a maybe vote it would be a definitely yes to buy vote.-----EDIT: A small correction, as mentioned in the comments, rFactor2 now includes online multiplayer in the price tag (no more online subscription or lifetime payment). Thanks.			"

												...The only way to find something better could be testing iRacing (but is too expensive for a racing ""simulator"").Wanna do 24h races with 41 cars on track, 3 different categories, 2 to 5 drivers per car? No problem, buy this! GPU note: I play with low graphics and max FPS locked at 130, I like to have it as smooth as possible, but sometimes my Sapphire R9 280 find hard to keep that level, generally when it rains and you have cars in front and behind (i drop to 80fps more or less). It remains absolutely good but not as smooth as it could be. So my advice is to go with a stronger video card than mine:) (CPU i5 4460)			"

												Ive edited this review after having several of the most amazing offline races ever. Yes my point stands about the polish and content, but the AI is the winner in this sim.+ Easily the best AI offline racing ive ever had !!!. wow no other sim has AI like this. offline race are the best your gonna get here. For that alone its worth getting this.+ FFB when eventually dialled in is unmatched in any other sim, like its tyre model.+ Day / night racing - watching a race transition from day to evening to dusk is amazing the visuals look stunning here. Not sure what the fuss is about with bad gfx!?- inconsistent content, some are good some are not so good , with just a handfull of decent feeling mods (a small handfull!) Even some ISI cars feel better than others  (cheating ffb self aligning torque, using caster on the formula renault and others).- weather that doesnt really work (wet area off racing line never dries) with ai (using wrong tyres not coming into change etc) Needs fixing. --------------------------------------------Lets hope the new studio can bring rf2 out of the gutter and back to where it belongs, it certainly has ALL the potential and the best AI !

												Quite dissapointing really. Graphcs quality seems worse then the demo on the same pc with all settings maxed. Multiscreen support and FOV quite limited and dificult to get right compared to other SIMS.Still seems very much based on RF1 where other SIMS have moved on. Shame as I really wanted for the V8SC mod as it has 2016 cars but not worth the money. Even the base ISI content is limited graphicly.			"

												(12/2016) Now finally the subscription for the rFactor 2 season pass is gone, so I just added this to my library.At the moment I would not recommend this game, as you get a confusing user interface and the content of rFactor 2 is organised in Steam Workshop without clear categories. This means there are a lot of MODs official and not official but it's not so easy to find a good set to start with.The physics are good but the FFB in comparison to Raceroom or Assetto Corsa is more undefined and it seems that the FFB is only coming from the front tires. This is ok, when using a active sim rig but without the half of the FFB is missing.Graphics and sound are weak, also the OSD is at least aged.			"

												Two friends and I have been playing rFactor 2 since its release and rFactor1 for many years before that . We play 2-3 times a week getting through many races in the process . We love it . .  .  .  or at least we used to . Since the ( enforced ) migration to Steam none of us can create a dedicated server that can be seen on the Steam server browser . We  have all tried to rectify this problem but can find no solution and it seems that nobody on the Steam/Developer side of things seems to be seriously addressing this problem . We can no longer run our private races, indeed our community activity is currently paused . We are all very frustrated by this but cannot find any answers .    Normally I would give this game 9.5/10 . I have played thousands of hours and admittedly love it BUT as I can no longer play it I cannot recommend it ( I can barely belive I am saying that ). Should this situation change I shall of course update this review accordingly .			"

												I have 4 sims, project cars, assetto corsa, raceroom and rfactor which I just purchased. I am very dissapointed in the graphics, track is not bad but car graphics are like an unfinished product. The handling is pretty good about the same as raceroom in my opinion but raceroom has a lot better graphics. One thing I do like is unlike the other games, if I bump a car in front of me or lose traction my car doesn't consistantly put my front end into the bank or wall. The game also needs more cars but my biggest complaint is the graphics. They are way outdated. If they improve them to be comparible to at least raceroom quality I believe it could be equivalent to the other sims. Until that I would not recommend this game.			"

												I plan to revisit rf2 when its next on sale, but at the time of review:Pros:Clearly one of the best physics enginesHas all the ""essential"" racing sim features that other games like AC are still missingAI cant be worse than AC, PCARSCons:Quality of the official content (some of which downloaded via ISI workshop) seemed all over the place. Some tracks had super low resolution mesh so felt like driving a 20 year old game, a couple of cars felt bad too, although maybe I was driving those on tracks that didn't have the real road feature enabled and it fell back to some other track grip mode (either way this in itself is a problem and annoying to have to check when going from one track to another).Workshop is missing a lot of the ""must have"" mods (mp server browser full of stuff not on there)Having random users upload the modders work is not ideal, and there arent enough reviews on the stuff that is there to tell if its worth tryingPaying for an mp subscription when the public mp is dead is also odd... you have to join a league/club to play online which is fine, but why do I need to pay ISI for that?UI isnt that nice, but its functional and easy to find stuffSome inconsistency with sounds, didnt notice any collision sounds in several cars that i tried			"

												I ve had this game for several yrs now, and i must admit its gotten much better with recent updates but it still feels like its in beta still and visually looks outdated compared to other titles.EDit:Once the title matures and becomes a more complete game rather than a modding platform I will change my review to a positive.  The game has an amazing driving experience but has a few immersion breaking bugs for my liking :)Pros:Excellent FFB & physics one of the best in the industry!ModdableLive track,weather and day to night transitionthe track atmosphere on isi contont feel very alive with the 3d animationsGood for leaguescompletely customizable for those that like to tinkerCons:Graphics......DX9 really ?car skins look terrible, some tracks that have been updated look good but those that havent arentUi is outdatedSome flickering textures and running shadows drive me nuts!Sounds...tires screech/skid sounds terrible and engine sounds are a meh at mostlacks content and has no official race series, just one car from random race classesMods....very little quality available and the majority are just ports from rf1 or ripped from other titlesHardly any activity in multiplayer and you will need to seek out an online league to get in any racesNo career modeNot noob friendly and takes alot tickeringThe PRICE.....i paid $85 usd for  a1 yr membership back when it was originally released.  Thats over $100 cdn once converted which i feel is not worth it for the amount of content that comes in the base package, especially since there is no licensed series.  So take advantage of the current 40% off price!!!!This new engine ISI has created has tons of potential, unfortunately ISI treats it more like a community modding platform  than a game and leaves alot for the user to create and figure out as they have stated they will not purchase any series licenses.I really hope a dev team like Reiza will use this engine in the future and give it a little Reiza love and push the boundaries!

The game gets stuck on menus and due to some bugs I was unable to set up my Fanatec CS steering wheel and pedals at all. There's some work to do.

												I had to get a refund and steam were kind enough to accept my issue, i like the games i buy to work straight away, first the game had problems installing all the stock mods that come with this game so i was basically left with an incomplete game, then after i actually got into the game to play the only mod that successfully installed itself i was greeted with ""RFactor 2 has stopped working"", specs Windows10, GTX 980, I7 6700K 4.00GHz, 24GB Ram, i shouldn't be having issues.Shame, Rfactor 2 looks to be my type of game since o enjoyed most of Simbin's games but i just cannot be bothered to go through all the hassle lately, a game should work as soon as you finish downloading the thing, understand i am not giving this game a thumb down becuase the game is bad, it seems like a solid sim, i am giving Rfactor 2 a thumb down becuase of the issues i have encountered and i am just not in the mood to be honest, games should work if you meet the recommended specifications simple as that, anything else is an issue on the developers part.My first refund sadly had to be from a company that actually tries, sorry, maybe when the issues are sorted out i will try again.

												To me this "" sim feels more like a old Codemasters TOCA "" sim.  The starting wheel and car set up are so far off, it feels nothing like a sim.  And after dorking with the set up for a bit, the feeling has gotten better but know where near realistic.  When you cant get a car not to spin out and or loose control at 60 mph, simply because your breaking, (which btw, there is zero feedback for breaking) it leads to nothing but frustration.  There is also a button for the rev limiter but seemingly none of the cars have it, and like a real sim, they have zero tollerance for speeding in the pits, which in turn is just more frustration because even in practice you have to come in and serve your penelty, or be DQ. I have not tried Project Cars or Corrsa, but IMO Raceroom, and I racing are much better because the feedback and sense of speed is way more spot on to RL, and the car's actualy feels like it has tires.  The concept with the throw back cars and tracks are neat, and maybe I just need to tweak on the control setup more, but at this point and time, I really wish I would of tried the Demo because I feel like I wasted my fifty plus bucks on a game that is going to the garage.

												Preview videos and screenshots look fairly good.  Graphically the game is lack luster, once you push the details up, FPS becomes a problem.  Note I run 2x GTX980 in SLI with tripple screens.  It performs more poorly than project cars from a FPS perspective.  Physics are quite good but Assetto Corsa has physics that is just as good (if not better) and graphically performs well and IMO looks way better.  The user interface is generally quite poor and reminds me of a HTML rendered page (maybe a little better).  There are better performing, prettier, more polished alternatives around.  Give it a try if you will and you can get a refund if it doesnt float your boat. I requested a refund and would rather purchase the next PCars dlc instead.			"

												To be fair, it's a good sim, still probably the best option besides iRacing.  Poor selection of tracks though.  ISI has left this mostly to the modding community and it's a horrid mess.  We need more tracks that have enough grid boxes and pit stalls for the large fields rF2 can support.  My negative review is all about the Steam integration...worst decision ISI ever made IMO as I only run in leagues, and Steam is not well suited for this.The Steam overlay is very annoying and can be distracting...when a friend launches a game I get a pop up notification when in car. I realize I can turn the overlay off...but I prefer it on for taking screens. If Steam had the option to turn off only notifications (maybe it does and I'm not aware) it would be much better.Also, I prefer to keep my install very, very clean. I only have league mod installed and the required tracks at any one time. So synching with Workshop every time I launch is unnceccasary and the delay while it synches gets annoying at every launch. It also seems to 'force' new content downloads on me. No thanks. I prefer to choose what and when I install any new content (official or mods).Last, I detest background aps running on racenights...and Steam is an intrusive hog at the best of times.Finally, I pity the fool who tries to run a league event on Tuesday night here in North America with Steam's rolling updates interupting service without notice.  Hopefully the new partnership will see some improvements.			"

It like most racing sims is not about fun and driving, it is about knowing the mechanics and engineering of a racecar.

The rFactor2 was born to make money!!What they did in this new project could have been done in the old rFactor, you can see it in iRacing which is one of the best platforms that go around...you do not buy iRacing2 or 3...
