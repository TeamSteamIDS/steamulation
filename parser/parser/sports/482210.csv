												Sure, I wish that the players moved, but overall the physics in this game are really good and I love trying to beat my high score.			"

												Fun game, easy to learn.  You really have to use your arm and THROW it!  Good exercise.  It will be cool when the targets move, lots of potential.			"

												This game looks and plays great. There could always be more content but it's def one of the best sports games on the vive.			"

												Game its self isn't bad. Mechanics are decent, and visual are surprisingly great. The problem with it is the amount of content. There are two modes, practice and play (practice but timed). There is nothing other than throwing at still targets. No pass rush, no receivers, no plays or defense. As a huge football fan I wish I could enjoy the game and give it a positive review, but in its current state I can not.Edit: I should mention, the game would be worth around $5 max, I would reccomend the game around that price. But with the game currently being $20...its a hard sell			"

												I was really unsure if I should try this one, based on the prior review. To my surprise I really like this game, good graphics, sounds are good. The mechanics seem a bit robotic, but if they were too realistic I could really see myself getting frustrated because I would miss A LOT! You basically throw the ball toward the target and if you release at just about the right angle it will lock on and hit the target. Play options are light (practice/competition). I played for 20 minutes and i'm ready to go back in and climb the leaderboard. I'd recommend this if your itching to play some American football in VR.			"
