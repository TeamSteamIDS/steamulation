												A simple game of where you make the play calls. You start your own team and can recurit. Later join faction of other teams. It doesn't take much to learn, because it just easy and fun.			"

												I like the fact that changing strategy actually makes an important difference in a game. Very well done and easy to play!			"

												It's a good start, well worth keeping tabs on. Quick and easy to get in, once you have qualified for a league the fun starts!Playing with real people makes it fun! Don't quite have the ""make the right move at the right time"" down to science, but management and match play is easy to get into. Not too much, not too little.			"

												People who enjoy football manager, or the manager mode on FIFA alike I highly reccomend this game. It is going in the right direction, and with a few adjustments (maybe a few more positions and formations, a different system to the stars for purchasing players and maybe a nicer lineup page) the game could go very far. A promising start for the game, definitely worth giving it a shot.			"

												A game, and devs, I've been following for a while. They started out with LVH (Virtual League of Hockey) which was a simple browser based Hockey Manager game. I lost many, way too many, hours climbing the global ladders, playing the league and the finals against other people... But as this came on my radar it had my interest because I'm a football kind of guy! That being said, the game isn't where I want it to be. It still has some quirks and bugs, that ruin the experience for me. But it's definitely getting there. (Been testing and keeping tabs on it for a long time)When this game gets to, where it aims to go, it'll be a highly recomendable game. And yeah... these devs won't drop the ball on this one. This is a rather small company, trying to make it in the world of indies. At the end of the day, the concept of creating your team, managing training, player market in a real , breathing community is ambitious, but really cool! - What do I recommend?Try it, and then figure out if you like the concept or not. If you like it, keep tabs on it, like I do, and test it now and then. But regardless of wether you like it or not, give the devs some pointers on where you see areas for improvement!			"
