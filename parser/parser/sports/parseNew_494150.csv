Early Access Review
								As a person who did boxing as a hobby in college, I am very happy with this game and defintiely recommend it (especially because it is not a wave shooter like the rest of the VR games out there). I can block, bob and weave, counter punch when the computer throws punches (uppercuts, cross, hooks), so it's a great alternative to shadowboxing because you can practice defense at the same time. The blocking stamina mechanic is a good compromise so people dont cheese the system. However, since it is an early access game it is low on content (only one practice opponent and one real opponent), but I am sure the developer will add more soon since he has been very receptive to feedback and quick with his updates since his demo. The core mechanics are very solid and it is definitely worth the current price.   EDIT: Adding a gameplay video of myself to give people an idea of what to expect.

								For those concerned with ""yet another early access VR title""... you are right to be.  In other words, as advertised, this game is presently low on options with only 1 full opponent (not counting the training partner and the practice dummy manager).   There is a lot of work ahead for the dev.... However, let's also look at it from the POV of what we have.  - A serious fun arcadish boxing game?  check- A way decent level of presence?  Check (I swear when he gets right in my face, I HAVE to back off!)- A workout and a half in trying to down the opponent? Check!- A dev that has already shown an ability to listen and quickly apply some upgrades to key areas?  Check!- Ugly Joe ugly enough?  With the update, checkmate!Serious fun, superior to the initial demo in every way and well worth purchasing.  Some tweaks still needed to the sound department (I want to hear the opponent grunt when I land some decent shots!) and the aformentioned need for other opponents but superior boxing game is attainable here when we look at the initial effort.Highly recommended!

								Ignore the bad reviews!!This game is brilliant! I just loaded it up during my lunch break and I'm covered in sweat!The developers really nailed it when they allowed the user to adjust the glove positionning! The game progresses perfectly and it's very intuitive to learn. The immersion is really intense.I never boxed a day in my life ""other than Wii boxing"" and I just jumped into it feeling like I was really in the ring.To add some stress. they added some gruesome monsters to box against. The Zombie is super stressfull as he gets closer and closer to take a bite! ProsExcellent work out even if that's not your intention.Feels very natural after setting up the glove positionning. Nice Grafx and audioNice variety of opponents.Cons/suggestions;You will soak your VR headset with sweatNo online play yet Would be nice to have arms Would be great to include some iconic boxers like Mike Tyson or Mohammad Ali to get a sense of scale ;)Bought for $10.99CAD and I feel it's definitely worth it!

								Absolutely brilliant game. It is by far the most nuanced boxing simulator in the world (not that there are that many).I've been playing this game for the past few months and it just keeps getting better and better.  It's so rare to have a developer consistently exceed expectations with every update. I wish there were a way to support the developer beyond the one time purchase of the game, but I think it wouldn't matter much to him anyway. This game is clearly a labor of love.			"

								This game is a workout. You will be exhausted very quickly. This isn't bad or good, just know what you're getting into.I kickbox a few times a week so this game was a no-brainer. It delivers exactly what I expected, which is a very arcadey VR boxing game. The different fighters you face all present unique and different challenges, which mixes things up. So far its been a blast for me and everyone ive shown it to.It's a very worth while VR purchase.* The foam on your VR helmet is gonna get sweaty.			"

It's easily my favourite VR game at the moment. If you enjoy boxing or you want a great workout this game is definitely worth it.At the time of this review i'm on the beta branch for update #14 and it just lifts the game to a whole new level.Pros:+ Blocking and dodging feel great+ Countering after a block works very well+ The game runs flawlessly - no performance problems at all+ The face of the opponent deforms from hitsCons:- The hit speed is cappedThe developer has stated that he will add a ""fitness level"" option that will increase the force cap and enemy health. My opinion is that the force cap should be fully unlocked, but that may or may not fit the game.- The opponents are too easyI lost only once to the ""Blue Bomber"" and otherwise i breezed through them all in a single session. I understand that the game is balanced towards the average user that may not have trained boxing, so this is a minor issue. The (hopefully) upcoming feature that allows the fitness level to be adjusted would help with this of course.Great work developer! From all the VR games i've played (which is A LOT) - this is my favourite.			"

								Pros: Provides a good workout and genuinely gives you a little insight into the concept of combinations, albeit in a somewhat glitchy way. Body blows can make your opponent drop their guard, and you can throw hooks around your opponent's guard.Cons: Defense is iffy at best. I've had opposing boxers repeatedly punch right through my guard, while their guard seems flawless. Also, the mechanics are a bit weak, as you can literally step up to your opponent and just start pounding on the top of their head with both hands, eventually knocking them out even if they're guarding.Overall: Not a bad game. Definitely a good workout, and I'm sure that all of its flaws are due simply to being an early access title. For what it is, it's worth the $10 price tag.			"

Early Access Review
								I struggle to give it a bad review. I see where it is going, and it is the only game that I have seen in VR that is trying this, but anything that makes me rage quit I can't recommend. Too Easy: I plowed through everyone up to the blue bomber without ever being knocked down. The difficulty does not scale. The first opponents just turtle behind their gloves, and let you pound them, until they are unconscious. Too Hard: The blue bomber is a ♥♥♥♥ing beast. Even if I hit him twice as many times as I get hit, I can't hurt him. I have only managed to knock him down one time. The difficulty curve on this one goes from boring to unbeatable in one opponent.  Blocking is Broken: Are you supposed to be able to block with the gloves? I do it out of instinct, but every time, old blue goes right through the block. I would test it with the other fighters, but they don't throw punches. This means the only thing I have left for defense is to dodge. So now I'm flailing my head around like crazy, feeling like an idiot, trying to not get hit. Fighter placement: This is probably my biggest complaint. I play on oculus, and I only have 180 sensors, so I have to be facing front in order for it to read my glove placement. It works on the startup when I step on the scale...it works when I spawn at the fight board... and then in the match, it spawns the fighter on my right, instead of right in front of me. so, I have to turn to my right to fight, but now my right sensor is blocked by my body. This causes my right hand to either not respond, or to just fly off into space at random periods. Crowding: If you watch actual boxers, they move in to attack, throw a few punches, and back out so they don't get hit. Old blue, and a few of the other guys move in, but they never move out. they just stay in the pocket, and either hit, or be hit. The problem is, I don't want to stay in there with them. I move back, and they follow. eventually I hit the wall, in reality. I have no way to circle around them to escape, so I'm just stuck there getting pounded on. "

								It seems that all the negative reviewers are forgetting that this game is early access. I tried the demo before this was released and loved it. And after the update, it is just more brilliant. No more shattering gloves, and we got Lightning Luis, A much more challenging opponent that is gonna take some practice to beat. This game just keeps getting better. The blocking was insanely improved and is a good way to put up a fight against Luis. This game was just barely released for early access and people are bashing it already. For only 8$, I've already got my money's worth just from this first update. Keep up the good work Mr. Fitz! You have created a fantastic game.			"

								If you're looking for a VR boxing or fighting game, this is the best thing available!Fighting in this game feels very life like, with the opponents reacting to your every move. You can punch, block and duck like you're really in the ring. You'll have to mix up your shots and keep your guard up to beat the challenging AI, but with practice and effort you'll feel like a better boxer when you do.The ""game"" elements (scoring, progression etc.) are very much still work in progress, however the boxing is already a lot of fun, and the developer takes the time to read and reply to comments and suggestions. Be sure to opt in to the beta as new features are regularly added.I look forward to the finished product, but play this almost every day already, as it's a great workout! If you're struggling to drag yourself to the gym our out for a run, this game is a fun way to keep fit, and no doubt learn at least a little about boxing for real!			"

								as a boxing instructor i really enjoyed this game. my biggest critism is that the hand gets stuck to the head and  body when punching the opponent. as much as i like this experience when lightly tapping, it break the momentum of the punch on fast shots and feels weird. i think that the hand should pass through the body on high speed punches like in kunlun fight,with some kind of effect to register the hit has made contact. i think there should also be some kind of feedback when the player blocks a punch, and how to block for that matter as the computers players manage to punch through my guard quite often. other than that its coming along nicely			"

								I know jack♥♥♥♥♥♥about boxing, but i found enjoyment in this game even if it ""true"" or not to the actual sport. Would love to have a proper block mechanic but i guess they will add something like that.Either way, there isn't much to it at the moment. But i would love if they added a training room with stuff to punch and some costumization of gloves and such.This game is barebone at the time i'm writing this, you might as well wait before buying. It is what it is and little boxing experience don't be to hyped but if someone come by let them try it out. They will probably have a blast while it lasts.			"

								Disclaimer: The only boxing experience I have was the one time I punched my friends boxing bag and sprained my wrist.Purchased my vive last week, set it up and decided to grab a variety of games to put it through its paces over the weekend. Thrill of the fight was something of a yolo purchase; I normally steer clear of anything sport related. However I figured the reviews were promising and I was interested to see how convincing a simulated face punch can be without concussions and stuff.Turns out simulated face punches are more than sufficient motivation to make me move my body to avoid the annihilation of my digital cartilage. As far as realism goes, i cannot speak from any kind of experience, however the domsthat i am experiencing right now is most certainly real.Further the facial disfigurement is a really awesome, the graphics are not exactly photorealistic, however the damage your oponent sustains from good clean hits really makes it feel far more realistic than the graphics alone would appear to convey. Its kinda quite confronting when your opponent gets up off the mat with a massive Jean Claude Van Damme forehead egg right where the hit that floored them connected.I rate it four and a half JCVD forehead eggs out of five.

								great game and a great workout.  I hope the game continues to evolve and somehow the developer manages to capture the force with which you throw the punch so i dont feel cheated for attempting to box with good technique as opposed to some videos you see of people able to beat the oponents but with less than optimal technique.  Be prepared to get drenched in sweat if you go for a more proactive/aggressive approach. Love it.			"

Early Access Review
								Tried out the Beta and still enjoyed the game. The added arms gives you advantage to block attacks, I like the new damage system being reduced when you partially block an attack, even using your arms. I was amazed how close to accurate your arms are at, though it needs some work according to the developer but I trust him based from my experience, it looks like it is heading to the right direction. Always remember to let the game calibrate your body to get proper proportions, also calibrate each time you switch the vive to another friend. Heavy punching opponents (There is a new guy who is like a heavy weight with heavy punches) are tougher to block, sometimes it requires 2 hands to block heavy shots and blocking using 1 arm/glove sometimes is not enough. Your arms and the opponents arms react like that of the game Fight Night series where it can tangle at some point but not to an extent and sill feels like arcade. The damage you can give now is based off the speed of your punch, it gets challenging and pushes your strength specially when you are already tired at some point. Early releases feels more arcade, this one still is but with a bit of realism, punches do not fully go through their heads depending on the strength of punch, it can still go through their bodies but sometimes it stops at some point, your arms/gloves might not be where they are but they are just only inches off and I like the feel and most of the time it is on point. Some might not like it, but I guess because it feels different, for those who haven't tried the game yet and go straight to beta, you will still enjoy even with the new changes, they have their equal ups and downs, it is still the same game, you will sweat a lot and have lots of fun doing exercise, this is the best exercise you can get whether you have boxing skills or not. I have some boxing skills taught from my grandpa and if you have, you will enjoy this game more because there are many areas in this game that applies to the boxing discipline, this is the best VR boxing you get, of course you can always exploit the game and beat the guys easy, as they have their technical limitations, part of the fun in the game is somewhat up to you, how you react and move yourself in the playing field, boxers will try this game and apply like they shadow box on real opponent, casual players will just barage the opponent as many hits as they can, if you are a fan of Fight Night series then this game is the closes VR game to that and of real life boxing.Recommendations- Option to adjust the starting point of your arms (shoulder) It looks closer to my head. Or overall manual calibration.- Improve opponents reaction when doing sidestep, they look dumb when I keep on circling them.- Apply illegal blow warnings (referee warning, kinda) when hitting at the back of the multiple times when playes go behind them.- I don't think the body works well unless we have sensors to detect, leaning forward does not work in this game as your body just moves forward like a hanging slab attached to your neck.- Maybe tweak the damage system to add more damage when countering their punches and less when opponents expect to be attacked or when they are in defensive mode. In real boxing you tend to get hurt more on punches you don't expect.- Maybe try to play with special punches, a charge punch by holding a button to charge it.- Add movement to characters to dodge your attacks, duck, lean way and moving back to lure you to an attack or sidestep and move away when hurt.- Add player knocked down on floor, not following the downed players body because this can cause nausea, maybe just put a downed players body on the floor and add Taunt animation on the characters taunting the downed players body, this will be more challenging and will provoke the players. It would be funny to have the player (John Doe) wearing a VR headset and holding the vive controllers with gloves getting knocked down on the floor.			"

								A must have for any boxing fans, or any VR players looking for a good sweat. I have over 10 hours in this game and have enjoyed it even in it's earlier forms. The new cuts and bruises with the beta is awesome and I can't wait to see this system fleshed out. The developer/s is active and has fixed the fighting system recently so the AI feels like it's fighting back. The blocking system is awesome and the haptics involved with blocking and punching are well done. There is a variety of characters offering different types of fights (fast puncher, tall boxer, easy fight, medium fight and a fighter that gives off a Mike Tyson vibe). There's also characters left from a halloween update that offer a pretty good challenge (zombie and headless horseman/pumpkin head). Overall, this game has been well worth the 10$ I spent and also goes on sale quite a bit. Definitely a buy.			"

								So far I am enjoying this game.  This is a good example of a game that is not possible to this level on a PC/screen.  I have a lot of experience fighting, as I am a mixed martial artist that has about 10 years experience.  This game is the most realistic fist fighting game I have ever played by a large margin.  free form fighting that relies on real fight timing and not some prescripted fight timing that was dreamed up for an arcade.  I watched some videos of some people playing this on youtube and if this is accurate, they should get their asses handed to them in the upper levels....flailing and no blocking.  dropping blocks, etc.  we shall see.  Good job devs in plowing new ground that the big studios would not have the Cojones to touch.			"

								Game is graphically very rough and there isn't much content... but what's there is super great.  Obviously it's not realistic boxing but it's far closer than any other boxing game we've ever played.  And after you've played for a half hour, you feel like you've done a few rounds - if you're weaving and punching and getting into the spirit of the thing, you get a legitimate workout before you know it.Already worth the money.  And if developer keeps adding opponents (I'd like some ""quick punch pattern"" guys like in Punch Out) it'll be a classic.  Great.  Fully recommended.			"

								The Thrill of the Fight! Is a breakthrough game for VR. Looking at the video and screenshots alone makes you wonder, will this be any good? Well, the answer is YES! This game is phenomenal, and I do not just say it to make it sound good.As soon as you are thrown into it, you get the feel that you are actually there in the training gym. The scale of the players is immensely accurate. Graphics:Graphics are one thing while gameplay is a whole different thing. ToTF has managed to settle truly in between these two things as the visuals are fine the way they are. The players have great details as well as the boxing ring. The only downside I would name is, the background or “Crows” if you can call it, that is a bit lacking at the current release, but hey, that’s not the main focus of the developer at this time.Gameplay:This is where this game truly shines, you are put into a ring to go through 5 opponents (At the time of writing this review) which all vary in personality/skills and size. You immediately raise your guard as you know this will be a fight! This game allows you to do different types of punches such as Jabs, Deflections, Uppercuts and throw straight punches/lunges as well as a sophisticated dodge system which you can combine with Ducking, strafing around your opponent, raising your gloves to guard, but be careful, the side of your head can be open for the opponent to strike, so you really have to managed your blocking, which is great!The enemy AI is a work in progress, but at its current state it is polished enough to be called, more than acceptable! They block, move slightly around the ring and adjust to your play space accordingly. Based on the fighter you face, they might have different abilities. Without spoiling the fights to anyone, think about agility, size, force and weight. Overall, this is a must buy game for anyone, whether they have played boxing before or not. This game will have you sweating after fighting with all the opponents. This promotes an active game style for sure.  The developer is constantly updating the game, on a weekly basis and is delivering new opponents, promised game modes and tweaks to the fighting system. Do yourself a favor and buy this game, you will not regret it as it is pure fun to jab someone in the face, the only thing missing is the feedback of doing so in real life! "

								Really enjoying this! Mechanics are getting better and better with each update and the feel of boxing is pretty realistic. You can do jabs, uppercuts, hooks and straight punches (also body shots) and there actually is quite a nice amount strategy involved in using different attacks as well between different opponents. I like the dodging and defending mechanisms. Blocking straights, hooks and body shots really require you to actively switch the hand positions and even though the headset is kind of ""heavy"", using head movement to dodge really works nicely as well. I can't comment much on the movement and leg work since I have limited space so that is important part of real boxing strategy which I can't test really well. This game does require quite a big space fully enjoy it, but even almost stationary boxing still works ok.There is a nice amount of variance between the opponent styles and their strategies also have been getting better with updates. Although maybe they are bit oo repetetive as after a while you might find some strategy which works kind of too well against them. But you can still add some challenge by just mixing your own game up a bit and not exploit the ""sure"" strategy. I didn't like having unblockable punches with one of the opponents. In the latest beta update his punches are now blockable and I find it much more enjoyable while still challenging. Although maybe unblockable punches would make for a nice mini game on top of the zombies and headless opponent. I did find that trying to use only dodging required a hefty amount of energy and it was a really nice workout!Overall, I feel this game captures the feel of boxing really well even at this stage while it seems that updates are still frequent. I hope the game keeps evolving in the future as well!			"

								Game is graphically very rough and there isn't much content... but what's there is super great.  Obviously it's not realistic boxing but it's far closer than any other boxing game we've ever played.  And after you've played for a half hour, you feel like you've done a few rounds - if you're weaving and punching and getting into the spirit of the thing, you get a legitimate workout before you know it.Already worth the money.  And if developer keeps adding opponents (I'd like some ""quick punch pattern"" guys like in Punch Out) it'll be a classic.  Great.  Fully recommended.			"

								I waited to buy this game, did my research and bought it after Update #14. It's legit. This is a very decent game for core training and boxing simulation. I also like the old school boxing techniques. The physics continue to need work, but it does hold up on its own now. My wife has enjoyed this as well, finding the technique she learned to be useful in the game. The dev team seems to be committed to updating and improving the game and I've seen where they've responded to legit problems in negative reviews. I think that this app will only continue to improve.			"

								I got home from boxing, and hopped on the ol' Vive.  I saw this and wet my dirty smelly shorts.  I like to shadowbox; in the shower, waiting for my GF to decide what she wants to eat, or waiting for steam games to download.. this is a great alternative.  You can pull, bob and weave.  Hell the bot even pulls and comes back with a counter punch! With only ONE update so far and it's this immersive, I think our future is bright if Ian wants to keep going on this.  This is only the start and I expect great things!Edit:  There have been so many updates, and my review lacks a lot of what has been added on.  The blocking, ability to dodge punches, and techniques that the AI uses have all been upgraded.  Your punch power is now based on how fast you actually are with the controllers.  I love this game ten times more now, if you box give it a try.  If you don't box, this is great for learning!			"

								Great game, the most intense workout of all games tried so far (several dozen top titles).Unfortunately, women players I've shown this to refuse to play as the opponents are all men or monsters.Needs FEMALE opponents, especially shorter ones (with shorter arms) that ideally would be on the attractive/human-looking side versus looking undead as some of these male opponents do.  There are many women who are into boxing, but this game isn't welcoming for some of them (so I have been told).Naturally, more opponents/gamification (e.g. prize earnings to pimp out your gym, betting on your own fights, etc.) would be welcome, but I'm hoping that will be coming in time.  The important part re: the boxing mechanics is nailed down well here.			"

								While not a simulation game, it's the closest thing in development at the moment. It's early access and still needs some work to be truly great, but it's already fun. It is steadily getting updates and getting improved gameplay. This game will give you a good workout, especially if you aproach it like real boxing and move around and throw some decent punches. While not a simulation you will be doing all the same movements as you would in real life (assuming you put effort into it) so it's like an intense shadow boxing session. You don't need to be fit to play the game though and you can also play more casually. If you're interested in VR boxing I'd recomend this game, and you'll be getting a decent  workout while playing. Also while not exactly promised the dev is interested in adding multiplayer, so if that interests you it will probably be added at some point. There are some complaints I but I think the dev is working on most of them. Things also mentioned by others, like the punch force cap, which dev has said will be raised.Extended: Using new Beta.The game is getting better and better, it's now a much more authentic boxing experience, for the experienced boxers, let's not call it a sim, but it is a true boxing game now in my opinion. Power cap has been removed, opponents move more naturally and fight more dynamically. You can get flash KOs and one punch knockdowns. You can also be taken out very quickly yourself, so you have to think about what you're doing. The game mechanics have been tightened up so it feel a lot more real now, and it's more challenging, although it might still be easy for some (very few) people. You now get blurry vision when damaged which convey the damage really well, and is a good reprentation of being wobbled. Still no rounds but that is coming, and then it will be even better. There are more positives that I can't think of right now.			"

								I'm sorry to say that I don't like this game but hopefully it will get better.   But before going in to detail about what I don't like, there is one feature that I love.I love the fact that the game measures your height to make sure that your opponents are scaled appropriately.  My favorite thing to do is to get on my knees during the ""weigh in"" process causing my opponents to be much shorter and easier to beat.What I don't like about this game.  For starters, for some reason all of the characters tend to stand too close to you often pushng me towards the edge of my playing area.  They need to learn to back off far enough to allow you to throw punches.  I hate that the characters are mute, making the VR experience very uncomfortable.  The physics and game dynamics feel very wrong.  I almost never feel like my punches make contact even when I've thrown a good right hook.  Since the game is so awkwardly silent, there should be added music in the background.  Anyway, I basically believe I'm getting my money's worth and seriously, get down as low as you can when you weigh in to make your opponents tiny.  You will get a workout but if you're like me you'll be angry after fighting a couple matches due to an unsatisfying experience.  I'm hoping this develops into a fun game but it isn't there yet.  Having said all that, I'm still going to recommend it, there's just something about this game that gives me hope.			"

My heart is pounding. Hands are clammy. My whole body shaking. The noise of the crowd fades. Everything goes black. Am I dead? No. No, I was just knocked out by Luis ""The Lightning"" Felix. I slowly stand up from the crouched position I was frozen in. So this is what it feels like to be knocked out at the peak of your boxing career. Why did I get so cocky? Dead Eyes McGhee taught me everything he knew and sent me on my way. Ugly Joe? He may have been born ugly but he was a whole lot uglier when I was through with him. How could defeating an old, overweight man and an ugly ex-MMA fighter send me into such an ego high? Regardless, here I stood and there he stood. My chest deflated. My head hung low. As I'm booed out of the arena there's only one thing left to do. Bring it on Luis! Let's get this headset even sweatier!  "

								This is a real VR beat & up,  a semi realistic boxing simulation. The game is great, and getting better with each update! Now fighters waive and bob, dodge and block attacks. They tend to behave realistically and move smartly in space. Graphics are also amazing and runs great when supersampled to 1.8 on g1 1080, giving a strong immersion feeling. It's much much better than the other available game of boxe named boxing legend, and i put it on par with the other great Virtual Reality beat & up named Swordmaster VR, which is a must in case you like this game.

								Build Date: 6/31 or 7/1, the build that was released with early access.I demo'd Thrill of the Fight when the developer posted it on Reddit, and immediately took to it.  Sending the developer some feedback, he said he was aiming for an arcade-y feel and I think he's managed to hit a good sweet spot where the game is fun but you don't need to be an expert in anything, though being better does provide you more windows of opportunity to attack.This version is a huge improvement on the demo, which was only made available a short while ago, showing that the developer has the ability to write quality content in a reasonable timeframe.I'd say the price point for two fights (right now there's your trainer and Ugly Joe) is worth it, as there's many different ways to fight Joe, and you could slowly get better, work up from dodging to countering, work up from guarding to dodging, there's always ways to improve your personal skill, and from what it sounds like, it'll be needed for future fights.Looking forward to seeing more enemies and new ways to mix things up!

								Sorry, but one of the worst games I've played on the Vive.  The controls are bad.  The physics are bad.  It feels like a Wii game.  Doesn't feel accurate at all.			"

								yes yes this has plenty of room for improving but who says it will. at this point the game is no fun, its kind of broken. hopefully the person or team working on it are dedicated. what is up with the shattering hands? is that ment to be tired? no let the user get tired when he gets tired. make damage be relative to force of swing/punch. everything else try to emulate fight night. or playstation move ""the fight"".   make the fighting ring or space be dynamic auto adjusting to the users room size (like they did in ""chair in a room"").

								Only 1 enemy and he is really easy to beat. The ""glove break"" is the worst thing you could ever do, please, remove it and add more enemies.If you aren't a fighter irl, this game could be funny with more enemies, but if you are looking for good fights where you can fight ""free"", this is not your game.The idea is good tho, hope you can improve the game			"

								Pretty terrible if am honest, you can throw punches, they just go through the opponents head, like if you punch him in the face full force and his gloves are up, his head doesn't even move.			"

								Back in the day, I had a game called 4D boxing.  It was on my first PC and it was one of my favorites.  This game brought it to life for me.  I wish there were more sport sims like this for the Vive.  I made a mixed reality video of my gamplay fighting all 8 fighters here:

			Watch all the action in this video as I wipe the floor with all eight opponents in a row on Pro level. I'm just a Geek Dad that loves VR games. I film VR videos in Mixed Reality.		

Boxing fan, sport fan, or just want a workout.  Get this game today.  The developer is constantly giving updates and it is well worth the price.   "

								Very cool game! Played with friends for the first time and everyone of use were getting a solid workout and good laughs. We chatted and would like to see rounds or a timer added soon so we could compete on that level between us all. The fourth opponent was a massive step up from the third also, Too big a jump it seemed. In its current Its still very much worth the puirchase, If you wanna play VR and get some cardio in that day.. this is your game.Look forward to seeing more stuff implemented.			"

								Thrill of the Fight tricked my body enough to kick my sympathetic nervous system into gear. You will actually be pumped with adrenaline while playing this game. The most visceral melee combat game atm. Only complaint is that there is really no reason to move around the boxing ring, rather than just stand in place and punch.9/10 would punch my tv again			"

								This game is simply the best boxing experience available so far. Its come a long way from some very buggy beginnings, but the dev has put lots of effort into improving it continuously. Just the fact that its regularly updated puts it head and shoulders above any other VR boxing game I can think of.Its not a 100% realistic boxing simulation (which I dont think is possible with the limited number of tracking points in current VR), but is as close as you are going to get for the immediate future. The difficulty is varying a lot with different patches currently, but the dev has recently added a skill slider, so even novices should be able to enjoy it. The dev is also pretty responsive to users requests, so if you think something should be added, let him know.I use it for a fun workout, fighting 3-4 guys in a row. One thing to note is that using it like this WILL cause your Vive/Rift to get pretty sweaty - so I'd suggest a VR cover, bandana, or similar to avoid issues with excess moisture.			"

								This is hands down my favourite game for VR. Fighting in this is so intense, and a great work out. I can't play it that much though because each fight is so intense it takes a lot out of me.What would really elevate this game above everything else is if boxing techniques were taught in game. For example, if your trainer could actually help you train and teach you techniques taht would be really cool.Also, a mode to help you warm up before a match would be ideal too... like light stretching and warm up exercises - since each fight is quite fast and intense. I can see people getting injured from not warming up properly lol.Anyway, thank you dev, keep up the good work!			"

								I use this game to get my heart pumping every morning.  I really enjoy it.  It is very immersive.  I hope that the programmer will add more boxers in.  There are strategies you can use while boxing and I like that.  I am still learning them.  I wish there were more indications when you are wearing them down and when you knock them out they just sort of drop.  There is no indication that they are very close or will drop.  But really.. it is just 3D so what can you do..  Good job though.. well done.			"

								Boxing capitalizes on the strengths of the Vive while minimizing its weaknesses.  In its 7th update, TotF has progressed from its humble origins into a legitimate game, rather than a promising tech demo.  There is a solid core experience with different enemy styles.  The game lacks any campaign structure, so your replay will depend on your interest in experimenting with the mechanics and improving as a player.  For those with boxing experience, you can do all the stuff you should be doing, and it's effective.  If you have a large enough VR space, you can use footwork effectively.TotF is one of the best-designed games available for the Vive currently.  The concept works with the hardware, and the execution is good.  No teleportation or button presses to take you out of the experience; you're just punching and trying not to get punched.  It makes sense to the novice, but also allows the use of skill.  There's a lot more that can be done with VR fisticuffs, but for now this is as good as it gets.			"

								This has so much potential. It is an INCREDIBLE workout. The things I think would make this even better is:Correct the scale of the ring. It seemed HUGE. Make Body shots count. It didn't seem like they did.The gloves shattering is an odd mechanic. I should be able to throw as many shots as I want if there are openings. Having to dodge first then attack gets old and predictable.When you hold the guy, the controllers should vibrate to let you know the hold is locked in. Make it more organic and not so cut and dry with the movements. All in all this can be one of the best VR games to hit!			"

								I bought this when it was first released because I was pretty thirsty for a VR fighting game. At the time it was pretty rudimentary and dull, there was only one opponent and felt like I was fighting a stationary log. Disappointed I put this away and came back and revisited it at update 3 and what a difference. Now at update 4 I'm in a position where I am comfortable to recommend this as a early release ""game"", not because it is the only boxing game, but because its actually fun to play. As of update 4 everything has much more weight, like I'm connecting to something and that something is reacting to me, that been a forceful haymaker to the gob.Of course its far from perfect yet, still a little stiff, but its at a point where its satifsying enough to make it my go to high intensity boxing workout, I'm ducking and weaving and occassionally doing my best Kenshiros Hokutō Hyakuretsu Ken (North Star Hundred Crack Fist) attack. After fighting one opponent I am totally out of breath, what a blast.In fact its fun to just dance around the easiest opponent ugly joe, weaving and countering his punches like I am Muhammed Ali and be a Boss. Play like you want!The game falls between arcade and simulation action,  I have an opportunity to parry attacks and free to punch from any angle, with a sense of physics to everything, Each opponents currently also has a specific moveset and while I'm not a professional I have some experience in martial arts and I can react fast enough to some attacks. There is some level of telegraphing as you'd hoped which is great.The play format at the moment is just choose a opponent (who has a particular style) and then engaging in robust gentlemanly discussion until someone kisses the mat 3 times. There is no campaign or real progression system currently besides unlocking a new fighter as you beat the previous (up to 4 as at writing)The sole developer also appears to be active and engages with users. Awesome. So really liking the direction so far and intrigued by hints of bruises an such in future updates, who doesn't want to visually admire the handiwork of their jumping superman punch??? "

								I've bought almost every Vive game worth getting.  My library says it has 128 vr games (not sure how many of those are demos though).  This game is only second to Onward.  That is mostly becase I get tired faster with boxing.  I absolutely love being able to practice sparring, timing, distance, form, footwork of my punches for the days I can't make it to kickboxing class.  Only thing that would make it better would be foot tracking, but thats not the devs fault.  I received a cryptic message from dev on reddit, and if Im reading him right- Im very excited to see where this game goes.  As of now it's more than worth it's price.  Actually I think the first update was worth the price of admission.  Almost every week the game is updated with more content, new mechanics, or refined in some way.  It has come a long way since release.  If you're in to boxing, mma, or just like hitting stuff you need to get this game.			"

								Game gets really good if you have a friend over. You can really get into some great shadow boxing with a friend holding the cable in the air. I know not the best situation but so much more vr fun. It's a proper workout so I'd go as far as saying dress for it. My friend played with a hoodie and was dying haha. This is the best video game for shadow boxing Vr. Yes I have hit the headset with the controls and tried to learn to be gentle with the odd blocking style and in my excitment i have totally hit the walls of my room as well.The only con that you will get use to is how awkward the controllers feel for blocking. They could maybe flip them later so the bottem of the controllers point outwards for blocking but I dunno. That is silly nit picking and that's just a personal feel.That being said 9/10.Will hit wall again.			"

Early Access Review
								I almost never write reviews but I felt compelled to write one for this game.  The game might be a little rough around the edges, and only has 2 fighters as far as I can tell, but the gameplay itself was amazing.  I trained at a boxing gym for 2 years and I was able to use some of the techniques I had been taught.   It was also an amazing workout, my arms are still sore 3 days after first playing the game.Awesome work dev, please keep it up.  You are clearly on to something hear.  I hope that it becomes more and more simulation like and less arcade.Just some suggestions, I'm sure you have tons of ideas to impliment, but this is what I felt would make the game much better1) Focus on the core gameplay and mechanics before adding content like new boxers.  2) I need more feedback on whether or not I landed a punch or blocked a punch.  3) I need some feedback on how powerful the bunch was or how much damage it did.  4) Continue to improve the punching and blocking mechanics.  It's good but could be really great. Once you have a really solid boxing engine you can go anywhere.  Adding new boxers, events, career modes, venues, etc.  Just wait until you have the mechanics really worked out.  Your off to an incredible start.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been having fun with this early access, and glad I picked it up. It's not polished, but it does what you want from a VR boxing game, and it is fun to play around in. I have not regretted picking this one up.When you get early access, you put your dreams into the game for the future. I really hope for interesting boxers, and I hope the game doesn't take itself too seriously. They have built a solid platform, and I hope they give the art some more style and personality. Also, I really hope they can program where the length of the arc of your punches does more damage. Oh if they can program to register wide sweeping uppercuts and haymakers.. call me a happy camper. The new fast punch guy.. really enjoyed that fight. Anyways! Pick it up! A promising early access, and pretty fun for what they have programmed at this point.			"

Early Access Review
								Review as of Update 2 (Lightning Luis just added):Ok so this is obviously an early access game, so there isn't that much content. With that said, what there is seems to be pretty good. Full disclosure: I used to do full contact fighting, sorta like MMA but before that became a specific thing, and used at different times boxing gloves and juijitsu gloves. Overall things feel pretty good. You hold the controllers in a way that makes sense for this context. The opponents are really easy, but it gives you a little workout since they block just about everything unless they're hitting or about to hit. There isn't that much of a sense of actually making contact though, outside the sound. I dunno if it's the shading/lighting or what but it's hard to tell if I landed something (the lack of animation on impact has this effect as well). Body shots don't get any response unless they KO the guy, but the guys KO with the same animation as if you clocked him on the jaw. The characters aren't the most realistic looking, their physiques are kinda weirdly shapes, but it's good enough. I think the dev should look into the NVidia funhouse demo where you punch the little wackamole kind of things. They felt much more real to hit due to their physics and reactions. I would like to see things like hit counts, %'s, some kind of indication of whether I'm hitting hard or soft (just base this off velocity I guess?), and better detection of whether the guy is actually blocking my strikes. Basically I'd like that as the player becomes a better boxer all around he's rewarded. If I can throw 200+ fast jabs/round, and target them through his guard, that'd be nice to get rewarded for. The motivation would be there to become genuinely stronger/faster, so you can overcome the tougher opponents. That'd be truly unique.			"

								Very cool game! Played with friends for the first time and everyone of use were getting a solid workout and good laughs. We chatted and would like to see rounds or a timer added soon so we could compete on that level between us all. The fourth opponent was a massive step up from the third also, Too big a jump it seemed. In its current Its still very much worth the puirchase, If you wanna play VR and get some cardio in that day.. this is your game.Look forward to seeing more stuff implemented.			"

								When it first released it was pretty raw, clunky, and unimpressive. However, the developer has been working hard to get this up to snuff. Todays patch was a thing of beauty. It actually feels like what you'd expect a boxing game to feel like. It is still reallyy early release, but it is already incredible. The new champion introduced today looks cool and is wicked fast. I am soaked in sweat and loving every minute of it. I cannot to see what come next. Highly recommend this title.			"

								This has so much potential. It is an INCREDIBLE workout. The things I think would make this even better is:Correct the scale of the ring. It seemed HUGE. Make Body shots count. It didn't seem like they did.The gloves shattering is an odd mechanic. I should be able to throw as many shots as I want if there are openings. Having to dodge first then attack gets old and predictable.When you hold the guy, the controllers should vibrate to let you know the hold is locked in. Make it more organic and not so cut and dry with the movements. All in all this can be one of the best VR games to hit!			"

Great start to what i think could be a totally awesome fighting engine for Vive physics                                                                         Thanks "

Warning, your headset foam will get very, very sweaty. The only obvious draw back to boxing in VR is when you make contact with your opponent there's no physical feedback but that is to be expected since the opponent is not really there. Also make sure you stretch before you play. I didn't and my shoulders are killing me from throwing lots of hooks to the body.			"

								It's still in Early Access so expect a lack of polish and a few bugs, but it works. You have fists, you use them to block and to knock a mother#*&#$r out. Much like the old Wii boxing games, you get tired, and you will want to move your body unless you want to get your butt kicked so be prepared to sweat. Hope the Dev continues work on it, and adds stuff like jump rope, heavy bag, and what not - maybe some basic RPG mechanics (strength vs stamina or whatever) but it delivers what it claims for fair price.A good buy if you're into that sort of thing at full price, and for sure when it's on sale.

								Great game, lots of fun and very rewarding. You feel like a total boss when you finally knock someone out that you were originally struggling to beat. I think the realism factor also depends alot on how you play, i.e. squaring up and using proper technique instead of trying to find blind spots or glitches with the opponent's AI. The developer is adding content fairly frequently, and seems pretty responsive to the community. The game is also a great workout. Just a couple of things to be aware of:* You'll want a pretty large play area. The game is fairly dependant on mobility (steping, ducking, weaving). When you are backing onto the edge of your playspace, there is no warning system other than the VIVE chaperone.* Use the straps on your tracked controllers and tighten your headstrap. It is really easy to get immersed in the game and forget you're wearing $1400 (AUD) worth of headgear. More than a few times, a swift duck nearly caused the thing to fly right off my head.Despite that, I highly recommend this game. "

								Don't let the barebones visuals (or that this was a VR launch title) fool you, this game is FUN and the closest thing I've found so far that really captures the feeling of a fight as opposed to just wiping out Cannon Fodder in Wave Shooters.When I breathing hard muttering obscenities at the third fighter I knew I found something special. Also a stupidly simple and fun game to show to newbies.You'll want lots of play Space, and make sure nothing is in the way as you duck and dodge punches. As long as you play this game seriously (you know avoid getting hit) you will have a fairly intense experience.The only question now is do I log VR Boxing as Light Cardio in MyFitnessPal?			"

								I have a very positive opinion about this game. VR stands very well here. As this is still in beta I'll try a few suggestions here but as a reader keep in mind that the game is worth every cent. I do have a decent background with martial arts (but not with boxing). Btw rapid circular dodging with the headset is problematic (my headset fall down one time), no software solution here...So, my TODO list for Santa Claus :- I'd like to have a way to know my hit speed and frequency, maybe as a kind of training challenge against the ""trainer"" - As already discussed this is far too easy to reach the cap strength. I lost two matches by the Blue Bomber until I understood that trying to knockdown him by a strong punch in the jaw was counterproductive.  So I'd like to have higher cap and possibly some much higher punishment when over exposing (which is what I tend to do to land a good punch)- I'd like to be able to ""work"" a body zone. I mean when constantly hitting the same zone, some extra damage could be added.- It could be interesting for the opponents to have some different ""modes"" and/or pattern and having them trying to find which mode is a problem for you. I'm thinking about this because I saw a flaw in the blue bomber hand positions when he tries to advance and this now a fairly easy jab in his left eye each time he tries it.  Having different ""modes"" with an associated success of them would allow the computer to kinda ""learn"" from the player style.  "

								""It ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how you can get hit and keep moving forward.""This is a fun boxing in which the punches feel real. My only criticism is that the guarding doesn't always seem accurate, but maybe that's more my fault than that of the game.My fitness band informed me that I burned 500 calories in just short of an hour of playing this, which made sense given how much I was panting towards the end.

								Positive:Best workout game I've played so far. Really Immersive while playing. Kind of hard initially, you need to ""box"" to win.. if not you'll waste punches and get KO. The game is really responsive (at least on my PC), I don't notice input delay.Negative:The game is not finished, there's no ""modes"" to select. You do need to unlock the opponents by winning but once you unlock them you just pick them in any order. This game has huge potential.			"

								My new favorate game. Feels like sparing at the gym. Paying only 10 bucks feels like I stole it, If you added better sound, few characters for a career mode, multiplayer. I dont see why you couldnt get 25-30 all day long. I'd pay it! I know you heard it before about multiplayer dev, take your time. I know once  that gets here, you better buy some good servers to host. People will be chomping at the bit to box and talk smack to each other. I cant wait!			"

								So far ive only played this game for 20 minutes, but i am sweating balls. It really makes you crouch and punch and stuff. The blocking mechanic works for me most of the time, but when i hit the AI my hand goes through their block sometimes. Ive only got to the spider guy (which makes you feel like little mac when versing him), and most of the opponents are like regular difficulty where i went down a few times, but never had a chance of loseing. For now it seems like a pretty good game, but unless they add multiplayer i feel like there isnt going to be too much play time for it			"

								Need a little cardio in your life? Here it is!Though I suggest being careful... I'm banned from playing this until the kids are asleep and the wife is in bed, or at work as I came 2 inches from knocking her out... I really like the difficulty scale, something for everyone!EDIT: 2/15/17After several hours and a few updates since my initial review, this game has gotten SO MUCH BETTER. I don't think a better stress relief exist... The AI has gotten much more authentic, the damage system feels really good, and even if you fight the same guy over and over, it is never the same fight... I can't get burnt out on this game...			"

								Well...what can I say....Two weeks ago I downloaded AudioShield and thought to myself, damn this is a workout and a half. I like a challenge so threw to up to insane and only play on that level.Today I downloaded Thrill of the Fight, and well, AudioShield sux eggs in comparison to the workout you get with this.I know they are two different things, but if you are looking for a great VR game to get you moving and into shape fast, this is the one.There are several comments on here saying how easy it is and blah blah blah. Sure if you are a boxer already and in peak condition then perhaps this is just a bit of fun for you and a good way to get some practice in. For the rest of us who maybe have a few pounds sitting around the edges, get this game, you will not regret it.			"

								This game will save a lot of brains when it is finally finished. Why would you want to spar real people? No pain killers are needed after a bout of this. Also it really does give you a great workout. And boxing skills definitely give you an advantage. I couldn't beat that last opponent and remembered a little side step trick I was taught by my old coach and it worked perfectly. If multiplayer ever comes around it would be awesome to work towards fighting in championships. (If you can get there). One of the best games. I can't wait until there are more opponents. Imagine if this boxing engine was in a VR version of GTA.. The future is exciting and it’s coming soon. "

								This game is a little rough around the edges, but what it lakes in polish, the creator(s) have made up for in communication. The news section is frequently updated with excellent posts about what's changed.Also, they are absolutely listening to user reviews. Initially this game was meant to be more of an arcade style fighter, but after listening to feedback, things are headed in a more realistic direction which has made me exstatic.As far as gameplay goes, things feel pretty good. Slipping, blocking and punching are mostly natural, though sometimes a hit doesn't connect the way you'd expect.I'm recommending this more because the communication from the dev(s) and frequent updates make me optimistic about the game's future. If you like boxing and don't mind games that are rough around the edges, you're not likely to be dissapointed.			"

								Edit: So yeah I finally manage to play the game. That was a great workout. Had to follow the developer guy tricks below. I will play it again.Original post for history : Incapable of playing with oculus riftI always appear inside the floor, not able to jump on scale.Tried repositioning my sensors and stuffs, doesn't work.I think it's because the game start considering I have a 360 view and I have a 180.I see a menu where I seems to be able to change it, but can't reach it from arm length, since i'm inside the floor..So well, I can't play.Hopefully it will get better.

It looks like it is still being polished a bit but the boxing aspects of the game are already great and tons of fun. Felt like I was really in the ring fighting, and not punch-out fighting, actual boxing. Definitely the best vr boxing game out right now.			"

								Edit of an early access review: Most of the problems raised below have been addressed by updates, while this still has a bit to go its now worth spending time in, hopefully it continues improving.*******************************************The first thing I thought when I used the vive is ""this crying out for a boxing game"" There's going to be a boxing game for the vive that will conquer the world, the technology is perfect for it.  Unfortunately this aint it.The warning sign should probably have been when the only tip the tutorial gives you is to pull your hand back for more power, okkayy because that is'nt the cardinal sin of strikingThis may be an early release but the design decisons scream ""bad idea"" and the physics just are'nt there,  It feels like you're playing a vr game with the physics of frank brunos boxing for the zx spectrumYou find when the opponent covers up that the things that one would usually do, hook around the gloves, go to the body etc, just don't work, apparently that cover is a force field, same with the hit detection, when you stick a glove in the opponets face he often closes up a fraction later which blocks it, you spend most of your time trying to figure out what actually works in this version of reality rather than just getting down to itYes early access but, like they say, you can only fight what's in front of you and this is a bum.

								This is a great workout! Every time I play I need to take a break and catch my breath.It gets challenging quite fast, at least for me.Be sure to observe your room scale boundaries. You don't want to accidentally punch a wall.Also warn others in the home that you'll be boxing, so they don't walk in front of you at the wrong time. :)			"
