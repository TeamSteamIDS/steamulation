								Fishing Planet when it came out was good. Early access, full of glitches and bugs but delivered a fun fishing experience. Then a few months in they started to do choices that were taking a lot of the fun away. Then they recruited moderators left and right ""with years of experience""... from where? Guantanamo? If you made an issue public they tended to try talk it away with different excuses, and darn you if you didn't settle with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they served you. Forum ban. Haven't experienced it myself, but seen quite a few people being banned. Even Castaway_Dave, 1200+ hours in the game and probably one of the nicest guys in the game, have been banned for making a point of a huge glitch concerning weather patterns in Michigan and going into inventory and VOILA weather has changed.....!  They decided that better he goes then fixing the code.Enough said. Read the pros and cons  and decide forr yourself.Pros:- It's a fishing game- graphics... sadly list ends thereCons:- Never ending list of bugs and glitches- Staff, support staff and forum moderators are probably the most unsympathetic and unprofessional people you will ever experience in a ""mmo"" game out there. (Can be useful to experience as a reference for future games)- Forum moderators engage in discussions and tend to ban if they don't agree with you, or if you make the public aware of issues that they don't whant anyone to know about. (just a couple of examples)- Oh and if they read this post they will surely do their outmost to get it removed or otherwise respond to it in kind to these ""unfair"" charges.			"

								Got banned from the game for playing this game a lot... Yeah really.. I found a bug and told people about it and I got banned because it means less money in the pocket of killerwallet. Eitherway check it out its a good fun game and I would have kept playing it. I made a video of the bug that got me banned and I'd link it to show everyone but the dev filed a tastey copyright infringment notice on it so it's gone. The idea here is that if people don't know about the bug then you don't have to worry about fixing it. I'm guessing the devs hate me because I exposed the fishing mechanics that this game uses to spawn fish. Basicaly there are no fish in the water and one just spawns based on a dice roll from a few factors when your bobber lands. Moral of the story here is don't play buggy and broken games by money grubbing early access devopers who only care about making money and not about making a game that works.Edit: I reached out to support about my ban and video take down.Support (sent by *****@fishingplanet.com) Using game bugs as cheats and disclosure it on a public channel without sent to the developers is and act of cheating and disrespect to developer, In your home country it also a crime.You violate the EULA in a section of using bugs and cheats and not notify developers about it.Even more, after we move your thread to bug section you start a new thread with the same links, also send them to players in chats.This behavior is unacceptable. We suggest to remove the second video from your channel, or we will need to ask youtube to take down all FP videos from your channel because of EULA violations.Me:Not sure if you are trolling me again but:""Using game bugs as cheats and disclosure it on a public channel without sent to the developers is and act of cheating and disrespect to developer, In your home country it also a crime.""First the bug was never used as a cheat but merely a way to go under the river. Second the developers are disrespectful to their community. Also I did report this bug on the forums so, no.  And again WTF are you going to try and arrest and sue me under? The CFAA? GL.""You violate the EULA in a section of using bugs and cheats and not notify developers about it.Even more, after we move your thread to bug section you start a new thread with the same links, also send them to players in chats.""What is this contradicting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t? How can posting a bug on your forums be considered not telling the developers when you read and deleted the thread in minutes?""We suggest to remove the second video from your channel, or we will need to ask youtube to take down all FP videos from your channel because of EULA violations.""Go **** yourselves. Don't worry I deleted all that trash from my channel. I would hate to have anyone even think I supported a developer like you.Also run your emails through a proof reader. Those mistakes are unprofessional.Have a wonderful day.			"

								This game is aiming to be a fishing simulator, realistic fish habits, movement, etc. It's not too realistic that it takes away the fun of it being a game. It's very different from other fishing games I've played. I'd love to see what updates they add to make the game even better. It has a lot of kinks but I expected as much.Pros:- F2P- Not pay to win, you can only buy exp boost or extra credits (earned by just playing the game)- Lots of unique features from other fishing games- Not just a ""catch & reel"" game- Easy to learn after a while- Different fishing methods- Pretty graphics/animations- Other players are pretty helpful, especially when trying to learn a new area- All DLC content are just items obtainable in-gameCons:- Tutorial is bad, by bad I mean, confusing + teaches you almost nothing- Really heavily targeted at fishers right now- F1 (help/keybinds) is messy, they should probably color code it- By multiplayer it means it has a chatbox in-game (Hopefully they're adding other players or something like that)Overall still a great game, and one of the best fishing games I've played. If you have time, want to try something new, or enjoy fishing, give the game a shot.			"

								Freemium. P2W. Broken line mechanics. Shady DLC treatment. Community sacrificed for 3D models (for some reason). Bite rates decreased. Prices inflated. Mobile-game cooldown mechanics. $100 for one year of ""Premium"". $50 for unlimited license to one area (Alaska). Lack of direction, lack of communication, poor economy management that leads to consumer punishment. Do not make in-game purchases, as it is a waste until fixed.EDIT 01/22/2017: Communication was provided freely during closed beta to ""eQ"" a.k.a. Hegert, who relayed to me they are ""Public Relations"" for Fishing Planet while in my stream.  All issues still stand other than a minor improvement in line physics (most techniques still broken).  Would recommend said ""PR"" not being snarky to players simply because they disagree with current system - as we're quite capable of 'calculating'. Especially zero, which is remarkably the same amount of money I will be putting in from this moment forward.			"

								Could be a great game. I can NOT recommend in its current state.As it stands they keep nerfing the fish. Keep messing with the feel of the fight...At the moment it is nothing more than a ""Shoot fish in a barrel"" type game.There is no variation in fishing tactics, each fish can be caught by using 'X' bait at 'Y' spot.Also the forums are scrubbed of ANY type of criticism. Players get permanent forum bans for saying anything about the game in a negative way.My son's perma ban resulted from saying ""Ok you can go catch the same fish 1-2000 times in the same place with the same bait. Enjoy your awesome fishing Sim.""No warning or anything, so be careful what you say if you do try to speak in forums.			"

								I put just about a 100 hours into this game, life got complicated for me so I stepped away from it for a few months. Come back to find ridiculous pay to play schemes. When I was playing intensely I set myself the goal of buying unlimited licenses for all the areas using ingame cash from catching fish which was very grindy but totally possible to do, now its baitcoins or whatever they call it to get unlimited. It had a well balanced economy, now I look at prices and my mouth falls open. The durabilty and pay to repair items is ridiculous, in the real world I have fishing rods from my great grandfather that still work beautifully with out having to ""repair"" them after fishing for a day, so I see no practical gaming reason for this mechanic. Sure I snapped a rod once in the 25 years ive been fishing, ten minutes later with some bamboo splints and string I was back to fishing. Yes I should get a new tackle bag, the one that was given to me as a kid is pretty worn out, But I think it will last me another year or two.This was a great game once upon a time, a bit grindy a bit buggy but overall I was astounded at the promise it showed and laughed at other lesser fishing simulators. I bought some real money dlcs to support what I thought would be the greatest fishing game of the decade. Now? Nope, im too old to fall into this money trap. Perhaps one day it wont be like it is now and I sincerly hope so. Until then, farewell.			"

								This saddens me. As a real life fishing enthusiast, I was absolutely thrilled when I found this game on Steam about a year ago. It was fun, the leveling up to 20 or so wasn't too grindy (well it was, but not overbearingly), and all in all it was a relaxing game to play after a long day at work, or right after waking up and sitting down with your morning coffee. I even felt bad about such a decent game being ""free,"" so I purchased a few of the DLCs.I fell out of the game, for no other reason except for playing other games. I reinstalled the other day, and firstly found out most things have changed. For one, when I logged in, it told me I needed to repair my broken items. For the low, low price of $20,000. Yes. Twenty thousand dollars. I was in the process of saving money last time I'd played, and I didn't even have half that saved.Ok, I said, and moved on. Then I tried to go to a mid-level lake (Florida isn't technically a lake, I know) and saw it would cost nearly all my money to go there once. Screw it, I said, and went there. Peak fishing wasn't until late afternoon, so I skipped time. Well I misclicked, and instead of 4pm, I clicked 3pm. No biggie. I hit T to forward time again. There is a damned cooldown on waiting. But don't worry, if you buy Baitcoins, you can bypass the wait time! I then spent about an hour trying various baits that the game told me particular fish in that area loved without so much as a bite. When I did catch one, if I remember correctly, it was worth about $200. So, $8000 to go there for the day, and $200 per fish caught? Seems fair...That summed up where this game has gone, and it saddens me to say that I'll be uninstalling it and hoping a less money-hungry company makes a game where this one decided to abandon gameplay for cash grabs.PS: Don't worry, you can buy Baitcoins with your trusty Steam wallet and convert them to in-game cash, so as long as you're willing to spend $50 or so, (1 coin = $100, and $50 gets you 1090 coins, $10,000 to visit Alaska for one day) you can go to any lake in the game!

								EDIT: Pointing out the developer response to this review, located in the review comments below, was literally ""LOL"" then mocked my review because I hadn't played in a few weeks (you know, maybe because they ruined the game by the time I got back and there's no reason to log on anymore?). Here's another thumbs down to the kid they hired in their PR department giving childish responses to their customers reviews.TL;DR = Game was awesome, F2P, people paid because it was worth it. Now after the update, it's a freemium game complete with timers and cooldowns THAT THEY ADDED specifically to get you to pay to skip it. (That right there says enough, but by all means read the reviews and their own update log to see all the other fun crap that made half the playerbase leave since then, and you can go verify player pops to see yourself. I encourage it.)Was a good game until the new update. Update changed many core mechanics, got rid of DLC items people already paid for (they lost the items as they no longer exist in the game) and basically some of these changes, like the home lake change, got rid of things players spent WEEKS farming for. That's FARMING TIME, not while you are at work or school time.Game is much more ""give us money"" in every way now, and they ADDED annoying crap like timers and cooldowns (facebook games, anyone?) that you can, of course, pay for to skip or speed up.Basically this was a great game who people put money into because they liked and enjoyed it, and now it's some freemium crap with all sorts of gameplay additions to make it more difficult for you while not adding much to the game, but of course, you can just get out that wallet now.....Thankfully I type fast, and this only took 2-3 minutes of my time, but that is all the time I am willing to still put into this game, and just crapping on it more in this review seems redundant.

								The game is ok, but the people running it don't allow you to give help to others to find the best fish. They will ban you because of it and give any excuse other than the truth. They keep upsetting a lot of people with their attitude in the forums, short answers and lies too. Before the last update they promised more XP for Common fish and Trophy fish, but they lied and put the XP down on ALL fish types and upset the community. Now they're banning people and without warning, even though posting in the forums that people will get a warning first! I wouldn't trust them so far as to throw them. If i were you steer well clear of this. It isn't that good anyhow, well not anymore!Now this developer has the audacity to accuse me of abuse thrown at their developement team on my REVIEW!!! See people this is the sort of thing you have to put up with, a bunch of LIARS, nothing more, just plain liars. I did NOT give them abuse, I have witnesses to the fact, that was BEFORE they took DOWN MY POST IN THEIR FORUMS, to hide the truth no doubt!OH and another thing ALEX, you NEVER WARNED ME AT ALL (again you lied) you just BANNED ME WITHOUT WARNING YOU LIAR!!!!!!They DON'T like NEGATIVE feedback and try their damndest to get rid of it, they ban you if they don't like what you say, they accuse you of things that you didn't do and don't allow you to protest. Take this on board before you get into playing their simulator. HERE's PROOF;This is part of the evidence within their forum (the rest has been deleted by them);alex  [developer] 3 Sep @ 6:01pm Originally posted by spotme_2:You didn't warn me before you banned me! Why? And in particular the reason you gave wasn't sufficient. You should have a word blocker in place to prevent anbody being offended in the first place. I used a few bad words, but none were aimed at anybody within the lobby, yet you banned me hours later...All i've been doing is trying to do is help others so that they can enjoy your simulator, so basically doing you guys a favour in reality, and this is what I get? Really poor guys, really poor. And now you post this, saying you will always make warnings before banning...?Yes, we banned users without warning lately but from now we shall give a chance to correct the post prior to ban.Last edited by alex; 3 Sep @ 6:Now hide that truth ALEX the LIAR DEVELOPER!!!! YOU BANNED ME WITHOUT WARNING. That was out of order and you damn well know it, you lied on more than one occasion, and because I pointed this out you banned me from your damn forum, so don't tell more lies and accuse me on my review, that I gave abuse towards your team, because the evidence is there for ALL to see how you people are!FREEDOM OF SPEECH you liar!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!Footnote:-Well said Nordek. If they had simply warned me instead of a ban without warning, I would simply had stopped doing what they wanted me not to do, and I would have just carried on playing it. But they went too far (especially Alex) and gave me another ban without warning from their forums because I asked why the ban, and pointed out that they lied about the raising of the XP on Common & Trophy fish, basically I was seeking the real truth behind why they banned me.Furthermore he then slanted me on my very own review of their simulator with more lies, accusing me of abusing their staff, and basically saying that's the reason they banned me and also lied about warning me to be simply polite! I've been nothing but polite in every way possible, however he took something personal and turned into something rather pathetic to say the least and certainly over the top in banning me for what can only be seen as helping others with trying to catch Unique fish. Which by the way others do frequently day by day on their simulator. Which makes me wonder if they banned me for doing just that, are they then saying they are going to ban all that do that very thing, just because they don't like it...? Seems rather silly to ban people over something harmless as helping others enjoy their simulator, which in my opinion would simply help them to grow...But hey, what do I know?			"

This is a sign the mod does not care to give people second chances and let the commuity grow but to show off his power (in my opinion) and argue with commuity when people disagree with him as shown in the video when he refers to the commuity as Children.Honestly, it's fine for a mod to be a little ban heavy but when he repeatly agrues with people then bans people that don't agree with him it a little too much.

								DO NOT BUY DLC----------I really enjoyed this game before the update. The mechanics were great although it took ages to level up without dlc and premium. My biggest gripe is that I recently bought the Anniversary DLC that came with some great gear like the Fishfort Keepnet 660lb and lots of 6/0 spinners and lures. After the patch they nerfed this DLC (even though i had already paid for it and was using the items prior to the patch) so that the keepnet was replaced with a 440lb limit and the lures and spinners went from 6/0 hooks to 4/0 (this is just some of the nerfed items). They essentially took my money that i gladly paid for the dlc because of its great value and specific content, and stripped me of several benefits that it originally came with. This is unacceptable, a shady business practice to say the least, down right theft to say the worst. And this, folks, is how they treat paying customers. This is very unwise considering its a free to play game that relies on community support through dlc and premium purchases. Its fine to play for free, just dont trust them with your money. Right now this game holds a monopoly on the market for fishing games, but all that might change if a large developer brings out a paid game that does just as great a job without the freemium content this game relies on. In any case, my wallet is now closed to these developers. Heck of a way to celebrate their anniversary. This review will remain negative until they return the items they took from this DLC in their original glory.			"

								..... This is disgusting. I really enjoyed this game when it was first introduced. I'm sad to see it going in the direction that it is headed, as this was one of my favorite games. I like some of the new innovations and fish, but the game mechanics are becoming much too annoying. It seems as if you guys are now doing this for money and it also shows that you guys have no clue what you're doing. You are ruining this game. We were promised boats and other tackle a year ago. All I see with every update is new DLC and garbage game mechanics. This is despicable. Return the mechanics to their oldest form, and I promise you, there will be many more players that will enjoy this game daily, and possibly want to spend money on it, which is obviously what you guys want...

								I thought the game was fine before the update. Travel and gear costs were reasonable, if you didn't have the dlc it was still a joy to play because the bite/hook up ratio was fair enough to keep you busy. Premium was/is expensive, but if you played without it, it didn't really subtract any fun from the game (you'll just lvl a little slower). What this game had before the update was large sociable chat rooms, loyal players who would pay for dlc/premium to support game, it was enjoyable, and an outstanding community. Now there are pay to play blocks everywhere, the economic system in game has changed and made everything more expensive (I thought it was fine the way it was), only 5 people in a room together at a time now, hook up ratio is just low enough to make the game unenjoyable and mundain. I used to genuinely love to play this game but it is now at the bottom of the 'totem pole' for me. Sad to see a game with such potential ruined.			"

								6 Months ago this would have been a completely different review. The developers of this game originally stated that this game would always be a F2P with a premium option to speed leveling, etc. Gold (Baitcoins) would never be available to purchase and were a reward for catching Unique fish. Well, I took a couple months off of playing this game for life reasons, and I come back to find this game is now completely P2W. Gold is now a purchase item. Home lakes are apparently gone, so instead of being able to set your home state and return to your favorite lake cheaply, you have to pay exhorbitant prices to travel each time that you want to go. A license that I ground for hours to obtain, now costs about $20 real money to obtain. This developer has essentially lied to their community through and through. I would not recommend this game anymore. It's not even fun with all the nerfing they have put into the game. Really wish I had never spent money to support these lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by buying premium and DLC. If you don't mind burning massive ammounts of time on a P2W that you'll never get anywhere with, go for it. Otherwise stay away.			"

If you are a fisherman in real life, or if you have never fished in your life you would get enjoyment out of this game. This game is like crack and I can't get enough! There is so much potential with this early access game and from the way the devs are constantly updating facebook, they really care about the community. Community is another point I want to hit on. Everyone that ive ran into so far is willing to help the inexperienced and I love that! There are so many games now a days with bad communites that it can just ruin anyones time in a game.

								I really hate to post this review, as I greatly enjoyed the short time I had with this game. I came back afer not playing for about a month only to find prices in game jacked up to the point it simply isn't worth playing.I have seen many reviews commented on by the developers about how money needs to be put on the table, and that you can't expect it to be truly free to play without some sacrifice. I myself put food on my table by writing software, and take it from me, people that write software in this manner do not mean well. They think that you are a sucker, and if you continue to give money as they reduce functionality, then you are what they think you are and you deserve what you get.The only way to change the outcome is to uninstall. Without a decent player count, the money supply is cut off. They have two choices at that point: cut bait and move on to another cash grab, or restore gameplay to a decent state.I will gladly change this to a positive review if the devs come to their senses, but I doubt it will happen. Devs rarely change tact if they have a cash grab on their hands. Hard to change your spots once they have been seen.Oh well, it was fun while it lasted. You guys actually do have decent chops at making a solid fishing game. Shame you squandered it.			"

								I reviewed this title a while back, and while I didn't recommend it then I was too leniant on its cons as I really wanted the title to succeed, and I believed in the developers.It is also a good looking title, and feels good in many ways.I dont believe anymore, the developers are frustratingly similiar to politicians, they react to positive posts that are 'harmless' but completely ignore any serious questions, like ...- Why is the drag setting so limited ? 7 Settings only (0 - 6) ?- Why does heavier tackle struggle to cope with small fish ? A 0.7 kg smallmouth redlining a 9.1k line on a 10.5 kg reel on a heavy rod ? At half drag setting ?- What EXACTLY does the message 'Fish tried to bite and escaped'  ? Specualtion is , hook size is wrong but that doesnt make sense as the same hook can catch a 5.1 kg striper and a 0.9 kg smallmouth , so what fish is struggling to take that hook ?These questions could be easily answered and the whole debacle put away for good, but no answer.There is also the unrealistic mechanics in place, like...- Catching 'uniques' , you dont just fish away and have a 'whopper' take your bait... nope you check online videos or lists, or your own excel spreadsheets for 'proper timing and rigs' and fast forward time to the 'correct window' and for an in game hour or two you try catch 'uniques'. You cant be patiant as the time is ticking away, the window is small and the in game time is accellerated.- The game gives you charts that show when the fish activity is at its highest, but that doesnt include 'uniques' , outside that particular window they are close for business utterly.- The game has 2 types of in game stores to buy tackle and baits, the megastore that has everything but you cant use it when at a fishing location, you have to leave the location and then access the megastore, and the pay travel to return to your fishing location. There are store local to the fishing location but they make no sense, more often than not they will not stock the bait you need for that location (Wax Worms for Sunfish in Cali - not in the Cali shop).- Hope you dont like catfish or panfish, they aint worth a damn according to this game, nope you need to catch bass, pike and Salmon for any decent exp and rewards.- Physics are mess, the fish will be staring at the sky with thier tails facing the bottom yet pulling on your line while being dragged sideways while the fish is in a vertical posture. You will often need to drag fish through the ground, your rod will attempt to use ninja clone techniques while fishing (double rods) and your fisherman will often reveal that they are blue aliens when the skin colour 'washes' off.Defenders of the title will pull out the old Early Access defence, yet  the title has 4 current DLC packs and has had 2 event DLC packs, 6 DLC packs since August, yet the title has numerous mechanical faults which have been brought up pre-early access during its close beta period, and not addressed.Looks good, feels good but is not a very good simulator. the more time you invest the harder it gets to ignore the cracks but the developers seem to be staring at stars if you look at their 'roadmap' ... cars, boats, houses, worldwide locations, customisable avatars... they havent even got the basics down yet, nor even added features that should of been in place long ago like quests and tournaments.It is the better fishing sim, but in a rather limited race and with very poor competitors its hardly much of a endorsement. Try it out but dont expect much in terms of simulation... its a casual feels good looks good arcade game, with some bare minimal simulation.			"

								Edit on January 19th (original review done in response to the first update of the 0.7.0 beta):The devs are beginning to tweak some things and do bug fixes. This is a good sign. While I still have issues I listed below, I'm happy to see devs working on things like line physics, astronomical prices, gear balancing, and other bugs. Check out DIscussions for info.Edit Feb 20, 2017: Short summary of game status: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game economy is starting to feel like Cold War era dropping sad lonely rubles into a rusted coffee can to take down to buy my loaf of stale bread and 12 pieces of toilet paper every week in my holey fishing outfit I can't afford to repair. 0.7.0 Beta pre-release review (early Jan 2017): Cons: I really enjoyed the game but the game is now being updated and features special currency (""baitcoin""...) that effectively locks the good gear behind real money. The normal game currency is becoming severely devalued to the point where 10x increased cost is the new normal. This equates to a grind to catch all the fish you need to pay down the 10x travel costs, the 10x daily access fee, the 10x daily fishing license, then make 10x a profit after that to afford all the average gear upgrades so you can then pay the next 10x travel cost, 10x daily access fee and 10x license to go to a better location suitable to your level, so that you don't sink yourself into a cash and experience hole by staying in a low-level area. Yaaay.Avatars have been added to the game, but no way to disable them so you can't quietly fish without several others standing on top of you, nor are you able to do anything about someone using their avatar to block you. You have to move and hope they don't follow you, or leave the map and lose the enormous fees you paid to fish there. Because of the avatars, the room size has been shrunk down from 20 to 5, so the fun, social aspect of the game is currently, for me at least, not there anymore. The game mechanics for the rod, reel and tackle have changed in such a way that lures hit the water surface like a brick, lines are so fine they're difficult to control, setting the hook on a bite will jerk the fish out of the water and send it flying way overhead. There's also something called a pond pass which also costs real money. You can, of course, also buy baitcoin with real currency to have access to the associated perks in the game.Current players who have shelled out over the past year+ with time, money, purchase of DLC to support development of this early access game, are in the dark about what the plan is to convert their current bank, gear, purchased content, and time invested. There's been comments but no official announcement, and the release of the beta is supposedly now only a couple of days away. I'd have loved to shell out a monthly subscription fee for this game without all the b.o.l.l.o.c.k.s. they're adding in. Even the premiere level which you buy with real money costs additional real money for baitcoin.Pros: Looks like some of the graphics got a touch-up.			"

								I'll start this off with saying I do like the game despite its problems and slow update pattern. But as it stands with the long list of bugs/glitches and slow updates I cannot recommend the game as-is until a more realistic update schedule is put in place. However despite the game, that is not the problem nor is it the main concern I have about the future of the game... Its the forum moderator that is ultimately killing the community from the inside by deleting and even banning people for posting anything even remotely negative or critical. I'll tell you about my experience, and you can make up your own assumptions. This has been going on for a long time now and people have noticed how bad the power-trip of FlaGuitars has gotten over the last 6 months. There is even YouTube videos coming from reputable tubers about the community-horror censor-machine that is FlaGuitars.I have always been very out spoken in the forums and have called out FlaGuitars directly when he has spoken down to people, called them children (in a round-about sort of way), and even broken rules set out in the steam forums ToS by dishing out, what I found to be, offensive, derogitory and insulting replies to people who have called him on the deluded way he handles forums posts that do not adhere to his selfish, bullying attitude.The most recent case of this, some one, (rightly so) asked why his forum posts keep getting deleted after a few hours. Being a victim of this unprofessional practice FlaGuitars preaches in the post, I posted a reply detailing my experience with exactly the same issue as the OP. I named FlaGuitars (as he is the only moderator on the forums), and gave an accurate, detailed desciption of what happened to my previous posts n the subject. Less than an hour later I was banned from the forums permanently for 'Foul language and insulting a moderator.' Which is kind of ironic, as all I actually did was speak about FlaGuitars censorship in the forums. To think that FlaGuitars find his own acts 'insulting' is a joke in itself, considering the amount of people I have spoke to he has directly insulted and offended by talking to them as if they were children, (which is also against the steam ToS).So in a nutshell, if you are happy with being treated like a 2-year old with no intellect and can happily follow a dictatorship-based community, and play a game with a never ending list of bugs, then by all means download and have a go. I'm afraid that if FlaGuitars carrys on his ban-wave of destruction, then this community is going to be dead before the game even comes out of EA.Note : I am also of the firm belief that the devs are unaware of the enourmity of the problems this one guy is causing to their game they have worked hard on, and I dont think they are getting fair bug reports due to FlaGuitars removing them in such a manner.If a dev ever reads this, you really need to hire another fourm moderator with better people skills that can take critisim. Mark my words, he will destroy your community.Thanks for reading my review.~XPS : Details of my ban can be found here :http://s26.postimg.org/nn83un4gp/ban.pngEdit 1: I did not receive a warning, which is in the community rules set out by the development team (your superiors, yes there are people above you), I need to have received before a ban of any level is dished out. Way to break the rules once again, I am the proof.""The bans may last one day minimum. From now on we shall always make warnings before banning.""http://steamcommunity.com/app/380600/discussions/0/527274088388296207/Edit 2:Thanks to reviewer Rezeak for finding this :https://partner.steamgames.com/documentation/moderating_best_practices#Banning""Bans should only be issued when someone posts in violation of the Steam Community Rules And Guidelines. Bans should be temporary in order to serve as a reminder of the discussion rules. Permanent bans should not be issued in most cases.""Edit 3:More proof FlaGuitars deletes posts he makes that are personal attacks.http://s26.postimg.org/6v3y9jtqx/rev3.pngOh, the irony...Edit 4:Links with proof/experience of others :http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rezeak/recommended/380600http://steamcommunity.com/id/CactuszGaming/recommended/380600/http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054395134/recommended/380600https://s26.postimg.org/dfkz4hsux/mod_fourm1.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/9fLx8Nu.png

								The new update is designed to destroy equipment you grined together (or bought) so you spend more cash on new gear.Radically shifted to buy-to-win. Follow the changes but dont fish with anything you like to keep right now. It was ok with most players to make the game more challengeing (as it was easy, 3 fish sizes and ""hit the spot catches"") but that is not what this last update is about as things stand. I bought a couple of the DLCs, and tried permium for a bit to avoid grind but not spending a dime more until we see if these changes are permanent.			"

								This game WAS the best game on here for the several months I played it  before the ""big update"".   Well, folks, the devs have completely RUINED it with all the new criteria that must be met to play it.  Forget the pure pleasure of throwing a line in the water & see what happens.  I had a reel drop from 95% to broken on ONE fish. It must have been a nice one, but I'll never know.   I have been fishing for 55 YEARS, and I have NEVER broken a reel in my entire life.  Only one of MANY changes that have resulted in a BAD experience with this game as it is now.  I've lost several thousand in-game bucks since the new & improved version came out.  Can't afford to travel anymore, lose too much $.  No more big fish; even with modest drag settings, the line (or reel or pole) breaks because you can't retrieve the fish.  Still limited access to the trophy & unique fish because of very poorly placed paths & clear areas.  Wear & tear on the equipment?   Totally unrealisitc.  Of course if they make it wear out quickly, you have to but it more often.... but really?   I'm still using the rod & reel set my GrandDad got me for my 13th birthday.  Come on, for cryin' out loud !!  You made really HORRIBLE decisions concerning the game play here.   Admit it and fix it !!!!!			"

								It was a fun game but after the 0.7.0 patch it's gone down the drain. It seems now to be focused in player's real wallets instead of getting people to have fun and enjoy the game.The interface overhaul went into the wrong direction. Line physics are completly broken.What you paid with gold currency ingame had, most of them, the stats changed for worst.Just avoid it.			"

								I don't review games. I don't really think anyone cares what i have to say about them. But i can't hold my tongue on this one anymore.I used to really enjoy this one, in fact it was my go to game, until they ""rebalanced"" the game a couple of months ago. I could log on, kill a few hours, have fun chatting with folks and catching fish. Since the rebalance, it is nothing more than a grind game. And a slow one at that.Heres what I used to  like: The game worked. rod and line physics were reasonable, i could catch enough fish to make a few in game credits and didnt have to micromanage.All of that is broken now. the fishing line is like rubber. the rods are like slinkys. The fish don't bite enough to keep things entertaining. Costs are so high that i can't see how a new player would get anywhere. Heck I'm having trouble making the new economy work at level 38. And the social aspect is ruined as well. They added stupid 3D avatars that basically fill up every fishing spot and ditract from the experience. I can't turn them off, so I fish alone to keep from having <insert name here>'s arms and rod in my line of sight.The devs have claimed that they fixed some of the issues by lowering travel costs at certain places and tweaking the physics. I don't see any improvement.The way i see it, its a game. It should be entertaining, and this just isn't anymore. If i want to catch only six or eight fish a day, I'll wait for spring and walk down to my dock and do it in a couple hours.I would have recommended this game 4 months ago, now I just can't. If you want to fish, go to a real lake.			"

								Easily the best fishing game out there and not because there aren't many fishing games out there but because the game does a great job at immersion with beautiful visuals and audio and you can just relax. Of course by relaxing, I don't mean that the game is easy, if you want to go for small fish go ahead, that's easy, but if you want some nice largmouth bass you gotta work for it!DetailsThe game is full of small little awesome details. Like I only realized recently that there are actual fishes in the lake! I always thought that the game was random and it assigned a fish to your hook (based on location and bait etc...) when you caught one, but no that's not how it works! You can see them if the water is clear and shallow! They move around your bait, poke it, hit it and if you're convicing enough, they'll bite it!Learning curveFirst thing I'd like to mention is that, you don't need to have any actual fishing experiences in real life to be able to play and enjoy this game!The game can be hard at first, specially after you level up once or twice, all the new equipments that unlock can be overwhelming. There's a tutorial at the beginning of the game but it doesn't cover a lot of the stuff you'll need to catch bigger fish later in the game. So you'll have to look up tutorials and read item descriptions to figure out how to work with the new rod you just bought.Although there are some pop up tutorials here and there after you level up, catch a new fish or buy something new, I'm not sure exactly how they are triggered, but they give you some essentional info about for example how to catch a new type of fish.Fuzzy Logic, No RandomnessAlso there isn't an element of randomness to this game when it comes to catching fish, by that I mean that the game uses a fuzzy logic recognition system. What does that mean? It means that when you're trying to catch a fish by for example a retrieval method like Stop&Go (there are multiple retrieval methods in the game), your consistancy in luring the fish determines the quality of the fish. That's not randomness, that's as close as you can get to real life simulation! I love these devs!The DevelopersSpeaking of the devs, they are great and they know what they're doing. They are active and constantly fixing the game and notifying about the server's status etc...TL;DRIt's an awesome fishing game, with some suprising great little details. Try it, you won't regret it! No need for real life fishing experiences.8.5/10 "

								Well as a last resort I'm reviewing this game. I've been playing this game from within 30 days of launch. It has had it's ups and downs. About a year after release this game was pretty good. Great physics, decent amount of lures maps etc. Then the devs announced they were try to get the game picked up on a console. Suddenly the devs began to cram features and items in at an alarming pace, and began to refuse to fix known bugs and play issues. Suddenly the game physics got worse, and lag spikes abounded. Did anyone fix any of this? No but they did ad avatars, so that people you don't know can jump up and down in front of you while you're fishing... YAY!The current state of the game is unplayable, not to mention the times the economy has been ""tweaked"" where the only result is you have your hard earned money stolen. I don't recommend this game for anyone who wants to have fun fishing. If you like grinding games like cookie clicker then sure play it.			"

								Fishing Planet was a game with tons of Potential when it first released.The game has since initially grown in popularity and success, at first the dev'sdid some unique things, like tournaments where they actually ponied up and payed out real life cash for the winners.They released more content more places to fish, they brought out competitions etc.At first glance it seemed like a game heading in all the right directions.And then you started to see the true end goal.  To make money!  However, why should a gamemaking money be that big of a deal its sorta the purpose of a game is to make its developer's money!Well its how they have done it,  at every turn they make the economy more brutal.  They introduce wear and tear on your rods and reels, now they have even started to nerf DLC content, yes stuff people already spent money on is being rebalanced???  Why so they can sell a new replacement for it!!!  Your premium currency formerly Gold has been readjusted to baitcoins...  and they same things you could have purchased with you gold 10 times over you can now only afford once after the transition from gold to baitcoin.  Even the tournements are broken, 2 fishermen do not have equal odds to win, it depends on who has spent more money and has the better gear?!?  Fishing Planet is a game that had tons of potential that is now nothing more then a slow agonizing grind, you need to be an accountant with HR Block in order to navigate all the travel fee's and licensing fee's and then you have to have a plethera of time on your hands in order to catch enough fish to pay off all those fee's.....  There is no casual fishing as any fishing trip in the game demands a commitment of time just to break even.It possible things could change in the future, the game seems to change and update frequently, but most of the changes have been in the wrong dirrection.  And for that reason I cannot recommend this game and suggest you check out IceLakes instead....  while its only Ice Fishing its a fair more enjoyable experience!			"

								I love fishing, I live in FL and fish all the time.  I've been dying for a fishing game that's worth anything since sega dreamcast was around.   I want this title to do well, this game has all the right ideas, all the things I would want in a fishing game.   Since it is early access I won't harp on game mechanics and physics as I know they will improve.  My biggest problem with the game is its just not fun.  Let me explain, in Fl in real life I go to a lake I can catch many species using the same bait by adjusting I how I present it to the fish, where I'm from bass,bluegill,catfish,etc,etc will eat a nightcrawler.  It may not be optimal but it happens.  In this game its not like that at all, I find myself searching guides after frustration sets in.  You then find to catch this species you cast in this exact spot, during this time period, with exact leader setting at this amount, using this exact lure or bait and then grind for hours using that exact setup.  There isn't really any rng.  Once you get the xp needed to reach next lake you then go to guides find exact spot and grind for hours on the next fish.  To me thats not fun.If you don't like grinding you can spend 150$+ of real money to get the better lures, and xp boosts.   I probably don't play this game mostly because of the costly dlc that comes out that you need to buy if you don't want to play for 12 hours a day to compete with others.   The very first day this game came to steam I spent 20$ for a weekly boost of some sort and it does not go by game time it goes by real time so it forces you to play alot to make it feel its worth it purchase.   I would rather this game be 40$ and come with all content then claim to be free to play.   Its free to play to get you in the door then when you feel the grind you pay out the A##.			"

								Okay.This game is the most fun I've had in any fishing game so far. Seems like there is a fair bit of expansion to be had, and I'm thrilled everytime I have a bobber drop.Don't get me wrong. This is a bit of a waiting game, but fishing is about either finding fish or lucking up to hit that 10% of the water that fish reside in.Did I mention there are fish in this game, and you can CATCH them!?Great attention to detail as well. The black crappie I just caught looks like one I just caught last weekend.Edit as of 9/16/15This game is so relaxing I've started using it as a sleepaid at night. Its almost as peaceful as camping in real life, I just wish there was a volume mixer that was more than just music, and effects.			"

								""That's boring."" You're right, it isn't exciting, but you're missing the point. It's meant to be a relaxing diversion, and that it certainly is.The tutorials have recently been updated and have greatly improved the ability for new fishers to learn to play, too. I still recommend checking out some player-made guides and tutorials, but they're no longer vital.The thing that sets this fishing game apart in particular is how tactile the controls feel. The 'grind' isn't bad unless you want earlier unlimited access to new fishing regions, and the premium equipment doesn't appear to offer a real ""advantage"" over the common type. There isn't a competition or race. It's all fishing, and that's all I could ask for!While there could be many updates to be made in the future, it's pure shoreline fishing for the time being.Still Fish outta 10 Written at the time the game self-declared as Early Access, didn't leave Missouri ingame yet.

								Turned from a great, fair fishing simulator to a pay to play cashgrab.... R.I.PIf you are on the 2nd highest level, have enough gold and cash, they simply add 10 levels ( where 1 lvlup needs more xp than 20lvls did together), raise ingamemoney-prices about 5-6times and convert your gold into ""coins"" (1000gold = 100coins) while the gold/coin-price stays the same.... thanks, but NO THANKS!

..:: HONEST REVIEW - NO BS AND A** KISSING ::..NOTE: Since this game is in EA this review will change with time (or not if developer keeps breaking his own game).MyScore: 4+ Gameplay: 6+/10Graphic: 5/10Audio: 6/10Developer: 3/10Pros:- currently best fishing simulator on the market***- many fishing locations, fishes, baits, gear, etc.- sometimes can be fun,*** - best in genre doesn't mean good in general...CONS:- Since update 0.3.0 game is just unrealistic to the point where stuff breaks when it shouldn't or doesn't work like it should. Update brings a lot of nonsense to almost all parts of the game ultimately gimping gear, fishing mechanic and fish AI. - Update 0.3.7 doesn't fix anything (durability system is still broken/gimped, values for gear strength are messed up and so on...) and brings even more issues with bucket full of boring content. There is nothing more anticlimactic than small pond (which they call a lake haha) filled with pretty much same small fishes which are on starting location in this game.- Developer bans people for bringing up negatives about the game on the forum. They keep ignoring any negative opinions even when opinion is supported by loads of valid arguments and facts. Basically if you have negative opinion and you want to share it on the forum TO HELP THEM UNDESTAND WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE GAME YOU ARE VIEWED AS HATER. It doesn't matter how many facts and valid arguments is behind you .. you still are treated as hater whos ""supposedly"" attacking developer and they will remove you from forum. It's pretty much gaming version of ""Amy's Baking Company"" from Kitchen Nightmares.- Their Early Access statement is just one big pile of bs:""...our team is aiming to deliver the most realistic and fun sportfishing experience...""""...Our main priority is to ensure uncompromised realism of the fishing experience...""Update 0.3.0 is putting this statement to the grave.""we intend to use Early Access to polish everything out by fixing any bugs and introducing new features with the help of your feedback""They not only not polishing things they IGNORE feedback and push low quality/broken content while adding new DLC for 30-45 euro. Greed at it's finest....""...should take us approximately four months, with a full release planned for November 2015.""They claimed to have game polished in around 4 months... it's been 10 MONTHS and they not only didn't polished anything they also are nowhere near releasing this game. Game in current state is all over the place with bugs, gimped mechanics and psychics. Just mess... - Moderator deleting video evidence of game breaking bugs on the forum. Gives false excuses saying that my line broke becasue it was at 0% when in video clearly is on 94% and keeps talking about me not using ""pro"" meters which would show that my line is at low % which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t becasue its irrelevant what meter i use. The point is that small fish broke heavy line and it shouldn't happen so they want to hide it by deleting any evidence. Game is broken and it's reflected in 0.8kg fish breaking 3.6kg (and even 4.5kg) braided line like it's made of paper.Evidence:

			Fishing Planet - Update 0.3.7 In a Nutshell		

- Most of positive reviews is bogus and there are even threads on the forum calling people up to deal with negative comments. I guess they want to do everything to boost dying game.- Developer which doesn't understand how bad his development strategy is:FP lost most of initial player base and after 0.3.0 even more ppl just left.- Developer making fishing game doesn't understand how fishing gear and physics works.- Another developer abusing Early Access,- Only one server:Game server is located in NA so Europe and rest of the world is screwed by over 130ms ping causing game to lag,- Bad development decisions:They working on VR when almost no one can use it or can't afford it while delaying development of more important key components.- Quantity over Quality:They keep adding stuff without polishing audiovisial components and mechanics to setup solid base. They keep changing and messing up what was working fine.- Some sounds can get annoying to the point where you turn of sound or there are sound which shouldn't be there,- Recommended System Requirements are a joke:My specs are above it and on max settings i get avr. 25fps while facing water.- Outdated glitchy and average graphic: On low setting it looks like something from 2005. On full setting foliage still looks bad... only water and lilypads looks good but game cause PC to sweat like it's some freaking Witcher 3 or Crysis,Our ""avatar"" in the game is like some weird human shaped alien which glides above ground... Srly???!!! They could deal with it in a creative way... oh wait they aren't creative.- Graphic lag/Freezes/Client - Server lag: Basically everything from switching windows in UI, switching rods or people posting on chat cause performance issues sometimes to the point when you get 3-4 second freezes or you can't cast lure properly,- Complete lack of optimization:Game is so many moths in development not to mention 8 in early access and they still didn't optimize game,- Boredom caused by how easy to catch are biggest fishes:It ain't unique/trophy fish if you can catch 10+ of them in one IRL afternoon. Basically game spoils player with trophy and unique fishes being childishly easy to catch.- Grind:There is nothing funny in catching over 300 fishes all pretty much same size just to be able to move on to next level,- Boring  grind events:Basically grind based event where you spend few IRL days to get useless rewards,Lack of creativity is they key problem.- Irrational decision making:Basically they make decision which doesn't make sense e.g.  crankbait have damage indicator but soft plastic lure doesn't... rod is damaged while it's not even under load... and so on...- Rubbish, ridiculous and overpriced  DLC's with existing Pay to Win factor: Right now if you buy DLC you get mostly gear which is for free in the game + 3 rubbish skins for ONLY!! 45 euro... what a nonsense.Again lack of creativity is the key problem.FP developers: Good DLC is affordable by everyone even those who gain steam money by playing other games so 1.99 euro is perfect price which everyone can afford and support your game. On another hand balanced DLC have content which doesn't add pay to win factor and still brings something fun to the game, e.g. custom made crankbait's with regulated lip/weight or fishing rods with custom shaped handles and ""accessories"" on it + custom textures, etc. I do not recomend this game and play it only if you're desperate person. At first it can feel good and you can have a bit of fun but soon enough grind will kick in and all the bugs and glitches in the game combined with grind and boredom will simply make you angry to the point where you will uninstall. Only thing keeping this game alive is group of scrubs ready to spend 30 euro on DLC ;) My prediction: This game will end like Euro Fishing.			"

								I've recently started to play this game and it truly is a great game. That said, the latest patch that basically introduced pay to play is worse than a mobile phone paywall game. The leads on this game clearly have nothing in mind but cash and it's obvious, especially this early in development as they 'test' these paywalls. I'll update this if things change but : Great Game but will be basically locked behind a ton of your money.			"

								Total cash grab. Could have been a great game, fishing with friends online would have been awesome. You can't go two seconds without some sort of popup telling you to buy premium. Not only that but the fishing, although it has some accuracy, is for the most part arcade style and brainless. Put on the right bait and cast, and you catch the fish. Simple as that.			"

I have 9k available to spend (purchased with REAL cash) and ""don't have enough money"" to purchase things like grasshoppers.  It has taken me months and plenty of REAL money and I still can't reach the next level.  I have recommended this game to many people and now regret it.

								Was fishing somewhere, did not play for a few days, now I don't have any more credits and therefore can't play the game any longer. Forum says: contact support and ask them to reset your credits counter. Sadly I can't find a way to contact the support. Even their website only says ""Play the game"", yea, nice joke, but no chance to contact them.Until that crap isn't handled, I have to say: nope, can't recommend that.So if anyone can tell me what to do, that would be nice./EditSo people told me the developers are ""pretty responsive"" on Facebook. Ok, I just deleted my Facebook account because of reasons. I don't want to go back. I have this game on Steam, the developers need to have a contact support system, like a mail address, or contact on the Steam forums, which they don't. Nowhere in the game or here you can even find out who developed this game. Other people tell me that I am stupid and should log in every day for the bonus credits you get this way. Good idea, I only need somewhat above 2000 credits, so by this method I would need... months of logging in into a game I can not play, just because the developers don't have a support system so I can't tell them about this bug a lot of people have, according the forum threads.So please stop calling me stupid or giving this review a thumbs down or calling me troll. I do liked this game, it was pretty relaxing, but I can not play it anymore because of some very stupid bugs, which are bugs and not game related things that I did wrong. It's a bug when you don't play a game for weeks and the game tells you after coming back ""Well sorry, you now need 2000 credits to play this game, but if you tell anyone on Steam they will say you are a troll, and by the way you can't contact us. Maybe on Facebook, where you just deleted your self. Yea, life sucks""			"

								TLDR: Fishing planet is a very beautiful and relaxing game. You can play for free so ignore the stupid ""pay to play"" reviews  as its difficult but possible, just be warned, the devs are a group of greedy mot-er fu-kers, and its evident once you are inside the game. Try it for your self, just dont fall victim to their obvious ploys, spend wisely friends!A once  beautiful game, now rulled by the mighty $. Every thing that works the best, gear bait etc, all costs bait coins. You can get baitcoins for free, 1 a week (yes you heard me right, ONE a week), 10 for placing first in a catfish competition, and thats it. They removed getting baitcoins for unique fish, so forget that idea. You can play this game for free, it is free to play. But you will be fighting week to week just to be able to stay afloat monetarilly. They decrease how much money you make perfish, and increase the ammount you pay for every thing, and not in a small ammount, well over 100% increase from beta. You can not longer purchase Unlimited licenses for cash, only bait coins. They say they are going to increase ""fish productivity"" after nerfing that into the ground, but lets be realistic, the company showed their colors, and personally, I am sad I even bothered supporting these greedy fools in the first place (Yes I bought a few of the DLCs in order to show support for a game I once had hope for. Yes I will still play, but I will be damned if they ever see another cent from me.			"

								I used to love this game, paid for DLC and all that .. this new patch has killed it. the random rooms are empty , kinda ironic as you don't ge to enjoy the new 3d models lol.. but a more important thing to Note: If you buying DLC from them, they will and have in this last patch removed DLC content such as the iron maiden keeper from holloween dlc. I loved that item  lol.. but who cares how I feel about it.. I paid Real Cash for it and others they have removed from the game. I did not get ""baitcoin"" or what ever it's called for the items I paid real cash for after the patch, I did not get the 100 extra coins as a gift.  I've sat down and worked out the math to double check this. based on their patch notes and the exchange rate they gave.. i'm owed several hundred more ""premium"" cash for the stuff they took from me.  this should be illegal. the people in charge of this games are low, dirty thieving jerks.. I know they have to pay for the game dev some how.. but stealling from your Dieing player base of loyal fans via removing their Paid Content is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor excuse. Do not Trust this game or the people behind it.  side note, as a fishing game option, it is one of the better fish games out there.. but it's not worth the loss of real cash you might want to pay if you did like it.. and pay wall? holly crap.. i've never seen any casual fisherman ever pay several grand to drive to a lake to fish.. what the hell were you thinking.. even with todays gas prices lol.. wow..

								Fishing planet, Well where do i begin,some may say missouri... me i say from my childhood playing games by the likes of ""big ol bass"" and ""championship bass""to name a few, this is the kind of game i had been looking for, for years!Having read the ""roadmap"" for this game it sounds like it may fast become one of my favourite games of all time, now thats quite an achievment considering my gaming history.anyway, on to the game itself,in its current state its pretty darn playable considering its still in early acesswhen playing it draws on real life knowledge, like what habbitat does a perticular fish like, what food does it like, is it line wary or will it just have at anything going past ect.For me this firmly plants it in the Realm of actual Simulator, instead of those simulator wannabe games.Fighting a Fish: you actually have to fight it instead of just reeling in, lest you break your equipment or risk loosing the fish.The Tackle : Tackle variety is Decent in its current stat with many Baits,Rods,Reels,Line,Lures and much more(to unlock items you have to be the correct rank or higher (you dont have to pay for a thing to unlock it all))The World : the fishing planet world is based off of three main things currently; Level,Cash,Gold. You gain xp/levels for catching fish, the better the fish the better the xp, the same is said for cash which you use to purchase things like new tackle,bait,Licences and moving home to a new state should you wish. Gold is a kind of Special currency only aquired by catching really nice fish called ""unique's"" (you can also purchase gold using real money should you wish) you can use said gold to purchase special items, These Include : special baits, premium rods and reel's and better wearable equipment.MY experience in Fishing planet- having bought a couple of the DLC packs i thought ide have a look to see if anythings on sale considering its black friday, and i noticed there was so i decided to buy a 360 day premium pack, shortly after buying i noticed the pack hadnt apeared in my ingame inventory like normal when i purchased the DLC so i thought ide leave it a while since the servers had just come back up after some maintence, but still nothing, i thought it must have had somthing to do with the maintence that had just happend. so i decided to email surport and query what had happend. The staff responded Quickly, They are also really pleasant and profesional and after a few emails back and forth solved my problem. You can really tell These developers do Care about there players and about making there game better.I was pleasantly surprised by this considering the tarnish that some early acess games/Dev teams leave on players.Overall this is a really enjoyable game and i cant reccomend it enough to anyone who likes Fishing or even if you've never been fishing in real life but want to give it a try.Totaly worth the time and money ive spent on this game.

""The Best Damn Fishing Simulator Ever""	  Honestly I can't think of any fishing game I have ever played that was better.   First of all the game is absolutely beautiful, the environments are very natural and serene. The water dynamics like ripples and splashes in the water are amazing. Also there are many locations and over 34 types of fish with more of both to be added in the future.  The fishing is very realistic, sometimes you can almost subconsciously feel your mouse tremble as you see a nibble and set the hook. The fight of the fish is very satisfing especially with big ones, where battles can last over five minutes.  Fishing Planet is a very relaxing type of game that you can lose hours playing. It's one of those games that you don't have to be constantly at the keyboard. You can sit back and relax while playing or get up and walk around to strech your legs, go get a snack, yet your still in the game.  The game works on a level based system where you earn XP points by catching fish. As you increase yor XP, your level rises. Higher levels allow you access to better rods, reels, baits, lures and tackle in general. Higher levels also allow you access to the other locations where the fish get a lot bigger thus the need for better gear. The best kind of free to play model, you don't have to pay for anything. You can purchase three things with real money; in-game cash, a premium account which gives you increased xp for catching fish and DLC packs. None of these are required to play the game however. You have complete access to everything in the game for free, with the exeption of having to grind a little to earn the higher tier locations and equipment.  This game is in early-access which means it is basically an alpha. Which also means it is not completely finished and has aspects of gameplay not yet added like boats, free roaming and multi-player. These features will be added in the near future but the lack of them still does not undermine the playability of the game. Even without these features the game is still wonderful to play. It also has bugs and game mechanics that will be rebalanced as well. This is the nature of all early-access games. I played a few early-access games and this one is in much better shape than your average early-access game, try it for yourself.  In closing, Fishing Planet is completely free to play, is a small download about 2gigs and runs well on even lousy computers. Highly addictive and also very satisfying as well, what do you have to lose? Fishing Planet is an absolutely a must own game if you are any fan of fishing.  "

								The game is in ALPHA and yes there are tons of things wrong as far as bugs go but is is playable..After 60+ hrs in game I have to say it is a  SIM that has the normal grind for gear like all games do. With that said it is FREE TO PLAY (so why not play it?). IMO it's FTW=FREE TO WIN cause you can buy everything in the game with ingame cash that you get by playing!!!NO PAY TO WIN!! yeah sure you can get a prem account but that only gives a xp advantage.As for graphics is really polished and looks great! Sound gets abit dull and boring at times but its ok. So in the end is it worth playing yes for me anyways cause I am a fisherman and I know this is just a game and not real life..I give it a 10/10download it see what you think foryour self			"

								I am definitely going to follow the game, as I had a great experience with the fairly friendly community.. Also, it's indepth and reaslistic as most parts seem anyways, it could obviously use a few tweeks.. As in you can't do 360's and almost snap your line.. But uh, other than that, I could see this game going places.			"

								I put alot time and effect into this game, and waiting for some added content that was actually beneficial to the game it self. right now there are rods for casters that are still not able to be used to their potential due to lack of weight on lures or sinkers still not in the game. yet the devs just want to focus on esport aspect and not care if the game itself becomes more more horrible. you can easily reach end game in 1 week, level 21 is all you truely have to get up to before you realize just how crappy the game becomes.PROS:visuals 9/10 still has a glitch from time to time but nothing game breaking and reminds me of the 70'searly game  9/10 really fun for the first 18 levels but a little grindyCONS: devs focused on the wrong spots to develop the game properlytheir bug report is just crap, i once reports a bad bug and was told not to watch youtube, when i used youtube to post the video of the bugend game comes early and quickoverall was great when i first started player, now i get on for 10 seconds once a month just to see if they finally brought out the stuff that was coming out ""soon"" still ben atleast 3-4 monthes and none of that soon is here...But they still want to focus on the esports competition stuff while game is no where near where it needs to be			"

								Best fishing simulator/game I ever played.You can play for free no problem, it just takes you a bit longer to reach your goals.Whenever I'm in the mood for fishing, but weather is too bad, season is just wrong, or health prevents me from doing it IRL, I can just get on here. Add a great community to that, and I got all I need.Is it good? I think so. 343 hours logged and about to add more.Are you a person that needs something to happen every second in your life? Then this is probably not something for you.  This is a simulator, not a fish-reeling game.But if you want to relax, join us with a rod and reel by the shores, and perhaps come on teamspeak as well for a good chat, and if needed, some help.			"

								It was fun for a while, but it bacame obvious after a few hours that they have tuned thru a recent update to make progress very slow. Low level fish pay a currency based on size. Catching bigger fish pays more currency, but are gated by tackle. This tackle is gated by level. You must pay currency to travel to fishing locations, and for example 220$ to go to the first unlocked lake. It took several hours of irl gametime just to nearly recoup the travel cost. So be prepared for alot of time invested if you want to advance without paying real money. The task is repetitive, based alot on chance, and even your victories aren't really rewarding. All in all i think its tuned to far towards long grind. You'll grow bored before you get to the fun parts. Good luck.			"

								I am a level 10 newbie, that being said, I want to go to faraway places and catch unique fish and not drain my wallet to get 5 fish. I used to fish in Missouri for about 225 credits and I could come out the other end with at least an extra $70 from catching catfish. Now they decided to downgrade the price to $1800 (did I say downgrade, I meant jack up by %800). Now, in order to gain any money from Missouri, you would hve to catch about 100 pounds of young channel catfish if you wanted to come out the other end with any hope of gaining money. What a shame because this game showed some promise, and, I bet, if they had not inserted these P2P and P2W schemes, people would have bought more DLC's because they saw that this game was a well-crafted, fair fishing simulator that was made for the purpose a game should be made, for fun. Now, If they wanted the option to allow players to donate with special bonuses (premium accounts), then I could understand, and there is no shame in making a video game for people and gaining money from it, but when you pull a theHunter on me, you can't seriously believe anyone will enjoy your game. If I wanted to throw away my money, I would have just gone to a strip club. At least then I would get some fun in the end. Game devs, if I could go back 6 months, I'd like to see how many times you slammed your head into a brick wall to come up with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. the updates were for ""balance."" If I was on a tightrope I was your definition of ""balanced,"" I'd be♥♥♥♥♥up on the floor right now. All in all, I would have rated this gme a five out of five if they reverse all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they put in it.			"

								I'm hooked.All puns aside, I downloaded this thinking I'd delete it very quickly. However I started playing and that changed drastically. Not only is this in-depth (although I don't know much about fishing), but it's easily accessible and personally I find it very fun to play. It isn't an action packed game, but get the right techniques and you get rewarded for it. Reeling in big fish is an exciting struggle and you do actually feel good when you land it. It does have microtransactions, but if you play the game well, you aren't forced to use them, it encourages smart playing and research, which I find to be quite interesting. It won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's free; so download it and give it a try, you may be pleasantly surprised! I know I'm excited to play this tomorrow.			"

								This game was good 2 years ago. Now it's just a microtransaction hell (baitcoins). And it also stops you from playing at all (cooldown timer).How you fished 2 years ago:- Fast forward to peak ingame daytime,- Fill your fishnet in 30mins realtime,- Fast forward to the next ingame day.How you fish now:- Fast forward to peak ingame daytime,- Fill your fishnet in 30mins realtime,- WAIT 40MINS FOR THE COOLDOWN TIMER TO GET DOWN,- Fast forward to the next ingame day.You basically are forced to quit playing over a half hour, every hour. Or, you can spend some baitcoins (realmoney) to get the cooldown timer removed for that one fast-forward click.Ridiculous ! "

								So I played this game for probably more hours in a couple of months than a couple of games I have owned for a year or two and I can tell you that alot of this time was fun. Until you get to the grind. If you are looking for a fishing simulator I would honestly wait for maybe a year and see where this game is in that time. Fishing isnt about catching and I dont believe the devs and many people actually realise this, its about the thrill of catching the fish, the fight and the thought that you have the chance to not catch anything or catch a fish that you can put in your personal records or the local newspaper. I am level 17 in this game right now and have caught hundreds of fish, If I was on a trawler boat sure I would accept that number but once you are grinding from what I have gathered 313 fish to get 25000 xp for level 18 to get to a new lake and actually catch some decent fish is rediculous, the process of getting this 25000 xp is pretty grueling requiring you to constantly fish the same old bass in the same old spot at the same old time with the same old lure with no real skill involved (promised dynamic fishing system not implemented). So the only way to get this XP is through ""Farming"" call it what you want this is not fishing its catching, when it gets to the point you are catching a fish every cast every day on the same lure it is catching, after a while this is no longer fun. When discussing this I have had the typical ""well go fish somewhere else"" ""stop calling it farming and you will eventually stop thinking it is a grind"". I am sorry but since I spent nearly a month in each of these spots ""farming"" it is boring and also ineficient as the lower level places give you less XP as you expect. Sure its a fishing game but not a simulation game like advertised which is sad to me. I thought the game would be fun and exciting after the new fish fights, It didnt. The only I see to really fix this game is to remove this XP system completely let people fish again, let them have fun, not every game needs to be about one upping people of stats, let people fish a spot and try to catch the biggest fish to drive a competition, lower the frequency of catches and the game becomes a fishing SIM the way it should be. Keep the money system and add more premium currencey tackle for revenue but please for the love of god dont turn this in to what everyone is comparing to a fishing MMO where it is no longer fishing. Even a license system like the hunter would do me but everyone knows that that would never work because funding a f2p game is a bad thing as as soon as money becomes involved it is p2p (Sarcasm)...

								Loved this game when I first started playing - great graphics, great physics, great ""Feel"" to it - you really do feel like youj're out there on the shore casting and reeling in, and when you get a strike you feel the battle with the fish. But...Then in the course of a day or two something changed. Where before I was pulling in a decent number of good-sized bass with my spinning rod and jigs, suddenly I go hours without a single bite. I went an entire 2 days of a rather expensive fishing trip not getting a nibble, on a lake that had always been super productive the day before, and yes I was fishing with the right bait, rod, reel, hook, and at the right time of day. I went from 3 dozen trophy bass in a few days to no fish at ALL.  Needless to say, it was obvious they had made a change to the game that decreased the number of strikes bigtime. To make the game more ""Realistic?"" Maybe. After all, who can really go to a lake and catch 20 23 lb bass in 4 hours? But you know what I have to say to that? If I want super-realism, I can get in my car and drive to my local lake and stand around for half the day casting and reeling and not catch a single fish. The reason I want a fishing GAME is so I can escape to a fantasy world where I can catch a lot of fish, unlike in real life where I basically suck at it! And no I'm not saying the game should be some easy joke where anyone can just grab a pole and catch a ton of trophy fish, no skills required. But for those of us who took the time to learn the right equipment to use, the right baits that work with the right kinds of fish, the right times of day, and the right techniques to use to catch each fish (stop and go, slow and straight, lift and drop, etc.) - we should be rewarded with good catches! And yes, plenty of them!Not sure if this is a temporary setback, or not, but time will tell. I can say that if the game mechanics have now been changed to the point where I have to sit around for hours at my monitor not catching a damn thing - just like in real life - then I probably won't play Fishing Planet any longer. Plenty of other games I can escape into for a few hours to get away from reality that provide the rewards I'm looking for in a game.			"

								****Update**** Ok really can't tell people to play this game when they make a game where you have to get licenses and obey the law and then when they come to Florida in real life they can't do the same including breaking federal law buy catching and keeping a  protected species. But the worse is the spin control of erasing my posts and others calling them out on it. No bans just poof posts gone. They should own up to it, apologize and move on. They did the fishing ,they posted the pics of them and fish. They need to own up to it. 


Announcement: Fishing Planet iCast Odyssey (teaser included) 
Fishing Planet, Aug 5, 2016

			Hello fellow anglers! As promised it is time for us to tell the story of our journey to the iCast 2016 show and how we explored the fishing America.		


I would not recondmend this game. The game has some redeeming qualities but since I am not endorsing this game I won't mention those few items.1) Yes it is free to play, at certain levels though it is pay to win because if you want in a tourny you have to be lvl 17+ in order to have access to tackle that will catch the target fish or a fish keeper big enough that will let you be competitive, So until your high enough level to get those items it is pay to win IF your interested in tourny's.2) Fish mechanics are horrible. Everything from how a fish strikes to the mechanics of the catch are pretty bad. When the game started there was a huge cheat inbedded in the mechanic that allowed for almost instant catches, ever since then they have been trying to ""fix"" it but it has never really gotten there, they should have scrapped the whole thing and started over.3) Super grindy (understandable to a point) but the game squeezes you into certain lakes ao it basically spend all your time for a big group of levels at one lake then when old enough move on to another....The worse thing is they DO NOT tell you any info but you not being old enough for a lake equipment wise. I lost over 6 hrs of play (making money) only to pay the extra to ""move"" to a new lake and find out that I couldn't catch anything worth while because I was not old enough to buy the ""magical"" bait that only the fish in this lake will strike lol..4) Going back to the mechanics...the fish are all caught in ""spots""  Yep, spots, no wandering fish no moving targets and although fish in RL are often caught in ""spots"" only when those spots are active ( ie that special cove you are lucky at alot is because the wind blows often into the cove, increasing the food chain and the fish will move into the cove following the increased food chain, when wind doesn't blow into cove, no fish in cove) So it would have been far more realistic to have either multiple spots that change because of weather except there is no real changing of the weather( you have 2 weathers rain and no rain) OR just have fish wander all over and not have any stupid spots since they couldn't realistically simulate the other aspects of fishing like weather and water conditions.5) Now to squeeze out more money they have an equipment damage, destroy and repair system. Which is horribly stupid. I have been fishing with the same 3 reels and 3 rods for 25+ years ( I am in my 40's) I understand they need to get paid this is thier job BUT... Picture this... you pay 250 in game currency to do a few days of fishing somewhere. You forgot to repair your pole or lets say you want to goto new york and fish pike which will eat your pole alive. It is possible to end up destroying your pole before your trip is done, wasting all kinds of money. Now yea it would be the stupid players fault for not paying attention but moments like that should never happen in a game....NEVER...and no it did not happen to me but was the first thing I thought of when I played with the damage system for the first time.6) The game is full of ""non-explanatory"" moments. No in game pop ups or stuff to help keep a player from making mistakes like going to a fishing hole too early in level or joining a tourny that your too young to have the ""tools"" to compete. You WILL eventually waste money on something and have a ""wtf, nice of you to tell me"" moment. How uch time/money wasted will be different but sooner or later you WILL make a mistake somewhere, even if it is buying a lure that won't fit a pole...(yes only certain lures on certain poles)7) Which then brings me tooo...certain poles/reels ect.... This is a major say whaaaaat moment. For starters you can only bobber fish from a ""special"" pole which makes me giggle becuase NO ONE uses these poles in RL. They are alot like the old style bamboo poles as kids we would use in that they are really really long. But these things have reels. Basically the whole idea that I cannot take 2 poles (one 6 1/2 foot spinning set up and one 7 1/2 foot casting set up and fish with that everything and use every type of lure/bobber ect is just re-tarded. Other than special things like here in Oregon fishing pike or salmon you need steel leaders, salmon you need a very stout pole (think deep sea size pole). But other than a few specialty fish you can fish for over 30 ""game"" fish in this country using the same two poles I mentioned above.I still play every once in awhile to scratch an itch but casting in the same spot 150 times in a two hour period is just not fun. Not using my brain to figure out where the fish might be, is not that much fun. So when I do play its usually about 15-30 mintes because after that I want to hang myself with some spider wire.What they could have done to make it better:Real fish movements based on weather,time,moon phase.Real fish actions after hooking.( not enough variety)Total openess in fishing tackle I can buy and what set-ups I can use.NO DAMAGE SYSTEMNO magical fish spots.Find another way to make money other than breakage ect. Tourny's for ALL players broken down by level brackets with fish that CAN be caught by lures ANY player can buy not just DLC items like tourny's are now unless your old enough.Sorry but I really hate the whole pay to play feeling hiding behind a mask of well ""if you level long enough you can play in those tourny's for free without the DLC"".....You shouldn't let a player join if they can't fish it and be competitive against others.....

								Ok so this is my first Steam game review. This game is so good I am spending part of my Fishing Planet time to write this. I love everything about this game except one thing, which i will get to. First the pros:  1. The amount of details the developers put into this game is unreal. Every fish species has its habitat you have to fish for it in just as in real life and the habitats are true to life. Even the action of the lure you are using is a big factor just like real life. Same with the bait. Just like fishing in real life combine all those factors and execute your cast and retreival properly and you may have a chance at the fish your hoping for. Odd are though, that it will be just another Bluegill.2. For an early access game, in my experience this has the least amount of bugs, personally I haven't experienced any.That being said I have heard in game that others have been experiencing visual glitches. As for game mechanics, i have heard nothing. 3. The graphics are quite decent and doesn't bog my graphics card down much, if at all, and im running max settings on an old NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460. The water looks good, pretty realisic. The only thing i would say is add a little more such as the occasional fish jump and more to the fishing gear section such as sunglasses. So if your wearing polarized shades you can see past the glare and be able to see the fish underwater. I know that would be a lot to add but it would just improve the overal appeal of the game and add to the realism of the fishing in this game.The only con is the license system. Now i know this game revolves around realism but come on, the only thing worse than buying a license to fish in real life is buying one in a game. Every. Time. You. Go. On. A. Fishing. Trip. Unless you wanna spend an absurd amount of in game money for several months worth of fishing. Here's the thing, I live in Upstate New York, The We'll Charge You For Everything Except Taking A Shi%, Oh Wait We Charge For That Too State. and i only have to buy one once a year. And only for a measly 20 bucks at WalMart. I am just glad they don't make you pay real life money for in game licenses, or else i wouldn't play. But catching fish doesnt earn that much money especially when fishing trips in game are ridiculously expensive coupled with expensive fishing licenses. But if i wanted to not be able to afford to go on a fishing trip i would just shut off my computer and sit at my desk and not go on a fishing trip. Lower the prices of travel and licenses, but if you want to keep the prices so expensive have the fish earn more money seeing as that is your only source of income.Other than that i love this game and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I know some random guy's rating doesnt matter much but ill give it a 9/10, and if the income and/or prices change for the better ill change it to 10/10.			"

								Well, I played this game for almost 100 hours then it got very boring and i had to farm to level up. Then the new update with the new AI, fight mechanics and of course the new strenght meter came. It got waaay worse than it was before and i stopped playing. I came back to see what happened and yet every single fish escaped for low line tension (even if it wasn't low) and i had to fight a 1 kg trout for like 15-20 minutes. It was the best fishing game and the devs ruined it with the new updates and I'm sad because i really liked this game. :(			"

A perfect game for relaxingLast time i played a fishing game it was on a PlayStation console. Since then i couldn't find any fishing game which would be interesting and fun. Fishing planet combines simulation with arcade and the result is pretty good. The game is realistic enough to keep you playing, try different baits and lures, time of day etc. and it's arcady enough to be fun for casual players.Gameplay is pretty basic, you choose the lake or river, pay the money for transportation, buy the licence and go fishing. The are countless baits and lures, rods and reels. You choose the correct ones, cast the rod and wait. If your equipment is low level it can break very fast, but if you use it correctly it wears pretty slow. You can buy equipment to store more things (you can take limited amount of things to the lake with you).What i don't like is the licence system. I'll try to explain. There is in-game time, you arrive at the lake in early morning and time slowly ticks while you're fishing. You also must buy a licence with in-game money, but licence are valid only for the time you purchase it(1 day, 3 days etc. You can buy unlimited licence but it cost crazy amount of money) so if you purchase a licence for 1 day it is valid for 1 day in real time while game clock stops when you quit the game. I think this is not fair. People after work don't have much time to play, they purchase the licence and play maybe for an hour in the evening and the next day the licence expires. I think licence should be tied to in-game clock and licence time should freeze same as in-game clock when you quit. If developers want money they should make and sell new lakes as DLC instead of items or boosters.This game is free with in-game purchases for real money, so i guess this is the reason. Developers want people to buy licenses for real money. Anyway you still can fully enjoy the game without spending real money. Leveling is very slow but it wouldn't be fun to level up fast in my opinion. If you're short on money you get some each time you launch a game and there's free lake where you can farm money and exp.The graphics are acceptable, it could use some work. There are maybe 10 or so maps which are very small so it shouldn't be too difficult for developers to make them look better, after all you stare at the same environment for hours so it would be nice if it looked better. game runs steady 60fps all the time. Water on the other hand looks amazing and realistic. Well you kinda expect that from such game anyway.Developers made a good work on the sound department. Sounds really add immersion and make you feel closer to the nature.All in all the game is really fun, a perfect game if you want to relax and listen to the sounds of nature. Try it, it's free :)Pros:Great performanceYou will not get bored after 5 hoursGreat variety of fishConsIn-game purchasesLicence system			"

								Was addicted to this game, racked up 209 hours of game play in a little under 2 months. They increased the cost of everything, unfairly converted your gold (200 gold = 20 baitcoin now, wtf? ) increased the cost of licenses by 10x, just plain ruined the game.Fish and lure behavior completely ridiculous now, gotta pay to ff time... On and on. Do something better with your time then spending it on this ripoff.UPDATE:Had to add this. From the early access section on the store page.Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?“The game will stay Free to Play but the starter-packs and in-game purchases WILL COST LESS IN EARLY ACCESS, in comparison to the final full-version retail prices.”How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?“We will have an intense and fruitful Forum interaction between the development team and the Community as well as weekly Twitch Q&A sessions that help us gather ideas, feedback, and any possible bug issues.We perceive the Fishing Planets Early Access community as one big family that is helping us shape the game’s evolution and prioritize the development process by giving their votes in support of certain features and ideas.

								This game showed a lot of promise when I first tried it out.  I opted to set it aside and wait for it to be completed.  That was quite a while ago and it hasn't made much progress since.  Now it looks as if it is going to be pay to win with microtransactions and I absolutely will not support a movement that is ruining gaming for consumers.  Make a good game worth paying for and I will gladly pay what it is worth.  But if I'm going to spend my money on fishing gear, it's not going to be virtual.   "

								Not played a huge amount but first impressions are good, I've played fishing sims since I was a kid and this is the first one I've seen in years that has my interest.It's free so theres absolutely no reason not to give it a try - the true test will be to see if they keep updating the game as time goes on but I imagine alot of that will depend on how many people keep playing, for now it's well worth playing. :)			"

								One of the best fishing simulators I have played in a long time. Many modern aspects of fishing such as the licenses, locations, and all the stuff you can buy in the shop are amazing. The variety of both fish and shop items makes this game actually fun to play. It requires a little patience but not so much that your waiting 10 minutes for your bobber to move. Developers definitely listen to the community and have added so much such as competitions and new items in the shop.			"

								5/23/2016Still hold out hope they can get things back on track but with each update it seems less and less likely. Before update 0.3.0 back in March this was without a doubt my favorite game and I played it any time I had a bit of free time to do so. After the update though the new fishing mechanics were/still are so unrealistic it’s more frustrating than it is fun. You’ll literally fight a fish for hours in game and hope that after all that work that this 5lb fish doesn’t completely spool your 30lb line in the end like it’s a shark or whale. I’d hoped they would fix this and kind of bring down to the level at which it was before the patch but so far we’ve still got these fish that are obviously on steroids. Never in my life have I broke a rod or reel. While they have slightly fixed this issue they still break way too easy in the game, I think we may be using glass rods and reels. They also made all gear wear out so now you need to repair everything pretty much constantly, which eats a good chunk of the profit you earn.  The only logic I see here is they wanted people to have to purchase more in game currency as before you could play the game 100% free (buying a membership grants you 50% increased experience so I always had a membership for the boost and to help support the game) with no issues. You still can but the less experienced/new players really seem to struggle now.Two good things that came in the patch were the gear matching (however the way it’s setup means that having max rod slots is all but mandatory to avoid constant gear swapping) and they fixed the right mouse button spam that plagued the game. To be completely honest I wish they would have just fixed the right mouse button spamming and left the reset of the fishing mechanics alone as they were fine. In the end it’s probably still the best fishing game out there however the player base has really dropped off in a short amount of time. I’ll keep hoping they bring the game back to its former glory but as for now I’ve all but completely stopped and I wont recommend the game in it's current state as the fun factor just isn't there anymore like it was before the big update.**Updated 1/4/2017**Stopped back to see if any progress had been made to fix the game and came across the Beta notes. Seems the Devs have decided to make some changes to things that may have helped the game. Instead of removing the level caps to lakes they've increased the level cap while also limiting what you can get XP for (no longer for achievements). They are getting rid of Gold finally AND replacing it with BaitCoins, which appears to be the same thing only harder to get without spending real money, imagine that!! Permanent licenses will be gated behind BaitCoins, ggwp Devs. Forwarding time will also be gated behind BaitCoins... Basically everything that was good about this game has now been changed or is behind a paywall. Good lord this game used to be so good, it makes me sick to see what the cash hungry morons have done to it.			"

								If you want to be able to post any comments about the game that might be negative based upon over 700 hours of playtime.. I would not recommend it... I was banned from the forums for making comments that are not nearly as negative as others in this game.  The reason given was that .. ""my opinions do matter"".. even though i claim they do not.. WEll if they do matter... then i would not be banned.. But I am.  Of course, as one player said... we should be happy to be able to speak at all.. bc in some places people are punished for this.. especially Women.... well i can understand now.  It is very sad that as a player that has purchased almost every possible DLC, in further support of development of the game.. of a development team that has grown by money paid by people such as me, from 5 to 20 members, would ban a player for making comments negative.  I have played more than 700 hours in this game... and i can't comment about anything.  The game could be great, if they actually allowed people who have played to make comments, if they actually decided also to update the community in steam about progress... where the game is based.  However, they don't update you in steam either.. none of this development team believes it is important to update the community in the forums of steam.  Instead you have to go to a radio show on twitch if you want to find out any information one that lasts hours.. or, also, if you would like to participate in the beta of this early access game.  This is very sad given that it is dedicated players like myself who would like to see this game succeed... They should think about how they treat customers.  They allow moderators... not even in development, to close threads of discussions as they see fit, and to ban permanently members who have been loyal customers.  It is hard to say i do not recommend this game but my feelings about these issues seems every day more to cloud my opinion...I still love to fish.. and it can be a very nice fishing simulator.. too bad the team making this game does not think more of their customers.

								Hate to write this because it was my favorite game ever, but I played this game everyday for about 3 months, I even bought 2 dlcs. I quit playing for a couple of months, came back and they have just made it too hard to play without it draining your money, they have jacked up the prices to travel, prices for liscence, bait, tackle, and now even charge for things that they didn't before. I didn't mind spending money on dlcs and a premium account before, but forget it now. Its a shame because this was an excellent game, I hope they figure out that they messed up and correct this, but sadly I doubt they will. It all boils down to GREED.			"

								The best fishing sim I've played. Not perfect, but absolutely better than the competition.Pros:Immensely diverse range of tackle, gear and baits. This is kind of a double edged sword as the depth of options makes for a steep learning curve; selecting the right gear for the right species is problematic, especially for starting  players. One needs only to take note of the subject matter within the in game chat channel--this almost invariably consists of players asking 'which hook/leader length/area do I need to catch X fish'. That said, I don't think the brevity of tackle options should be considered a negative. This balanced a little bit by the number of guides and info videos available online--most of what you need to learn can be gathered pretty handily outside of the game.There is a wide vvariety of fish to taget and while most do share similar rig preferences, there's still enough nuance required in order to land trophy and unique specimens which makes for good challenges.Calender events serve as a way for players to catch fantasy fish which are worth fair amounts of in-game currency, which can be used to purchase the best gear and baits. Nothing is locked behind a paywall, although special offers do come along seasonally which gives people the option to purchase extremely high end gear at lower levels--in this sense, the game is technically pay to win. Fighting fish is a fun, and unlike Euro Fishing, the physics which govern these are intuitive and intelligible;  striking, reeling and lure retrieval mechanics are all well concieved  and work consistently, and solidly. The graphics are pretty good for an in dev game, ambient noise is realistic, and the locales are pretty enough to look at.Cons:Perhaps ironically, Fishing Planet is possibly too realistic. Missed strikes, incorrect rig, lure and bait choices can result in lots of time spent winding or watching a float bob for no result. It pays to do your  research before heading out. It is also quite grindy; levelling is slow especially in the teens, and this is exacerbated by the fact that gear access is level restricted. In order to catch fish which yield worthwhile cash and experience  relative to your level, you often find yourself needing gear you can't access. The result is that you wind up grinding out fish which are no challenge to catch, and yield little rewards and experience.It's a bit off kilter and hopefully the devs correct this in the future as this is probably the biggest, and most monotonous flaw in the game.As far as I can tell, unique and trophy fish seem to drop at inconsistent rates depending on the species. Trophy catfish in the starting area are common, yet you can expect to reel in dozens of bass before landing a trophy specimen. Post patch, alligator gar have become impossibly rare, whereas unique redear sunfish are caught hand over fist. It's a broekn system which requires an overhaul.Overall, and  considering that Fishing Planet is pre-release, it's definitely well worth playing. The foundations for something great are all there, It just needs some refinement. And there's enough to keep you interested in the interim.Score: 6/10			"

								While improvements has been made to fix the broken massive-update, which broke the physics and made extreme slow-downs, I still can't recommend it. It is not relaxing and exciting to actually fight on to catch enough fish to pay for the licenses and fees and continuously fixing the degrading euipment. It's not fun, especially that they now further nerfed the biting ratio of the fish and it seems like the peak times are short  and the fish stops biting abruptly, right after peak time is over. People need to rely on youtube videos to go to a new place and immediately start fishing exactly as the youtube video instructs them, because they are afraid that they gonna run out of money if they don't cacth the necessary amount of fish to keep them playing. This isn't fun, but a crazy grind and every single fishing lake is reduced to a 4m^2 spot, where everyone fishes at a given hour to catch a few trophies and uniques. Nobody cares about the rest of the lakes and rivers, nobody cares about the bush and trees. Your game is basically a few tiny spots to fish for the fish now , that gives the most xp and money, nobody cares about the rest of the fish and nobody really cares about what other lures baits out there, beside the most effective ones.  90% of the lures and fishing gear is irrelevant. 90% of the fishing spots are irrelevant and uneccessary90% of a game-fishing day is irrrelevant and unnecessary.90% of the fish are irrelevant. After a while everyone figures this out and the game is reduced to about 5 fish worth to catch with about 5 different lures and baits and that's it. Befor you judge others or me, I have paid over $30.00 in DLCs, that's pretty much the full price of a finished game, and this game is still early release. Fishing is suppposed to be fun, not a struggle.  Unless the developers aiming to make a survival game and the players have to depend on their wallets to survive.  It's a quick way to become unpopular, if you ask me. This review gets updated,, whenever any updates applied and changes the gameplay to either direction.			"

Can't land anything, all your equipment, I MEAN THE BEST REELS IN THE GAME, can't hold up to a 3 lbs fish? WTH? This game is not realistic, how could it be? I still have my reel from when I was a kid a freakin ZEBCO 202, bought it for 10 dollars in 1970? I reeled in catfish with that night after night, and after cleaning it up ready to go again, so how is this update realistic? I never EVER had to balance lures and line and reels, if I wanted to fish with a bobber and a spinning rod, GUESS WHAT, I did it and you know what else, I CAUGHT FISH!!!  Bad update sorry to say, and this game will die out UNLESS something is done and things are reversed!			"

								So this game used to be very enjoyable.  You could casually fish, relax, pass time, and move from place to place with a little work.  The F2P model was good, and I even payed some money to support and buy some gear/tackle or lisences.  But the latest changes destroyed the game for the casual player, and really felt like an all out cash grab.  Advanced licenses require real money, travel costs from lake to lake dramatically increased.  Now playing feels like an all out grind from the get go instead of an enjoyable progression.  It really did have the potential to be a great fishing game/simulator, but at current build is a game fueled by greed on the developers part imho.			"

								Advertises Multiplayer and Co-Op capabilities. These are not currently part of the game, therefore negative review. I understand that this game is in Early Access, and because of this it can't be judged in the same way as a fully released title, but if it was at least mentioned in the store description that multiplayer had yet to be implemented I wouldn't mind. But the fact is that multiplayer is advertised in several locations on the store page, even though there is literally no sign of it being even close to available within the game itself. Therefore, negative review for false advertising or clickbait, whatever you want to call it.			"

								I was somewhat skeptical about this game at first due to the free-to-play model, since F2P games have catfished me one too many times and most modern fishing games are pretty crappie. As it turns out, Fishing Planet is a kick bass simulator that has hands-down the most in-depth modeling of fishing as a whole. Licenses, catch/keep systems, leader lengths, tackle box storage, real and artificial baits...it's all here. Everything from fish activity cycles to river drift is modeled in a way that's accurate, but still fun enough that you won't want the developer's head on a pike for making something that's as slow as the real thing is sometimes. The early game can be annoying since panfish are near-worthless for leveling up and will often make it difficult to get at the more valuable channel cats, which is a load of carp, but once you get over that hump, your options quickly open up for gear and species, and fights can become really cutthroat. I played a lot of fishing games back on the NES/SNES, and even for someone as pickerel about their fishing games as I am, I'm enjoying Fishing Planet a lot. ...salmon.			"

								Up until the newest patch this was a good and relaxing game to play, to gain vitual money and xp was a little long as both are needed to go to better areas and get better equipment but this was acceptable as you could hone your skills and tecniques. Now the new patch is here and they have increased the fish IQ which now makes the fish unrealisticly intelligent. Now they can remove the bait off your hook without causing a disturbance to your float, when you do manage to hook one they race off to the weed beds and wrap your line around the weeds which snares your equipment, leaving you to try and rescue your equipment while the fish saunters off giving you the preverbial 2's up. Let's be real Devs....fish are thick, don't give them something they never had in the first placeNow your equipment deteriorates at an alarming rate...how can throwing nylon line into fresh water once knock 1% off it's durability, salt water possibly...maybe. I assume the reason why they have now changed players equipment to be made of tissue paper is so that people will spend more of their hard earned in game cash, which now is even harder to get as you can't catch fish to sell.Well done Devs you have done what all other failed computer game creators have done, listened to a very minor group of annorak players and broke the cardinal rule, DONT TRY AND FIX WHAT IS NOT BROKEN !!Due to this recent patch you have lost alot of players, maybe you will see the errors of your ways and change things back making this enjoyable and playable again,if not then I wish you well in the pits of obscuredom which is now where this is heading.

								This used to be a half way decent game, but after the update it has turned into a complete money grab. You can see this when you leave the area where you were fishing and it tells you that if you had premium, you could get a lot more in game currency for the fish you caught then you would if you dont have premium. Another place where this crap is shown is how the game makes you pay even more in game currency to be able to keep (and in turn exchange for credits) fish that make the fishing worth while. P2W			"

								Sadly it was one of best fishing game when it was starting in 2015. Now after recent update turned up to be typical money grab. Before u could just chill daily for 1-2 hours and fish on your favorite spots nowdays people are asking around for specific fish to make up for all travel / lures expenses (not to mention baitcoins and gear that it exclusive to that currency - after update u can't get any of those from unique fishes as it was back in times) . Sad to put such negative opinion on one of my favorite games in the past but i guess most games nowdays are just bussines for people - this bussines just went to far for players to enjoy...			"

								This game is amazing!!!Def the best fishing game I've ever played actual fishing part wise. Why the negative score?They changed it so you can no longer have a home state. This means you have to pay for travel EVERYWHERE now. The first one past the begining lake is $1800. It takes me about an hour to get that $ when I am f2p. Then the best is that if I make a mistake and have to go back, that $ is not refunded at all. Lower travel costs or bring back a home state option and I'll change the review, for now I guess I'm just stuck of the Lone Star Lake.  "

								Great Simulator, Nice Progression, But The Grind Is Real+ Does a great job of simulating and the best fishing game around+ All 3 different types of lines (Mono, Fluoro, Braid) all have their strengths and weaknesses but overall the lines are balanced+ Nice Progression System+ Grind is Not that Bad (until you get to level 16+)however the bad parts to the game a few issues with bugs such as the teabagging in Florida or the game giving me frame drops a second before i get a bite to help tell me ""hey i'm getting a guaranteed fish on the next second"", and finally the fish flying around in circles at times when you go to reel it in.the grinding is pretty acceptable that you don't need to get premium so long as you have the skills and the patience to grind.. However when you get to level 16, the grind is so unbearable that the developers have basically forced you to want to get premium beyond level 16 as the xp scaling is so much. At this point the fish give between 45-60 xp per fish and the next level requires 15k xp and you only make about 3k xp per game day. At this point it takes you 3-5 real world days just to go from level 16 to 17. and from level 17-18 (requires 25k xp) it will take you 5-7 real world days aswell, making the grinding so painful at this point without premium. it took me 3 painful days just to go from level 16 to 17 and when i got to level 17 the xp gain did not even improve so i am either forced to get premium at this point or endure the pain of grinding. at this point i have decided not to continue playing the game as i would have completed it without premium but the grinding is just unbearable now that i can't sit there and grind so hard to gain one level per week.so take your time with the game because when you get to level 16 be ready to shell out for premium.

								Fishing planet is the ultimate relax experience. Moreover, despite being F2P is not by any means P2W and not repulsive in graphic/simple stupid gameplay terms.In fact, graphic is nice and close to imitate realistic pond and everything you can find around it- logs, plants, boats etc. Audio is calm and minimalistic. Besides intro music (which is great) there are only sound effects which is actually a great decision as it fulfills the calm and silent atmosphere of fishing contemplation. Birds, water and mosquitos are the perfect background to sit back and chill out.As for gamplay it is really more complex than throw and tow. You get yourself into two main ways of fishing- spinning and angling. Spinning is where you go for the fighters and predators. You must master several techniques of spinning as different predators respond differently to given bait and its movement.When you get tired of fighting you can take out your angler and do some peaceful casting for some less fierce fish. There you have to know what given fish likes to eat the most, where they hide and at which depths. There is a lot to learn and fishing blind and random will result in small blue basses. When you do your research and come prepared, you will get comparable results with big largemouth basses and heavy catfish as there is very little randomness in this game. If you know what you are doing you will get results making it very high commitment-high reward game. It will never make you feel you lost your time, even when you pour many hours into it.I covered barely some of the aspects of the first fishing place, there are more really challenging lakes as well as more types of fish to catch. Although being still in early access, game provides countless hours of fun and relax and there is lots of competitive stuff planned for the future.Moreover its free, so you can try it out with no money loss. Although when you try it, you will feel that the devs deserved some monetary gratitude for their tremendous work that is far superior to good ol' Trophy Bass series in every aspect.			"

								As far as a fishing game goes, the ""game"" outweighs the ""fishing"" portion by a large margin. It seems to be all about slowly building up your gear with incremental upgrades at prices and stats that are set with only competetive balance in mind. The gameplay itself is very simplistic and doesn't feel very natural. There is no walking around a lake or getting in a boat- you pick one of two or three spots on the map and you'll be teleported to that particular ten square feet of shoreline where you can clumsily sprint to the water's edge and begin ""fishing.""  It's never difficult to tell what the developers are focusing on in a game, particularly when the game is in Beta. In Fishing Planet, you can loot through the tutorials to quickly see that there *are no tutorials about how to fish* but instead only tutorials about how to navigate the menus and buy new equipment. Equipment, mind you, that is most easily obtained through DLC. You didn't misread that- the game which isn't even out of Beta yet is already charging for extra content. Yeah, that's what the world has come to. You'll spend more money on this game that you would just buying a rod and reel and going to your local pay lake.  So what about the fishing game mechanics? Well, there are a couple different cast types, but I had to figure out how to do them through the in-game chat because there are no key mappings to look up, nor are there tutorials for the game itself. There is no way to adjust the strength of your cast and there is no player skill involved in casting. The bobber appears to be giant and really messes with your depth perception because it seems to always be the same size regardless of it being in your hand or out in the water (which I believe was intentional so you could see it better in the water). But doing that is a moot point, because there is a torrent of meta information always flowing to you that the game insists you should have, such as a large display showing your bobber and the water level on it, as well as information about reeling in your lure too early. The process doesn't feel very developed, and the mechanics themselves are extremely lacking. Any chance they'll work on making the game flow better or flesh out the base gameplay mechanics? Not likely, they seem to be solely focused on adding new fish to the game and new items for the in-game market, like fireworks that you can set off.  So yes, it's a game. Is it fishing? That's debatable. I don't have a problem with develpers looking for a profit, and that's not where my complaint is. My beef with the game is that the CORE GAMEPLAY has taken a backseat to the in-game market system, and that sets the tone for the whole development process. What you see now in gameplay is likely what you'll see as a finished product, and there are hundreds of fishing games out there that offer better fishing mechanics. Pro Bass Fisher for Windows 95 was a great one, and honestly beats this game in every aspect but graphics.			"

New player get nowhere with slow xp and good item as the game developer intended to do. Stop squeezing money from customer and give what they really deserve then this game will rise to be big tittle in fishing game			"

								I am really liking this game so far and I'm really glad I found it. Probably the one of the best fishing sims I've played. You can do most things you can in real life like adjusting drag, jerking your rod to get free from snagging some weeds, choosing where and what time to fish, etc. I'm not gonna lie, it'll take you awhile to level up and you'll probably be catching a lot of bluegills when you first start because certain fish needs a certain bait and time of day to get. Not to mention where you cast on the body of water and how high or low you set your bobber/leader can also make a difference. Took me some time to get to level 3 so I can get the casting spoons for bass but when I got them, it was worth it. There's also an in-game chatbox where other players can chat with one another. I found this useful. The majority of the community is just great in this game. I did however, run into a few people arguing on chat about irrelevant topics and a player who told everyone that they suck and he is the best fisherman on the server but most of the people are willingly able to help each other out if a player needs help or tips on how to do things. The game kinda tends to be a bit laggy at some times but not a lot. Anyways, with that being said, this game is still a great and relaxing simulator. It's free, why not try it out? :)			"

								Other than the small crash issues at the loadinga and quiting, I really wanted to enjoy this game. To summarize my short opinion of it so far:Pro's:- Brilliant Scenery!- Starts off slow, you'll need to have the patience to get to the Intense fishing before you really start to enjoy it, so hang in there!- Relaxing Music and feel to the gameCon's:- Limited movement space, the player has very limited space to move, which is surprising with the amount of places down the river. To move to a new spot, your basically having to do a 2 or 3 second load to that spot. Overall, there was not much point in adding Character movement. I was hoping for a bit more freedom in movement and allowing the player to explore the scenery beyond.- Crashing at the fist Loading Screen, Note: Don't Click or press anything whilst on the loading screen, If you get the Please wait pop-up. Then click please wait and it should eventually load.- Crashing on Quit..The crashes will obviously get fixed eventually though. :)			"

Early Access Review
								A wonderful fishing game thats a little rough around the edges.This is an early access review of Fishing Planet. As of this writing, the game is currently on version 0.3.8 with an average update cyle of one every other week. I also have 400 hours in this title since August of 2015. I am a liesurely angler and have only recently reached level 21 in game.Fishing Planet is what I would consider a pseudo-simulator. The primary goal of the game is to relax and fish, though tournament style fishing is planned. As anyone who has fished in real life would know, you're never guaranteed a catch. This is the main point where Fishing Planet leaves the ""true"" simulation. It must balance gameplay with realism, and as such, catch rates are generally higher than what you would find in real life. On the other hand, you are offered a wider variety of rods, reels, lines, tackle, bait and misc. equipment designed to target a range of fish in a range of situations. You then couple all those decisions with your retrieval style, such as straight retrieves, stop and go, lift and drop, among others.That being said, what is planned and what we have currently are two different things. If you come into Fishing Planet at this time, expecting a perfect simulator, you will be disappointed. Fish currently have spawn boxes and set times when they spawn. Venture your lure outside this box or through this box at the wrong time of day and you won't find anything. Fish randomization is something the devs are working towards but, for the time being, the same general strategy is required. There are guides and spreadsheets detailing where to cast, when and with what lure/bait that will, hopefully, be rendered completely obsolete in the near future.There is a leveling system in place to limit where you can fish and what fish you can realistically catch. You can't just hop into the game and expect to catch 20kg Muskie immediately. You'll first need to catch smaller fish worth experience and credits to level up and purchase new gear, as well as licenses to higher tier lakes. The devs have recently ended a test in regards to removed level locks on lakes, and as such, it may be removed on all lakes in the future. If that's the case, your only limiting factor will be gear. You will still have to earn your gear by leveling up or bypassing level locks by purchasing DLC packs focusing on certain gear types such as heavy float rods or ultralight tackle. These DLC are completely optional if you wish to take your time and fish.Waterways are currently limited to North America, specifically, the United States. However, there are plans for European and Asian waterways in the future. Fish species are diverse and dependant on where you are. Current species include, but are not limited to Gar (Alligator, Florida and Longnose), Bass (Largemouth, Smallmouth, White, Peacock and Striped), Catfish (Channel, Blue, Flathead), Panfish (Bluegill, Crappie, etc.), Pike, Trout, Salmon and more.Graphically, the game is beautiful. Water physics are a sight to see. Ambient noise is great though some lakes can be a tad bit annoying to listen to.There are some rough spots though. They range from physics (fishing launching into the air) to fish AI bugs (fish don't even bother fighting on ocassion) to equipment bugs (drag exerting tension on the line even when not under any load). None of them are major or game breaking, in my opinion. Your mileage may vary. I currently would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys fishing as a leisure sport. Perhap, once tournaments are added, more competitive anglers will have something of interest. Arcade anglers, however, I fear would not find this fu. There are no easy-mode toggles such as underwater cam, reel assist, automatic tensioners or the like. If you don't know how to fish from real life experience and are unwilling to learn the basics of how fishing gear works, you may find this a difficult title to pick up.Just remember that this IS Early Acess, which means things are always changing. As such, don't get too comfortable with how things are. If something is easy to exploit, expect it to be changed, if there's a bug, expect it to be fixed.			"

								858 hours waiting to see  if this EA would finally take off and mirror the the boast of its creators. Sadly whilst graphically its 10/10 that is all it has going for it. As for realistic . Not even close. Now don't go on a hate rant I am evaluating the game on its description by the creators. Simulation od real life fishing. Come on guys who are you kidding it isn't even close. You cannot use the mosty used cliche ""it's early access"". Hooks that even Jaws would have trouble swallowing and floats normally used for mooring boats too. A game where every single facet is hinged upon the drag max on a reel!. How ridiculous.This game is doomed and it seems all the devs are interested in is putting more and more content in to a broken game. The rod reel physics have never worked from day one even if they have come a long way since the winch and haul method. Then comes  the cheaters  that were forewarned long before they arrived as in  all games some must win at any cost and pat themselves on the back for comfirming they are the lowest form of life breathing on the planet. How on earth do you expect to simulate a lake when there are no fish living in it. Spawn spots are not natural and are just pockets on a lake where 90% is devoid of any life. I played a 2D coded fishing game for 16 years and as a simulator it was spot on in every area and is still to this day the best fishing simulation ever produced.  It is a shame that despite describing themselves as fishing enthusiasts( reading between the lines meaning never picked a rod up in their lives) they do not posses the knowledge to make this game a worthy title. 6/0 hooks 30lb line with bloodworm as bait and being pulled all around the lake by a 15lb fish does that sond like a simulation of any fishing scenario any angler has ever had. The game is disjointed and a mess tbh. They are putting too many thumbs in too many pies and diluting what they have created. For a non angler it might occupy your time for a while but for any real life angler it's safer to stay on terra firma than engage this nonsense 2/10			"

								Game was awesome I played it alot just leisurely fishing to see what big ones I can Catch.Now they Ruined the whole game put it behind a paywall that is rediculous.They made it way too expensive just to even go to a new fishing sopr.I've been fishing in this all day and never caught a single fish.they hid all the baits behind the gold coins which you never get.I like they way they had it before it was somewhat affordable to get to the other ponds,you could buy some of the baits with the credits they gave you.this game is the worst kind of freemium game now.they pretty much halt progression in the game unless you spend money of freemium crap.They should have just made a great fishing game and not worry about freemium ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

								This WAS a very fun and playable game if you like fishing.  However, I have to agree with my fellow ex-fans, in that, the devs have turned this game into a rigged slot machine where the house is the only one who wins. I have slowly and methodically been turned off by most of these ""updates""  over the past several months.  If that was intentional, GOOD JOB! I no longer play it or spend money on it like I used to.  If this was unintentional, my first question is,  Who the heck let the lunatics run the assylum!?  The things that were broken, barely got touched.. like the damage to equipment from general use, fish not biting after a certain rank or the totally useless fishing atlas for a few examples. One trip to a fishing spot in this game and the equipment is damaged with just about every few casts.  It was fun at one time..honest.PRO: I got to reclaim some of my hard disk space on my steam drive.			"

								It starts out nice (the basics are there for a good simulator), but quickly turns into either an obnoxious cashgrab or a tedious grindfest extreme. Your choice. I would much rather pay a decent amount of money up front for a good game than struggle with pseudo-free-to-play. ""Baitcoin."" You said it.Update: As of patch 0.7.7 the game is now a wannabe Ponzi scheme as well. I want to like this game and see it develop into a good simulator upon release, but the developers are making it really, really hard.			"

								I've played this game for almost three hours, and by played I mean I've sat on the loading screen trying to get it to work for almost three hours. Nobody online seems to have any solution or advice for this problem, 0/10 fishing sim, 11/10 loading screen simulator. Think I'll stick to my local pond when I want to fish.UPDATE: While my time played now says 41 hours I assure that all 41 of those hours were spent on the infinite loading screen, thats right, i've spent almost two whole days just trying to load into this garbage. Once again no one seems to be of any help, an email sent to the developer after REQUESTING I EMAIL THEM THERE  went UNREPLIED to, and while the community did try to help they offered no new information other than what I had already tried. From some of the stuff I read about this game it doesn't sound enjoyable to begin with. Paying for rod and reel repairs just to make players spend their in-game money, really? As an avid fisherman I can asssure you rods do not need to be ""repaired"" regularly if at all with special exceptions such as a broken tip or guide, and reel repair? Just oil and lube twice a year and most decent reels on the matket today will last a lifetime. I wish I could not reccomend this more than once, I understand this is a game but they are marketing it as a simulator, so lets at least simulate accuratly shall we? You can handle big fish just fine on light tackle unlike this game would have you believe, also I've seen several ""tips"" while sitting on the loading screen that are just flat out wrong. If you enjoy this game, hey go for it, but if the dev's are gonna market it as a realistic fishing sim they need to try MUCH MUCH harder.			"

								With almost a full day of gameplay I want to start a first impression review for people both in the know how for fishing and new to fishing games (like me. Yep, I'm a CSGO/Team Fortress player, not a simulator/fishing player. BUT I've fished in my life time): Pros:  This is the first game in a long time that has had me ""hooked"" extensively. The gameplay is fluid and accurate. Stepping into the game I was expecting 1 of 2 things: Confusing and unnecessary game mechanics OR pay for the ""best"" equiptment as do MANY other fishing simulators contain. Starting and Controls: BOY WAS I WRONG. Off the bat the tutorial gives you the need to know basics for fishing in general which is easy to use and from experience really an amazing portrail of the sport in real life. After you understand the simple and relaxing controls you're off fishing on your own. Gameplay: USUALLY, games like this would start you off with fish in tiers (Example: Start bluegill, then catfish, then bass, and so on). However, you're able to start going for either bluegill, catfish, pike, or bass right off the bat. When it comes to fishing in this game, real world knowledge is amazingly potent in this game. A HUGE plus over other fishing simulators! Catching a fish in this game gives a SUPER rewarding and that's why I'm enjoying every bit of the game play. Market Model: There are free to play games I play without spending a dime but are annoyingly hard and VERY long to progress through where I just get burnt out and stop playing. Then, there are games where a majority of everything in the shop can be achieved... PURELY BY PLAYING!You don't need to spend anything to achieve special currency. Yep, ""premium currency"" is awarded through achievments and special fish. Yep, just like the games of old, you can unlock special stuff just by playing the game! DLCs? PSSSSH. Though their DLCs give you and edge early on, you can completely farm up to get all the items in the DLCs just from playing.Also, the in game currency is made fast with a bit of work BUT no where near grindy or slow as many other F2P models out there. This game's F2P model is a HUGE plus being a F2P player. Great job!!! Cons:   Lack of Variety and Content: One thing that slows you down is the fact that there's only so many fish you can catch. To many people this can bog down grinding and cause interest to droop off but it's what I expect from a game that just went into release. I know for a fact there's going to be A LOT more content to be added here such as tournaments, quests, missions, and more fish and equiptment. Though on the plus side to this there are varients of the current fish you can catch and personally that's good enough for an on release game. Grindy(ish): Yep, Grindy. Big surprise there from a F2P game right? Well, as to be expected. Every game with progression has a grind but I feel like this game handles it fairly well to a point. Upon reaching lvl 15+ there's a huge gap in exp gain that causes the game to really slow down. However, this is in place so the level split between casual and hard core doesn't grow too far apart.In all honesty this is a good move to prevent inbalances when tournaments get released. I would like to mention this is changing a week after this post to increase exp gain all around. The low level grind is decent up until level 10 and then you feel the monotonous grind thereafter. Like I stated! They're changing this in a week so this will change for sure! Entry Level Steep(ish): If you have experience fishing or used to fish like me, then you'll be just at home here. Like I stated in the pros, this game is SPOT ON with relation to real life fishing.However, if you're completely new to fishing, you might have a hard time getting started since every single fish has their own way of being caught. Though this can be a problem for a little bit, there's PLENTY of guides on youtube, guides here on steam, and help in game. Verdict:  Honestly, I went in with expectations set by many failed misses in the fishing game genre from years before but I'm knocked on my♥♥♥♥♥with how well this game came to rise up to what has been sorely missing in this genre of gaming. The F2P market is both gameplay derived and not pay to win, the gameplay is spot on and rewarding, the graphics are beautiful as all hell, the physics are nice, and importantly to the genre, this game is really accurate.Though there are kinks here and there with lack of content and poor entry level, this game hit the spot for an alternative to FPS, RTS, and Strategy games that I'm used to playing.I really hope the devs continue to keep the game in the positive heading.

								This game used to be good a long time ago. But it is not now. I remember when I could come home from work and relax and catch fish on fishing planet. It was good times. Then changes,and more changes and now you might as well call it line throwing simulator because I guess the virtual fish has been fished out because I never hardly catch S**t anymore. It is a game, and should have some fun during the relaxing game play. But there is no more fun to be had.You sit for hours in game time catching nothing. This game is broken and I closed my wallet to it a long time ago. I do still come back to see if it is fixed and fun again but it just seems worse every time I do. I have a love for fishing planet from the past but a true hatred for what it is now.			"

No more guarentees son, deal with it.  One thing I don't agree with is the durability, but it is what it is.  The updates added a lot more realism to the entire aspect, no more reeling in and just going ham on a fish.  Time to actually use speed, timing, and drag to wear that fish out.  All the keyboard warriors are upset about that, makes me think they haven't caught the big one or had the patience to deal with a lackluster day IRL.Take it easy, cast a line, and enjoy the damn game.

(optional)Enough said, if you like fishing or want a stress free game without having to kill something every 2 mins then simply give this a go.Updates are coming in fast, the game is growing and gets better.Another fishing sim just got released costing money, I would avoid that one for now and stick to this..Its FREE.......

You will get anywhere and will catch all the fish there's available in our game. What do I get from premium accounts?With Premium account you get a 50% boost in experience you get per each caught fish for the duration of the account, a pack of licenses,a money pack. In simple words premium account just lets you level up faster.Is there any specific tackle or content I can purchase only for real money?No.Infact, quite contrary, there content you can unlock only by playing the game.So, do you have a membership?No.Premium accounts are more like boosters.

I like the game a lot and there are many friendly people online to chat with in game that share hints and tips on the best times to fish.It can take a long time to level up if you do not have premium membership but that is part of the challenge and as you level up this unlocks better tackle in the shop for purchase so one day you can land that dream fish.The game also contains two types of currency; gold which is harder to come by but is earned by unlocking achievements or catching unique fish and silver which is the main in game currency which is earned from catching the remaining fish types plus also unlocking certain achievements.If you download this game and your a fishing lover you won't be disappointed.

								I liked that Game alot  until the new Update came online Today, they totally killed it. The Travel costs for any Lake are so expensive that you just cant afford it without buying real Money Currency, the new Time Skip Function is a Joke! Each Hour you Skip gives you a 5 Minute Cooldown, so this means Basicly that you are trapped for across 20-30 Minutes until you can skip the next Time and if the Weather is Bad you are many more frustrated because you dont Catch any Fish to Pay the Day to be there. Really 500 Currency Money for ONE DAY?? And those is the lowest Price there-.-. The Fish Catch Mechanics got changed by far, the Fishes bites 4-5 Times until they take the Bait or they just Disappear and stop biting. Me and my Friend was 1 Hour at Missouri in that Time we filledmore than 40 Pounds in our Nets and now after the Update Patch we filled just 20 Pounds. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ANYMORE ON THIS GAME.			"

All the hard work farming uniques have became a waste of time, cant even farm unique redear's anymore to get baitcoin to buy better gear/bait.  Also all DLC that cost real money has been Nerfed, no one bit happy about that. Use to be able to enjoy the social side of the game with 20 people also fishing on the same map, but now lucky to see 1 person. I feel bored just waiting for a bite with no one to chat with.			"

								Well they wrecked it. It was a good game but now due to a poor update that has made it a look at the scenery rather than catch a fish with unstable rod and float or lure action. Travel costs make it prohibitive to learn a new lake as you spend so much money getting there and a huge daily fee that if you find a spot fish bite occasionally  you dont want to waste it.  All the money I have spent on the game and with this latest update they ripped it all off me. A monthly license for Quanchkin is 192000 dollars so I paid 500 bait coin for the unlimited..... bait coin i had was paid out at a 10/100 ratio 10 bait coin for every 100 gold so ripped of big time.  It has become a money grabbing venture by the devs who just dooo  dood all over their customer base. So summing up  fish dont bite no money coming in it costs alot to travel so choice is stay at free starter lake forever or buy in game cash with real money to play the FREE fishing game plus the insane amout it costs for rods reels baits etc.12 montha ago I would of highly recommended this game so sad what can happen in 12 months			"

Fishing Planet helped occupy my two year old for a few minutes while he helped me catch some fish.  I got bored pretty fast on this game and do not think I will be playing it without my son.Edit:  I wanted to add that you can switch your tackle up, adjust drag, reel speed and bobber depth, travel to different fishing holes in a few states as you level up, travel to a couple different holes in each map, and adjust the time that you would like to be fishing.  Then once your there fishing you have very limited walking area allowing you to go from side to side on the shore for a short distance.I'm giving this game a thumbs up for what it is, a free time passing fishing game.

								This game is a conundrum. The graphics are beautiful, the effects like bugs skimming the water are stunning, the background ambience is incredible, and the actual gameplay stinks. They spent so much time making everything realistic looking that it feels like they forgot to allow time for the actual mechanics of the game. If you throw your line in the water and a fish bites at it, you have to wait for quite a while otherwise it says ""strike too early"" and you lose your bait. If you wait to long, it says something like ""Strike timed out"" and you lose your bait. The actual window, it seems, for being able to actually hook the fish is around 2.5 seconds out of the entire ""strike zone"". Add to that that it's nearly impossible to buy anything OTHER than bait like grasshoppers and worms and such, and when you can, you can't even use it because you can't buy the correct pole for lures, the game becomes infuriating. Wait to download this game until they actually fix the mechanics and make the game more open. After all, why should I wait until I'm like level 50 to be able to buy a particular fishing pole? Are they saying that in the real world, I can't buy a really nice setup unless I've been fishing for a long time already? No...a salesman will sell you whatever you want, even if you don't know how to use it.			"

								I havn't played as much as I'd like to but I definitely like this game and enjoy it a lot.It seems a little limited unless you put a few bucks in making in-game purchases but I've learning how to do more without micro transactions being necessary to have more fun.The game reminds me of The Hunter in many ways which is one of my favorite games and a similar F2P simulation game but hunting instead of fishing. I feel like if they took some notes from that game and made a few changes then they would really have something worthwhile.If you enjoy fishing but can't get out all the time or afford a licence then this game is for you. If you want to get into fishing then this game is a really nice tool as well.			"

								Since the new update has caused mostly moments of frustation, I'm changing my review.. Before the update, you could use the best gear you could afford and while it may have taken awhile to reel in a fish, atleast your line didn't go all slinky and a 4lb fish take 400+ ft of line. The game was good the way it was, but I do appreciate the devs trying to change things. For me personally 500+ hours logged a change this big kinda stresses me out. Maybe it won't be the same for you..so I won't say it isn't worth giving it a try, so I will atleast still recommend you try it... After all it's free. P.S> Devs I appreciate the time you put into ""change"" but I hope you plan to supply us with decent float rods in the shop. We've been asking for this for a long time now. How can we pull in 20+ lb catfish and others on bait rods when we only have the best float rod- a gold item the Fenix that cost 40 gold.. that can't handle anything over 17 lbs?? ...maybe to try to convince us to buy DLC? Hope you don't become P2P...I happily bough DLC when it was optional. Honestly......new rods and sufficient gear to match this change in the update would have solved this whole issue. All 20 levels I have been waiting for a better float rod. Still yet to be seen but I know ya'll are working hard and I do appreciate that.			"

								As much as I like this game and the ""Time"" they put into this game. There are bad aspects towords this game . Such as getting banned for telling the Moderator that there is alot of bugs that they could improve on and maybe helping to really make the game better but no they get banned because its foul langauge. Another bad aspect to this game is the forums. Yet again getting banned becasue you can not have freedom of speech  and i'm sure saying you'r baby sitting the game forums is kind of insaulting towords us players but hay if you want to be that kind of person . Do what you want but heres a question. If this game has so many bugs and problems why dont you just take the litle kids advist and not bannding them for trying to get a point towords acullay fixing this problems . Its a fishing game which needs the right stuff to make life real life and know when the weather is right and no of this glitchy stuff.  I bet you this post will be banned and I will banned for speaking my mind too. If do thats  that proves  some ""Moderators"" are to high on the horse and don't understand the words of Freedom of speech. Please tell me about the Rules and Guidelines. I know them.

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWPros:Looks nice, graphics are fairly goodHas a more realistic look than most fishing gamesCons:First and foremost the game has a misplaced focus on locating fish rather than the catching of them.It can takes hours finding the right spot, time of day, right bait to find what your looking for and when you finally hook one, you can reel it in quickly without much trouble at all. The ""fish fight"" aspect of the game  is virtually nonexistent.The game claims to be ""multiplayer"" however is simply a single player instance with a chat box in the corner.No customization at all, any gear other than what rod and reel your using doesn't change your appearance at all, in fact you never see more than your own two hands.In its current state the game seems like little more than a tech demo, the maps are small, and it get repetitive rather quickly.VERDICT:I can't recommend the game at this time.The developers I think are dropping the ball, or what has been the case for many EA titles, the game is just a cash grab. They seem to prioritize how players earn experience over the fixing of major bugs in the game. In the first week of release they adjusted fish spawns and exp rate three times and have again since then. Balance in a game like this is important, however all these changes have been ""nerfs"" to experience gains to slow player progression. In a normal EA title this would be fine, however this one sells a premium membership in the cash shop that gives 50% bonus to experience. Early Access or not, if your going to have a cash shop people expect to get what they pay for and not have the game changed in a way that devalues what they purchased. Quite frankly the actions of the developers thus far throws up the   ""cash grab"" flags in my opinion.			"

								I used to love this game and would come back to it from time to time just for a relaxing free fishing experience. I particularly love the fact that the developers used to be adamant that it would stay free with only real money purchase being the premium membership. Everything in game had to be earned and the best stuff had to be earned by catching the best fish. Now since the last update you can only get the best gear by paying real money and the prices of everything has skyrocketed to ridiculous amounts. Probably won't be returning to the game until changes are made to make the game great again.Pre 0.7.0 this game was a 10/10 completely free fishing experience.Post 0.7.0 its a 3/10 freemium experience at best.

								Im really gonna miss this game. Guess I will just have to go too Fishing World. Im level 32 with over 340 hours invested. I supported this game I bought premium, I own all but 2 of the DLC content they have up for sell. You noticed I used the word supported cause I will never spend another dime on this game with the way things are now. I really feel like I just got crapped on. They removed items from the game that I paid money for. This so called upgrade to the Heavy Casting pack, Its not a upgrade its a peasment cause they took the 660lb Fish Net out of the game so you couldn't carry as much fish and would have too end your day sooner.  Thats fine but dont screw with something that I paid my money for.  If it came with the DLC leave it and figure something else out. The amount of money it takes to travel too and making it back while there has become way more difficult but not impossible if your willing to spend the money. But the licenses that you have to buy to fish there is completely insane. Adanced Unlimited License for Alaska is 1000 baitcoins. In the Premium shop 1090 bait coins will cost you 49.99.  All I can say is WOW WTF!  WIth the introduction of the 3D avatar's, that causes even more problems. For example in Flordia there are 3 small T docks to fish from and when you have 5 or more people standing there it's hard to see. All you see are fishing poles and fish flying in front of you.  These are just afew issues the game has now, there are many many more. With just these examples you should be able to see where this game is headed. But it will not cost you to download for yourself and give it a shot. Only thing I can think of is maybe they were bought out by EA.  If thats the case Origin's Vault is needing more games.			"

								I have to agree with what people are saying this game was great until 2017.Normaly a game is considered pay to win if you can not play it without paying money, the problem with this game since the update is it is beyond that.Even when spending Money (no matter how much) there is no progression possible, the ingame playmoney system is broken beyond everything. You would have to fish the same lake for at least 3 ingame days to get any type of profit which can without any problem be 12H real life time, this is absurd.So the only question i have to ask is: How do you call a game that is not even pay to win since you cant win no matter how much money you spent ???

								This game is great in general: graphics and gameplay are well done. But i can't recommend this game to anyone because of his xp system. It's a grind fest, where you must play a whole day getting the same fish if you want to level up and get access other areas. It's not fun, it's boring as hell.EDIT: after some comments:I did not mean that i will get the same fish when i cast with specific bait/lure and on the specific spot. I mean you have to ""grind"" on the place that give a better, let's say xp/hour, in order to level up your account to get acess to new places/fishes. Trout are a example, i have some friends that spend the whole day getting trouts to gain a single level. And there are fishes that just dont ""worth"" the time because this exp system. I like to get all the fishes, but some species just dont worth the time you spend there.Another thing is that when i get a fish, i don't feel ""rewarded"". Fishes don't really fight, it's easy to get a trophy fish without even care taht your line may break. And since you learned, by yourself or saw any tutorial, how to get a specific fish, the AI of the game will always work on the same way. So if you cast on the same spot with the same lure in the same time (i heard that some uniques are caught exactly at the same minute of the day), you will get the fish. There is no ""random"" things that always happens on fishing irl. Some times you will get a fish on the ""wrong"" place and time and this don't happens here.Anyways, i read the last news and looks like they will improve exactly what makes me dislike the gamWhen this happens for sure i will change my review to positive, because the game overall is good.

								So I log into FP for the first time in a few months and see that I can travel to Canada again for the holiday. I also see there is changes with the way the game has money. I have 32k.... cool, I spend 4k on a license and 11k to get there. Well - when I try to pull out a pole - none. So I go to inventory and find nothing. I'm now assuming everything is gone.Not happy. I try to buy a new reel at 12k and a pole...not enough money.At this point, I'm really frustrated and irritated enough to quit and uninstall the game after a being around since it got on Steam. I bite the bullet and go home... only to find all my stuff there. Now I wasted all that cash.I'm writing because I'm at the point where I finally frustrated and hope you guys can fix it - maybe return the in game money I started with.....if not, it's been fun and well, I'd rather spend $20 for the game and not have a F2Pay kind of set up and may look at the Euro fishing game. I wrote to them on Facebook and the answer I got was lame:""Hello, every time you go fishing you have to make sure you have everything you need - from gear to lures etc, that works in real life, too.  We also stated in update notes that all gear has been moved to home.  Therefore we cannot do refunds, because nothing happened due to bugs. You can however go to a free lake and get yourself up & running there.""I don't want to spend 5 to 15 minutes reading game notes of drastic changes. NEVER before did our inventory stay at home. We log in and our items were on our body and in our bags. Bad excuse. So - I'm uninstalling and will be looking at Euro Fishing or hell, I'll get a pole out in Minecraft and have a better time. What a shame. It's beatiful, relaxing and all that I like. This last patch for Freemium just blew it. Not going to dump money into another game like Planetside 2. I will pay the chunk ($10-50) up front and call it good from here on. Milking people for cash is lame anymore. Good bye Fishing Planet.			"

								The game idea is amazing. It's a beautiful and realistic fishing simulation. All a game has to offer. Why would this be a negative review, then? Because progress in this game is incredibly frustrating and impossible if you don't invest tens of hours catching the same fish over and over again.I just finished a 5 hour fishing marathon. 150 fish caught, for the next level I'll need approximately 90 more. To reach the next area and be able to fish some different species I'll need 2 more levels. frustrating to say the least.I'll definitely change my review into a positive one as soon as this grind of hell is over.

								Best-looking, realistic fishing game I have ever played. Fantastic graphics, fishing options, locations -- it looks like the developers have done their work building the game. This was a title I could potentially have seen myself playing and contributing to for a long time. Potentially... A *potentially* great game, but, like many online competitive titles there is a huge problem with rampant cheaters and hackers. Unfortunately, this ruins the experience for players who don't cheat, and also raises the red flag. Cannot recommend.			"

								Great fishing game. It's not a perfect simulator, but what is, aside from pressing a button and a train moving on tracks? The devs are extremely friendly and active, working to make an interesting game. Fishing requires some level of thought, and can be an exciting experience for some species, and a relaxing for others. Some new patches and content comes buggy, but the Devs HAUL to fix such problems, (including mechanics that the majority hates ,etc). It's beautiful and alot of fun without spending a cent, so try it!			"

								- Game looks beautiful! An amazing feature for any free-to-play game anymore.  - Item mall (real life money items/features) are more for convience.  All of the content in the game (different areas you fish) are capable of being unlocked by leveling and using in-game currency for players who choose not to spend money on the game.  An ideal way of doing the Item Mall.  Only thing I can see people having issues with it is when tournaments are unlocked and players who spend can get a certain lure a level early, but that's far from pay to win in my eyes.- For the most part the community are more mature players.  But with any free-to-play game, you are going to see some immature idiots trying to ruin your experience.Overall this game is pretty addicting, fun and requires patiences (it is fishing after all.)

Updates are another thing, they give you a date and or time and they fail to reach their end. The game is horrible now. The devs ruined this for lots of players. I seriously hope this game fails, and everyone leaves it so that they have a ""fully developed"" game with no one playing it because of how stupid it is now.			"

								This game sadly turned into a cashgrab. Aside from the ultimate showstoppers: cooldowns and timers, there's just everything tweaked towards making you pay unless (unconfirmed) you set a VERY considerable amount of time aside. I haven't seen that though. So it might just be impossible for a working and living human.The game doesn't resolve around fishing. It's more or less an economy simulator set in the fishing scenerio. They have ""travel costs"", daily access fees, daily fishing licenses, gear upgrade costs, lure costs, bait costs... Everything costs, a lot.All that just to make you grind mindlessly by the way. Yes, there are other locations available, suitable to your ""level"" though.It kills the spirit of fishing. Fishing can be fun anywhere, not just in your ""level zone"".It also teaches you nothing. At all. It's just a gear show and a grind fest. What a missed oportunity.Instead of all the timer mess they could've just named a price (e.g. between 50-100€/$) where you can buy everything and be done with the cashgrab. But they didn'tAlso it seems they There would've been so much potential, for example VR. But sadly it seems the game is made for money, not because the devs actually like the sport.			"

								A great game, with a great community, however a horrible moderator who doesn't believe in or allow freedom of expression within Forums.The Good: Good graphics with varied fishing locations and species of fish. There are plenty of fish to be caught and plenty of locations to catch them, the developers have done a good job of try to emmerse you in the game play.Great community, every time that I have had a problem or not understood things the other players have taken their time to help give advice, point me in the right direction, and in general to be pleasant and helpful.Game play, at first things can be a little confusing and even a little over whelming in the choices or rod, reels, baits, lures hooks, etc..,, however with a little effort and a few questions asked a person can have a well balancd set up and be catching trophy fish and unique fish.The Bad.No freedom of speech within the forums. Even if your post violates none of the Steam Rules or the rules of Fishing Planets forums the modrator refuses to allow open and honrst debate regarding the game or any problems encountered while playing the game. If it varies from his opinion you will be banned.Sounds, the sounds seemed canned and antiquated. The dove sounds like a whistle kids make by blowing into their hands.Not enough communication from developers. Not much more can be said on this topic. without communications the user feels left out and abandoned. Synopsis. A very good game that is fun to play and a great break from blowing stuff up all the time. After a long days work the game is a great way to relax and enjoy fishing at home. Whether you buy content or use what you are awarded as you level up, the game is a blast. The best gaming community I have seen in a very long time. Definitely worth the time to check out.			"

								I would not recommend this game for anyone except maybe the people who like mini games. The graphics were okay, water had some problems and its a fishing game so it's important. Real water doesn't just move up in one spot about ten feet while its a still lake and there wasn't any point where you could actually see the fish in the water even if the water was crystal clear, which is my favorite part about fishing is seeing the fish in the water. Before I even downloaded the game, I read and met all of the minimum requirements, and even all but one of the recommended requirements and when I log in the game says I dont even meet minimum requirements. My computer isn't a bad laptop or anything I bought it specifically with high graphics games in mind and put quite a chunk of money into it and before I even start playing this game tells me You dont have the minimum requirements and the game is going to glitch out on you. Get into game and all of the controls are screwed up the tutorial spent ten minutes telling me to press one button while the actual button that I had to go hunt and peck looking for was across the keyboard. After that shenannigans I get past the tutorial and get into a private room and I cant move because the game keeps telling me I dont meet the minimum requirements. After a week of constant failures on this game I just gave up even trying. Ive had better fishing experiences in my pool to be honest and would rather play any of the major console fishing games before I deal with this. I understand that its early access but usually you include the tag Alpha Test or something on your steam page so that people know its going to be terrible to play and you're honestly going to spend about an hour working through glitches.

								Right now this game has 13 DLC packs, totaling approx. $285, but this game is free-to-play apparently.I can buy 4 triple A titles at release (and have change) with the total cost of the DLC, and this game absolutely does not equate to 4 titles.Prices have been inflated (they haven't scaled; everything is actually more expensive) and perm. licenses now require currency that as of right now can only be bought, or scrounged up over dozens of competitions. (assuming you place) Some licenses alone cost $50. (Alaska)The new, insidious, and exploitative economy is designed to push players to just buy DLC and premium currency instead of playing the actual game. I would argue that the game, as of 0.70 is as - or even more difficult, than it was when it first released. In the 2 years this game has been out, The dev's promise to deliver a quality free-to-play experience has manifested into a trap to sate their greed. Fishing Planet is taking advantage of its monopoly on the fishing simulator niche here on Steam, and it's disgusting. It is a former shell of the principles by which it was founded, and I find the avarice of the developers appalling.   The developers do not derserve to be rewarded with your money or your time for their deceptive practices. Stay away.			"

								I am a big fan of fishing games and this game is the best that i have found so far. very realistic and is a good way to pass the time. Since it is in beta i figure their will be more improvements to the game to make it more unique and different from what has been put out before this. A list of what i like about it and i don't like.LIKES:- VERY REALISTIC- BEAUTIFUL SURROUNDINGS - GOOD TO PASS THE TIME- FISHES ARE REALISTIC AND ACT HOW THEY WOULD IF THEY WOULD BE CAIGHT- SIMPLICITY - SMOOTHENS - THE FEELING OF THE GAME WHEN WALKING, FISHING, AND ROD MOVEMENTDISLIKES- LACK OF FISHES (IN BETA SO ASSUMING THEY'LL ADD MORE)- CLEARER INDICATIONS WHEN YOU LOSE A FISH- NEEDS MORE CUSTOMIZEABLE EQUIPMENT. FISHING RODS, LURES, WORMS, AND SUCH- I WANT TO FEEL LIKE IT'S ME IN THE GAME ACTUALLY FISHINGTO CONCLUDE THIS REVIEW THIS GAME IS WORTH THE TIME. VERY EASY AND RELAXING. IF YOU LIKE TO FISH OR JUST LIKE TO CATCH FISH I RECOMMEND THIS GAME. * REDMINDER* THIS GAME IS STILL IN BETA SO BE PATIENT.			"

								I started out not liking this game since at the beginning you only start with basic gear and can only catch small fish it can get boring. But it's easy to rank up and start earning more money to afford better equipment and then the game becomes really fun. For being a free game I was really impressed with the quality of the graphics and the gameplay, there are some bugs but this is a early access game so that's not a suprise. Use Youtube for gameplay tips, I still go there and i've been playing for awhile.Don't listen to people who leave negative reviews on steam and have only played the game for a short time, they never experianced the full game.

								I, sitting here waiting to play because i am 3 short for travel to fish so have to wait, I love the game and will be playing it all the time. maybe the game should have an area where you can sell items for ingame money to travel with or you can use it if you buy something you don't need any more. also, this game would be even better if it was open world, and you can travel to different places  and also be able to fish freshwater and saltwater.

								This game is very interesting, and I am glad that it is not pay to win.There are some important things you should note.There is no Dynamite/grenade fishing. This is really fun, cause you should be table to take the boat out after and net the fish.However the major component lacking in this game is the ability to unleash my carnal pleasures onto the helpless fish after I catch them. This is of major concern for me, and deciding factor of spending time in game.			"

								Great game. Caters to the outdoorsman, as well as the MMO player. Which I happen to be both. Has many aspects of great mmorpgs, level progression, gear upgrading. As you level up you unlock access to new livewells, rods, reels, lines, lure, bait, and fishing equipment. The leveling is at a good pace, and the money system is NOT pay to win. You get cash for every single fish you catch, you also get experience. While I've never put 1$ into the game, I consider myself pretty decent at it. It's all about finding the right spots to fish, and using the right gear, as well as different techniques to control your lure. The fights are exciting and nailbiting at times. When you just know you have that trophy fish on the line,and you don't want him to unhook. Also, there is unique fish, and Trophy grade fish, which will give you very huge rewards, unique fish also give you money for the cash shop, which you also recieve a chunk every time you level up,and the reards increase every level. If your not sure about it, JUST TRY IT, us gamers need to support these developers who think outside the box and make great games. This is true progress in gaming, not another copy and paste sword and board, or korean grinder. This is where its at, you must try! Look me up when the friends list goes live and let's nail them!

The only way to get enough money back to go on another fishing trip is to wait a day or two for daily login rewards.Overall very addictive and satisfying game.Ps. would pay for preimuim or DLC to by a gun and shoot that mongrel Mourning Dove and Woodpecker			"

								F2p done right here. Even right now in early point of the Early Access, without much to do, other than grind experience and chat with other players at your fishing spot, this game truly shines brighter than the other fishing sims and games I have played so far.So many rods and lures to choose from, with different kinds of lines and reels , its really the fishing game to try out.Even at this point there are good amount of spots and a lots of different fish types to choose from.I personally love the leveling system, and the unlocking of better equipment and clothes through ranking up while fishing. Cant wait for the tournaments, quests and duels which are coming on a later date into the game. They will make the relaxing fish grinding even an better experience for us in the future.And about the microtransactions.This game definitely isn't another TheHunter, if you know what I mean. You can easily play and enjoy this game for full of its content for free and enjoy it as much as anyone. The ingame currency is easy to obtain and gets you the gear and licenses you need for the fishing spots without too much work (Or work at all, cause its fun to earn ingame currency while fishing and turning the fish in). If you are interested in fishing or just fishing games, I cannot recommend this game highly enough for you. "

								Let me star this off by saying I am one of those that is VERY lery of F2P games. Its not that I have an issue with the sales model.....If done properly it works very well for some games. But thats where it all falls apart, because 9 times outta 10 it is NOT done properly. To many games say F2P but then hide huge amounts of content behind paywalls. To many say F2P but are actually P2W.......And EVERYONE here Im sure know full well what I speak of....I could name games but would rather not....That having been said......This is a great game, and a GREAT F2P model. Even the DLC on steam is mostly stuff that you can get ingame playing without ever paying a cent (or there is comparable from what I saw).I have not purchased any of the DLC yet but I plan to, seems a great way to stock up on role specific gear AND this honestly has potential to be best fishing sim ever..Im willing to throw some $$ at that!!!I have purchased the 3 day premium account. Can say these packs or more than reasonably priced for what you get..and brilliant you can use your steam wallet for this!! I did level to almost 4 before getting premium to get a feel for the game. Yes it is a bit slow...but its fishing, everything is a little slow ya =) It did not seem to slow or unfair or overly grindy at all.Great game thats 100% playable with ZERO investment, but well worth every penny if you do decide to spend a bit.

								I really enjoyed this game, bought most the DLC and spent money in game as well. Not because I felt I had to but because I enjoyed the game and wanted to support it. After the most recent updates you feel more like you have to spend money. These cool downs on fastforwarding time when your net is full is a game ruiner. I feel as though the game has lost its direction. I know a business needs to make money but I cannot see profits rising this way. People like myself will leave because although it was a good game theyve ruined it. Sad really. I dont mind spening money on games when I feel like I have the choice, when I feel like there is no choice you can count me out.			"

I can't wait for what this game will add, because it's in early access, so it'll be exciting. Also, for real life fisherman, this is probably the best you will get. It's pretty detailed. Graphics are nice, fps is smooth, overall fun.  (Only request is- going to new lakes is a bit expensive and hard to get your money's worth, so I'm stuck at missouri. Oh well)			"

								I really really really liked this game, and would have rated it positive up until the latest upgrade which did improve a lot of things, but the new absolutely positively horrendous abysmal fishing gear damage model is just sooooooooo unrealistic that I'm quiting the game until I read or get an email that it has been improved.  I just can't comprehend how the developers, which were doing a really got job up until now IMHO, could have gotten that part so completely wrong without some kind of maliscioius intent on their part.  I was helping the effort by buying a couple of DLC packs at $50, which is close to what one would pay for a new popular title game, but this current damage model just blew the game out of the water and off my play list for me.I suggest anybody who is interested in starting this game now wait until you see news indicating the developers have instituted a MUCH more improved damage model.It simply sucks right now!

								You can buy actual fishing licenses cheaper than you can in-game....What are these devs thinking? All the way up to $99 for a years worth of VIRTUAL fishing... You can fish in 2 spots on 1 lake for free at first. EDIT: Apparently with the exp you earn you can eventually gain the in-game currency and buy the licenses to fish elsewhere. But the exp was updated and nerfed so low that this is an absolute GRINDFEST. And that lake gets old and boring very fast, as well as the .5 lb Bluegill. Also the menus are a mess. If you have the virtual money to buy something it can still be blacked out with no explanation as to why...Multiplayer is NOT implemented at this time.

								Pros:- The graphics for the tackle and other items are well done. When you buy items from the bait shop or pro shop it looks like you're actually purchasing a real item.- The environment graphics aren't perfect but they are nice.- The imposed limit of what you can buy when on a fishing trip is interesting. You are limited to buying small things like extra bait or line but if you need a better rod you have to cancel the trip. It makes planning crucial.Cons:- There are certain combinations of items to catch certain fish, and certain spots to catch them. There is very little variety other than the size, length, or quality (trophy or non-trophy) of the fish once you figure this out.- Bugs and unrealistic physics. Sometimes when you cast you will just drop the line into the water at your feet. I was told by many other players that they experienced this bug. If you yank a fish out of the water sometimes it will send it into this ridiculous orbital spin where it goes sailing around your body. I ended up not having to struggle with fish anymore because I would yank them from the depths of the river and they would go flying into the sky and right up on the riverbank where I could just reel them in as they sat there.- Two forms of currency. A lot of items in the game can only be bought with gold. You can earn it without any form of micro-transaction but it just doesn't make sense. When did you ever go into a Bass Pro shop and try to buy something with gold coins? These aren't always things like special rods or reels...they are consumables like grasshoppers...- No weather effects.- Poor day and ""night"" cycle.- There really is no multiplayer in this game. You fish by yourself and you can chat with other players but you never see them in-game.-  Extremely limited by fishing locations. You can only travel the space of about 20 feet along a bank or dock to change where you fish. You won't be finding any secret fishing holes. Part of the fun of fishing is exploring and finding your own spot.			"

So the grinding is honestly enjoyable. Theres the thrill of catching trophy or unique fish which keeps me going. This also makes you lvl up quickly. If you do decide to go premium, you get a 50% exp boost  which is not a game changer so this game is definitely NOT pay to win. Also I'm not sure why but the loading screen is a little long when you're opening the game but not like 1 min long so be a little patient.			"

								I will honestly say this is a great game. Very relaxing and pretty realistic, me and my friends just hop on skype and play this and listen to music lol. The only thing is that I was a little disappointed with the ""multiplayer"" chatbox, but it looks like they are going to expand on that in the future. The devs are great they seem very responsive on the forums and looks like their working hard. If this is what this game is like in early access, I cannot wait to see whats coming. I'll give this game a 4.5/5!			"

								This makes me happy. Way more happy than most games I currently own. Sure its not for everyone, but few things are. It helps to know a lot about fishing and tackle going into the game, as the tutorial teaches you almost nothing. You will want to have a decent PC to fully enjoy this game's beauty. I would love to see better textures/clarity on the actual fish you catch but thats minor, as you only see the fish for a few seconds while deciding to keep or release.  Its slow going to get to level 3 where more gear becomes available. Wish I could turn the birds chirping down or off or maybe they could just make them chirpy at dusk and dawn. No bug spray required. Can still drink beer to your hearts content in your own home while fishin for some bass.9/10 as a Fishing simulator......Cant really compare this game fairly to any AAA titles out. Or even to most games. Its in a class of its own.			"

								Fishing Planet was a good romp for a while. The grind set in pretty hard after Colorado however. Even with recent XP bumps, there didn't seem to be any reason to visit the next area. North Carolina had more spots for snags, less XP, and generally less progression than Colorado. So you're faced with the prospect of grinding out three+ levels of trout instead of feeling like you're getting somewhere by moving on to the next area. I skipped the (somewhat miserable) New York area entirely after a couple of trial runs there.But if you can ignore the grins and stick to the starter area and Colorado, you'll see what a beautiful, relaxing game it is. You can certainly kill some time and drink a few beers, maybe even kindle your interest in real life fishing. But unless there is vast improvement in the progression, don't let it become a major time sink. Just enjoy the good stuff, and hope the bad areas get better.			"

								If you like the old school fishing games you'll be in for a treat with this game. Keep in mind as of this review it is still a beta. So far, I have made it up to level 4 and it has taken a bit of time, but being a fisherman myself in real life the leveling hasn't felt unrealistic.  Going out and not catching a fish for a period time can and does happen and while I can't sit down and play this game for a very long period of time I do find it enjoyable and even relaxing to a certain extent.The game overall I can recommend, but if you come into it expecting a super-exciting fast-paced game this is not for you. If do however enjoy fishing and want a simulator that is fairly close to the experience give this a try I don't think you'll be disappointed.   "

So bring your best fishing knowledge and maybe a buddy or two with you.  I am only level 8 and I can tell if I want to compete for prize fish !!  I better bring my A game !! If the game turns out to be as good as I think it can be, you better get it while the price is good!!  See you at the lake !!!			"

								I love this game.  The fact that it's still early Access is very exciting to me because as good as it is now it will only get better.  For those of you scared off by the thought of spending money on a free to play game rest easy.  If you never spend any real money your gamming experience will not suffer.  As of right now the only thing you can purchase is more in game money which is easily earned by catching fish in game.  If you like you can buy a membership that comes with a small xp boost but that really just speeds up the game.  If your not in a hurry to level up or buy gear you can play for free and have the same experience as those that choose to pay.			"

								At this time, I feel that this is a freemium game that requires paying to enjoy, and the price seems quite high to be honest.  I normally like to support devs that are working hard on making an awesome game; however, for a reasonable price.  It is not for casual players, unless you don't mind fishing at a single lake that my circle has begun calling noob lake.  Everyone in the game is now from Texas, and that is the only lake you can reasonably fish until you are at least level 16 when you can get decent sized nets.I have calculated the cost of going to the next level location, which is Missouri, and it takes a minimum of ~20 lbs of the most profitible fish in the area, large mouth bass to break even, but only if you spend baitcoin (the in-game premium currency) to get an advanced license permanently.  The good thing is you can earn some baitcoin through achievements, leveling, and by logging in every day for a bonus (every 5 gives 1 baitcoin).  So getting these licenses is not impossible, just takes a loooong time if you want to stay free.If you have plenty of time to grind fishing noob lake, then go for it.  If you really like fishing, get bored easily in the same spot, but don't have a lot of time to play (like me), then stay away.  If you are a hard-core fishing nut and don't mind paying quite a bit of real-world money to do whatever you want to do, then this game is for you.			"

								If you want a fishing game this is the only one you need. People complaining about grinding? It's fishing, it's fun and it takes patience and getting to know what the fish like. You'll be able to start catching fish right away without that, but if you really want to be able to catch the a trophy or catch a unique fish then you'll need to do your homework.The community is very friendly and willing to help you out regardless of your knowledge of the game and it's the first online community that has been able to elicited a smile during the hours of playing over the last few days. If you don't have a little patience or a little drive to try and figure the fish out then the game isn't for you. All the information is pretty easily available and there are plenty of guides on the steam forum and within the game itself if you ever get stuck. The gear choice is a little overwhelming at first, but you pick it up quickly.			"

								So .. after i played this game for 3 days i'll stop playin it.Why?I am at level 9, got some new equipment and was an the third lake which i was able to fish on.I cant tell what kind of fish i got there but after an ~20min fight i got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥The fish never come closer than 20m and if he was an 20m he went straight back up to 40-60m, than it took a while to get him back to 30m, than he want back up to 50m and so on.Meanwhile my equipment went down from ~88% to 40%.I dont know what kind of fish that was, maybe an whale or something like that but i wasnt able to land it.I guess my level is simply to low so the game doesnt allow me to catch bigger fishes.That guessing fits into the pay2win method which the publisher seems to work with.Anyway ... first f2p which i delete cause its simply not possible to catch bigger fishes while at an lower player level.Dont play it if you dont like to waste your time with big catches which you can land anyway ...

								So far a very promising game. There is a lot of potential here and the devs claim to have realism at the fore-front of their minds. Realistic game that will get you addicted quickly. Once these future updates come out this will be a game for veterans and players new to fishing alike.  It should be noted that there is a lot that needs to be tweaked, fixed, changed, added to and so on. This game is still Early Access and is only a small representation of what they are planning on doing with the game as updates start to roll out. Please be patient and check back often for updates.  It's too early to start listing pros and cons due to the amount of changes that will be taking place. Everyone has their own opinions, instead of reading what others think check it out for yourself. In this case you more than likely won't regret it. So far overall great game. High attention to detail and realism. Will only get more so by a large amount in time. Enjoy. :D			"

								This game presents a good concept, is a realistic simulator, but with many bugs and a bad support.  Title Fishing Planet   Developer Fishing Planet LLC.   Publisher Fishing Planet LLC.  Release 11 August 2015  Graphics 3D   Genre Fishing Simulator  Price Free-to-play  Rating  4/10 The game.Fishing Planet is a sportsfish simulator that places players at various locations across the United States. Cast your line and catch a huge variety of fish, using an assortment of equipment in a soothing, realistic experience.Gameplay.There are 32 fish species, a huge assortment of fish swim in the waters of Fishing Planet, from catfish to pike.There are 7 locations. You can travel across North America and fish in varied environments, taking advantage of weather conditions to reap the largest number of fish you can.The equipment seems unrealistic. Is the equipment designed to wear off? Great idea to spend money. It was the worst update that could have come out.One aspect that I really enjoyed it was the relaxing atmosphere. While you fishing, you are involved in a soothing and relaxing atmosphere.This game crashes for no reason all the time, it's frustrating. And sometimes, your basket of fish will be empty for no reason and will not give credit for what you have worked for, on a crash.If it's of your interest, there is another known fishing simulator-game: Euro Fishing.Bad support of developers(?)Well, I saw some answers of the developers to some negative reviews of players with so many hours and...I was stunned.  The idea with which I was stayed is that developers don't want to know about the community, at all. They still give you bans, and bad answers. Amazing.No, for me this doesn't work.Pros. (+)Concept.Relaxing atmosphere.Decent graphics.Cons. (-)Basic bugs.Menu crashed a lot of times; you basically are forced to quit playing over a half hour, every hour. Ridiculous.Developers.Sad, because the game has potential. But even the best game ever can't develop without a good support.			"

								Alright im gonna make this review quite short at the moment because i haven't really got that far into the game when i write this. First and formost i gotta say.. Wow.. This game.. If you fish in real life and love it this game will pull you in and keep you playing! This is one of the most realistic and fun fishing games ive played in a LOOOOONG time. You actually gotta use real tactics, use the right lure/bait, right rod, line and depth. This is not some arcade game where you just throw out a lure or a bobber with some bait and just catch fish.. But that's the best part in my opinion :)Many of you that has seen theHunter for example on steam might think ""oh is this one of those games where you have to pay real money for licenses (Yes there are licenses in this game but ALL of em can be bought with ingame cash even unlimited ones so you don't have to keep paying every time you wanna fish. And keep in mind if you buy a license for  example 1 day it will actually last for 24 in real life hours)For now this is a wellcrafted, fun and very realistic fishing game with ALOT of potential to be one of the best ones out there. With more updates coming (boats, saltwater fishing more lures, baits and fish) this game will keep me busy for a very long time :) And don't let the bluegill ""farming"" let you down in the begining :P It really opens up after level 3. Bass fishing is extremly fun! :D I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves fishing :) A big thanks to the devs for their hard work trying to keep the servers stable and pushing updates at the same time :)			"

								One of the best fishing simulators out there. That said it does not have much to compete with, to top it off its free to play so I can say without a doubt Fishing Planet is the best fishing simulator I have ever played. Its also the only one I have ever played on PC so you best try it yourself.			"

								Realistic fishing at it's best!  You don't have to buy a thing! and you can literally turn off the hud and it feels like your actually there fishing.  The controls are super easy to use and the control you have over your rod and reel is exactly like you would expect from fishing in real life.			"

								This game has serious bugs.  It runs badly at the best of times.  It is also extremely difficult to enjoy the more interesting places in the game unless you spend cash on content.  I don't have a problem with spending on a game, but not when it has this many flaws.  Bugs are a very serious and legit problem issue with game play.  Expect to have to close and reload this game multiple times while playing.With all the bad, the game has serious potential.  I have been waiting for a legit fishing game for a long, long time.  This almost gets it.  Probably the best I've seen for incorporating action in the bait.  Most fishing sims before just were a straight retrieve more or less.  Others were also too arcade like.  I think that is what disappoints most.  They have all the elements, just failed to put the pieces together right.			"

With great regularity improvements and enhancements are implemented. Real-time digital fishermen will relive the relatiteit in this game. In addition, accurate and expert panel is behind the scenes available to answer any faults, problems and questions in a professional way. I as a user recommend this game for the full 100%. I myself have already spent some hours, and I will continue to do so after in the future.For the developers, keep up the GOOD work !!!!			"

								Before Sept 15 2015 I would have said everyone needs to play this game. but after there last patch, well they broke the game. no longer are you able to level up properly, no longer are you able to make any currency needed to fish other spots.they over engineered the game to be to life like, ( sitting for a long time not catching anything is not fun.) If I want that I will go to my local lake and spend the day there, not on a computor.Now heres the best part, ALL the egomaniacs that got to full level before the patch, Now what the Deves to make the game haeder to play. thats right it it harder to catch fish, make currency, get leveled. see thier already on top, and don't want anyone else there. Would I recommend this game, maybe. if you have money burnng a hole on your pocket or have hours or days to just sit and waist, sure play it. I was going to support this game, but now thinking of deleting and usinfg the HD space fore other things.			"

								As I reeled in what felt like my millionth .4 pound bluegill last night, I realized ""wow, if I were fishing for bluegill in real life with worms right now, I'd sure to be catching more than just them!"" This game has great mechanics as far as the catching of fish, casting lines, watching for a strike, etc..  But the grind as it stands now is just horrible.  In reality, no arbitrary level of experience blocks me from catching different species.  I really wish the game would throw a few line-breaking bass, pike, and catfish into the mix while you're still in the newbie phase of catching freight train loads full of bluegill.  I also wish it would let you advance beyond bluegill/crappies more quickly, as I'm bored with these two species of fish.  The sizes of fish really don't vary all that much, either.  I'd like to see some 10/12oz bluegill, some trophy pounders, and some itsy-bitsy ones that you have no idea how they took the bait in the first place.Other than that, I am definitely excited for the future.  This is an early access game, and a free-to-play one at that.			"

								easily one of the most realistic fishing games, i personally have ever played, i think it's a great game...time passes by faster than you'd expect when playing this game...For the scrubs who yell out p2w...well they see a pay shop and start the QQ becasue they're poor, this game is play to win, pay for convience if you don't want to put in the time to level and expeirence the game...it's a fishing game though as you level you earn in game currency as well as some of the shop currency to buy the extra good stuff, although im saving all that up and still doing just fine.  Like IRL you have to have patience and enjoy the soothing sounds of nature 10/10 will play 6 hours again tomorrow			"

								Still in it's infantcy but extremely fun! Don't think it's a point, click, wait for fish, click again, done, you caught a fish. There is real stratagy involved. I was pulling in 0.4 lbs bluegill one after the other until I was blue in the gills. Then a fellow fisherman just down the shore privied me to some tips on how to catch different fish and the very next catch I made was a Young Trophy Bass. Just like real life, you have to out smart the fish, have gobs of patients and simply enjoy fishing. If you can meet that criteria then Fishing Planet is the next best thing to literally going fishing.			"

								I've played a bunch of steam games, never done a review before. This game however is worth my time to say all the nice things I can about it. Graphics are great, game play is fun and intuitive, keeps me coming back. Very enjoyable community thus far. Imersive enviroments. All good games, in my opinion have leveling systems and an inventory, gain 2 types of currency from catching your fish in addtion to experence. Yep, that's awesome. As far as the inventory system...  well you get a ""backpack""(i.e., vests, rod cases, tackle boxes) full of tackle and rods as well as a garage at home that you can fill floor to cieling with everything from the shop. Tons of options for tackle,rod,reel setups and they are not even close to being done releasing gear... So yes...  Fishing Planet is amazing, travel the country and catch fish with us. This game is a complete gem, and the devs are doing an amazing job polishing it. If you like fishing, have an interest in fishing, ever been fishing..... PLAY THIS GAME.			"

Newbie Review: Fishing PlanetHello everyone! This is my first review ever for a game on Steam, and I do intend to get better at it as I continue reviewing my favorite games, so don't be too harsh on me, OK? WARNING: A lot of text ahead! Please skip to TL;DR if you're not into this kind of reviews.This game popped up on Steam, and my first thought was ""A Free-to-Play fishing MMO? What's that?"". This game was free to download so I decided to give it a try. This game is in Early Access  so many features are absent at the moment but the core gameplay and the main mechanics of the game are absolutely clearly visible and I like them a great deal already. The game has a small but concise and precise tutorial, and a hint system was added recently so anyone new to the game in particular or to the genre as a whole will have a decent possibility to dive right in without any significant problems. In my first 30 minutes or so of gameplay, I realized that getting experience and unlocking new equipment was quite hard and similar to a grind of some kind, but the developers are constantly working on the game and they did improve the experience gain system, leveling up become easier even without a premium account (I hadn't put any money into this game up to this point and I think it won't be necessary at any point in the near future, and this I also like a great deal). This game does require a little bit of fishing knowledge to get the full experience out of it. However, this doesn't mean you have to be a fishing expert to play this game properly. I went fishing (IRL, I mean) a couple of times so I have some basic information about where to search for fish, what bait to use and so on. So, from a casual gamer and a newbie fisherman standpoint, this game is quite easy to understand, very chill and relaxing (awesome graphics and sound effects do get the work of chilling you out done quite nicely), and of course it is reasonably entertaining. As of the moment of this review being posted, there are no multiplayer components in this game aside from the chat (which, to be frank, I haven't even used yet), but it doesn't take a lot from the game in its current status.As of right now, this is more of an enjoyable single-player fishing sim than an MMO, but the game is still quite good. Controls in this game are quite intuitive and also there is a full key binding map available if you press F1 in-game.I have very little to say about the negative aspects of this game, but there are some nonetheless. First and foremost, you have a limited amount of fish you can catch and carry away (in other words, your storage capacity is limited, just like IRL), but there is no clear indication  on the interface itself of whether you have storage capacity left or not. You have to go to your inventory and check that from time to time. In my opinion, it would be more comfortable to see your storage capacity indicated, for example, in the left hand bottom corner of the screen. The second  annoying thing in this game is that your hook may get stuck, the popup says you can free the hook, but out of 10 cases of being stuck I didn't manage to get my hook back. It's either an annoying bug or my hands just being not straight enough (which is indeed a possibility when it comes to gaming).Now, I quit this extensive babbling, and get straight to the TL;DR SectionTL;DRPros:- awesome sound and graphics- intuitive controls- relaxing gameplay- true F2P, very few premium items- constant improvements in the gameCons (those will hopefully get fixed)- no multiplayer just yet- your hook often gets stuck and you have to cut the line most of the time- no indication of spare storage capacity directly on the HUD, it may be usefulDo I recommend this game? If you are into fishing or fishing simulators and want to relax a little bit, then give this game a try right now. You will need to play about 15 to 30 minutes after you have completed the tutorial to make your mind about this game in its current state. Bear in mind that it will get updated. And I also may need to update my review if the devs introduce some major changes (which they hopefully will).P.S. If you have time and desire to do so, please give your feedback on what I need to do in order to improve my reviews. Healthy and reasonable criticism is also very much accepted. ))			"

								There is a bug which when you are traveling that makes the game load for a while and nothing will happen, and if you restart the game it will work but all your money you spent on the travel will be gone and you are still in the main meny.This makes it (atleast for me) impossible to travel since I don't have any money.

								This is a pretty fun fishing game.  Can be a bit grindy, but it's enjoyable and relaxing.  If you're looking for a chill experience in a game of skill, this one is for you.Graphically it's pretty decent.  I don't have any issues with it on my machine, and find it faily bug free for the time being.  You get the odd lag spike every now and again, but other than that I haven't noticed anything game-breaking.A few things I'd like to see:Additional Weather Effects.  Rain would be a nice addition.  Wind would also be a good simulation addition to add to the challenge of placing your cast.Better social aspects.  Friends lists would be cool.  A guild system (fishing clubs?).  A slighty improved interface for going over your equipment.  It'd be nice to easily compare items to one another on mouse-over...like a hover box when you look at something in your inventory to compare to what you have currently equipped.  That's my two cents for now.  Back to the water for me.			"

								Pros:  Most realistic fishing game to date.  Think ""The Hunter"" but with a higher moisture content.Very active Devs that listen to the community and actually seem passionate about fishing.Wide range of fish from bluegills to bass to pike and everything between.  Muskies in the future.Simple but effective casting/retrieving systemCons:Fish ""hot spots"" are all you need to know, cast same area over and over againGrind - you'll find yourself casting the same spot over and over landing fish over and over to levelLocations limited at this timeMost of those cons should be fixed once they add more locations and boats.  Being limited to a few shore spots at this time really causes a lot of repetition but once you can float around the lake that should make things much more interesting.If you like fishing you will like this game.  If you don't like fishing you might find this game boring at its current build but in the near future things look to be really opening up. "

								I had been looking for a good fishing game. When I saw this and saw that it was a free to play game I figured it was not going to be all that good but its FREE so I figured why not I have some extra space on my hard drive. Once I downloaded it and booted it up and started playing I was actually some what blown away by how nice the graphics are. Obviously being early access AKA Beta stages it has some quirks and Minor bugs but over all this game is worth the time downloading it. If you like fishing games you will not want to pass this one up as I believe this might be the best fishing game I myself has ever played!			"

								I once caught a Catfish with just a string, a hook and a bait. So I always wanted to somehow find a Fishing game that's just as simple and realistic as it is. So I played this game. Let's just say in a nutshell:> Catches fish using non F11> Feels like worst fishing casting method ever....> Asks silent fishermen in the area.(You can't see them around but they are fishing invisible to you actually).> Random fisherman tells me to press F11.> F11 allows me to throw max or control where I throw the bait/lure to.> Was grateful as f**k because game turned to Game Of The Year Edition for Fishing.> Then asked where to fish other kind of fish(Since I always got nub fish)> Random Fisherman told me step by step on how.> So I followed and I got my 1st catfish by using just Bread.>After getting a 3.4lb Catfish, I (Accidentally) bragged I can't keep it, since its too big for my fish keeping tool. Random Fisherman says, 'Nevermind, still nice catch!' ""Laughed Internally"" > Later on, suddenly we talked about MLG Fishing while waiting for my bait to get bite. We talked about 360noaimcasting 2ez and I actually tried 360 casting like a pro and got a fish from it(took some time still).>LATER ON, We talked about DLC in a good way. Someone suggested if they can have a radio, but there's already Steam Music Player lol. I recommend an announcer DLC where if someone is fishing something big they'll go announce it like how a sports announcer does in an exaggerated way. However other people suggests even more ridiculous DLC ideas. Well.....what can I say? It's a simple, calm, fishing game, that takes some knowledge(Well after you look at some guide or yt vids that is), and patience by the shore, encompanied by some noises near the river bank, like small critters like crickets and bees, near your ear with the sound of the river flowing and mists and daylight transitions. 13.5lb/10lb will fish this amount of fish again every day. Hope someday I can fish a shark or megalodon in a DLC.			"

However, with the magic of digital money, one-touch shopping, time-advancement technology, unlimited supply of fish and the serenity of nature, void of rednecks and loud ""pro-anglers"", fishing is pretty fun. Gets grindy after awhile from fishing the same fish at the same spot, and really i started to miss human connection in this game. Sometimes I fish, not for the sport of it but I fish because I need someone to accompany me, you know? Im really lonely in there			"

								On the surface, the game is superb. It has great mechanics, lots of content and good features for competition, highscores, etc. If it can sort out the technical issues, it will be miles ahead of the competition. As it is now, it's a really high potential, high frustration experience.The server issues are the most frustrating. Inventory items disappearing- or not appearing in the first place, scores not registering all seem very common. Since the community is built around these features, it's just not working right now. These are also the kind of things you won't really notice until you've already invested a lot of hours in the game. The game is relatively new on Steam, yes. But as I looked through forums, it seems players have been reporting the same issues now for a couple of years. If it takes a couple of more years to fix the infrastructure, the game will be dead or another game will take its place. Which would be a great shame.The monetization is very hardcore. The server is unstable. The game itself is great, but turns more and more painful the longer you play it. Hope it will change.			"

They've increased the prices of bait and lures while also removing the option to buy certain items with in-game money.

								After more than 500 hrs of play, i must say that this is a pretty good fishing game. Graphics are great . Fishes look awesome. Water is close to real .Mechanics are good too. Considering that this game is still in testing and not even born yet, we might have a real gem by the end .All the contents is free , unless you want to buy some premium account to level faster.

								I've played almost every fishing game ever.Fishing Planet = 9/10. Will surely be the best fishing game available once they add everything else, boats, kayaks, new locations, tournaments, etc.This game is for true simulation/realism lovers. You hear the grass, trees, just the right bugs, the water, your rod and reel, wind, air, nothing else. Reminds me of heading out to Granny and Poppies old farm house, catching grasshoppers and fishing the pond, or fishing under the bridge out by Snow Hill Road for bass and catfish with my buddies. I really miss bass fishing back home, this game gives me my fix! I have played almost every fishing game ever created. I'm a die hard. This one is by far the best. Not for arcade fishing lovers. This is the real simulation of fishing.			"

								Fishing Planet is a fishing simulation sport game, where you play as a fisher and buying licenses to different regions and catching different fishes, either SP, MP or co-op cross platforms.First of all, the game spare you the smell of fish, and secondly you get the game for free. The game offers a perfect overview of a fishing experience while thinking about life. The game starts to throw you through a tortorial, how to fish, what kind of bait to use and many other advanced fishing techniques.You will have a inventory as player, where you can move around the fishing spots or travel by plane to find and catch better fish at better locations. You have the option to change time according to best time of catching fishes etc. When you catch a fish you can either release it or keep it to gain a reward. The reward is being used to buy better bait and other equipment. You do have a option to buy ingame cash for real time money, to get better equipment to catch better and bigger fishes.For a free game, with a bunch of DLC's, the game offers a great fishing simulation sport game for those who loves fishing or wishes to learn about it. So if you are sitting with a fisher feeling in your stomach and want to learn something or relax in your home and run away from the fish smell, then this game is for you. Here is a demo:

								Very relaxing, fun to play, interesting and helpful people! Indeed, it's a lot of fun just to fire it up on occasion and relax and just fish. I never spent a single dollar on this game and it was and is still a load of fun. Worth the download in my opinion, you can buy just about everything if you are diligent and continue to play. My suggestion is to go after Catfish and Bass as early as you can, they offer a nice pot of money and they are worth catching more than the smaller fish.			"

								This is probably the single most greatest achievement in my life. I have never played a more perfect game. To the way you cast, to the astmosphere, this game has it all. The world looks beautiful as I stand by the water casting my line, and then I get a bite! I reel it in a little, let it pull, and then pull it out of the water! I've never experienced anything like it before! There is even a multiplayer part to the game! You can fish with all of your friends! As you all fish in the same area you can see what everyone else is catching around you! My friends and I all had a blast sitting here one rainy night, all fishing together. It was a great experience and I hope that everyone else comes and joins us too! And if that wasn't enough to get you to get this game, then perhaps me saying that its free will get you to come and try it out! Plus the game is super easy to get into! Even those that don't like fishing can simply walk around the beautifullly constructed world. I can't wait to see you all down by the pond!			"

								I really want this game to be good. I understand it is in EA, so I'm hoping the problems get ironed out. It needs a modern video settings menu. Because this game with awesome HD textures maxed out would be beautiful! Also there may be some stability issues, I had 2 crashed in my time playing the game so far. Controls are surprisingly intuitive. Make the fixes, and when you are ready to sell this game, don't do freemium. The market for this game is going to be mainly people who love to fish, you won't pull in non-outdoorsy people to play this. Make it great, and I'd bet it would do well at $30.  "

Eurotruck FishingSo after tackling few days with the infinite loading screen and getting a helpfull tip to turn off my firewall, i decided to try and add the game to my Allowed list and it worked! so i was finally able to get ingame.Now i been playing few fishing games here and there since the 90s and i quite weirdly enjoy random fishing game moments and was hoping ""Fishing planet"" would give me an good experience and it sure didGood:+ Fancy graphics (The game sure is an eyecandy)+ Crazy selection of equipment (i was blown away how much fishing stuff you can buy from lures to rods to hooks... it clearly shows the developers passion to fishing)+ Relaxin (its oddly nice to just sit on a pier and wait for the fish to start nippling on your baits)Bad:-No music during gameplay (this really isint a downside since the natural sounds of birds is kind of relaxing but i would hope in the future there would be a choise for somekind of FM radio to listen random songs and/or proadcasts while spending quality time on fishing)For anyone that is looking for fishing game or just to relax and spend time i can highly recommend this.

								This game is butieful and is gr8 for the players who like to screanshot as I myself like to take screanshots. The buy menue is getting larger every update and the species of fish increase aswell and dont get put off the fact that at level 2 you are only catching Bluegill and White Crappies as when you reach level 3 you can larger and more harder to real in fish such as Bass and Catfish.Give this game a chance as this is the most fun I have had in a fishing game and I have played a few!

								This is a really fun game. I enjoyed playing it until the other day. Something happened in the game and I lost 5000 dollars due to a game error (nothing that I did). I know this isn't a fully released game, and I expect this kind of stuff to happen. So I emailed support and told them of the issue that I was facing, they replied blaming it on me, and didn't do anything to resolve the issue. I wouldn't recommend this game.			"

Baits drastically increased in price.Amount of online players, low. +-1.450 as i am righting thisIt takes days and days to break even on your trips as non premium player, even when going after more expensive fish like trout and bass. I have to say that the game is very enjoyable to play, it looks nice too, only the economic inflation is too extreme.Sadly unistalling. "

								At one point I supported this game. I even bought the DLC for it. Recently they actually removed DLC items from players accounts replacing it with inferior items claiming balance issues. They have added cooldown timers which effect players that are even playing with a premium account. They want you to buy baitcoin to bypass this timer. Shouldn't premium time in the game bypass this?The best lures are now locked behind a paywall of baitcoin with no real way to earn baitcoins in game.Went from a decent fishing simulator to a real life work-out for your credit card. Don't believe me just check out the DLC it's priced the same as a AAA game.Update: January, 19th, 2017.     Now the devs are having the mods deleting any negative threads or posts on the forums.This shows that they are aware they are in the wrong and are trying to purge the forums of any of their wrong-doing. I'm just glad that they can not delete reviews. If you do try the game I would strongly advise against giving this developer any money. They sold us DLC then ripped us off.			"

								At first, my thoughts were ""why on earth am I playing a fishing game when I don't even like fishing?"". However, I quickly began to realise that the people who play this game are all really nice and they all seem to contribute to the fun, relaxing atmosphere of the game. In my opinion, Fishing Planet has a lot of potential, perhaps as a game perhaps aimed at an older audience, and could even attract people who are inexperienced in fishing, such as myself, by going into more detail in explanations and tutorials, etc. Overall, I'd say give it a try if you want a relaxing and peaceful experience, and if it's not your thing then just uninstall it.

SummaryFree to play but works best with a quite expensive premium account. As a simulation it's quite amazing with different types of fish having different habits, preferring different baits, and each kind can vary greatly in size. You really need to plan your approach and know your trade to be succesful. Definitely not that easy to learn and pretty hard to master. I can easily recommend this one, if you are prepared to buy premium, at least in the beginning, to level up a bit and have more fish to choose from.Pros1. It's free so you can check it out for yourself. 2. There are many different kinds of fish, including normal, young, trophy, and unique variants. Each fish has its habits and preferences so you can't use the same approach all the time, you must really tailor it accordingly.3. While premium account really helps a lot, it is not a requirement as there is no way to simply buy levels or high-level equipment without hard work. Premium speeds it up significantly, but if you are patient enough, you will achieve the same thing. The main hindrance of not having premium account is cash - you really need to make your stay in each state profitable and this is much harder without premium account and lower prices for fish that you catch, especially on lower levels. 4. Graphics are pretty good.5. Community is really friendly and other players can tell you how they are so succesful using in-game chat. I have not encountered even one instance of real rudeness. 6. There is a lot of gear to choose from allowing a lot of customization. 7. You can always check which fish are available at each lake, along with what to catch them with.8. There are a lot of decent guides on Steam and YouTube so you can learn the ropes without too much trouble. 9. The game is pretty stable and I haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs. 10. I love the travelling system. You can't just go anywhere you please, you have your home state, and each trip costs some money - you really need to plan them well to make them profitable, especially at lower levels. 11. You can still catch quite a lot of fish, contrary to most reviews here, it just takes skill and luck. I can catch 35 lbs of catfish in about 15 minutes, although I never really counted it, and I don't have a very high level, nor DLC or baitcoin gear. Cons1. There are some graphical glitches, like people warping across the lake, but nothing annoying. 2. Premium account is pretty expensive.3. Rooms are small, I would love to play with more other people, exchanging experiences and competing. 4. Weather changes are definitely not subtle. Note - I do have a premium account, I bought baitcoins once, and own no DLCs.			"

								While the beginning is pretty boring what with catching Bluegills and all, it's worth it to get to level three so you can start using lures.  Bass and Catfish are possible at level 2, but you'll probably catch more Bluegills than anything.  Once you get some spoons and jigs, the real fun begins and levelling goes much faster from there.  I sat down with a six pack of beer and before I knew it a couple hours had passed and I was out of beer.I like that the game tries to teach you proper fishing techniques, which you can then apply to real world fishing.  I've learned a few things and will try them out next time I get on a boat because shore fishing in my area is pretty poor.  Overall it's a great game with lots of potential.			"

								I'm an angler in real life and I play games as well, so I can review this game from both perspectives.As a fishing sim: this sucks balls-the listed species for each fishing location lie; there are only 6 species shown when there may be more and it says, for example, ""pike"" or ""trout"" instead of the actual species like ""grass pickerel"" (which is a member of the ""esox"", or pike, family)-getting snagged in this game is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Once you get snagged, often for no reason, the hook is stuck forever and the only way to retrieve it is to turn up your drag and yank repeatedly until the hook comes out. 9/10 times the line breaks and you lose line and a lure.-this is a free-to-play game that has a leveling system and premium currency.  That means a lure you want requires real money to get (just use that money to get an actual lure and go fishing) and you can't fish for what you want to fish for since 1. some of the starting map's fish and all other fish from other lakes require a ""license"" that costs money and 2. equipment required to catch fish may be unavailable until you reach a certain level.  I guess this is a simulator because you literally pay for lures, line, rods, reels, bait, and everything else you could fish with in real life.-fishing, in real life, is rarely consistent.  Fish will change feeding habits and locations without warning.  Then why does fishing planet have tutorials where you can catch fish in the same spot again and again?As a game? Hmm....-as i said before, the free-to-play model is♥♥♥♥♥♥and I don't want to give them money.  TheHunter, a game with a similar business model, is actually good with this and I gladly give them my money.  For some reason, it has worse reviews due to the free-to-play model.  That makes zero sense.-The gameplay mechanics are broken.  Fishing in real life is more exciting.-Say you have the license to fish for something you'd want to catch...There is NO information how to fish for species.  NONE.  You have to google it just to know where exactly to cast and what bait to use.Plus, it sounds like they are banning people with negative things to say on forums? I haven't experienced this but it sounds shady.quit this and play TheHunter or better yet,  The Witcher 3. That game is dope.  0/10			"

								Firstly, let me clear something up, I am not a fan of fishing in real life or in a game. However, that does not mean I have not enjoyed the good things this game has had to offer, and it was surprising that I have enjoyed the game as much as I have.Pros:-The game has a very relaxing atmosphere, beautiful environment and great gear and fish to experience in different weather, along with a satisfactory amount of locations (would like to see more though, much more)-The battles you have when you finally get a fish on the line can be pretty epic, and the disappointment when you lose one equally as epic and heartbreaking, but enjoyable none the less and a large reason of why the game can be so enjoyable.-Managing your gear setups, and having the right gear for the right fish and situation, really defines this game from a point of view of what makes this a strong game and as close to a simulation as one might imagine of a real life fishing experience in that regard.-Now (last update) you can see your friends fish as they have added the ability to see other people fishing in the same room. Yet to decide how this feature sits with me, but for now it’s been fine.-New Dynamic Fishing system, so you have to go and search out the fish, unlike before where they were static and predictably always in the same locations.-The feeling of when you catch something rare or big, such as a new personal record this can be very exciting. Sadly, these moments become less and less frequent the more you play the game, nevertheless this is something that makes you go back for more.-Helping each other out, friends and even strangers happy to help out with tips and tricks to catch certain types of fish, it is nice that people share information to help each other catch more fish more frequently.Cons:-The Grind, initially you have a reasonably decent progression, and you get new things, get new types of fish, unlock new locations and all seems to be going ok. Then as you level up to higher levels, though not the highest, more like between early and mid-levels. You realize how much of a grind you have ahead of you, just to unlock a new thing like a new area, new gear and new fish types. The grind is brutally painful.-Premium unlike some games where you can earn a premium status, this game requires real money transaction as the only way to get yourself into a premium status. Very Money driven new implementations in last update. And premium people get more game currency and xp rewards, so It makes it less grindy experience if you pay for it. And after every ingame day, the game reminds you of your status as premium or not. Just to let you know how important it is to have premium. This new feature really pisses me off.-Last update has increased the costs of things across the board, while the ratio to earnings was reduced. So the gap was increased. The game was already out of balance in this regard, now it is more so. Coupled with the fact that catching fish is more challenging now, it simply means more grind, for both pay and free players.-""Fast forward time"" while fishing now isn’t just a simple necessary feature, no they decided to try and monetise it by adding a cooldown. So when you fill your bag after a day’s fishing and need/must forward time, you can find yourself waiting around doing nothing for the cooldown to run out because they forgot that if your bag is full you shouldn’t have to wait for a stupid cooldown to go home for the night to come back the next day. And if you do pay to have premium, you don’t even skip the cooldown, you simply reduce the cool down. This feature was incredibly badly thought out and implemented and should be reverted back to how it was.-The new system of lure fishing doesn’t seem to show properly, it was supposed to be fixed, but it still only works randomly. And furthermore to this, some of the other techniques like twitching seem to be broken now, so hopefully they can fix these things. Also the Fishing Rod Physics are now bugged in latest release which also needs fixing. Don't know why they update the game with bugs as clear as this, worked fine prior to update, makes no sense why they would break it and release it broken.-Licenses last a real life day. Instead of a game day. This is so ridiculous. If you only have 30 mins to fish one night, well too bad you pay for a full license. The costs really add up and hurt, the game is not friendly to casual players. It is heavily trying to stimulate long play sessions so that you might actually get some value from your playtime. Otherwise you can find yourself losing money, because of the stacking costs of Licenses. You could basically end up in scenario where you spend 5 or more in real life days fishing just one day in the game, however you have to pay for 5 Days’ worth of Fishing license. Simply makes no sense.-If you make enough money in a day, but don't have enough before going to your trip to cover the costs of the 2nd day, yes you pay to fish in game daily in addition to licenses. The game simply boots you back home, essentially losing the benefit of being out fishing. So even if you made say 10k and have plenty of fish, the game doesn't know to use what you caught to pay for the next day, watch out for this, it is really annoying when it first happens to you. It will simply force you home, even though you made more than enough to cover the costs. The message says ""Stay ended"" your stay on the pond has ended, you don't have enough money to stay longer. But you do, the game is just so badly made, that it won't recognize it. Really infuriating.-Lack of an audio cue for when you need to strike, (as an optional feature, would be great) because it really can be rather sad at times, that I have to sit there staring at a float all day hoping for a bite. Would be nice to be able to look at something else and have an audio queue when I need to strike and reel in the fish. Visual only cue is a bit limiting of times I’m willing to play the game. As it does take a certain amount of focus, an audio cue would really allow people to do other things while not missing out on catching the fish, because they are forced to stare at the float intently.Summary:Barely Recommending this, the game has its moments and it is free (time is money so the term free is used loosely in this case), so it is worth at least giving it a chance. You can have some relaxing moments and some excitement too all in one, but I do find I have to be in a specific mood to play this and I have to allow enough time to make it worthwhile. If you are into fishing, then It would make sense that you like this game. And if you are not, give it a try, who knows you might learn something, I know I did.			"

								It's so close to being a good game that I wish I could give it a neutral rating instead of a Good or bad rating. The Good: The graphics and physics of the game are well done. The environments look and sound really good, lots of realism and depth. When you catch and reel in a fish it seems like one of the more realistic games I've played. There are a number of places you can fish and a number of species to fish for making it very diverse in the long run for someone that has reached the max level and unlocked / bought all the gear available to them. The Bad:  Your ability to enjoy this game is completely dependant upon your willingness to spend REAL money, and how much you're willing to spend. It's also dependant upon you being able to grind. If all you did was play the free version of the game, it's not enjoyable. It's boring, too much of a grind to ever really be fun. You waste too much in-game currency traveling back and forth between bodies of water as you level up. It also limits the amount of in-game cash you can earn by the size of your stringer, which is expensive to upgrade so it's a catch-22 getting out of low level, boring areas unless you open your REAL wallet and spend REAL money on one or all of the 3 things this game pretty much forces you buy. In game you have 2 currencies: A cash currency and a baitcoin currency. Cash is spent on average gear, baitcoins are spent on high-end gear. Both of the in-game currencies can be farmed by grinding (spending hours fishing while knowing where to fish, what to fish for, and what to fish with), OR you can skip the grind and just use real, hard-earned money to buy the currencies. The cash is cheaper than the baitcoins. Of course, this is how all free-to-play games make their money. For you to enjoy the game at the highest level you'll be spending a fair amount of REAL money on a regular basis. The game baits you into spending money on yet another near-necessity if you plan on playing a lot: A Premium Account!  A premium account allows you to grind through levels (40 of them) at a 50% increased rate over someone that has a regular account. Lets not forget that you also  make in-game cash about 50% quicker. The premium account monthly subscription is $14.99 per month, the cost of a WoW subscription. And then if you plan on bouncing back and forth between lakes fishing for ""fun"" fish and buying ""good"" gear you're going to be burning a hole in your real wallet paying for in-game currencies to make that happen. Why? Because the game charges you THOUSANDS of in-game dollars to travel to a particular body of water, but you cannot recover the thousands you spent in a single trip. So if you leave the lake, with a stringer of, say, $1,000 worth of fish, you have essentially lost money fishing there. How do you recover that money? By fishing the starter lake, which is little more than a pond, for HOURS until you've made enough to afford another trip! Or, <suprise suprise> You can just use your credit card to buy some cash to get out of the little pond in Texas and do some real fishing. Imagine that!  PAY TO WIN ladies and gentlemen. Those who pay to play will leave the average player in the dust and enjoy fishing more bodies of water for more species and sizes of fish. Its just that simple. SERVER DISCONNECTS AND CLIENT FREEZES I just had a server disconnect while reeling in maybe the biggest fish I have ever caught.  In 6 hours of playing I've had more than a few server disconnects and client freezes. It's not my computer. I have a custom gaming PC that I keep updated and CLEAN! I have a 300 Mbps connection, a Nighthawk router, and my NIC is a PCI-E Wireless AC1900 card with 3 high-gain antenna. In almost every game I play my ping is lower than just about everyone I play with and it's rock-solid steady. How this could be better: Stop charging people in-game currency to travel back and forth between bodies of water! I understand, and even like, spending in-game currency on gear. That makes sense to me. But this is a video game. It shouldn't feel like WORK to have to grind out money just so you can go fish where you want to fish.  And also: Fix the server instability issues.

								To start off, the game was great, fun to play but now its horrible.First of all i quit when i was level 15 because of me releasing a fish and for some odd reason it gave me a 1000 dollar fine.Second of all Traveling somewhere in the beginning is practicly useless with out alot of room for fish to be able to earn the money you payed for the trip, even the mudwater river (first place you can go to) you atleast have to be above level ten with tons of money left to even make a small profit of catching catfish or Garthird of all the rods and reels cost a fortune, and the ammount of money you get fined is rediculous when you catch a fish that you need an advanced license for.Also 1 tip for the devs MAKE THE GAME NOT PAY 2 WIN			"

								I have played a bit and I think I understand enough to write a review. Here's the skinny: First off you don't have to pay a dime for anything to enjoy this game. It has, by far, the best payment model of any free to play game i've played. You don't have to spend a dime on anything. Ever. Everything sold as DLC is also sold in the shop. This does not mean that buying DLC is bad. You get some real bonuses for buying DLC. The number one bonus being that if you buy a DLC package then your rod/reel can never fully break. Second most important bonus is that you can repair most of the DLC items with in game credits instead of in game gold. Now, before you trip on the Gold/Cash thing this is where the payment model shines. You can earn gold in game and it's not hard or impossible. Flat out, not a pay to win by any means of the phrase. Gameplay: It is skill based. Also, being good means having knowledge.Last is the community. Nobody will tell you to, ""Die Pleb"" or ""Roll out, Noob."" Everyone is there to help everyone else.			"

Upon during so I learned more about the Dev's and how they have treated deciated players, banning them without reason and such. Based on the user expriences I decided I best not get invovled with this one in fear of becoming another one of those users that get mistreated.  Something worth reading about first before you get in to this one. Turned me off, not the acual game it's self.			"

								I have been pc gaming for 30 years, at least.  Last time I had played a game so addictive was when the first silent hunter came out.  Let me be plain about it.. this is the best game , of any genre , i have played in many years.  Who needs summer with the bugs and heat when you have this? the graphics are awesome, the fishing is extremely realistic, but graduated for newbies, The locations are varied as are the fish at each location. The community in chat is one of the highlights of the game.  I have yet to run in to more than a couple of a holes... everyone helps everyone,,high level to low. ( except in a tourney..lol).  And you NEED them,,, there are many hidden ways and tricks to get high level fish  ( Trophies, and "" Unique"").  Youtube has many videos ( some good, some bad), that can help but i prefer hunting on my own..but sometimes it 's a grind,  But the chat  community is golden, as i said.The only suggestion I have would be to have a guide to at least tell you  how and where to catch a unique or trophy species.. especially for newer players.  Otherwise the only way to find them is if someone tells you the special spot, time of day, and bait to catch tmem with.  But an outstanding game overall... AND ITS EARLY ACCESS!!! truly worth a few bucks for the DL'cs and soe gold and exp, boosts.  Amazing gaming experience!			"

								I can't give this a thumbs up. Too much time at one location before you can venture out (gain experience) unless you pay. Your supplies are very limmited unless you gain experiece or pay. The time it takes to gain a significant amout of experience is just like real fishing. I'd rather spend that amount of time on a game the is more engaging.			"

Not spending money, or owning any of the DLCs does not hinder the game at all.If you enjoy fishing, you'll really going to love this game. It's the next best thing. "

								This game is pretty realistic in terms of fishing mechanics and bait types. The graphics have the potential to be incredible if your computer can handle it. I have a Nvidia Gtx 960 superclocked and it runs the graphics on the best settings pretty well, but obviously if you lower the graphics settings it will run at a higher framerate. It can be a little bit of a grind sometimes to get the higher level items, but it still is fun. Since it is a free game there are micro-transactions, but they are not in your face about it and you can easily play the game without them. If you like fishing you will definitly like this game. If I had to give it a rating I would give it a 8/10 since it is a free game with great graphics and good gameplay.			"

								The best fishing simulator in steam, at least for now.Pros:- Free 2 Play- Realistic (kind of). You'll need basic knowledge about fishing to be good able to play and enjoy this game, every rod and reel feel different and you'll need to match it with certain line, certain bobber, certain hook, certain lure/bait, certain technique and certain time of the day to land certain fish successfully (don't forget to buy your fishing license or you'll be fined). So many varieties, at first you'll be overwhelmed by it.- Fishing shop. You'll feel like browsing a real fishing shop website, although to buy something you need to meet the level requirement.Cons- Damage mechanism need more polishing, it's a bit unrealistic- Certain items only available in a limited time DLC- Need more contents (not really a con as it's still in early access)9/10			"

								Fishing planet is a realistic sport fishing simulator that places players on the muddy shores of locations scattered across America. Cast your line into gentle waters and reel in a variety of fish, using patience and practical knowledge to successfully bag them. A huge assortment of gear is available to purchase; customize your loadout to catch particular fish, using the right rods, bait, and line to make the catch. Earn experience from every fishing trip and level up, unlocking new areas of the map, and earning money to purchase more equipment. Catch trophy-sized fish and rise to the top of the leaderboards, showing off your dedication and perseverance.Fishing Planet has amazing graphics. It is still in the 'Early Access' stage on Steam but has a ton of potential to be the best fishing game ever made. It needs better documentation and fine-tuning of game controls, physics, etc. But even though it's not finished yet, it's fun to play. It's free to play, with lots of extras available for optional purchase. No forced underwater views, plenty of real-life fishing spots, a ton of tackle/baits, and a wide variety of fish provide lots of replay value.Fishing Planet Key Features: + 32 Fish Species:  A huge assortment of fish swim in the waters of Fishing Planet, from Catfish to Pike.+ 7 Locations: Travel across North America and fish in varied environments, taking advantage of weather conditions to reap the largest number of fish you can.+ Huge Equipment Loadout: Purchase new gear and equipment to make fishing easier, opening up new opportunities.+ Leaderboards: make the biggest catch and rise to the top of the leaderboards.+ Relaxing Atmosphere: Immerse yourself in a soothing atmosphere and relax while fishing.Pros: +Realistic simulator +Large customization options +In-depth parameter choicesCons: -Long load times-Lackluster tutorial-Some random crashesMy Rating - ""Good"" Traditional Rating - 6.5/10Try it out as its free to play on steam.

								Going straight to the point.ProsThe simulation is extremely real;The array of equipment is pretty vast;It is totally free to play;The graphics and the sounds are really detailed;Fishing feels very rewarding;Fine progression;Really fun, for those who like fishing, to play.ConsThe game only teaches you how to play with floating rods (there are other equipment which you need to learn by yourself and the game doesn't give you a single tip on what it does or how to use it);Some items on store need a specific kind of reel and the game doesn't tell you when it is needed;Frame desynchronization problems;If you lag, or your connection with the game stops, or if the server stops, there's no message telling you that it happened (when the connection is offline fishes don't come for the bait/lure);If you run out of virtual money you'll have to buy it with real money;Some lures can't be attached to certain rods and the game doesn't tell which ones.In general, the game is damn good, if you like fishing simulators or fishing you MUST play it. Wouldn't suggest spending real money on its beta current state because it feels very defective for a beta test, once things get solved and corrected I think the game will have great value. "

								I can't get this to work.  I installed and reinstalled it two times.  It keeps crashing on the account create page.  I have a socket 2011 v3 i7 5820K, 32gb of 2666mhz ddr4 ram, 500gb ssd boot drive, two 3 tb sata drives in stripe raid for data.   Plenty enough to run this.  Also a GTX 980 SC video card.  Windows 10 Enterprise Edition.I did not get to play it so I can't really reveiw it properly.EDIT:I got it to work.  I had to uninstall all the nvidia drivers and nvidia expierience  etc...  all nvidia programs in my programs list.  Then rebooted and ran CCleaner and deleted all the nvidia remains.  Then redownloaded and reinstalled the latest driver.  Removed Nvidia Geforce Expierience and the Nvidia Sound Driver.  Now the game works fine on high settings.  I played for a while and it seems ok for early access.  I will test it out more.			"

								Excellent game with nice 3D looking graphics. Catching a fish is like catching one in real life and it is amazing. It did take some time to level up and travel to different citites but it's so fun that time would just fly by. Definitely a must have game!			"

								Fishing planet is probably the best fishing simulator ive ever played also i haven't encountered any lag at all and the game it looks so good with its nice graphics and nice sound effects also you have to be quite patient with the game which is also nice that you can sit back and relax because you only really need one hand and thats on your mouse so if your looking for a nice slow game I would give this a shot.      10/10 would catch a fish again			"

								Well as fishing games go this a good looking game. But I have a few probs with it.1. It takes way 2 long to rank up.2. The fish need 2 be more random I keept getting the same fish for 3 hours and I used diffrent baite and hooks.I think this game still has allote of work to make it better. Can't waite to see what happens.			"

								As a person who actively fishes in real life, i can confidently say that Fishing Planet is the closest you will get to fishing without going outside. Easily one of the best Early Access titles out there. It is a little bare on the diversity of fish species, but those will come with time. Even if you are usually turned off by the tag of Early Access, this is a free to play game and well worth a try. Also, probably one of the most relaxing games i have ever played in my entire life (no joke).10/10 would drink beer and fish all day			"

Early Access Review
								Honestly, I was skeptical at first having bought into dovetail games fishing and just plain disliking that, but this game was a pleasant suprise. I'm an avid fisherman and haven't been out much this year because I'm a full time college student (summer classes too...). This game has scratched that itch and will continue to do so every winter when I just want to be out bass fishing. It's early access, so I assume things will only improve from here on out, but it's a solid game. The graphics are awesome, fighting with a fish seems awesome (except when you yank a small fish out of the water and it flies around you...but it's a laugh at least), and the sheer number of items is impressive. I personally dislike that it's the type of game that deals with in game purchases and such, but the game is totally playable without spending a dime. Getting started until you reach level 3-4 is a bit of a grind, but after then is when the game truly becomes fun. The community is great, I get into discussions about all sorts of things and we help each other with game tips. All in all, it's a great experience and it's a relaxing break from your regular day to day. I definitely recommend this game to any fishing fan.			"

								Best fishing game I've ever played and It's not even a finished product. It's great fun right now to learn new areas and gear. It has a few bugs but at the rate the devs are fixing them I wouldn't say it's something we will need to worry about in the long run. If you like fishing games then you have to give this a chance, it can be a little difficult at first but people in the in-game chat are helpful and there are great guides available. I can't wait to see how the game evolves and grows over time! There is no hint of pay to win at all, I would gladly pay money for the free game!			"

Early Access Review
								Here is my opinion of the game in it's current state. Graphics are really nice the trees are nice and has a nice nature feel to the game. The fishing starting out is a lot of bluegill and crappie. The gameplay mechanics are good except sometimes lag messes you up on fish. I see a lot of complaining about load times. I have not noticed anything abnormal about load times with my system anyway. I have seen a lot about errors and such...again I have not gotten this at all so far. Currently it is bobber fishing if you are after catfish and such however I read that bottom fishing will be added later on. In my honest opinion the price point for premium is a bit expensive for a year. Would be much more reasonable at $60 per year or something equal to what you would pay for each game release that releases on a year to year basis. Premium is not required never the less. But it will certainly take time to level up without it. My main complaint is the size of the trophy fish. They run quite small for most species I have seen. Where I am from a 15lb channel is not out of the realm at all. Bass also seem on the low side of what I would consider a trophy. I do hope this gets rectified in the future.The fish graphics are pretty nice as well!Game is certainly worth playing but will get better in the future. It does have some issues but nothing that can't be dealt with.			"

								In the year 3036 there is only fish. What scattered remnants of man remain claw at a meager existence sucking nourishment from the prelapsarian cousins of the Earth's finned masters. Welcome to Fish Planet, fish or DIE.Pros: Beautiful visuals, good sound. Incredible attention to detail on gear, fish and environment. Fishing rods, reels, and lures play completely differently befitting a ""sim"". True free to play. It's a fishing game.Cons: Early Access means less features right now. Occasional fail to load. Occasional crashes.If you've never played a fishing game or haven't played since Super Black Bass on the SNES. Do yourself a favor and download this game for free. I can't wait for a multiplayer mode where you fish next to your buddies.			"

Early Access Review
								Very customizable even in early access, and looks to be adding a ton more content. Soothing graphics and calming music. Quite realistic and has a lot of game depth. I really enjoy the contrast of this slower paced, zen game compared to a lot of the action packed and hecked clickers in most f2p games. (The other stuff is great too, but sometimes I just wanna calm down a little.) It's also great to play while catching up on Netflix or watching Twitch. There are purchasable in-game items and DLC, but I personally haven't bought any, so I cant really comment on that. The devs have said that there is nothing locked behind pay walls, so it should be pretty fair. Will have to see in later development. My only negative is that the pace is a little slow right now. I seem stuck at rank 2, but that may be becasue 'm just not putting in the hours. Anyways, what is available now is quite good, content is a bit limited for lower levels, but there is at least several hours of good gameplay in there regardless, and I definently find mylsef coming back to it when I just want something quieter to play after a long day. I can't wait for the game to develop and grow.			"

								When I get skunked going out fishing, I come home to this and get my catch for today. As you first start, it will be confusing such as pressing f11 to change it's casting mode so you will be able to cast further and having to quit your current fishing session to equip new equipments from home and then theres your rod setup. You will figure out eventually.			"

								Going straight to the point.ProsThe simulation is extremely real;The array of equipment is pretty vast;It is totally free to play;The graphics and the sounds are really detailed;Fishing feels very rewarding;Fine progression;Really fun, for those who like fishing, to play.ConsThe game only teaches you how to play with floating rods (there are other equipment which you need to learn by yourself and the game doesn't give you a single tip on what it does or how to use it);Some items on store need a specific kind of reel and the game doesn't tell you when it is needed;Frame desynchronization problems;If you lag, or your connection with the game stops, or if the server stops, there's no message telling you that it happened (when the connection is offline fishes don't come for the bait/lure);If you run out of virtual money you'll have to buy it with real money;Some lures can't be attached to certain rods and the game doesn't tell which ones.In general, the game is damn good, if you like fishing simulators or fishing you MUST play it. Wouldn't suggest spending real money on its beta current state because it feels very defective for a beta test, once things get solved and corrected I think the game will have great value. "

There is a lot of literature online if you really wanna get into it. It's a really unique and relaxing experience, 10/10 will fish again.			"

								This game is incredible+Extremely fair F2P model, you really do not need to spend any money to experience every single thing in the game+Devs are very active in the community and respond quickly to bug reports, frequent updates+Already lots of diversity in types of fish, locations, gear, styles of fishing+Different fish require different methods of fishing+Nice and engaging community-Once you figure out how to catch a certain fish it's pretty easy to keep on catching them repeatedly -Tutorial is lacking (Devs said that this is a priority to add upon)I went through the reviews and the majority of negative reviews are coming from people whose PC's cannot run the game, or are TOO ♥♥♥♥ING STUPID TO FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS IN THE TUTORIAL (ARE YOU KIDDING ME? HOW CAN YOU BE THAT STUPID)			"

								This is a fun game, better than I expected. The graphics are very good, and the amount of features in game is fantastic. You can change reels, buy new bait, choose from different locations to fish at. It is very realistic, and you will be surprised about how much fun you can have with this game. However, sometimes the screen shakes so much the game becomes unplayable. This first happened for me after completing the tutorial. It shakes so bad it hurts your eyes-forcing you to exit the game. Please fix this issue so the game becomes easy to use again.			"

								I have mixed feelings on this game. It's great for prerelease!!! I find this game too realistic. I've spent over 4 hours in a day catching nothing, and that's what this is. You wait for a long time, and catch like 4 fish within the course of 40 minutes (3 were from the tutorial!). I think i'd be nice to be able to speed up the time or something. Great sound effects and graphics though!			"

								Was fun for while then got very repetitive. Had fun fishing for each type of fish and getting trophy but then forced to grind very long to get to new area's. If I took my time would take months to get to new area. Still early access so lots to come.Edit: Later levels 14+ become to much of a exp grind. Level 16 to 17 would take me 50days in game fishing, about 25 hours real play time. Prices are bit high on dlc and Premium. People have become very toxic in-game.  Still interested to see the updates but till then I wont be playing much. Dev team seems to cater to small group on their teamspeak and they all have bloated ego's. Dev's share more info. with them, then the general public.			"

It might only be me but i recommend getting this game and giving it a try.A message to the developers: You guys should add in a singleplayer aspect to the game that doesn't require internet connection. It would be great for waiting at the airport for your flight or if the internet is down at your house. All in All this game is a solid 9/10: It gives you the thrill of catching a big fish with the satisfaction of reeling in a large mouth bass and is hours of fun for everyone(literally)			"

I used to think fishing was all about chance, but this game is very skill-based: if you use different techniqe you will catch entirely different fish even in the same pond.  It inspires me to go out into the real world and fish, something I never would have considered before, so obviously this is an excellent game, even if it is made by Russians.			"

The dev support is really top, and even if there is still some bugs (it's still Early Access and what game did not ? ), they react fast, take users feedback into account, and keep their promise.If you have fishing experience, try it, if you don't but want to discover this great sport, try it also : it's FREE (you really can start without paying a cent, and if you love this game you will want to pay for it).

Fishing rods, reels, and lures play completely differently befitting a ""sim"". True free to play. It's a fishing game.Cons: Early Access means less features right now. Occasional fail to load. Occasional crashes.If you've never played a fishing game or haven't played since Super Black Bass on the SNES. Do yourself a favor and download this game for free.

I have a socket 2011 v3 i7 5820K, 32gb of 2666mhz ddr4 ram, 500gb ssd boot drive, two 3 tb sata drives in stripe raid for data.   Plenty enough to run this.  Also a GTX 980 SC video card.  Windows 10 Enterprise Edition.I did not get to play it so I can't really reveiw it properly.EDIT:I got it to work.  I had to uninstall all the nvidia drivers and nvidia expierience  etc...  all nvidia programs in my programs list.  Then rebooted and ran CCleaner and deleted all the nvidia remains.  Then redownloaded and reinstalled the latest driver.  Removed Nvidia Geforce Expierience and the Nvidia Sound Driver.  Now the game works fine on high settings.  I played for a while and it seems ok for early access.  I will test it out more.			"

								The game use to be absolutely awesome, so relaxing. I could play it for hours upon hours, and I'd have NO problem spending $$ on it... However, the only real way to get anything out of this title is to constantly dump money into it... It's not even Play to Win, it's really honestly become Pay to Play, period. I'm devastated to see that it's become a microtransaction nightmare because before all this, it was my absolute favorite Sim game... "

								i remember playing this awhile ago and it was okay from what i could remember..came back to it recently to get my fishing fix being its winter where i am and i dont have ice fishing gear right now..anyways boy do i remember why i left this game....its so far from free its insulting..i must of been giving some free starter stuff to try the game with when i first started playing because getting back on what feels like a year later i dont have anything...no rods...no bait nothing....the prices are way too high on everything so you will need real money to play this and like i said prices are way too high...i tried using the group chat to ask some others some questions and i couldnt even type my question because other menus would pop up ...while im sure theres a way to fix that it just seemed pointless being i didnt plan on spending a bunch of money to play..the game is beautiful they succeeded in that area..you will feel like youre outside  but its all ruined by the in game purchases that are required... much potential but too expensive...especially for a game thats supposed to be FREE.....i do not recommend this			"

								If you like to fish in real life, then get this game. It is a very fun, addicting game to play. The only thing I do not like is that you can't move your character very much at all. This is not a pay to play game. All the stuff you buy in game, you earn from catching fish. The premium account only really helps with leveling up. Also, the game has a really great community, so if you ever need help, you can just ask other players in game and there is always people willing to help you out. So, all in all, I wold give this game an 11/10 for anyone who loves fishing.			"

Devs really did a bang up job of creating this masterpiece!!  Only problem I've had so far is that sometimes you'll get a lost connection, but that's no problem as you just have to restart and pick up where you left off. Happens with all online games.Overall, I'd give it 10 stars...and it appears the game is getting better with time as they add more content.I don't reccomend many games, but if you like fishing, you'll love Fishing Planet.

								If you like fishing in real life, you might like this game as well. This is a free to play game, but there are some parts that CAN (not must) pay for to either make your experience more enjoyable or speed up the leveling process. There are some parts that are grindy if you want to level up, however, for the most part, the gameplay is enjoyable. This game is very much a work in progress and the developers are constantly improving the game which makes it fun to play.  With the game being a work in progress still you may find the odd bug from time to time. Overall, it's a fantastic game to relax and play and soak up the environment they Fishing Planet creates and catch some fish.  "

								After a day of strressful work (or stressful gaming) this an incredibly satisfying, yet relaxing casual fishing simulator.  I have not played too many fishing sims but I have played enough to find this one far more enjoyable.If you are highly competitive even in your casual gaming you will probably not find this appealing at the moment.  Multiplayer exists and the community is really great -- but there are no tournaments and you're left with a leader board for each fishing location but nothing super special.And of course if you are super competitive you will be frustrated by the DLC and micro transactions.  When approached from the perspective of a casual game, I find the micro transactions to be distateful but much less bothersome.As with most fishing sims, you are of course rewarded more for catching the ""popular kids"" of the sport fishing world (Bass, Salmon, Pike ect ect) but you are still able to progress/level with trout, catfish and panfish.  They are actually how I grabbed some decent ingame cash early on though they fade in importance over time.The graphics are enjoyable but at the moment the software is certainly not optimized.  I regularly have minor (read: non-game breaking) graphical errors.  The sound track is peaceful and enjoyable as well.  In short, if you want to actually feel like you're really fishing with complicated sporting gear in the actual environment...you need to purchase a fishing license and go out side.  But if you're interested in casually gaming and like fishing this is not a bad option and honestly one of the best currently availabe (though that says so little). "

								If you like actual fishing, you will like this game.  Very realistic, beautiful scenery and sound effects.  You need to learn and use different techniques to catch fish in this game, I'm certain I've learned quite a bit for the next time I go to drown some worms in real life.You won't find announcer's voices or underwater views or any of that stuff.  You're holding a rod, watching the tension of the line or the bobber.  Just like real life.The DLC is a little pricey, but you can earn and purchase all sorts of gear totally from in-game cash, if you're willing to grind a little.  Once you get past a certain level and purchase the right tackle you can start to get the ball rolling. Free.A very relaxing and fun game.			"

								The most fun I've ever had with a fishing game. I'm addicted to this.   Clocked up over 24 hours in 3 days, which is a lot for me.  It does have a learning curve to it, you have to learn how to catch the different fish, and use the different equipment.  Real world fishing experience will definitely serve you well here. It's still early access, so there are still bugs and server issues. Looking forward to the future updates.			"

								I went into the water to drink and bathe in the river, to get the smell of the fish so they would accept me into their fold. Slowly and surely I gained their trust, and adopted their language, culture, and ways. The great chief look to me as the next leader for the tribe, and I already gained the love of his daughter. Soon I was caught between two worlds, my fellow fishermen or my new fishy brethen. I went to consult the source of wisdom for the fish, the great and powerful submerged river truck tire. It spoke to me of a war that will come to take the lives of my fish tribe, and the evil of man and their great machines of war. What will happen to me I do not know, but this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome if you love fishing.10/10 Half fish, half man babies			"

								The game is good but buggy at times...  To be honest my biggest complaint is that my camera view keeps getting off center after about an hour of playing and I have to quit and restart.  The fish don't act like normal fish at times.  When you try to catch the fish they are much smarter than normal fish in that they can rapidly create slack on the line and get off the hook unnaturally fast.  It's fine for now and it's still a good game.  After playtesting the game for a few days I have a few recommendations for the game to make it's replay ability better.  It would be more exciting if you could walk around the lake and have to find the fishing spots.  Seasons should also be introduced in order to change fishing style throughout the 4 season.  Fly fishing should be included in the game.  Also the lakes should be larger and different boats should be introduced in order to access locations unavailable by foot.  I would also spread the experience across the fish more so that players don't go for the same fish all the time.  It seems that at each lake there is only one fish that gives a good amount of experience while the rest don't give enough experience to make them worth fishing.  I know the game isn't finished and these are only suggestions to the developers....Other than that the game is great with a lot of potential.  Definitely worth playing for a while. "

								Highly recommended for people that has given up all hope in life and does not mind staring at a pointless computer screen for endless hours. Here's for all you good folks out there that has caught a fish, this amazing salmon recipe will help a lot with your future endeavours.  1 (2 pound) salmon fillet 1 teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning 1 teaspoon onion salt 1 small onion, sliced and separated into rings 6 slices lemon 1/4 cup butter, cut into small chunks  1/3 cup sour cream 1/3 cup mayonnaise 1/4 cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon capers 1 tablespoon finely chopped onion 1 tablespoon caper brine 1 teaspoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon prepared horseradish 3/4 teaspoon dried dill weed 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt ground black pepper to taste1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil; grease the foil lightly.2. Place salmon fillet with skin side down on foil. Season salmon with lemon-pepper and onion salt; top with onion rings                   and lemon slices, dot with butter. Fold foil around salmon and seal tightly.3. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Unseal the foil and turn the oven's broiler on. Continue cooking the salmon under the broiler until the flesh flakes easily with a fork, 8 to 12 minutes.4. While the salmon bakes, stir sour cream, mayonnaise, white wine, capers, chopped onion, caper brine, lemon juice, horseradish, dill weed, garlic salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Serve with the salmon.			"

								Fishing Planet is a Early Access Free to Play realistic sportsfishing simulator made for anglers.  You will have to know how to fish for real and love fishing for real.   You can catch 8 fish families.  The graphics look good but the background music is repetative.  You have a lot of control of how you set up your fishing gear and control on using your fishing gear.  Like real fishing, the environment conditions is supposed to effect the fishing.You get for free 1 unlimited basic licence in Missouri, the Missouri map has 2 locations.  But you have invisible walls preventing you from moving away from the location or falling into water.  Looks like you can unlock other fishing trips after grinding through trips in Missouri, you have to level up and earn ingame credits.  There are 6 other fishing trips, currently locked. If you buy a premium pack it gives you licences, give you some credits and a xp boost, and you can buy credit bundles with real money.  You can get licenses and gear using ingame credits.  You can earn some ingame credits and gold by playing.  If you go broke, game over, so make sure you make your trips profitable.  Maybe someone could learn how to fish for real playing this game well.  I don't like fishing, did only a little fishing when real young, so i am going by what i know watching fishing tv shows i seen.  It looked ok and game worked, has a beginning tutorial.for more info:

Things i would like to see in future are:1:More intense sounds; like splashing when fighting with fish.2:Adjustable FOV; fishing would be more interesting if you could see more and not be like zoomed in.3:Free travelling; travelling to these different spots in states are expensive, and you get money through fishing. Its like grinding money and then finally travelling to the next spot.Overall, i do recommend this game.			"

But i didnt test other locations than the noob one.Barbecue tonight, yaaaaaaay ! "

								This game was great when it first came out.  I could go in, cast out, catch fish and level up.  Buy new lures because of my level, go to a new destination.  Rinse and repeat with all different species of fish.Now, after this latest update, I spawn in.  I choose a destination and blow a good 3 grand getting to that spot, only to realize that all of my gear has been removed from my character.  And it's not in my inventory, it's back home.  So I can't do anything but leave.  What a great waste of money.I tried to come back and give this game a chance, but now it's just going to get uninstalled.			"

								Great fishing game. If u know how to fish u can play... let me explain. I fish for real, alot, so when I started playing I did what I would do if I were fishing, wanna catch blue gill, cast a float , just about anywhere preferably near weeds. How about bass, a jig by cover. And catfish, cut bait near the bottom in a hole or drop off. So to conclude... if you like fishing and gaming. .. and fishing (simulator not arcade) games, you'll love this.			"

								played an hour of this and it was really great, unforunately I won't be playing it anymore because of what the reviews have said. Everyone loves the game but based on some facts people shared I can tell it is a terrible model that i've dealt with  in the past and don't want to anymore. Making players restricted by time is misery, if a free to player wants to earn something he should be able to work at it when he wants for how long he wants and should be able to reap the benefits at his leisure.sure make the baitcoin conversion rate higher to make it take forever and I'd be 100% happy, but restrict me by time? no. Let me earn stuff based on the commitment I want to put into the game.I bet their playerbase is small and this is their way of selling out, it's a shame that they don't have more faith in their game and in people to put in the money, now they're scaring everyone away trying to rip them off.Devs have to realize by now. and they don't care			"

								If you like to fish, but don't like having to travel, get wet, get cold, and get smelly old fish guts all over you, this is a fine simulation of real fishing. I believe they are going to introduce many more aspects such as boats, co-op, European fish (and hopefully European pegs!) and maybe sea fishing...here's hoping! It's free to play and you can earn not only the normal in-game currency, but also the special coinage by doing events and catching Unique fish. There's really no downside to trying this game, the scenery, beautifully rendered streams, rivers and lakes all help to relax after a hard days mutant or zombie killing. Go on, wind up your day by winding down and winding in a fish or two! :)			"

								this is a great game and im really enjoying it.. i know its early doors but will you be implementing things like catapults to bait up your area, more information on the reels rods and lines as me and my friends are struggling to work out what line goes with which reel so and and soforth, i would also like to see an introduction to bait alarms and maybe having two rods set up at the same time with bait alarm rigs.. also i feel like float fishing is really really slow most of the time and when you do catch fish on float there not really big, also i think it would be good to bring in some sort of landing action ie using an actual landing net to land the fish.. these are just some things that i think would make the game better hopefully some of these ideas will be put in.. otherwise brilliant game			"

								i can understand that this game is a free 2 play. but the progression is extremly slow.i watched a few youtube videos about how to catch specific fish and what not.and ye they give you more than +1 star (aka exp.) but still it takes you forever to level up to level 3.i am sure, with the premium (booster) thing, it wouldnt go alot faster.also i can understand that the progression in this game is slower cause it may take you up to 10-15 or even more minutes till u actually catch a fish.but even if i get a punch of 1.6 pounds -catfishes (+7 stars) it still takes quiet a long time to level up.it wouldnt be a big deal if u would get a new map/location if u level to level 3 since it takes you atleast 1-2h to get to level 3, if u are new and got no idea what u are doing.but no, (not completly sure) u need level 6 to get the second location, which is new york.other than the really slow progression, the game is really sweet. fun and addicting!i would love to see other players around the river fishing aswell. currently all you can do is chat with ppl on your server. thats not how an MMO works :(also running around more would be really fun aswell, dont give us just a few spawns and we can walk 2meters to the water and stay there the whole day.u should be able to only choose one spawn, which will be next to your car and than u can walk 10-20sec to the river (shortest way) or you can walk all around the river and fish from the other side :Ddont get me wrong, i dont want a walking simulator, just more possibilitys on where i can fish rather than a ""hardcoded"" area.looking forward for updates :)			"

								this game is not broken its far better than it was back in august and it will only get betternow im not saying its perfect cos its far from that there is a lot of bugs about atm theres dissapeering fish,flying fish even raining fish :D theres a problem with the drag on a few real big fish,theres walking fish.the wear system is fine if you keep your gear in the green area there is hardly any wear but if you go for bigger fish and have to go in the red then repair is more(nothing wrong with that)but even with all these negatives the game is more fun than ever once you relearn itfish fights are awsome now,the fish ai is a lot better(they actualy react to how you move the rod ect)i think the main problem is its no more easyland the biger fish take a lot more effort to land and i love that.Even the smaller fish are far better now, go grab a ultra light setup 0.8 braid and a nano spinner and go origon i dare you to say its not funn :D to me is seems to many focus on the monster fish in game put town your big guns and go have some fun with the smaller stuff forget about xp grindin and start actualy fishing :Dany 1 that actualy knows me knows i spend more time at the lower lvl places than i do at the good places and im lvl 23.Theres going to be lots more bugs,lots more changes before this game gets out of early access and i will be here for all of them becouse i love the game and realy enjoy it.you can call me a fanboy i dont realy give a toss im in for the long haul,i will be here throu all the good times and the bad becouse this is a fantastic game a great dev team(a bit slow but hey there not a big team) and a fantastic comunity.now go dipp your wick,get ya line wet, tight lines all :D			"

								It's a pretty fun game in the few hours I have played. The graphics are pretty, and the fishing is fun once I figured out what I was doing. It does have a few rough patches like all early access games do though. The weather pattern in the different fishing spots is exactly the same each 'trip' and I think a bit more variety would be nice. I also am one of those people who uses a keyboard layout other than the standard US QWERTY, and it would be nice if I could re-bind controlls to the keys I actually have, or if there was controller support. That and a few glitches like being unable to reliably set up your rod when buying new gear is annoying.On the bright side though, it is free!			"

It takes some practice and tiral and error, or you can look up the many available tutorials on youtube and even watch live play on twitch.tv.

								Devs are tremendous right now. Rather than getting all whiny and writing a crap review because of a few simple bugs I decided to wait until they were fixed. Guess what...they were fixed 12 hours later and the game is running smoothly again. I guess the kids that couldn't get it working after 5 minutes gave up and made a bad review....my review is to balance that out a bit. "

								I've play this game on 2 different accounts. Honestly there is to much farming to make any progress on a level or gear up. Fish have unlimited stamina which make it impossible to land a large fish if you get it on an untralight rod and reel combo. Can't fish with multiple people other than by chat. Lacking an online community.It feels like this should be a game for my cell phone. I am soured by the fact that DLC is being sold before the completed product is finished. Yes I am aware the game is free but that doesn't make it acceptible to me. TI planned to come back to the game after release but the whole DLC sale made me change my mind.			"

								Pay to win. Amazing conept with very good execution however the ""premium"" option and general mobile app feel to the menu interface ruins the experience to an otherwise great fishing simulator. That being said, I am very willing to purchase a full game (even if it is in early access e.g. rust). I would've loved to see this as a complete package that I could just purchase and have availible to me without microtransactions, cooldowns, etc.Hope someone else will come along and do a fishing simulator right!

								As an older bloke but still relatively new to online gaming, I was sick and tired of the shoot em ups I normally play and sought something more relaxing. Due to my disability, I have not been fishing in the real world for years, so when I stumbled across this game in steam, for free, well I just had to give it a go. And I am very glad I did.It is so relaxing to play. I love the scenery, I love the way some of the smaller fish can put up a great fight. The background sound effects are lovely. And I really enjoy the friendly banter in the on screen chat box. If you are the kind of gamer that likes to compete with others, you can play it that way and try to level up as quick as you can, and there a tons of guides to help you find the tricks and tips, I however, really enjoy the slower route, figuring things out for myself, and just enjoying the game for what it is. A marvelous way to relax and recuperate from my recent heart attack, and a smashing alternative to the find gun, load gun, kill em all type of game that I have been playing up untill now.A truly brilliant game, thank you to all the Dev's, for making this, and releasing it for free. Brilliant. 10 out of 10 from me.			"

								Did any one not notice this game is in early release. And FREE and yes there will be bugs and it will crash and not work from time to time and the dev team may get things wrong as in making game worse before it gets better at times. As thats the idea of early release game. Not for us to slate it but to be constructive with your criticism and help the dev team to make game better. if when game is released and may even be charged for game then thats when you go this game is not for me the dev team have got it wrong for me i am not playing any more job done. But for now this is looking to being a good game and i am having fun playing now yes at times it feels a bit same as you catch fish in the same loctions time and time again. But the quetion is despite the bugs the crashes and all the other problems with game as its in DEVELOPMENT not a finished producted yet. Is it fun do i enjoy playing it well my answer is yes i played nothing much else since coming across the game a few days ago. Does it do my head in at times when it does not work as i think it should or can't catch big fish yes but thats the part i am enjoying and for a person who hates fishing in real life i dont think thats bad thing. So would i recomend the game yes a big yes because its free for one it can be a bit of a grind but not as much as real fishing in my opinion as i hate real fishing lol. Secondly it looks nice and sounds not bad few more back ground noise would be nice and change more and get rid of mosies lol. So try it if you dont like nothing lost as it has not cost you any thing. Is a full product i would say not but it is looking to be one great game at moment needs work and i feel thats what its all about :) SO STOP MOANING AND STOP PLAYING OR HELP MAKE GAME BETTER with constructive criticism not game bashing or game bashing as i have read in various posts. Also on release if game is not what you wanted for it stop playing and dont pay if it becomes a payed game.			"

								Fishing Planet is a very fun game overall.  It does feel a little grindy due to the experience system and the way that different locations, lures, and equipment unlock, but that doesn't bother me since I find the game extremely relaxing and fun to play.  It's actively being developed and improved, and I can certainly see it becoming my new ""World Golf Tour"" -- the game I go to when I need to just unwind for 30-45min after the baby goes to sleep.

								Summary:Played a couple hours and overall a pretty decent game. It is a little different from fishing games I remember playing in the past but it's not bad. At the start it was a bit annoying having the control map pop up while the tutorial was going. I think that it should have been less invasive and have a little bubble stating ""press F1 for controls"" or something like that. Also the control map has some faded lines pointing to the keys which are a bit hard to follow. I kind of feel like a noob but just a suggestion... If you catch a fish that is supposed to be a release under the license equipped maybe once you catch that restricted fish it should have a notice that fades away saying if you keep the fish you'll get fined. I messed up and kept 2 fish in New York on a basic license and it made me go negative and now I can't fish til tomorrow. I can see this game getting a little repetative over time once I have caught a majority of the fish. Otherwise it's pretty relaxing, just throw some music on in the background grab a beer (age 21+) kick back and cast out.Pros:Beautiful graphicsVariety of gear/fish/methods to catch themCommunication to others in server (chatting and notifications of fish caught)Cons:Looking around/movement is a bit floatyNeeds more clarity on license restrictions real timeI'll do a better review when I get more time in the game and have more knowledge about the game.

								This is a great fishing sim, the price being free was awesome, however the game can be played without having to spend any real money, but advancing in the game will take a while longer. I do feel however that the better gear and equipment does make you want to spend real money and in some cases with equipment you may have too if you want to compete, the only real downside to the game right now is cost of travelling, if your happy with the basic lake then fine you don’t need to spend anything but if you want to travel the licences for the venues are too expensive and the cost to travel is beyond a joke! but as I said nobody is forcing you to spend anything and to be honest, if this cost of travelling keeps up, the game will die.If you like fishing then this sim is just up your street, beats having to lug all your gear about too.I do recomend the game but not impressed with the rising cost of licences and travel.

								I would overwhelmingly recommend this game, here is why...I've played many fishing games dating back to Blue Marlin on the NES. This game is the first one that has ever given me a sense of what it is truly like to fish in real life. The environment is beautiful, the equipment realistic, the difficulties of real fishing are present. There are two types of players in this game, the first type goes into it to play a game, the other goes into it to fish. The developers need both types of players to be a success. The game can't be too realistic to where you can play for a few hours and catch nothing, but it also can't be so easy that it feels 'arcadey', because you will lose the players that come to fish. If you want to catch a fish then you can, but if you want to catch a nice fish you will have to work for it, just like real life fishing. There are mechanics occasionally that make it hard to catch fish, but a game that is still early access and is this complex needs leeway to fine tune things.There are many people that play this game that are in the first group and do not care about learning how to fish, they just want to know where to cast, what to cast with, and what time of day, then they try and can't catch what they were going for and blame the game or the developers. If you take the time to experiment with different lures, different retrieve styles, and cast in places that real fish would hang out then you will catch something, it may take some practice, it may take some persistence, and it will take patience. That is one key thing that makes this game worth my time, the idea that real fishing requires patience, if you don't have that and you wait 5 seconds and nothing will hit your bobber and you get mad and bash the game then you aren't meant to play this game.On the topic of cheaters, a lot of people say that since there are cheaters in the game, that it ruins their experience. I really don't see how they can do that. One person cheating doesn't change my experience because I can still come into the game and catch a fish, I know how I caught that fish and I can take pride in the fact that I didn't have to cheat to get that fish. The devs have done a lot to curb cheating and sometimes those measures can have false positives. Anti-cheat is a very hard thing to get right and will never be 100% effective. I will admit that this game can get quite grindy in the higher levels. The official reason for that is so that it will take you longer to do everything there is to do and catch so that the devs have more time to add more content to keep you coming back. But I have been playing for 510hrs at the time I am writing this review and I have yet to catch everything I want to catch and go everywhere I want to go, however I am slightly slower than some. Some say this game is pay to play and it is most definitely not, far from it. I have not paid a single cent to get to where I am, but not that I won't in the future to support the game. Yes you need certain gear to be able to participate in certain areas but you do not need to pay real money to do it. There is a reason why certain maps are level locked and its because you can't start out in the game and immediately go after a 50 pound striper bass or a 40 pound Northern Pike. You start out with access to gear that are only rated for small fish. Its a game, you work up to the big ones, if you don't like that don't play. Some recent reviews are complaining about that because there were limited time events that opened up all the lakes to everyone so they could compete in a tournament for fish anyone can catch. But they chose to go for fish they didn't have the gear to catch. Obviously you can pay for DLC and get better gear early and beable catch any fish that you have the level to catch, such as the 90 pound gar in Missouri. But, that is far from being pay to win because you can just wait till you level up and you can get that gear for in-game currency.			"

								LOVE IT! Bugs are so minor that they are almost unnoticeable, especially for an early access. I get on to just have a casual moment and get sucked in four a few hours trying to catch that big one. Great game if you love to fish. The line even drifts in the currents and rain messes with your view. I highly recommend this to anyone who fishes but doesn't get the time to get out to the lake.11\10 "

								Trophy Bass 4 >>>>> current state of Fishing Planetedit - after 17 hours or so i'll say this... and i still stand by my initial review... the actual ""fishing"" mechanics of the game is OK so far. at it's base it's fun. but what makes it boring? shore fishing. it gets old pretty fast from static points. there needs to be boats, topographic maps, electronics, etc. i doubt we'll see it on a scale like trophy bass 4 where entire real lakes are mapped and you could travel to any point on it.the ""grind"" to use gear is fairly boring. it also feels like the fish Quality scales to lures you unlock. maybe there's some RNG involved to get trophies on worse things but i havent seen it yet. also the semi-forced ""you must fish varied species"" to level quicker is pretty Carrot on a Stick. im interested in bass fishing only. you should be able to grind the game fishing how YOU want to fish (""you can just way slower because one lake doesnt have a species you want to fish""). combining lures and different types of rigging... why use anything but jigs with hook guards for cover fishing? why can't i make a jig-n-pig combo? i can't texas rig my worms or tubes. what if you want to wacky rig? more casts... the casting is too generic. there needs to be flips, skips, etc, etc... a game made in 2000 has all of this - even if the graphics are way crappier it's a way more fleshed out game that creates a better experience of fishing simulation. ""ultimate"" fishing simulator is a very bold claim for what it's offering.			"

								Absolutely a fun game to play for a bit to kill time or to sit down and relax with some fishing. Alot of people are complaining about the fishing mechanics of the game and others things, it's free to play and simulation games (especially ones like these) are hard to get all the mechanics down. The game has to pay attention to so many factors to try and replicate real fishing which is very demanding. So the fact that many people think the game is broke or too easy there's a few simple things you can do1. Post actual problems in the forum rather than QQ because you can't fish right.2. Remember that the game is still in early dev so there is going to be problems, get over it.2. Uninstall and move on. It's not a game for everyone and it's f2p so you're not loosing anything.Overall mechanics are solid to play, different baits to use so there plenty of variety, many updates that come out everyday to improve.Will rate it 8.5-9/10 for simulators.

								This game is really good, if you love the outdoors and you love fishing this game is for you. you have a wide range species of fish and habitat. easy of control with your mouse settings and keyboard. one thiong i did not like and i'll see what happens, i was playing a game and i did not watch my coin currency, and i logged out of my game, well when i came back, i was on a negative currency with no way to continue my game play even on the basic free map? so im going to see if it gives me a log in bonus or do i have to reach into my wallet to unlock content, dont get me wrong the game is incredibly great, but i think there needs to be a add on feature maybe where you can sell old tackle, to give you some kind of coin or dollar amount to where you can atleast enjoy the basic parts of the game. other than that as i said the game is great my future add ons would be boating/canoe's, a wider variety of land fishable spots.

								This game changed the way I live drastically. Now, I will acknowledge that it appears I only have approximately six minutes played on Fishing Planet, but let me be honest: Those six minutes were damn well near the best six minutes of my life. I changed from an isolated and depressed 30-year-old man with an anime body pillow into a 30-year-old virtual fishing master with no time to be distracted by my animated girlfriend. The simple, yet elegant act of catching virtual fish encouraged me to contemplate my life and motivated me to abandon my sweet high-school waifu and become a competitive E-Sports fisherman. I was an atheist until I played this game; I'm now a firm believer of Christ and this game is a clear reincarnation of him. I have achieved a state of Nirvana. I am God.			"

I'd rather pay to win at real fishing and spend the money on gear.You can't cast for♥♥♥♥♥♥without upgrades, you can't catch more than♥♥♥♥♥♥fish without upgrades. You want to change holes? that's going to cost you in game currency and when you run it they will try and sell you more for real world dollars.I just want a game I can cast properly and catch something other than bait fish after an hour.I caught some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little .16 lb fish I let it struggle around for 30 seconds or so before it decided we were bro heims and reeled itself in. 3/10. Could have potential but it seems like they are gearing up to force microtransactions and milk it with♥♥♥♥♥♥game mechanics. Basically seems to have a mobile game philosophy. Rather than focusing on making a good damn game that people want to spend money on because it's good they chose to make a game you have to spend money on if you want to progress at anything faster than a snails crawl.EDIT: And now I am getting Emails from these people trying to sell me black friday fishing gear deals.  Its not bad enough that  in game nothing is possible without  spending actual money now they are emailing me harrassing  me for more money. Get ♥♥♥♥ed. I don't support nickle and diming garbage.			"

								First of all, the game is very promising, not just there yet, but has potential of being the best Fishing Simulator so far. But let's check the pros and consPros:- Not just a game, a super realistic simulation- Fully customizable equipment from rods&reels to your hat&boots- Many ways to fish, many places to fish- Again, realistic gameplay forces LICENSES (awesome!)- Good visuals- A really helpful communityCons:- Good graphics brings lag from time to time (though I tried the game after a Starcraft II marathon that lasted over 40 hours, so gotta check it out later.)- F1 Controls Panel is too messy that I closed it right away and asked the community for most of controls- Tutorial? Is there any? I mean ""Throw the bait using LMB *LMB image*"" Thanks mate! Reallly helpful it was. I was about stick rod right up to my a**.-Uhm... I thought this was Multiplayer? I thought it was, Co-Operative? No? Oh... Seriously only thing that looks Multi-Player is the chat-box. Th game promises to have some tournaments but... C'mon WE WANNA THROW THE THINGY TOGETHER!!!Overall, this game is good, looks good, will be even better! 'cuz the game is already good, you can see it in the ""pros"" section up there and it's ""cons"" stated above are al fixable cons. Highly, seriously recommended. I don't know how to wait for my computer to relax a bit to play this game under better circumstances. Add me, message me and blah blah blah-di blah.			"

								I found this gem after watching a livestream and was very interested. As an avid outdoorsman and fishermen, I wanted to see what a F2P game had to offer. While it is still in early access, it is still a very fun game to play. Tons of content and more still to come. Travel America fishing for the premier freshwater fish. From pan fish to bass, predatory fish, float fishing, trout, salmon, and even the mighty sturgeon, this game is an easy and fun way  to fish if you've never been or do it all the time. As in real life, spending money on stuff that you may never use is a bad move. Before buying, ask yourself, will I need this after Missouri, or Colorado, or New York(btw don't go here after you unlock it, its a bad move, wait until you are higher level or you will be in debt and get stuck. 8.5/10.

								I have never fished in real life... I have never been interested in fishing...Then I was introduced to this game.. At first I was like OK this is boring but then after leveling up and catching different types of fishes I got hooked (pun intended).  Really fun game and I've actually learned alot. And I can happily say that this game is so satisfying I never ever have to go fishing IRL.When fishing in the game it actually sounds like I'm at a real river or lake. Sometimes there is annoying little birds or whatever making noise and irritates me. But it sounds very real. The maps are very beautiful.. Lovely little mountains on some... Just trees on others. One map i really like is Florida. Looks amazing.There is a nice variety of fishies and the best one imo is the Walleye.So far a very good game!! Cant wait til they add more maps (EU SOON!!) and more fishies :D			"

								Logged in not having a huge amount of hope for this game, having played just about every sports hunting and fishing game made at least a few hours. By the time I stepped up to the bank I was swatting mosquitoes away from my ears. This game is very good for a fishing sim, if you like that stuff. If you liked other fishing games this one will blow you away. You must use proper baits, depths, rod/reel setups, etc. The immersion is nice too. I spent a evening just cat fishing because it was fun.I would not recommend this to anyone looking for action, or fast paced anything. This game is made to hang out, chill, relax catch a few fish and chat with others doing the same thing.			"

								A friend of mine was playing this game for about a week telling me I should try it out and I was giving him grief for it the whole time. I like to fish in real life and my thought was ""if I want to fish, I'll load up my gear and hit the lake up the road, fishing sim? Whats next? Bathroom sim? Lol"" but one day I gave in and downloaded it... WOW!!! Within 5 mins of getting past the tutorial I was hooked. This game is awesome! The graphics are amazing, the fish artwork is fantastic, the map locations, the gear, the fish fights, the community... it's all awesome! And to think, I can go fishing and I dont have to buy bait, gas, or license. I dont have to deal with crowded fishing piers or river banks, summer heat or frigid cold. It is early access so some things are a little buggy but nothing that doesnt take away from the immersion or fun of the game. The Dev team works hard to bring new content and fix problems that the community reports. The community itself is filled with awesome people who will help you out if you dont know the first thing about fishing and video guides are out there for just about every species in game. Good people, good fun, good game! Download and give it a shot, you wont be disappointed. Completely free to play, you get access to everything with ingame credits and gold that you earn by catching fish except for DLC but that is a given. So what are you waiting for? Come join us in the best fishing sim money can't buy.			"

Early Access Review
								2nd EDIT: After recent patch 3.3 that went live 12th March, I can say that game i enjoy playing this game once again. They have  turned down fish IQ, and they are not able to snag the line anymore. It's turned off until they figure out proper way to do it. Gear still wasn't updated and everyone will find leveling a bit harder because the lack of gear required. One of the examples is lvl 19 casting rod ""Galaxycast"" that requires lure weight to be minimum 100g. That was obvious typo, and game suffers for it, since you can't really use that rod. Main flaw of the whole update is that devs cranked up the difficulty but haven't provided players with adequate new or updated gear.I still have high hopes for this game.Back from my previous rating when i gave this game 3/10 (post patch) from 9/10 (pre patch), I am now giving this game rating of 6/9 since they have made it playable again. I have my hopes up this will not become ""freemium"" game.For those who wish to read my review of the patch 3.0 and my thoughts on it, you can find my rant below. :)tl;dr - I explain the reasons why they screwed the last update, and how it hurt the game and community.__________________________________________________________________________________EDIT:Apparently, only their patch notes are really lame. Thing is, you need to match your gear exactly to the weight (or better) of the fish you are going for. My main problem was that the game was lying to me. A bit about the line not fitting reel. If reel says its 0.28, just mount it even if you get warning that it may damage your reel. If you have reel that is even the slightest lower than the fish you are catching you WILL break your gear, and damage it fast. If your full gear matches the fish spec, you will have same experience as before. It WILL become enjoyable again. I will be leaving this negative review tho, since the patch notes are TRASH and i had to spend over 10k and 100g to figure this out.__________________________________________________________________________________There are tons of reasons to love this game. Excellent community, gorgeous scenery, sound effects (tho some peckers and wolves can be annoying at times) the feeling when you are fishing them sometimes ""feels"" like real fishing. BUT...Reason why i'm even writing this, is because i have spent very much of my spare time on this, and after most recent update, i  had a feeling i have to go and put my 2 cents here. Update is almost perfect. While they were trying to go for feel that would be as much realistic as it can get, somewhere they lost themselves. It has supposed to be tougher for players. To make fish smarter, to make gear have durability, and to make you use your gear as you would do in real life, instead of just straight reeling fish in. Well I said they got lost, because when they went for smart fish, they got smart as Albert Einstein with street smarts and strength of a superman. You can have all proper gear suited for the fish that you are trying to catch, but fish will just glance around see some rocks or weeds, make a run for it, forgetting the fact that it is in much pain and agony get boost of strength and swim 15m in opposite direction, hiding behind those rocks, then tie some super knot around one of those rocks, snag your line, get the hook out if it's mouth and just laugh at you for being a dunce compared to her smarts. Now for the gear wear/tear part. Everything gets destroyed. Your jacket, your bags, lures, lines rods and reels. I'm guessing the undies get worn too. Now, it wouldn't be much of a problem if that would take some time, but alas it is not. Your gear lasts you for 30-40 fish max, then you need to repair it (if you manage to fix it, since reels once snagged by fish at max length because of their superman strength, your reel gets broken full since you can't break line unless prompted, and game doesn't offer you that option. Broke 6 reels trying to fish in California (where i am supposed to fish for my level). At the moment i'm stuck in leveling because i should be fishing in Cali, but my gear (that's the only thing that crossed my mind) is not good enough for that fish. But if i would go anywhere else to fish, i would need to grind another year, since i'm getting 10 times less XP on some other places. For example for rainbow trouts i'm getting 35xp and i need 20.000 xp to my next level. Fishing technique: They did almost flawless job. You need to fish just as you would reel in real fish. You need to tire it out with same techniques that you would use in real life. But again, their smarts and superman strength are sometimes ruining (quite often) the experience. I'm using correct and updated skill (fishing as if i would in real life with tiring the fish), but somehow they always are able to go over my max line distance and break my reels. And anyways, i've got gear at my place that is older than 30 years and still works same as the day it was bought.Now there are also some gear issues that don't make sense to me.  I guess either i'm not right in my assumption, or somehow they missed one thing. I am using  spinning reel Exterminator 5500 for example. As it says on it, it supports 0.28 braided line. Well, it wont support it, and not even 0.23 one. So, how about you fix this ASAP.... game mechanics are a gem. but fish is 3 times stronger than it actually is, gets bursts of power that allow them to swim 40m in opposite direction, and you just can't do nothing. Just sit and watch as it destroys your gear, even tho, your reel in reality should easily handle that fish weight.This game is going FREEMIUM and i think they wont turn away from that idea, since there is already DLC package that you can buy. That dlc includes gear that will be usable for ANY fish. And there is no way to obtain that gear in any other way.YOU NEED FIXES TO THIS UPDATE ASAP, or this is going to end badly with you loosing gamers.			"

								I am not sure what the delelopers are thinking in this game?  They provide rods and reels that can be equiped with 30 pound plus line to catch fish that only weigh 40-45 pounds max, but only provide rods that can only handle 12 pound line to catch fish that approach 100 pounds and have no heavy action rods available to put a float on.  I hope the next update addresses this issue.			"

								I would recommend this game to every one who likes fishing. I have been playing this game for over 300 hours or many months. I tried it by accident due to being bored from shoulder surgery and not being able to use both hands to play video games was a bummer. I was able to play this one with just one and it has been great ever sense. Also I had my first problem. It was with a DLC I bought so I emailed the support not sure of the type of response I would get. I was amazed that they responded in just 3 hours, and during the Christmas holiday season to boot. Everything was fixed right away to my great satisfaction. I will continue to play and support the developer of this game. FISH ON everyone			"

Early Access Review
Preface: This review is a ""compare & contrast"" with another popular fishing title released around the same time, Dovetail Games' Euro Fishing. I like both and think they're both quality titles, but they do different things well and will satisfy different tastes. This review is meant to help you decide which one you might prefer. I wrote a similar review for Euro Fishing, and will update both when Fishing Planet comes out of early access.+Free, with a generous FTP model Fishing Planet's FTP model is described on the wiki as ""free to win"", and while that sounds contrived it really is pretty accurate. Fishing Planet is very generous with what is available to non-paying players, and the devs have stated that they want people to pay to support the game, not because they were forced to in order to progress. Be forewarned that the mid-game can get grindy, but overall I think that Fishing Planet is living up to its FTP intentions.+Nice variety of fishing styles & techniques Even in early access, Fishing Planet has a great variety of angling styles, and it even recognizes different lure presentation techniques within spin fishing. The devs have promised even more styles in the future (including boat and kayak fishing), but Fishing Planet is already a fairly comprehensive US fishing game, with potential to be even greater.+Lots of different places to fish Fishing Planet has locations all over the US, and will include different water types in each (rivers, lakes, marshes, reservoirs etc). The devs have said that an eventual goal is to have locations outside the USA as well. +Great variety of fish Panfish. Crappie. Catfish. Bass. Pike. Trout. Salmon. Gar. Lots of different kinds of fish, and more might be on the way. Such a diverse group of target fish requires lots of different angling methods, giving Fishing Planet a ton of longevity. This variety of angling methods, locations and fish is Fishing Planet's greatest strength against the rather one-dimensional Euro Fishing.+Excellent water effects The water in Fishing Planet is beautiful, which means a lot when you'll spend most of your time in-game staring at it. Personally I love how well it reflects the surrounding environment, and reacts to your line. This is another area where one of FP's strengths aligns against a particular weakness of DTG's Euro Fishing, which struggles a bit with its water.+Tons of gear Geeking out over gear is part of the fun of the hobby, and Fishing Planet really delivers with a large store of real-world fishing toys. One nice nod to immersion is that while you're out fishing, the local shops will have different gear on hand. -Limited spots to fish from in each area Although you can fish all over the US in different kinds of water, each area only gives you a few cramped spots to fish from. There is little room for the exploration found in DTG's Euro Fishing, and each location does feel more like a videogame set piece than a real place. It doesn't take long for each area to feel a little stale.-Weak casting mechanics Click LMB to fill the power bar. Easy, but honestly it's a letdown in comparison to the casting in DTG's Euro Fishing. This is where Fishing Planet falls short against a strength of its European counterpart.-Audio is incomplete, and impedes immersion Fishing Planet is in early access, so hopefully the audio will see some TLC before release. However, at this point it's noticeably incomplete, and hampers the immersive aspects of FP's strong points.-No landing mechanic Currently you just reel the fish in, and there is no mechanic for netting or handling them. One could argue this is better than the pretty rough netting mechanic of Euro Fishing, but hopefully something is added at release. -No photo-op Fishing Planet's presentation of your catch is disappointing. Your character just hangs them in front of your screen by your line, and they flop around until you click through the stats box. DTG's photo-op finish to each catch does a great job of showing off the fish, and helps give them a sense of personality. FP's fish (even the unique ones) end up feeling a bit cookie-cutter and bland. -Multiplayer is a chatroom As a game that bills itself as an MMO, I really expected more than this. The devs have more multiplayer features on the way, but at the moment Fishing Planet is basically a single-player game with a chatroom. DTG's Euro Fishing actually lets you fish with other players in the same location.-Weak NPE (new player experience) Fishing Planet's tutorials are cursory at best, nothing more than a few click-through menus. Hopefully a more comprehensive tutorial is added at launch. However, the wiki is, despite being a work-in-progress, quite good.			"

								I'll start with the cons of this simulator, and follow up with the pros.  This is my opinion based on years of playing fishing games and spending countless hours fishing in real life.  (Note: I've read the most recent dev blog post, and it appears that the developers are hard at work already on some of this.  Good stuff!)=== Cons ===Physics - line slack in water doesn't correlate with how much line is released; confusing fish catches (the fish seem to 'fly' or teleport out of the water upon catching).Xbox 360 controller - doesn't feel right with the controls of this game.  No game controller configuration options.Controls - out of sync with fish bites; casting is a pain (no level of casting power?  simply click and hope for the best?); hooking/reeling fish is a confusing ordeal (fish on?  tension?  visual/audio feedback?  doesn't seem the game adds excitement to fish retrieval).XP/currency - too much emphasis on points and currency rather than skills; microtransactions - a nice option, but seems to be designed as a cash grab.  Please - DO make money on this - development costs money.  But don't sacrifice fun and realism by making it pay-to-win.Fish AI - unrealistic expectations (i.e. 'use a 16 inch leader with a size 6 hook').  Following guidelines to increase the odds of catching a fish is good - but forcing players to stick to a formula and grind away is just not fun.Music - need more of it.Interface - a bit confusing; example: ESC key does different things or nothing at all; GUI needs to be consistent amongst the different screens.=== Pros ===Graphics - WOW - spot on!  They are truly amazing.  3D texturing, beautiful ambience, plenty of attention to detail with the tackle/baits/etc.Music - I've only heard a single track so far, but it's good.  That is the style that is fitting for a fishing simulation, and I'd love to hear more others like it!Fish species - It's nice to see no limitation imposed; carp, bass, catfish, sunfish, etc. - they all matter.Realism - FINALLY, no forced underwater view!  No annoying announcers.  No arcade elements.  A simulation :-)Tutorials - A nice touch.Support / dev feedback / wiki - Some of the best I've seen anywhere.  Listening to your user base and keeping them 'in the loop' will help keep this game thriving for years to come. "

								I enjoy this game, it is a delight morning coffee or evening adult beverage sort of game for the casual players or those just looking to ""get away from it all"" for bit. On the other hand it does have a bit of a challenge, if you come into the game understanding that it is a fishing game, and just like in life you have to wait, and you have to try diffferent bait and different places to cast in order to catch the fish you want, then you should have a fun time with the challenge. Players expecting to cast and instantly reel in fish after fish are going to be disapointed by the game, but you should still give it a chance it can be challenging, relaxing, and the community is very kind and helpful.

There are also leader boards, that reset every 7 dsys, fun to attempt to get your name listed, adds stress.  Not bad  stress just the stress of competition.  Some people think it is tough at that start, and it is.  However, this is what makes it so fun and different.  We get so used to go here do this.  You all what  I am talking about; pick up a quest, wiki the quest and it says go here do this complete the quest.  The days of having to figure out how to complete a quest are gone.  WoW has an arrow pointing the direction you need to go, where's the fun in that?  This is a fishing game, and like fishing, you never know what lies beneith the waves.			"

								Given that I'm not an avid fisherman, I was quite surprised by how quickly I liked the game despite how overwhelming and confusing it is for new players (further compounded by being an inexperienced fisherman) but thankfully, there are a handful of thoughtful guides / tutorials that have been generously provided by the community. Graphics are remarkably beautiful to boot. This game isn't going to blow your mind but for a blissful, fishing simulator, I'll give it a 10/10.			"

								It's a fun game and could really become a great one. As an avid fisherman myself, the dynamics and such make sense. It is easy and at time, very frustrating -- just like fishing.The developers take into account the different combination of lures, colors, sizes, and such for different areas. Thus, giving you huge amount of combination to try and catch different types of fish.Also, if you were having a bad year of fishing (which I was), this gives you some ability to try out fishing ideas in a simulated setting. Overall, I would recommend it.			"

								Just starting. What's going on?I just downloaded this game, excited to play it since I love fishing simulators. But for some reason whenever I start to play the game, the camera keeps switching from the ground to the sky. I can't control it and I don't know if it's me, the game, or my computer. My laptop has all the credentials needed to play the game, it's just the camera thing that I have the problem with. If anyone knows how to fix this problem please let me know.Aside from this problem, if this game is as awesome as it says it is, I would definitely recommend it.==UPDATE==Found the solution in the troubleshooting page.

								After playing about three hours of this game, I can say that this game is pretty good for a simulator. i get a sense of satisfaction everytime i catch a fish, maybe it's the feeling of progress I don't know. it's something someone who knows nothing about fishing can pick up and play, and have a good time. You don't have to spend money on this game, it gives you premium currency everytime you level. But if you want to spend money, than you can get access to stuff faster. Personally i think you shouldn't spend money on this game, except to support the devs but if you spend money to get an edge. Why? there's next to no competition, so why spend money to level faster? Unless of course you have money to spend, in which case go wild!10 ata 10Would fish for catfish again			"

								First off, RECOMMENDing this game, Really love the ""Fish-iques"". It's nice, smooth and looks and feels good.Been playing for 7 hours now, took me quite a while to get from level 2 to 3 but then, and only then it get's interesting.So please hang in there and be patient to reel in all those bluegills. So I recommend you guys and girls to hang in there, otherwise you will be losing a lot of fun yet to come.The DLC is not game ruining in any way. I can only hope they add more content and keep this game alive. I am only missing the ""multiplayer"" effect. Apart from being on Teamspeak with my mates and cracking open some sixpacks while fishing, it would be a big (+) to interact ingame in a better way.			"

								Totally awesome game.  People say it is relaxing, and it is to start.  At some point it is fun to fish tournments, adds stress but fun.  There are also leader boards, that reset every 7 dsys, fun to attempt to get your name listed, adds stress.  Not bad  stress just the stress of competition.  Some people think it is tough at that start, and it is.  However, this is what makes it so fun and different.  We get so used to go here do this.  You all what  I am talking about; pick up a quest, wiki the quest and it says go here do this complete the quest.  The days of having to figure out how to complete a quest are gone.  WoW has an arrow pointing the direction you need to go, where's the fun in that?  This is a fishing game, and like fishing, you never know what lies beneith the waves.			"

I missed dinner because I told myself ""just one more fish and ill go eat"" ♥♥♥♥ its 3 AM and that was at 6 PM. A great relaxing game, even with minor bugs with tackle. You should buy the game, but its free. Again the women will pop a top if she finds out, trust me boys.

YouTube™ Video: Fishing Planet PC Early Access Review 

			Views: 37		

			I'm back and this week I review an Early Access Free-to-Play Game. Fishing Planet. This is essentially a fishing simulator that is showing a lot of promise.		

The long review: This is essentially a fishing simulator that is showing a lot of promise.  The possible expansions they have planned is intriguing but the basics make you feel like you are out there fishing.Game play it is very basic, cast, wait for a bite, reel the fish in.  There are casting rods if you prefer that to sitting watching a float.  The bigger the fish typically the better the experience which helps unlock the better equipment.Micro-transactions are not rammed down your throat and they are using a model of premium time or buying currency much like World of Tanks.  Also similar to World of Tanks the better bait is premium currency.If the devs round out even what they say is coming this will provide many hours of entertainment.  Other locations would be awesome too, along with deep sea fishing?  Plus it is free-to-play without buy this everywhere.			"

								This is hands down the best fishing game I've ever played. Focuses more on realism instead of magic bait cameras, and looks great too. The best part? It's actually F2P unlike a certain hunting game I won't mention by name...Only complaint I have is that lure fishing (such as spoons) needs a little more feedback to it. With no physical feedback (i.e. like you'd get with a controller vibrating) it's hard to know if you've got a hit or not.			"

								First off, RECOMMENDing this game, Really love the ""Fish-iques"". It's nice, smooth and looks and feels good.Been playing for 7 hours now, took me quite a while to get from level 2 to 3 but then, and only then it get's interesting.So please hang in there and be patient to reel in all those bluegills. So I recommend you guys and girls to hang in there, otherwise you will be losing a lot of fun yet to come.The DLC is not game ruining in any way. I can only hope they add more content and keep this game alive. I am only missing the ""multiplayer"" effect. Apart from being on Teamspeak with my mates and cracking open some sixpacks while fishing, it would be a big (+) to interact ingame in a better way.			"

Game is really interesting to play,it keeps me really busy and I find it relaxing. I would recommend it to anyone who likes fishing irl,or fishing games,and to those new to all this who never tried irl or ingame fishing before.I myself can't go outdoors and fish with my friends due to being too busy but i can sit down here and have some fun with this game. Great game and they only begun to develop it,more interesting stuff will come soon,and I bet even more in future.			"

								This game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and one of the best fishing games I have ever seen!! This game WILL BE the best in the type. I would 100% love to see open pond and boats aswell as maybe later bow fishing, ocean fishing, deep sea sport fishers. That type of things that you HAVE to spend a few nights out on the boat with your friends and or club to be the best or some type of thing like that I would REALLY like to see spear fishing and most of all right now sooner then later I would love  fly fishing to be put in. Also Maybe when you add the bay and ocean type fishing put something like a throw net or casting nets also maybe some type of minnow trap or pot. This really is a endless type of expansion for this type of game. "

								after playing 7 hours straight and catching this most recent fish i decided that a review for this game would best be put in a story of the monster catch i made.                                                                 ----------------------------------------------- It was a dark, stormy afternoon. I had set out that morning with the few fishing accessories i could scrounge up after only 5 hours of fishing experience. Although all I had was a float caster, 3lb test and small cutbait to my name, I was soon to have a legacy. I went out in search of the biggest thing in my hometown lake, the aligator gar. I felt him nibbling at my hook, and it was all I could do to wait for the time when he was most vulnerable...BAM. he was on, and i was ready. he took me to the end of me line and held me there for what seemed like centuries. after he was done torturing me at that distance he was running low on power. I brought all the strength I had left to the end of my pole and pulled relentlessly against him. I tell you it was half past 2 by the time I got em this far. slowly i pulled him in, one foot at a time until he decided to get up and runoff again! I was disheartened by the affair but continued to pull him in. me friends all told me that it was an impossible task, break me line. oh no...not me. Ill never be conqured by a wee fish! now the time was 3:15 when i finally got him to 10 feet, and i had not a single foot o' pullin left in me so I ran into the water and jumped on him. I saw the beast in all his glory as i pulled him out of the water. my friends were amazed, never to speak an off word to me again. I became a legend that night, I became immortal.                                                                        ---------------------------over the course of hauling in the fish, it was the coolest experience ive had with a ftp game. the community is nice and helpful, the game is relaxing and overall its something worth wasting a lot of time on. The physics need work still since i was able to catch a 30 lb gar on 3lb test, but other than that Im very pleased with what ive seen so far and think its really worth playing.			"

								The game is very buggy, but this is to be expected as it is in early alpha, but this game has SO much potential. I have wanted a fishing game like this, and I am sure many others have as well. It is extremely realistic and in depth, the graphics are fantastic. You progress by catching different fish, the bigger the better. Once you earn enough in game cash you can buy fishing licenses for different lakes. It may seem like a grind for the first lvl or 2 but it can get very addictive. I give it a 7.5/10.			"

								Not bad one of the better fishing simulators decent graphics, decent simulation of fishing etc lots of good points most others have covered so I'll just list the bads.1. The tutorial can be a pita.. there really needs to be a way to skip it.2. I've multiple controllers plugged in.. the game seems to focus on my rudder pedals and there appears to be no method to tell it otherwise.3. It's limited to 2 cast types.. which means that doing skip casts, side casts, hook casts etc..that you might use to get into or under things aren't avalible.			"

								Originally, I was going to put a funny review like ""♥♥♥♥ catfish"" or ""more like Bluegill Planet LOL"", but I guess I might as well make something serious once a while, right?The game has a memory leak thing going on, make sure to turn of anti-aliasing or else you might experience severe FPS drops (I'm talking like dropping down to 5 FPS) after about 1 hour of play.The game is incredibly slow at first because until you hit level 3, all you can do is cast bait and wait for something to bite. And without actually knowing anything about fishing, that's going to be Bluegills. Or Pumpkinseed. Very rarely. So what do you do? You... actually figure out how to fish. Either do that by asking people in the chat (because we all love answering 10 times a day how to catch a bass or catfish), or by reading the absolutely marvelous Steam guides. You could also actually read up on how to catch this thing IRL, because this simulator is incredibly realistic in the sense that they implemented real-life fishing tactics to work ingame. That's pretty sick.Once you hit 3, you probably want to grab yourself a Spinning Rod and, well, spin. That's a much needed change of pace I found, since instead of waiting for something you bite you reel in the lure... and then you wait for something to bite. I don't know what people expect, this is a fishing simulator. Pretty much all you do is wait for something to bite. It's incredibly engaging if you like exploring areas, figuring out cool fishing spots, and eventually collecting all the different sorts of fish that are in the game. I would like to mention, I've played for like 30 hours now and I haven't even seen half of what the game has to offer. That is, of course, in part because of the relatively slow leveling system, but also because the game actually has a substantial amount of content for something so recently released. For a free to play Early Access game, it's actually amazing of how much content this game has compared to some other games on Steam.It should be mentioned that ANYTHING in the game can be obtained with ingame money. You do not need to spend a single cent on this game. Sure, yes, of course, it speeds things up, but not even by a significant amount. Fishing isn't ""easier"" by buying things. In fact, reeling in a big fish is completely skill-based, and even if you spent a hundred bucks it won't be any easier. That's because the most powerful equipment in the game is purchased by achievement coins. And, as you guessed, you get those coins by doing achievements or logging in 5 days in a row. You can only buy regular money with real money, and that's stuff you usually get plenty of ingame. Personally, the only really overpriced thing in the game in my opinion are licenses for new areas. And that's only because I want to save up for permanent licenses. Licenses to catch certain fish are cheap for a day, and probably worth investing in if you play the game often, I just really hate buying timed stuff because I feel forced to play something instead of doing it on my own.All in all, this is an incredibly solid fishing experience, it's addicting if you like collecting stuff and not a whole lot of fun unless you like fishing. But give it a try, it's free. Maybe you're like me, and you didn't even know you have a passion for fishing.			"

								Do you like fishing? Say no more! This is the best fishing game ive ever played! Hands down. Very rewarding and you get a sense of anger when you miss a fish. Too legit to quit. You will have to make sure you uninstall your wifes voice box, as this game will make her squak if she finds out you can fish online. I missed dinner because I told myself ""just one more fish and ill go eat"" ♥♥♥♥ its 3 AM and that was at 6 PM. A great relaxing game, even with minor bugs with tackle. You should buy the game, but its free. Again the women will pop a top if she finds out, trust me boys. Dont miss dinner.PS: I know men have a hard time figuring out women, for the love of god dont let her find out about this game, there will be boycotts.			"

								This game brings me back to the old fishing games I had on my old Windows 98. This game has hours of game time and a good time killer. The baits, the lures are great. The environments, the detail on the fish are pretty good no complaints just wish there were boats. I mean its cool bank side fishing, but more of a full river fishing would be nice. I would say this game is 9/10 all day. This game is awesome.			"

YouTube™ Video: Let's Play Fishing Planet EP1 Emerald Lake 

			Views: 7,324		

			Let's catch some damn fish! Get this game for FREE on steam here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/380600/		

I feel this FTP Fishing Simulator has alot going for it, but most of all I think it's fun to play and the microtransactions don't interfere with my enjoyment of the game. As I understand it everything in the game you can unlock without spending real money which I like. The only thing you really need to invest is time at this point. As far as Fishing Simulators go there isn't much to choose from but I feel this is one of the best. You can buy gear from a very imaginative ""online store front"" type menu which I got a big kick out of. It's easy to load an area get your rod out and fish. You have to experiment to learn all the different fishes habits, where they like to go, what they eat, what depth to fish at, weather, and time of day. The descriptions of the various baits, rods, lines, and hooks give you clues as to what fish they will catch.Now the bad, there's a risk of running out of money farely early if you make some bad trips or don't bring the correct bait/rod, OR forget to buy the correct liscence. If you don't have the correct liscence for your target species and you catch a trophie you're forced to throw it back or face a hefty fine. You also need to make sure your stringer or keep net has the capacity to hold a large fish. If you run out of cash you have to either buy more with real money or stop playing and wait till the next real life day where the game gives you some in game cash. It's not a big deal if you know what you're doing and don't make some bad purchases, I however didn't realize this.Overall I'm enjoying the game, the visuals are good and I hope they add more content as time goes on. A 2 player coop where you can actually fish next to your friends on a trip would be great.			"

								Now you too can tell ""the one that got away"" stories at the water cooler on Monday!  The adrenaline rush of landing a trophy fish comes without the fish smell, although sometimes you would swear it is all real...especially the mosquitoes.  I love the scope of the game, from great bass action, to the big lunkers of the northern lakes, to the fun of fighting rainbow trout in Colorado.  Some parts of the game are unrealistic (Atlantic Salmon in Lake Louise - aka White Moose Lake), but all parts are pure unadulterated fun!  DLC adds even more, and a way to get better equipment sooner.  This game is well supported by the community with lots of guides available and plenty of players willing to share advice to get you started.  Join the fun and that 25lb Lake Trout could be mounted above your fireplace by tonight!			"

								Great fishing game guys, the best I have played. Seems to be good time played for rewards given in the game progression, and controls are simple. Players in the chat are happy to give hints to get the big ones. My suggestion to the developers, expand outside the U.S. Some of the best lure fishing in the world is chasing that 1m Barra in the top end of Australia. So I and many other Aussies would love to see that addition to the game and through research I am sure you guys could show the world of Fishing Planet the challenge of hooking one of the most powerful and exciting to catch fresh/saltwater river fish in the world, along with other great species in the topend. Great job on the game so far, keep it going.			"

								after playing 7 hours straight and catching this most recent fish i decided that a review for this game would best be put in a story of the monster catch i made.                                                                 ----------------------------------------------- It was a dark, stormy afternoon. I had set out that morning with the few fishing accessories i could scrounge up after only 5 hours of fishing experience. Although all I had was a float caster, 3lb test and small cutbait to my name, I was soon to have a legacy. I went out in search of the biggest thing in my hometown lake, the aligator gar. I felt him nibbling at my hook, and it was all I could do to wait for the time when he was most vulnerable...BAM. he was on, and i was ready. he took me to the end of me line and held me there for what seemed like centuries. after he was done torturing me at that distance he was running low on power. I brought all the strength I had left to the end of my pole and pulled relentlessly against him. I tell you it was half past 2 by the time I got em this far. slowly i pulled him in, one foot at a time until he decided to get up and runoff again! I was disheartened by the affair but continued to pull him in. me friends all told me that it was an impossible task, break me line. oh no...not me. Ill never be conqured by a wee fish! now the time was 3:15 when i finally got him to 10 feet, and i had not a single foot o' pullin left in me so I ran into the water and jumped on him. I saw the beast in all his glory as i pulled him out of the water. my friends were amazed, never to speak an off word to me again. I became a legend that night, I became immortal.                                                                        ---------------------------over the course of hauling in the fish, it was the coolest experience ive had with a ftp game. the community is nice and helpful, the game is relaxing and overall its something worth wasting a lot of time on. The physics need work still since i was able to catch a 30 lb gar on 3lb test, but other than that Im very pleased with what ive seen so far and think its really worth playing.			"

								First of all, the game is very promising, not just there yet, but has potential of being the best Fishing Simulator so far. But let's check the pros and consPros:- Not just a game, a super realistic simulation- Fully customizable equipment from rods&reels to your hat&boots- Many ways to fish, many places to fish- Again, realistic gameplay forces LICENSES (awesome!)- Good visuals- A really helpful communityCons:- Good graphics brings lag from time to time (though I tried the game after a Starcraft II marathon that lasted over 40 hours, so gotta check it out later.)- F1 Controls Panel is too messy that I closed it right away and asked the community for most of controls- Tutorial? Is there any? I mean ""Throw the bait using LMB *LMB image*"" Thanks mate! Reallly helpful it was. I was about stick rod right up to my a**.-Uhm... I thought this was Multiplayer? I thought it was, Co-Operative? No? Oh... Seriously only thing that looks Multi-Player is the chat-box. Th game promises to have some tournaments but... C'mon WE WANNA THROW THE THINGY TOGETHER!!!Overall, this game is good, looks good, will be even better! 'cuz the game is already good, you can see it in the ""pros"" section up there and it's ""cons"" stated above are al fixable cons. Highly, seriously recommended. I don't know how to wait for my computer to relax a bit to play this game under better circumstances. Add me, message me and blah blah blah-di blah.			"

								This game is amazing! The realism and customization are second to none. I've been a fisherman all my life, but due to my health, I'm not able to get out like I used to. Fishing Planet has helped to relieve those urges. The community is great. There is always going to be an occasional troll, but this isn't a WoW crowd. People on here love to fish and to talk about it. I am almost level 13 after 69 hours of game time and haven't had to spend a single dollar of my money; however, because the devs are doing such a wonderful job, I bought a couple of DLC packs just to support them. More items are coming in addition to game features, but the game is very playable now.Try it out. You only have time to lose.			"

								Now you too can tell ""the one that got away"" stories at the water cooler on Monday!  The adrenaline rush of landing a trophy fish comes without the fish smell, although sometimes you would swear it is all real...especially the mosquitoes.  I love the scope of the game, from great bass action, to the big lunkers of the northern lakes, to the fun of fighting rainbow trout in Colorado.  Some parts of the game are unrealistic (Atlantic Salmon in Lake Louise - aka White Moose Lake), but all parts are pure unadulterated fun!  DLC adds even more, and a way to get better equipment sooner.  This game is well supported by the community with lots of guides available and plenty of players willing to share advice to get you started.  Join the fun and that 25lb Lake Trout could be mounted above your fireplace by tonight!			"

								Great fishing game guys, the best I have played. Seems to be good time played for rewards given in the game progression, and controls are simple. Players in the chat are happy to give hints to get the big ones. My suggestion to the developers, expand outside the U.S. Some of the best lure fishing in the world is chasing that 1m Barra in the top end of Australia. So I and many other Aussies would love to see that addition to the game and through research I am sure you guys could show the world of Fishing Planet the challenge of hooking one of the most powerful and exciting to catch fresh/saltwater river fish in the world, along with other great species in the topend. Great job on the game so far, keep it going.			"

								This is a fun fishing game. No really! It is! It has locations and species that I love to fish. The atmosphere is relaxing and I love fretting about what lure and rig to use to catch what I'm after. I've found that techniques I use IRL seem to work in game too, though some take a little tweaking in game to get right. One aspect I was not looking forward to was the social aspect. It turns out that seeing what others are catching and being able to chat about technique and setups has been a fun experience!This is a darned good fishing game and it's free! In fact, I'd be hard pressed to find one that I enjoy more. Now, if they add some more little goodies like fly fishing streams and more complex lure rigs...The support for this game is pretty snappy too! I ran into a snag with my account and wrote to support. Olga, the awesome support agent, helped me out and go me through the sticky mess. Thank you Olga for helping me out!The Good:  Support  Atmosphere  Fish selection  Tackle selection  Hillbilly music  Seasonal events with a sasquatch fish, aka furry trout. The Bad (ish)  Some rather bizzare physics for the fishing lines at times  Minor clipping errors  No way to suggest features / report bugs in game (it's in alpha)  The furry trout, while fun for an event I worry that the game could become cluttered with make-believe fish			"

			Going mad at this bug when I'm just trying to fish peacefully How do you ignore this wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee http://imgur.com/q3HzqIw		

Editor's note: I didn't uninstall the game I like it too muchAlso the bass fishing is really interactive and fun. Explains through flashing rod stress meters what you have to do, they will break your line and you need to ♥♥♥♥ with the drag on your reel to get your fish; feels like a true challenge everytime you land a nice fish. 10/10 best game, best game, 9/10, 5 stars, 4 stars, 5 stars.The float fishing is realistic, reminds me of dangling bread off the bridge in my local park and catching carp with a handreel.Levelling up takes time and is nicely balanced.The graphics are astounding, the game looks better than Unreal Engine 3 and it's made in bloody Unity. You could never tell it was an engine generally thought of as bad. It's smooth and pretty. Early access probably means some bugs will happen and stuff, but it should be okay as long as it doesn't stay in Early Access forever.			"

								I could write a review full of dank memes and badly written puns... but I won't.Fishing Planet is a fishing simulator that puts you in the boots of a pro fisher wannabe.  You must manage your gear, bait, and areas in which you fish.  In all honestly, it's a step above your average simulator game.  I say this because as I was sitting here, waiting for the next bluegill to bite, I heard the virtual drone of a badly rendered fly.  Instinctively, I swatted my right ear to get rid of it.  Yeah, that didn't work.  Somehow, a game not worth more than a couple minutes worth of play time, 'fer da luls', managed to fully drag me into itself.  It might have been because I haven't slept in several days or that I have finals that I should be studying for.  Nevertheless, as Fishing Planet is free to play, I recommend that you try it out for a few minutes and see if you find the same nirvana I slipped into while playing.  Let the calming music soothe you, the gentle rustle of the wind relax you, and the almost inaudible *BLIPP* as the lure sinks into the water comfort you, until your mind turns to rage at the consistant ""Fish tried to bite and escaped"".

								While grindy, I think this game is a lot of fun. Leveling can can stale and repetitive and money management can be a little bit of an issue, but I think it works well enough for the pacing of the game. I mean it's fishing, you could fill up your fish keeper in half an hour or it could take you 2 hours. To be smart about things you'd have to do a little research, whether it be reading some guides or watching some youtube videos cause venturing past the first two maps could be a little pricey. However if you manage your trip right you could make a lot of money and get a lot of xp.I do feel that this game could use a better tutorial explaining all of the mechanics. The rods and reels could have ""stats"" like speed and stuff that are at least easier explained for people who arent very fishing savvy. This would help in building a set up that works how you want to without regretting it later.All in all I would give this game a solid 8/10 cause it's fun and scratches the itch to want to fish but it could use a little more work.

								I'm an avid angler in RL and the chance to play this free ""after hours"" was a welcome relief from being locked down by windy days, work and life in general. The scenery, while not spectacular, is very nice and the ambience is just so soothing. Rod & Reel action is nicely mimic'd although there are glitches with bouncing rods etc. but you were certainly able to ""feel"" a fish without actually having a tactile sense of it.The fishing predictability is not good though. Rumour has it that devs want to do more here but when you can literally read the chat and copy what everbody else is doing, and it's consistent. Ahhh. It's just not fishing at all.Case in point. Catfish. Cast 10m out towards the green kayak. Set your small cut bait 2m down and you are as good as guaranteed a quality catfish. I fished after 19:00 everytime and was pulling trophy catfish (in excess of 3kg) almost one after the other. Want trout? 7g rainbow spinner, cast to 4th tree while standing on square rock and use a Stop & Go retrieve. 16:00 - 18:00 hours is what they all say. Sure enough. Trout.The fishing became very, very predictable. Even worse, variations inevitably produced very little so you end up just reverting to same ol' same ol' just to keep the catch rate up... and you need the catch rate because devs wrapped what you catch to a levelling system. imho, the devs made a mistake here, ie: making areas and species accessible only through skilling up. This is done purely by grinding through scores of fish. You can't buy past it (deliberate pun there folks), you can't cicumvent. You just have to do it.  Equipment and more ""advanced"" baits etc. are also wrapped around the same modelling. It soon became obvious that to be able to fish for the more legendary species in the more exotic locations with the better rigs, baits and lures you would need hours (and hours) of doing the same thing over and over. This just doesn't happen in RL and it annoys me. When a game claims to be a ""simulator"" it needs to simulate, not inhibit gameplay with some trite levelling more akin to an RPG. The reasoning behind such a system completely escapes me. It's almost like the devs want you to play the entire game sequentially to make sure you admire everything they've done.The best bit though (no, it is), the game is absolutely F2P but... it's really grindy to do so. You can take a credit card swipe for some faster skill point bonuses and ""advanced"" fish licences but it just seems to be so little value for money. If RM gave access to better areas and equipment ( not tied to comps/tourneys obviously ) rather than ""purchasing"" XP boost so you can get to better areas faster, it would certainly entice me to open the coin purse a little more readily.All in all, a good relaxing game despite the predicability, and given you can progress through the entire game and never spend a cent, can't complain too much. If you like fishing, grab it now. Being free makes any Early Access argument about completion/development rate V purchase risk completely moot.7/10Go fishin'			"

								For a fishing game, and me being a fisheran, I have found this game to be very true in so many respects, while there are some minor problems with how the ine acts, and reacts to the water, and the casting mechanics can sometimes be wonky, HOWEVER, the fish all respond the proper way, they hit the baits the same way real fish do, and their fights are much the same as in real life as ye can get without actually feeling the rod bend in your hands and the thrill of the first solid hook. The only other problem is that it will run your video card on the hot side due to the fact that they rendered the entire space and the trees on the far side of the water area, as wel as the water surface and reflections, so that graphics card can get a real workout, but it is VERY Much Worth it if you are a real fisherman.  So far I have managed to take the time and slowly, oh so slowly, bring in a 17+lb Flathead Catfish on 8 lb test.  Just a matter of playing him out, letting him run under light but constant, wearing tension, the tension keeps it moving to escape, which will, eventually, hopefully, tire it out so that you can then slowly bring it in to you.  So, I would Heartily Reccomend this game to any and all folks wo either fish or would like to learn how.Say ""HI"" to Cutch fer me, I visited him long ago and got my copy of DeerHunter 2K5 from him, such a good fellow, knew some of the folks my grandparents did, similar hunting and fishing areas, and he was an excellent games tester as for the reality end.!Chuck Sweet as Steelwolf			"

								This INDIE game really isn't good enough to be asking these amounts of money for DLC's. Even proper games usually don't go over 15.00. 45.99 for a DLC? It should be 5.99 for the whole lot if you ask me. I've seen better fishing games on Android and they're cheaper too!This is probably another early access scam where the devs rake in the dough while probably stopping development in the near future.In my opinion Steam should not allow any early access game to release DLC until a decent v1.0 game is released.

								Great game, I'm hoping for multiplayer soon. It is a grind ill admit, but plenty fun if you enjoy fishing and would enjoy a game like this, just kick back and click the mouse, that's it really. Very fun none the less!			"

								If you are looking for a game to make you look like an incomptent 30 year old who lacks the money and time to actually fish, than this game will suit you well. In my 11 minute jouney through this game I came to the conclusion that my peak of satisfaction with this game, came when I finished installing it, everything after that was no bagucci.			"

								Finally! A fishing game we've been waiting for! And i couldn't believe that it's FREE!!! I couldn't believe that it's genuinely free! You don't come across games like this very often anymore,Pros:Amazing graphics,Realistic tackleRealistic fish fightingSuper fun to playRelaxingInteraction with other people in the chatFuture updates look super fun!Cons:Not open world which i would like, Since some places are close to each other and would have been enjoyable walking on the trail to the next spotNot a huge range of weather patterns (As of writing this review, Sunny, Cloudy, Rain, No Thunder or Major storm)Update: Open world is slowly coming to life! Which i enjoy very much!As of now in it's early access stage, It is a very fun game to play, Starting to feel like you're fishing in real life! I would rate it 8/10.			"

								This fishing game has high hopes of being what many have wanted for years. This has already bypassed anything ever put out before. It is free to play with real money transactions. But it isnt done in a way you feel like your being robbed. Will add more as I play more. As 4 hours really dont qualify as a enogh time to review a game.When my Friend and I was running BigGameLodge back in the days when Deer Hunter by Atari was popular we dealt with alot of bad mouth people we also didnt put up with it as well. Im glad to see someone care so much about Fishing that this game really pulls off well. Wish everyone took this much passion in to these games instead of just making a quick buck. Looking forward to the future.			"

								Reason for down vote:1. 75$ of DLC when the game is not even finished yet. This is the main reason why I am no longer buying Total War series. DLC should be mini-expansion packs, not extra cash grab to unlock whats part of the base game. Having DLC on release day is a slap in the wallet. 75$ is more than what a brand name game costs, what would justify paying that for this? While this particular base game is free, it is only for the moment.2. Want to catch trophy fish? Well, go to the right spot, get the one lure that allows you to catch it, and cast. That's it. No variation, no trick of the trade, nothing. Grind to the right lure, grind for in game money, travel to the next location. Repeat.			"

								This in an awesome game if you enjoy fishing. Very realistic feel to the game. You don't find catfish roaming the surface for flies, pan fish aren't hiding at the bottom. Generally the fish are where they would be in real life. The different tecniques used help you fish more like yourself rather than simply casting and reeling. (twitch, stop & go, lift and drop)The leveling and trophy systems are great for those who still want something to work towards.The biggest thing about this game is patience... If you are going to play and ONLY worry about levels and trying to go fast... don't bother, It's not Call of Duty, you're not meant to level as high as you can in one day, you're not going to catch the biggest fish in the game right away. People in game tend to be pretty friendly, you do get the odd person who just wants attention and blurts out profanity, but for the most part people are willing to help you succeed at what you're doing. Hope this helps some people out.... ohh... and as of the time I'm writting this... it's free..... just get it.... lol			"

								The fish do not fight and you seem to have nocontrol of the distance you cast your bait/lure.You pick your bait, you pick a direction to cast,and you try to set the hook at the right momentwith the right-mouse button. Once hooked, youretrieve your catch with the left-mouse button.The graphics beautifully depict the outdoorenvironment, but there is no graphics to showfish movement or behavior under the water, andonce caught the fish do not look life-like.Point and click fishing.The game looks nice, but it is really no moreadvanced than ""♥♥♥♥♥♥Olson's Bass Tour"" for DOSfrom 1988.

								I had to stop fishing Trophy Rainbow Trout out in colarado just to write this review! First of all I am not an avid fisherman in real life, I have gone fishing a few times as a kid as most people have, however I never really had the ability or drive to make it a real hobby. With that being said, I was still able to really enjoy this game, and am continuing to enjoy  it so far. Now it should be noted that this game is very realistic, every fish has its own specific set of baits, water depths, and areas/ times of day they like. So if you have fished before, or know a bit about fishing it makes this game a bit easier. However even if you really don't know too much about fishing, a lot of the fun i personally had with this game, was researching what different fish liked, and trying to find my own areas and baits that worked for me. Fish fights have been improved since the inital launch of this game, you can really feel the difference between a normal fish, and a trophy fish. Sometimes forcing you into a fish fight between 60 seconds, to a few minutes! It's really an exciting feeling when you first catch that big catch.  It should be noted that for the first hour of playing will be spent catching 0.5lb Blue Gills, and such. This is too introduce you to bobber fishing, once you are level 3, you should go buy a spoon, and try casting in the reeds for some bass, or throw some petfood on your bobber, and set the line to max and try to catch some catfish. YOU SHOULD TRY THIS GAME.(RESERVED) I Intend to review some of the interfaces and high level play at a later date.			"

								I am hooked! I would be okay paying for this game, but they let you have it for free! There are some things I would like to see added but It still early access. I've experienced remarkably smooth gameplay.  Havn't found a bug yet. I did have to turn down the rendering settings a notch because my CPU started to overheat.  The game mechanics are awesome. There is no stupid underwater mini game you play to catch the fish like you see in other fishing games. This uses rod+reel+line+drag+patience=fish on! Choose your gear and fill your tacklebox before heading out to the water. Seems like most items can be unlocked and purchased within the game using the money you earn while fishing, I kind of like having to work up the ladder so to speak, Wondering if they'll ever introduce boats and sonar. Rod holders + bite buzzers? Polarized sunglasses? If you like to fish, you will love this game. If you want to learn how to fish for real, this game shows you all the basics to get started. If you hate fishing and simulators, this mnight not be for you.			"

								This game really took me by surprise! I am typically more into FPS, Fighting and MMORPG's - I gave this game a try because it was free, and boy was it a decision that I am happy I made. This game is seriously a ton of fun, I could literally spend hours playing this game. I got to learn a lot about fishing tactics, best methods, and more than I ever would have expected from a fishing simulator. The graphics are nice, the environment and ambient sounds are a masterpiece as well... the game, within a few minutes can take you away from the daily grind and helps you feel relaxed. The only drawback is, I can't really cook the fish. Aside from that, downloading, installing and playing this game is highly recommended. It is also very addictive and hours will go by because of all the fun you'll be having and not even know it. Leveling is perfect and keeps you begging for more.			"

								I usually enjoy a good fishing simulator, but for some reason I just didn't click with this one. Nothing major against it, just some little things. Mainly, I would appreciate some extra sound, such as the fishing rod making a noise when reeling in, giving just that little extra sense of depth. Then again, this was a free game so I can't complain too much. I only gave a thumbs down because there was no neutral option.			"

								Good game, nice graphics, if you like fishing, this game is worth to try, first 5 hours was really fun, but then you accidentally spends all your in game money traveling to another country(its not cheap) and forgot to buy that place fishing license, and all you caches will be illegal, now you have no money, to start play normal again you have to spend you real money, THAT IS VERY EXPENSIVE, level gains very slow(lvl needed for better equipment and for traveling, traveling need high levels and its expensive, every fishing place have only two small fishing spots - BORING!!!), want to gain it faster - Pay sick money for that, want to travel to another country and buy some fishing equipment - PAY SICK MONEY AGAIN, SO i think its cheaper to fishing in real life(at least in my country) where you can get more FUN then in this game!! sorry for my english...

								20/10 would play again! This game is awesome, it really feels like you are there by yourself fishing. But of course, you need patience and the smallest bit of experience with fishing with this game. Leveling up from level 2 to 3 is the hardest part of the game, i've been through that and when i was level 3 my life became 10 times easier.  Anyways, this game has great graphics and great phisycs and it's the perfect game for the ones who are looking for a good fishing game			"

								What a game!Been wanting to return to fishing for a while now, I came across this game a couple of weeks ago and I am having a whale of a time, you start off using basic fishing gear and you can work your way up, fish in different areas and catch a whole variety of fish.This game offers the opportunity to try loads of techniques to catch the fish you're looking for, the tutorials were excellent and dont give too much away which is perfect.as a summary this is in my opinon the best fishing game out there and doesnt seem to be a drag when ranking up, after a little dedication and patience, you too will have a blast!

Early Access Review
								     This game is what an early access game on Steam should be. Note, it isn't perfect it does occasionally crash and lag out. Majority of that has been fixed in the last 4 days. Also, those negative reviews are BS, they are people who hate the idea of even a modicum of micro transactions in a game and have computers made in 2002 so they can't run it well enough either. Yes the first hour or so is slow, all you catch is Bluegill and Crappie, but read reviews, do research and you learn that by lvl 4 or 5 you can bass fish. This makes the leveling up process much faster and much more enjoyable.     The micro transactions are limited to spend lots of money to be able to have gear in order to catch certain fish, or spend money to get a 50%XP increase per fish (not a big deal)and finally, get some ingame dollars. You cannot buy gold coins, they only come from unique fish (which  you need to work extremely hard for).     The gameplay is amazing, it's got realistic physics on spin fishing and even cast fishing. They occasional bug happens but this is an early access game for christs sake come on. Yeah, the drag systems aren't neccesarily realistic, but it's easy enough to understand, you shouldn't have issues not breaking stuff.     Most importantly this game gives you stockholm syndrome. It's that abusive boyfriend or girlfriend you have that you can't help but love. It is hard, and♥♥♥♥♥♥happens, but when things go right, it feels absolutely amazing. It's all forgiven for that one 5.2 LBS trophy largemouth bass that you worked so hard for.rating 10/10 addictive and a great simulator			"

								I love this game I must say, having never fished in real life but wanting to this is great fun, I liked the challenge of getting past the lower lvl' sand away from catching the dreaded bluegill, but once in game I have found people really helpful if steering you in the right direction for bass and cats. I do think that sorting the friends and chat should be top of the list, it sucks being in a good chat group just for then day to end, jump back in and your with a whole new group. All in all for a game in beta this is fantastic, with the right choices this game could be amazing once fully released. Would love to hear from a dev about what they have in mind for the club aspect, this could be a huge selling point having club competitions and so in.			"

If something bad happened where i ran out of money it was my fault, and i went back to the starte lake and made my way up again. This game doesn't even require you to spend real money to buy anything as all my gear i got was from just playing the game and earning money. Play the game right and you will never experience a problem. P.S.. Bugs are a given in free to play games, but none of the bugs in this game alter the ability to catch a fish.			"

								I've never fished irl but I'm strangely addicted to this game.  When starting out, please refer to guides and tutorials. Those as always, help you familiarise with the mechanics. Leveling is easy when you target specific fishes that generally give more exp or money. You need to pay attention to the details of your gear to land anything more than the basic bluegill and not break your line. Also the weather and time chart affect's the strike rate. Paid dlcs for the most part, give you gear that you would otherwise not be able to get at your level. However, it is optional as you can get your gear without paying a dime.  One of things I don't like is that you can fish with other people but you can't phyiscally see them in game. You only see them in chat.  I'd say give this a try if youre interested in fishing. It's free anyways.			"

Now lets start off like this:This game is a really good representation of really fishing. you don't catch fish every cast and when you do catch fish, it isn't a giant (1-2 pounder bass wise). The mechanics are really good and i mean this game runs smooth on a laptop not designed for gaming so thats a big pro. Ok now... the cons (subjective maybe) Ok so the way you have get snagged. its annoying but it isnt killing the game. I love fishing lillie pads but almost everytime I get snagged. again maybe subjective. another con has to be where you can fish on a lake. I feel that it is just way to limited. I know you can cast to places you can't wallk but what if you want to cast that way but at a different angle? I feel that instead of putting markers down there should be one at the louge or whatever and then you can walk whereever you please around the pond/lake (river is different maybe section the it off would be good.  I think it just gets to crowded sometimes. remember you got this game realistic   how about add to that by adding this to it.     ummm other than that I think this game is really good. great job devs! now.. do I recommend this game. yes absolutly but ONLY if you don't care for long waits before you get a fish or the fish you want.

								The game is fun, until you start moving to locations where you need to pay for a license.  I have no issue with the cost of them, it's the fact that their duration is in REAL LIFE days, whereas the everything else in the game is in GAME days.  This makes no sense other than to force us to play (and fill your net) every day for the duration of the license.Sure you, can buy an unlimited license, but they are sooooo expensive.Until this is resolved, I will not return to the game.  Shame - it's the only thing that ruins it!			"

								What a terrific fishing game! I downloaded this game on a whim, as I'm an avid angler myself. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality this game offers. You have to pick the correct location, spot, and equipment for the fish that you're trying to catch. There is a cash store that helps to unlock some content, but that was to be expected. Overall, I would certainly recommend this game to any fisherman who doesn't have time to fish in RL. Awesome game!			"

								This game is awesome. Free to play OR you could support the developers with buying DLC packs that will advance you through the game faster. I like the many choices available. You can fish with a bobber and chill out OR use a lure and keep those fingers moving. You can pick your own style and fish for whatever you want. There are plenty of fishing spots. Graphics are great. I would not mind supporting this game at all considering I used to pay $50 - $60 on a console game that I played by myself. This game allows you to play with your friends and people all over the world. I will say it again. This game is awesome.			"

								Before I tell you what I think about this game you need take under consideration is this is a game in early stages still not near the finish product they want good constructive criticism help better the gameplay. They want you test it out give them constructive criticism before the finished product out that all said theres still alot ahead to make it a great game but it is on the correct path for that. The players vary from good helpful to a few bad eggs for advice like any game but asking is good do your research when testing this game youtube videos of catching fish one great way for a base line of fishing at a lake. When this game finally is a what the staff they generally want as a finished product they won't stop they will continue make a great game for this they need support for players with constructive criticism as one means. That all said everything in the game is so lifelike fishing wise theres a few minor bugs but theres not a single game out there with them. If you want the most realistic fishing game with huge potential try Fishing Planet.  If you need help ask me tommyangeloEnjoy			"

								After 1671 hours of play I've decided that a reveiw is in order! This Game is a ""simulation"" type of game. It is intended for those that wish to learn about fishing in real life while still having an enjoyable experience playing a game from what I can tell. It has a steep learning curve for beginners. It is advised that alll new players use the tutorials and Youtube video's to help them advance to the higher levels. As it stands now, the more durable gear is accesible thru purchase outright,or purchase ingame with ingame currency after reaching certain levels.I find the game to be enjoyable,and relaxing. After a hard day of work,the sounds of the great outdoors,and companionship of the social aspects of the game are fantastic.			"

								Good game, particularly so for a fishing game, and free to play no less. Most fishing games dissapoint me pretty badly and so I hadn't actually played one for a while. I decided to give Fishing Planet a chance and found it to be a pretty cool game. Yes it can be a bit slow, and it can seem almost impossible to catch fish at times but it seems like every time I had issues the community was able to help me out. It's pretty common for the people online to be helpful and pretty friendly in my experience. All around this game is pretty fun, and although I haven't played much in the last few weeks and the dynamic can always change, it seems like it tends to draw a pretty decent crowd of players. If you enjoy fishing enough to enjoy fishing games, or otherwise like fishing games I would recommend giving this game a shot.			"

								A very good ‘free to play’ experience for a casual dip. Though ultimately a game which loses itself between visions of a great Fishing Simulation and just a Fishing Game.Akin to a Hollywood movie, which having employed a quality writer, director and cast, is sabotaged by producers and editors imposing a 'lollypop' formula upon it. Having lost sight of the fact that fishing is the most popular sport on the planet, the producers decided to change direction mid project. Distancing themselves from an audience seeking a long term relationship they opened the door on a casual fling. This compromise will leave both the non fisher and fisher feeling unfulfilled. Great promise replaced by short term gratification.‘Lollypops’, in the form of paid DLC, throw balance out the window. They provide a short term ‘hit’ for those not seeking a simulation, though hardly encourage any hopes of longevity for the project.To continue the Hollywood theme. Here we have a movie which will benefit from a ‘Directors Cut’ sometime in the future.Meanwhile, enjoy the initial free to play part and don’t grieve too much over the producers missed opportunity.  Their loss, my disappointment. GM			"

								How many of my 275 hours have i sat casting into water with 0 chance a fish will spawn because i am 2 feet outside the spawn box when IRL you would expect fish there.I loved this game until i started to find out more about how it works and now i am not enjoying it anymore :( i wish i could go back in time.Ignorance is BlissRecently from various Steam community discussions i found out more about how the game works specifically fish spawning in boxes i do not understand it well but if gives me the impression that fish spawn when you cast in box 1, 2, 3, 4 etc around the lake and outside the box’s no fish will spawn.I always knew the fish where in locations from chat and guides but for a long time i actually thought there where fish there then i saw chat mentioning fish spawning when you cast and that there where not fish in the water i was a bit disappointed but ok with this at first thinking there must be some complicated system and well it probably is quite complicated but now reading about spawn boxes and it seams you are in or out of them chance at a fish or no chance and also seeing a image or 2 posted it just makes me think i am completely wasting my time with a bunch of my casts not hitting spawn boxes and it is so not like real life we might as well be standing in a field casting at a fishing tank if we miss nothing if we get in the tank a chance at a fish. I want to know i have a small chance at a fish every cast anywhere, if the lakes are completely covered  in spawn boxes, zones or whatever with different % chance on a fish spawning wherever i cast in the lake i would be happy enough to continue playing this game but from what i can tell at the moment that is not the way things are and it completely puts me off the game.I also do not understand whey we can’t have fish in the lakes swimming around its not like we have a huge distance we can cast so load distance for the fish from the player or we could even have them load in each time a cast is made using distance from the lure/float as the spawn distance. playing other games there are so many things spawned in and out as you move around loads going on at a huge distance why on earth could we not have even as little as 10 fish spawn in X feet around the lure each cast each fish with a large area of interest around it if it makes contact with the lure a random number roll or whatever decides if the fish will go after it or if we can manage 100 or more fish spawn in each time the area of interest for each fish could be a lot smaller. i have only ever made simple flash games so i have no real idea what i am talking about other than what i have seen in other games but i do not see a lot going on in FP compared to almost any other game i have played the last few years, can we only handle a not very interactive environment simple sky along with the player and 1 fish at a time could be i am just completely lacking in understanding.The FP team need to learn from other games how you do an event catching 4th of July Historic fish was not a fun thing to do. They gave us new Historic versions of fish we knew well and made them spawn in different locations and god knows what other things the changed about them, i only managed 2 and spent what i think is a lot of time for an event on a 3rd then after reading the problems other people where having along with the fact some seamed to be uncatchable i gave up on it and decided to give up on the game.Opening up the high level lakes to all players so they could get the flags seamed confuse people thinking it was so they could fish for historic fish so they got fines.They could of made this a fun holiday event if they made all the historic fish catchable with an average of say 1 hour spent per fish and they could of separated the event given high level players the chance to show off going after say just the biggest historic Muskie get there name on a special leader bored that would last until the next time the event came around.If they gave a duplicate version of one of the high level rod/reel/line setups that was not reparable to all players they could of then opened up all the lakes other than Michigan for 3 days even giving free travel for all players for 3 days so everyone could do the historic fish event with a total time say 5-8 hours over 3 day to get them all make it a fun event so many can get a hat and give a second hat for getting all the flag poles so even people who only have spare time to log on for a few hours the holiday weekend can get something out of it. Everyone would get to use the nice setup to get an XP boost over the 3 days and continue using it until the durability ran out or they could just remove it after the event and low level players could experience some of what they have to look forward to encouraging them to grind up the levels. Should not be making cash and gold so hard for low lvl people to deal with you want to draw many people into the game then make money out of them not give the new players the hardest time its so simple to make gold and cash at a higher level with a long trip taking a few rods and reels.Make money off high level players, give us a holiday destination something like one of them amazing places in Thailand where they have rare huge fish from all over the world that is a dream holiday destination for real life. you could charge a huge travel fee in credits and only give us say 3 in game days there per trip and it would not be possible to make any credits there only a lot of XP so people want to keep going back for not just the amazing fishing but the XP. Make it so expensive it takes many hours farming credits per trip so even the hard core players need to spend a chunk of hours to visit two or 3 times a week real time so people will have to get credits on the store for Real money if they want spend more time there getting on leaderboards, having fun or farming XP.If you want to make money off low level players let them unlock higher level lakes with real money and they will also get dlc rods etc on the store to be able to fish there, you will always find people willing to pay for a boost.

								This game is awesome. Free to play OR you could support the developers with buying DLC packs that will advance you through the game faster. I like the many choices available. You can fish with a bobber and chill out OR use a lure and keep those fingers moving. You can pick your own style and fish for whatever you want. There are plenty of fishing spots. Graphics are great. I would not mind supporting this game at all considering I used to pay $50 - $60 on a console game that I played by myself. This game allows you to play with your friends and people all over the world. I will say it again. This game is awesome.			"

								My positive recommendation is only based off this game being Free to get and play.  This game has been fun to play, though sometimes it feels more like real life fishing with the looooooooong delays between fish caught.  There are also a few bugs that get in the way of catching fish (like being told you've moved the bait too far away from the fish when you haven't moved it).Overall, I've enjoyed the game and I do reccomend giving it a FREE try.However,  I do not reccomend spending a single penny on this game as this time.  If you insist on spending money, do NOT reference the Fishing Planet's Wiki (you know, the first thing that pops up if you search for ""Fishing Planet Premium"" on Google).  It hasn't been updated since 2015 (which I think shows where the developers interests really are) and you will NOT get what it says you will get.Premium only gives 50% more experience and 50% more currency from fish sold.  That's it.  Period.  Pay the $99 (a full, deluxe version of a game these days) for a year of premium and that's still all you will get.So it appears that at a fundemental level they do not understand the relationship a gaming company must have with it's players to hold onto them and become profitable at the same time.  Without some changes this game will eventually die and that makes me a bit sad as I actually enjoy playing it.			"

								If you are an angler, or virtual fishing enthusiast, this game might be for you. I say ""might"", because unless you are willing to spend $50 or more, it is a serious grind to earn money and upgrade your gear. I have 3.1 hours, and am only level 3. I probably will play more at some future date, but I am unwilling to spend either a hundred hours or dollars to make this game enjoyable.  One of the early real money bottlenecks is traveling and day fees. If you don't catch catfish and white crappie all the time, you will run out of in-game currency fast.  This game, like all free to play, is geared toward real money. I wouldn't have a problem with most free to play games, if items and bundles weren't so expensive. I have spent over $100 on TheHunter, Mechwarrior online, etc. Unless free to plays downgrade their premium prices, I won't spend much time in them.			"

								A very good ‘free to play’ experience for a casual dip. Though ultimately a game which loses itself between visions of a great Fishing Simulation and just a Fishing Game.Akin to a Hollywood movie, which having employed a quality writer, director and cast, is sabotaged by producers and editors imposing a 'lollypop' formula upon it. Having lost sight of the fact that fishing is the most popular sport on the planet, the producers decided to change direction mid project. Distancing themselves from an audience seeking a long term relationship they opened the door on a casual fling. This compromise will leave both the non fisher and fisher feeling unfulfilled. Great promise replaced by short term gratification.‘Lollypops’, in the form of paid DLC, throw balance out the window. They provide a short term ‘hit’ for those not seeking a simulation, though hardly encourage any hopes of longevity for the project.To continue the Hollywood theme. Here we have a movie which will benefit from a ‘Directors Cut’ sometime in the future.Meanwhile, enjoy the initial free to play part and don’t grieve too much over the producers missed opportunity.  Their loss, my disappointment. GM			"

								If you are an angler, or virtual fishing enthusiast, this game might be for you. I say ""might"", because unless you are willing to spend $50 or more, it is a serious grind to earn money and upgrade your gear. I have 3.1 hours, and am only level 3. I probably will play more at some future date, but I am unwilling to spend either a hundred hours or dollars to make this game enjoyable.  One of the early real money bottlenecks is traveling and day fees. If you don't catch catfish and white crappie all the time, you will run out of in-game currency fast.  This game, like all free to play, is geared toward real money. I wouldn't have a problem with most free to play games, if items and bundles weren't so expensive. I have spent over $100 on TheHunter, Mechwarrior online, etc. Unless free to plays downgrade their premium prices, I won't spend much time in them.			"

								This game may have potential for some players, but I really don't like the pay-to-win model. There are ingame-purchases you can make for real money which significantly boost yourself ahead. This may work fine on a mobile playing-whilst-on-the-toilet-game, but it is not what I am looking for in a computer game. I would really much like to instead purchase the game and have everything accessible to me through gameplay. This is the main reason for not recommending the game for my part. It took less than an hour of gameplay to figure out this wasn't the game for me. Others may of course feel differently. By all means, it is free to dowload so feel free to press ""play"" and judge for yourself.			"

								Update Review 1"" 23 May 2016Now, this game was never going to be a 500+ hr time investment game like Farming Simulator, ETS2 and ATS or IL2 CloD are for me and indeed, if you look at my hours, I'm barely 13 hrs played but nevertheless, I thoroughly recommend this game still. I'm very pleased I got into it.I have really enjoyed every minute of this even if  I have not explored a huge amount nor have I yet tested all the options of equipment or bait. This is all ahead for me and I am in no rush.This game is just a very relaxing time spend, it's easy enough until you get a big fish and then it'll blip your heart rate some until you get control. As you can get into it easily without spending any real money there's no risk.The developers have been very supportive of potential customers and provided a unlimited access lake where a number of fish can be caught.This all leads me to still recommend this game even if there is the dreaded ""buy a licence"" component. Frankly, I not done this yet anyway so that experience is for another update but I don't seem to feel nearly as much of a problem in this title's case compared other titles using the same model.Original Review:  15 April 2016This review is an initial reaction after 3 days. I will need to come back and edit this review after I've spent more time in here.I picked up this game in early April, just as 0.3.7 update (Texas) arrived.Having read about 5 reviews and seeing a 'mostly positive' rating on STEAM, I downloaded.Installation was easy during which I watched a few YouTube videos. By installation complete, I knew enough to get out and go fishing.  A few hand holds greet you as you first play and they're great. Within no time, I'd been fishing. I can easily stay out of the 'realistic discussions' as I'm no real life angler but I appreciate the degree to which this title has achieved certain aspects of the real world activity.Any simulator is a compromise but if it's not fun, then it's no good. I can certainly see myself spending a while here and there going fishing between my other simulator gameplay activities.So with 3 days under my belt, I've found the setup easy, got into fishing without problems, found it very relaxing and enjoyable and even experienced my first update which adds a huge attraction to the title.I expect I will go ahead and purchase some items from the shop as I develop my experiences.I tend to be wary of 'free to play' in a title but not against them or even spending some money on this as long as I can get value and the money I spend remains as purchased value. One area I am slightly concerned about is the purchased license validity time. If they are in terms of 'Game time', then I will be happy. If they are real time however.... I will be quite disappointed.I am totally happy I took the time to check this title out and immediately, I would encourage anyone wondering about it, to try it out. Here is a youtube video of my early on session.

								THIS IS MY ORIGIONAL REVIEW, THE UPDATED ONE IS BELOWIts got real fishing elements, But. this is legit friken waiting simulator 2015and its really laggyy.....UPDATED REVIEWThis is Fishing Planet. A game about litterally fishing.Back in september of 2015 i wrote the review above. That was negative, that isnt changing and heres why.This game is well made. Back when i first played it, it was a waiting simulator, took atleast 2 min to catch a single fish. Now that is has been fixed, i can understand why alot of people like this game now. personally i think its pretty well made BUT, and only BUT, alot of the mechanics that would make this game fun don't exist. For 1, the ""Lake Map"" First map i had to litterally wait through a 10 second loading screen just to move 10 feet to a pier, why i couldnt just walk and actually SAVE loading and  playing time on this i do not know. But the game does have a nice realism thing going for it, so theirs that....So lets get on to some things i like about it. (Or pros and cons if you will)Pros.Fun little gameNice realism effectDiverse fishDecent mechanics when it comes to catching fish.After the patches the game is no longer laggy, but is still somewhat poorly optimized.No longer a waiting simulator.surprisingly no Micro Transactions (My video lies, sorry, still new at this)ConsLoading screen timers can be a tad bit long.Needs a loading screen to walk 7 feet.Kinda pricy when it comes to DLCReally pricy when it comes to premium shop.....if you run out of money your kinda screwed uneless you play every day or buy cash.Lack of stats when it comes to equipment (Personally not a con, but it would be nice to see some stats)This game is good, i just dont enjoy it, alot of mechanics that would personally make this feel 100% real are missing, and it kinda just feels like something that i wish would have been better oriented.NOW FOR SOMETHING NEWMechanics i wish existedA boat to travle the lake.Some more open world kinda bitsnot having to wait for a loading screen to walk 7 feet to a peir........................................a bigger map with alot more options to do.a way to actually catch your OWN bait instead of buying it.I'm not being bias, honest. But this game just didnt appeal to me all that much. i saw a guy with 206 hours. so im pretty sure it appealed to him. But i guess to ones his own.You can see my crappy review video below!

								Fishing Planed seemed to be a logical choice for those days the weather outside doesn't cooperate. The game looks ok, but it fails in gameplay and the fact that there is a large 'pay-to-win' factor involved. The game has potential, but the fact that grinding for in-game cash or paying a substantial amount of IRL money are the only options to get to end-game content just break it.			"

								So with more then 100 Hours straight under my Belt here is a short but honest review form me:The game is pretty neat, the graphics are okay (its a fishing game after al no FPS game), Number of equipment fish and Locations is okay for earley acces. The game for sure has potential, but the dev seam ""undecided"" which way to go... why i say that, well they lateley nerfed the spawn of trophy and unique fish to lower the farming  for xp and make it more realistic, but on the other hand fish dont really fight, nor does it realley matter how good you are at giving attraction to your lure as long as you give some to it every time. The same goes for location, find a hole that works at the time and you got a farming spot...Motivation wise, its terrible, once hit lvl 14+ it gets grindy...VERY GRINDY, i played many games with hard Grinds (navyfield for instance) but here the grind isnt funny at all, find a hole to farm, farm it till next level...rince and repeat and if you unlocked a new loaction rince and repeat there...out right depressingIn Addition, the Dev's start to put Muck at you face every trime, you say there is something wrong with the game...there standart then is to say ""there is nothing wrong, everything is fine, and its because YOU dont understand how the game works...and then go on and do basicalley...nothing!Second there steam from is moderated by a powerhungry mod, who serves as the Dev's interceptor but isnt able to handle the power given to him and acts like an Despote...so mediocer game plus an bad way to handle the community even in Eearly acces...Keep away from this game!

								best fishing simulator currently available, the game has had a bit of a rough time over the last month with game changes and updates, a few bugs that was teasing all game players patience. After a few quick bug fixes the game started to recover when the fish decided they wanted to start flying, after a short time along comes Mr bug fix again and hey presto all gamers are happy again.If you are looking for a fishing challenge, some fun and excitement this is the game for you, there is loads of gear and bait available to buy for you and if you want to go further you can treat yourself to some premium with extra xp and further more even bigger treats are the DLC packs full of gooddies to give you that bit extra, those packs have some exciting gear for you.Well i think i have said enough, all you need to do now is download and join the community of fishers from all over the world who will always be happy to help with advice when needed, there is also allot of videos on youtube to help you move up those levels, happy fishing to all and if you see me in one of the rooms fishing say hi.

								For a free to play game, this is very well made. I've played a handful of other fishing games and this one by far takes the cake. Honestly, if this game were $5-10, it'd still be worth the price. It's great for casually fishing and having a peaceful time with friends. The game has the perks of both a fishing simulator (fish behavior is very realistic and knowledge about real fishing can apply to the game) and a fishing video game (there are certain places where fish can randomly spawn if you want that kind of stuff).Pros Very easy to get into (no difficult mechanics, but there are ""hidden"" mechanics, discussed in cons section). Not as grindy as other fishing games (still there, but it's a fishing game, so of course it's slow :p). Very accurate, you can tell the devs know a lot about fishing and care for the game. Updated regularly. Relaxing music/sound effects. Multiplayer is optional and enjoyable. (There's no voice chat and you can even hide other player models if you want, very nice mechanic in a fishing game. Alternatively, you can see where other people are fishing if you want to look for a popular spot.) Tons of fish! Huge variety of rods, reels, tackle, nets, everything. Very in depth when it comes to customizing your gear and tackle. Wide variety of places to fish at all around the US and one location in Canada.  Fishes' (?) habits affected by weather, temperature, and time of day.  Appropriate bait and techniques also affected by the above.Cons Retrieval mechanics could be explained more (or at all). Some things such as rod properties, usefulness of baits, etc. are not explained, which can be a source of ire for new players. No boats, canoes, or kayaks yet, though the devs spoke about adding them eventually.Other There is a premium currency called Baitcoins (lol), but it is mostly for things like unlocking certain equiptment early. They are however the only way of buying unlimited advanced fishing passes (which allow you to keep any fish you catch, otherwise you have to throw back certain fish like trophy or unique variants). You can still buy limited (24 real hour, 3 real day, week, month, etc.) advanced fishing passes using regular currency that pay for themselves very quickly.  ***At the time of writing, there was a recent update that overhauled prices. This lead to unlimited advanced passes becoming ridiculously overpriced, but another recent patch has lowered them again. The fishing is a bit grindy sometimes, but that's because it's a fishing game. The fun is supposed to be in the relaxed natre of fishing. (My two cents ahead). You won't find a single fishing game out there where you can just hop in, grab top level equipment after a few days of playing casually, and catch a record holding fish. You need to earn it. There was an update recently that overhauled the game almost entirely. Due to that, most of the videos or guides you look for will be outdated. There are of course bugs in this game, but nothing game breaking that I've encountered.Overall, I highly recommend it if you want a fishing game, casual or not.			"

								Suprisingly good game!I downloaded this on a lark, and was quickly hooked, no pun intended.  It captures the ""feel"" of fishing really well, and there is a ton of depth to the game given all the variables at play.   Leader depth, type of hook, type of bait, position, time of day, line type...it all adds up to give the game a really polished and satisfying feel when you finally nail down everything for a particular spot.Highly recommended for anyone that has even a passing interest in fishing.

								-No Massive Multiplayer (unless you count 20 people in the same chat box as MMO)-No co-op or multiplayer at this time. -Definitely not Open World.Plus the devs are chat nazis. They ban you for saying anything about the game but let fanboys spread salt all over the forums and never say a word. It could be awesome , but we will see what happens to it.Besides lets be honest here, people play fishing games to catch 20lb.  bass amirite?Not to grind the same fish for 2-300 hours to get to a map where i can fish the fish i want to fish.***Still have the ability to go negative dollars due to unclear or poorly worded licensing terms.....which means you cannot fish anymore unless you put money in the game or wait weeks to get the daily 15$ to get back to positive. Very suspicious that this 'feature' is still in after so many complaints and it seems to be a blatant cash grab***tl;dr   May be better later if devs add all the features they are claiming now instead of moderating forums badly.

								Great fun and experience for all!   Much like the hunter it takes time to catch your pre even with a fight, Fishing Planet brings this community together, with positive attitude in catching or loosing the fish help is always around the corner, with a dedicated Teamspeak3 server the community hasn't just grown for the sake of gaming but brought many members of the gaming community together, myself a newbie fisher gained great help and experience from other fishers in the community and wonderful tips from people vastly out of my reach in this world.  Recent Patch Review Fighting has become even more intense with this patch, but few glitches are still here i would be glad to send them in a letter form if it made any help but its only small things, with the latest patch fighting the fish has become a game itself and a challenge, i like this patch due to the designers adding more dynamics into the game rather than just for quality of looks.   Here are the results i rate the game. (Out of 10 for best and 1 for awful)  Graphics Quality - 10 With dynamic water, advanced shading on plants and features and barely a spike on a high run system, this game is great in quality and beautiful in its own way.   Game Dynamics - 8 The games dynamics including the fish are what is to be said as okay, is a little more than an ""okay"". Ai bubbles on the water, shifting clouds and also the large sounds of animals in the environment make it a great realistic experience for new player to feel what its like to fish from their computers.   Personal Settings 4 Whilst its great we can change our game for pure beauty, we should be allowed to switch off our birds, quality of scenery or even the FX quality we want, i rate this a 4 because of its lack of options and functions to support controllers and also the fact that users cant customise their game to suit there computer.

								saw game shuffling through black friday deals so decided to play it since free-to-play. a few hours into it i was hooked (lawl) and decided to pay for the discounted DLC package they had going for black friday. a few hours after making the purchase the game under went server maintence and then starts crashing and freezing 15-20 min into starting up after amintence was done.when the game crashes it doesnt register the exp or money made from fish currently caught and the money you spend in game to visit other lakes isnt refunded. the in game clock on the lake still runs so even if you log back in later you lose time.looking at the game's discussion board this is an ongoing issue with the game with absolutely no insight from the developers aside from ""check your firewalls""game 10 hours into it is now unplayable and after spending money on it i cant recommend the game*******update****after many more hours into this game i have new information1) since the beginning of 2017 and their recent patches they have no started impelementing really heavy paywalls to push their premium account option and ingame currency. will go on to describe in next2) you were able to set a lake as your ""home state"", reducing the travel expense of that lake greatly and reducing nearby states. those allowing you save money. they have removed that option. now its a set fee, you cant set a home state, and the travel epxense are outragous, now taking several days of fishing low level lakes just to make enough cash to venture to these new lakes, and thats not counting the hours you need to spend grinding now for gear3) cost of geat has gone up signifcantly. its now as much money for one crankabit lure as it is to travel to most of the lower level states. this now means you have to spends (real life, like an entire weekend) just to make money to buy new gear like lures, lines and so on4) the durability on items seems like it has been reduced, and the cost for repair increase. before these patches it didnt seem like i had to repair my stuff as often as i do now, and the cosr to repair said gear is almost insulting. my fish keeper, the item you need to store fish to cash in, is at 4k to repair at only 60% durability. 4k... thats the price to travel to most of the mid level lakes.5) you used to be able to purchase a lifetime liscense to lakes with the ingame currency you earn by catching fish, now its only buyable with the baitcoin currency, the currency you can only get by buying baitcoin bundles or ingame rewards (which is no way to farm baitcoins). some fo the lakes its almost as much as the travel expense for a one day liscense,6) constant bugs that screw you over, like being DC'd for server maintance and not being refunding travel expenses/liscense fees on lake. when you leave a lake, you cant return without paying travel fees, a dc counts 9atleast for me) as leaving. another incident i will describe in an event i just had happened.7) they removed alligator gar from a low level lake area, giving some poeple a choice to limited out their fish keepers at a low cost, and added them to a new lake thats now the most expensive lake in the game.log in today, buy bait, head to new york lake to farm walleyes because of all the price increases. get to lake, find out the bait i bought wasnt added to bait i already had in my inventory, but was put in my home storage. all lakes have select tackle you can buy at location, other than that you have to leave and then pay said epxenses to return, try buying new bait there, wont stack and tackle box is full. have to leave. i get a repair window for items when leaving, and i didnt even fish! it was asking to repair a rod and reel, even though i didnt make a single cast, and not to mention, the 4000 repair bill on my fish stringer!go back to home storage and move the bait into my tackle box, go back to new york, paying the travel expense once again. get to the lake, catch my first fish, just to find out the game uniquiped my fish stringer (at only 60 total durability), thus i cant keep anyfish and amke any money, so i have to leave once again, now 3200 lost in cash. go back to home storage, and yep, there it is. no notification was given that the game removed in from my inventory. re-equip said items, no prompt saying it was too damaged to use, go to the newbie lake, cause now i have no money to go back to new york. it will take me half a saturday to make back most of the money i lost, and make no advancement to traveling to a lake i actually want to fish at.the paywalls are beyond ridcoulous. and this is a game i found fun enough to pay for dlc to support this game, and every patch released this new year has screwed its players base aside from adding a new lake.

								No.(Fine, I'll write a real review)It's a very boring 'fishing' simulator in which you press right click when the bobbler drops, and then hold left click to reel in the fish.  That's the extent of the gameplay. Is it realistic?No, as someone who has actually fished, you don't catch a fish every 2 minutes by just sitting there and waiting for a bobbler to drop.If you spend more than 30 minutes playing this game, that's 30 minutes you could have been out actually fishing and potentially catching a real fish to eat.DO YOU KNOW HOW GOOD REAL FISH TASTE?  ♥♥♥♥TON BETTER THAN FAKE ONES!  I ATE MY KEYBOARD TRYING TO TASTE ONE!Verdict: Do you like fishing?  Want to fish with friends?Go fish with friends IRL, this game is just minecraft fishing mechanics with improved graphics			"

It's pretty and all, and if it was a single player game without the tack on payments crap I might want to play it. As is, definitely not.			"

								Ok first of all, the game won't even work anymore, and my anti-virus is not the problem.And second of all, more importantly, the mods/devs will block people with honest negative reviews. It is rediculous. In fact, I will probably be blocked because of this for flamming or insulting the devs somehow. I don't have anything against them, I just don't respect what they are doing to people who are simply saying what they think about the game. I decided to delete it because I don't want to help them. They need to fix themselves, first.			"

								Here is the best way I can explain this game. It is an Alpha fishing simulator that is pulling in people not only from the gaming community, but the fishing community too. It's the kind of game that if you take the time to learn, and level, you will be able to do pretty much whatever you do and have fun. It is definitely best played with friends, or members of the community. The thing is, like most alphas, you have to remember there will be bugs. No game breaking bugs are there right now, and they have been pretty good about addressing them. I even had a rare bug break a DLC reel, which was my fault too because I had too much line test. When I contacted support they immediately helped me out no questions asked. The community of this game is better than any other I have been a part of by a landslide. Everyone is helpful, the streamers are all cool, and everyone is actively trying to improve the game. The developers do something amazing too. They listen to the community, and even work closely with them, like with the upcoming tournament they are putting on for real life prizes.The game has a TON of cool things they are bringing in the future, and the beauty of it is, they aren't just blowing smoke. They are putting out legitimate dates they want to release additions, and they follow up. If every alpha game followed up like they do, they wouldn't stay alpha.All in all, I absolutely love this game. I can just relax, put on some music, hang out with friends and catch fish. I look forward to what they are adding, and enjoy what they have already. I highly recommend at least trying the game, which can't hurt anything because it's free to play. There is another beauty, it's not P2W. This is a true F2P game that the only reason you would invest in is if you want some cool DLC they release, and want to support the game.			"

								Honestly some of the best fishing I've ever seen in a game. Techniques can be used that I use out on the real water as well.It's not chocked full of action. It's no ""WoW Killer"", but if you like to fish, this game has it. For an Early Access game, it feels more polished than others. Can be confusing for players who never have spent a second on a pond or lake fishing.  The lure/bait types, the rods/reels, water temps and weather conditions. All of these affact how well you do. Patience is key to catching a lot of fish.  Excellent Fishing Sim! Just wish it had more Force Feedback capability. Tough to feel like i really caught a 3lb bass or 8 lb catfish and my arms arent tired. Also being able to move while fighting a big fish would be nice. IRL I have never been confined to the one spot im in...if I need to move I gotta move.9/10 for a fishing game for sure! "

								At the start, I hated the game, because it takes so long to make it to a level that you can actually catch some ""real fish"", like Pike and Muskie, instead of constantly sunfish, Crappie and Bluegill. But once you've made it up to higher levels and upgraded your tackle, the game is fantastic and very fun. The only times I hate, is when the makers of the game do upgrades or add a new map, sometimes it screws up things on other maps and the way your lures work, and sometimes you won't get any fish on lakes that you regularly get tons of fish. Also, it seems like it's the same favored people catching the biggest fish on every map, or the same people getting Unique fish on every map, when I'm using the exact gear and bait, and fishing in the same place as them. Other than these issues, the game is great and the graphics really make you feel like your fishing outside -- the water glistens, the birds are chirping, the weather changes while you're standing there from sunny to partly cloudy to cloudy to rain - and the fish change their eating times in these conditions too. If you love fishing, be very patient at the start and you will love the game.			"

								overall this is a good game, and no you dont have to spend money on it to make it far. I never did, although if you do you would have big advantages. There is many pros about this game more then cons. So im only going to list the cons i can think of at the moment. They said that they would be adding many things like boats for example and multi player ability which to me would make this game supreme, but it has not been done yet, and honestly im convinced it wont happen in this game. I could be wrong but hey just my 2 cents. Overall game deserves 7.5 out of 10 scale. Very high rating for a free game.			"

								Best Fishing Simulator I have seen. Edit 13-03-2016 after update.....Let me add my 20c for what it’s worth. Use it or don’t up to you.Pos,Good to see an update in the game and to see us going somewhere in the game.I like the idea of you not being able to spam the right mouse key anymore.Realism in using your rod and reel in fish fighting is defiantly improved.Walk around lakes is an awesome idea ""just make sure there is fish to catch at the new spots""Neg,Why increase the lure size on rods like Galaxy Cast 140, 160, 180 if there are no lures for them in the shop? “My Christmas DLC Rods I paid for are now useless due to this increase in lure size. Wear rate on line is still too much you can’t land a Trophy Garr with any Match Rod setup your line gets warn out before you land the fish. When are we going to see a stronger match rod, there is really a need for one now.Wear on Crank Baits!! WTH Chaps!!and then you split them all up and now they just taking up all my slots in my bag. Dev need to find another way to deal with this or remove wear on cranks completely. Crank baits should last you longer than spinners BTW.Rod and Reals don’t wear in one fishing trip, or for that matter a 100 fishing trips. The game really need some improvement here. Yes I agree Reels need a service every now and then but Rod's? How will you have wear on them? I’m quite sure Rod and Real Builders will not be advertising…..“Great Reel Will Last you a Full Day’s Of Fishing” Come-on Guy’s think things over man.A final taught…. From Yoda!Guy's don’t over complicate the game, Complication Leeds to frustration, Frustration leads to boredom, and Boredom leads to the Dark side! ps: If you release an Ultra-Light DLC make sure I can replace the lure items lost in the store, Ultra-light anglers will tell you, you will lose much more Lures than regular anglers. Well I'm done ♥♥♥♥♥in and complaining for now. Still a game I will play but we need some more patching here.Rg, Catfish Joe			"

								Just AWESOME. This is the game what all we been waiting for as fishermen :D This is probably, the best fishing simulator out there. I mean that, and as a real fisherman, I enjoy playing it. Okay it's not as good as irl fishing, but it is like the best videogame for it :)			"

								Best Fishing Simulator I have seen. Edit 13-03-2016 after update.....Let me add my 20c for what it’s worth. Use it or don’t up to you.Pos,Good to see an update in the game and to see us going somewhere in the game.I like the idea of you not being able to spam the right mouse key anymore.Realism in using your rod and reel in fish fighting is defiantly improved.Walk around lakes is an awesome idea ""just make sure there is fish to catch at the new spots""Neg,Why increase the lure size on rods like Galaxy Cast 140, 160, 180 if there are no lures for them in the shop? “My Christmas DLC Rods I paid for are now useless due to this increase in lure size. Wear rate on line is still too much you can’t land a Trophy Garr with any Match Rod setup your line gets warn out before you land the fish. When are we going to see a stronger match rod, there is really a need for one now.Wear on Crank Baits!! WTH Chaps!!and then you split them all up and now they just taking up all my slots in my bag. Dev need to find another way to deal with this or remove wear on cranks completely. Crank baits should last you longer than spinners BTW.Rod and Reals don’t wear in one fishing trip, or for that matter a 100 fishing trips. The game really need some improvement here. Yes I agree Reels need a service every now and then but Rod's? How will you have wear on them? I’m quite sure Rod and Real Builders will not be advertising…..“Great Reel Will Last you a Full Day’s Of Fishing” Come-on Guy’s think things over man.A final taught…. From Yoda!Guy's don’t over complicate the game, Complication Leeds to frustration, Frustration leads to boredom, and Boredom leads to the Dark side! ps: If you release an Ultra-Light DLC make sure I can replace the lure items lost in the store, Ultra-light anglers will tell you, you will lose much more Lures than regular anglers. Well I'm done ♥♥♥♥♥in and complaining for now. Still a game I will play but we need some more patching here.Rg, Catfish Joe			"

								Pretty much everything in this game is barred so theres not much fun to be had, i was hoping for an experience that resembles the real thing but all i got was what this game really is, which is poorly designed looking at it objectively though i will say the graphics are quite nice and it was pretty relaxing. At least it has that going for it. For most people i wouldnt recommend this game but for some select few ill just say download it, try it, and see for yourself.			"
