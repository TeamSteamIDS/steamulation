												JumpBall is a game that I can't recommend because:- it's not worth the money- it has lots of bugs- the controls are horrible- the graphics aren't that good- the soundtrack is annoying- there are no options to turn off the music- it has no sense- the only good reason to install this game is for the trading cards			"

												Really ugly game. Gameplay is literally just geometry dash except there is co-op which can be a bit fun. But it's only a bit funbecause you are messing up with friends, not because the actual game is good.EDIT: This trash doesn't even have steam cards even though it says that it has them on the store page.

												From the store trailer and screenshots, I expected some fun game like Circus Charlie, yet, this game is a disaster:1st of all the menu looks like аss2nd when I tried to make a screenshot of it - a CHROME DEVELOPER CONSOLE pops up - I thought it's a bug of my chrome, but no, aiming at different lines of code, highlights elements of the game. Is this .swf sold on steam? Lmao.

Pressed Esc accidentally - the game went from fullscreen to windowed right away and there is no chance to go back to fullscreen except reloading it completely.Non-existant steam overlay.So when I finally got to the actual gameplay - the game itself has pretty bad controls - you control a group of jumpers, when you jump with your 1st guy, other guys repeat your actions, it should be fun snake like jumps but no, when the 1st guy jumps over the obstacle, 2nd 3rd, even 5th guy, can hit that obstacle, because they are not synchronised properly, so you constantly hit everything, and the game itself pretty unplayable.Thus - this game is a disaster/10			"

												-Gameplay makes no sense and the controls are buggy and stop working completely sometimes. -The colors are not visually appealing and are even hard to look at after a few seconds.-The music is irritating and can't be turned off.-No way to save your progressIt's like Geometry Dash but not fun... just weird and tedious. Why are you playing with four other characters behind you that instantly kill you if THEY barely touch something? Why are the other four ninjas even there? I got this for free and just idled for the cards after playing for a few minutes and realizing how awful it is.			"

												Dear André Bertaglia..please stop making games.Very poor graphics which are badly animated. It's like looking at plaid on plaid...and makes ""Top Banana"" look restrained.Absolutely awful controls which make the game an exercise in frustration. They're sloppy, unreliable, and the collision detection is shockingly bad.Instant, one-hit kills.Don't waste your time with this. If it were an FTP mobile game...I'd still want a refund.			"

												JumpBall is truly a masterpiece of contemporary gaming. It is the pinnacle of every expectation in a high-budget AAA game from a major franchise, but it's an indie game. I challenge anyone to point out even a minor flaw in this game. The character development is truly extraordinary, especially with the blue and orange ninjas. The immersion that this game provides unleashes an overwhelming sensation such that when I close the game, I still feel like a ninja! Moving on to the music, the 8-bit style combined with several syncopated beats and rhythms are enough alone to keep me playing in any free time I have. Now, for the most important part: The gameplay. The fast-paced style is the perfect amount of difficulty and entertainment to keep you coming back for more. Some would compare it to ""The Impossible Game"" or ""Geometry Dash"", but that's a criminal understatement. JumpBall completely eclipses similar games due to the sheer manpower dedicated to making each and every element of the game precise and perfect. That's right, ""perfect.""If you haven't already purchased this game for yourself, I have no further business in speaking with you. My words can't express how much of a miracle it is to have this game in my life. If you do own this game, I highly encourage-nay, demand that you pick several other copies up for your friends, family, neighbors, pets, or imaginary friends you have so that they, too, can enrich their life with the majesty that is JumpBall.

												This game has less quality than a Miniclip game. It's more like a chore to play it. Flawed mechanics, like the ninjas desynchronizing when jumping, monotonous music, graphics, and gameplay, and other things like that, lead me to leave a bad review.			"

												Tedium. If you like games like flappy bird then perhaps you'll like this. All you do is hit jump, you have to time this perfectly over and over and over and over and over and over and over (etc) again. You have a score which oddly starts at 100 and goes down. I guess the goal is to get to the end of this chore with some score left... no thanks. This shouldn't be on steam. And why on earth is it 100MB?????? I can't see the graphics images taking up more than a meg of compressed gifs/png/bmp whatever./idling for cards... to sell, and then I'll be removing this game from my account.			"

												This game... this game has truly touched my life. Nothing could change my life on any spectrum, as much as JumpBall has changed mine. I don't know where to start on this. The graphics are greater than ANY VR game out there. I challenge you to try to find a game with better graphics than JumpBall. And the music, oh the music! It's as if a symphony has blessed my ears. The gameplay, it's eons beyond anything we have right now. The plot is truly stunning. It's better than CS:GO, TF2, Terraria, or Geometry Dash's plot. It truly moves you to another level. All of the characters have a touching background story of how they have met the master ninja. I can't even imagine how much training they've went through just to meet their Master. The artwork for this game is as if Leonardo DaVinci, Giovanni Degrante,Michael Angelo, and Wolfgang Mozart have come together to paint something to be remembered once the sun dies. Every gamemaker or corporation should try to imitate the creators work. He doesn't deserve a lowly title as the creator. He is my god, and he is everything I aspire to be. If there were ever a point to mark in history, it would be the day this game was released. This game is beyond perfect, this game... is creation itself. To cover everything I've said, this game is the greatest investment I have ever made, the graphics; stunning! Plot? Touching. Gameplay? Astonishing. Artwork? Beyond our age. Music? Blessing. All in all, you should really buy this game. It truly will change your life.			"

												Still haven't got past the first part ,is it unfairly difficult or am i just bad at this game.You have to guide your line of balls over hurdles jumping at the right moment .If you mistime the jump it will freeze and you'll have to re-start .Very frustrating if u ask me .Can we have a way to turn the music off please?Needs a way to vote 50/50 as atmo i'm not feeling a thumbs up.I voted thumbs up so as not to be unfair to the dev ,maybe i'm just rubbish at this :)			"

												This is the best game I have ever played hands down. I feel as though it's an acquired taste. Like fine wine or aged cheese, you must have an elevated gaming palate in order to fully appreciate it. I love this game, I really do... to even suggest that this game is bad in any way is insulting and hurtful. In playing, I have never felt more like a winner and a ninja. The gameplay is rewarding and fun, and I would easily pay upwards of one hundred dollars to have this experience again.			"

												(Gotten from the fine folks at Indiegala.  Thanks, guys!)So, you wanna be a ninja.  You wanna ride a ball and be a ninja.  You REALLY wanna ride a ball and be a ninja... WTF?!?!?!Ninjas are assassins that are well-trained in stealth and eliminating their targets.  JumpBall is about neither.  You instead control a group of ninjas (if you're playing single player) in a typical Runner-type game, jump over spikes, and don't jump into spikes....that's it.  I literally played this for 3 minutes before idling for cards.  I can't even say it's bug free as some ""ninjas"" get tagged by spikes without even touching them.  Sadly, the only positive thing I can say about this game is that it is technically playable.Among the many disappointing things going on in my life at this point in time, I'd say this adds to the list of disappointments.  It feels like an experimental game made in GameMaker Studio that should have been free.  In all honesty, don't buy this game even if it's on sale.  Save your money for a better game.   And no, I haven't made a game so I can't say I could make a better game.  I'm only saying that as a consumer, you will be greatly disappointed with this game. (Edit:  The DLC doesn't download either...but even if it did, I highly doubt it would save this game)0.1/10  You don't need big balls to be a ninja.  Really, you don't...			"

												This is a great game for those late night ""I don't know what we should play, though I should probably jerk off"" kind of times. Many good laughs are had with both the ridiculous concept and execution of this gem. And when you get it on sale it makes the purchase that much more justifiable.This game is a tremendously moving social commentary on the current state of Corporate Balls, and the struggles of the middle-class ninja. Each ninja represents a member of our capitalist society clambering to be successful and live the Balls Dream, only to be shoved away and sat upon by another of their fellow ninjas. The balls represent the economic food chain, in which those who are weak are crushed by those who have become mad with power and influence.10/0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000001			"

												JumpBall is basic autorunning platformer. You have to climb your jumps to clear obstacles in order to reach the end of the level, this game is not endless, although you seem to start from the beginning every time. All the mechanics work fine, the game doesn't have great art but it's at least cohesive and functional. It's definitely low budget and makes more sense as a phone game, but there's nothing particularly wrong here for what it is. An alright game.			"
