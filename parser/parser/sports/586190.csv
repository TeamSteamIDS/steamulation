+ Local / Online multiplayer support+ Good chiptune soundtrack~ Might be amusing with friends for a short while- Gameplay is far too simplistic. This is a 1-button soccer game. Your character rotates in a circle, and you press the Z-key to move forward, when you let go you begin to rotate again. You essentially try to move when your character is facing the ball, and hit it into the opposing side's goal.- The AI is a mix of stupidity and unfairness. They will commonly score goals on themselves, or if you are playing 2v2, the AI on your team will stupidly score on your own goal. They also unfairly rush the ball at the start far quicker than you are able to go manually, and will occasionally score without giving you a chance.- Not enough content.  Honestly you can experience everything the game has to offer within 1-minute.			"

												You can have a lot of fun while playing this game with a friend.The only minus is that if you use headsets and you start the game the soundtrack is going to make your ears bleed and I had  to disable it.			"

												Great Game honestly, but the goals are only limited to 5 goals, it will be better if there's more player option and time limit (limited by the time, like the real football). over all this game is good, but if there's more update sooner this game will be greater than fifa and pes xdxd.

												This is a very, very simple game that uses one button and nothing else.The game allows for human vs AI configs or up to 4 human players at once, including online play vs others.The AI scores a lot of own goals (maybe by design?)Soundtrack is basic but doesn't get in the way.The only real downside is that I can only imagine playing this every so often with friends.  It would be far too repetitive otherwise. "

												this is when extremely simple game can be made great: what else can you add or change in soccer football simulator?everything! just make a game with different playing modes: 1 on 1, vs computer or even 2 vs 2; add a possibility to change a ball and that will change everything - it will behave differently.

												it's a nice game. i'd play it when i'm bored sometimesthe soundtrack isn't really that repetitive. i mean, it is one track, but it's hard to notice when it loops. (that's cool.)the only thing i wish for is a switch between control style. that meaning ""hey, i don't wanna play one button anymore. i wanna play with like 2 or 3 more!""maybe that'll be an option. maybe a bad decision, but it's just my opinion.tl;dr good game ok			"
