Early Access Review
								Very reminiscent of the latest FIFA STREET game, with some nice scenery and simplified skills. I am unable to comment on the soundtrack, but the songs appear to be unique to this game, which is nice. This game should serve to fill the void left by FIFA Street not being released on recent consoles, as the games are incredibly similar and will hopefully be just as fun in the future.As this game is early access, I will also leave some feedback which I feel can improve the game. Custom player names do not appear ingame, instead displaying Player 1. Hair should be customisable, as all of the available characters look like Jason Statham body doubles and not street footballers. Clothing should be more plentiful and perhaps unlockable. It is possible to tackle an AI to the outside of the cage. The camera occasionally clips through the walls in both gameplay and replays. It is impossible to score from outside the box, instead forcing you to walk straight up to the keeper. It is too easy to regain the ball, perhaps a mode with fouls enabled should be implemented? What is the point of the red arrows when the AI does some skills? Some skills such as the sombrro cause the player to lose the ball.I enjoy this game already having played a few games and testing out the customisation options. I feel as though the controls are simple and the game looks pretty good already. The lack of replayability this game currently possesses should be redeemed once online modes and tournament modes become available. Perhaps a Rocket League style ranking system and being able to play with two or more firends on one team against other players would improve the game further.I look forward to see how this game changes as new features are added, I am already attempting to persuade my friends to purchase this game, as I believe it has good potential as one of the few good football games of it's kind on Steam.Hopefully a mode similar to that of FIFA STREET's international tournament mode where you travel to different destinations, playing in different tournaments and earning items. I strongly believe that this feature should be implemented into Metris Soccer.Good Luck and sorry for the wall of text.			"

Early Access Review
Early Access Review - 09/02/16Portable DescriptionInspired by the early FIFA Street series, Metris Soccer aims to bring soccer to the streets. Epic tricks, taunts, and plays are what the Street games are known for, and how stylish you scored your goal is just as important as scoring itself. Currently in an Early Access state, online play is not yet supported. Tl;dr - read the conclusion.GameplayCurrent Playable Game ModesThere are only two modes for you to play at the moment, Local and Practice, which are described below.Local: includes standard 3v3 matches against AI in Team vs Team, and a Dynamic Tournament that enlists you to complete contracts in a set amount of matches. These contracts contain specific objectives, such as: X shots, X goals, X side tackles, etc.Practice: includes tutorial, one on one, and no AI modes.Some of the upcoming planned features include an online multiplayer mode and a single-player league (campaign).Game CustomizationIn a Local match, you have the ability to choose the:Team: Personalized Team, UK, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, and USA.Arena: Rio, Tokyo, Indoor, The Cage, and Beach. Ball.Time Limit: 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 minutes.Score Limit: 3, 4, or 5 Goals.Team CustomizationYou have the ability to customize each of your three team members. The currently available features that can be changed include: tricks, face, shirt, shorts, and shoes. More personalization options are incoming, such as a stats-tracking system and symbols customization. Soccer in the StreetWhat makes a Street game so different from the traditional variety is the incorporation of a more lenient rules system all in an effort to promote heavy use of flashy tricks and stylish plays. Gameplay-wise, many Street games like to implement a lot of different types of combo meters, Slow-Mo replays, and epic finishers. Metris' take on the Street niche of sports games includes the following:Tricks/Trick Bar: methods of bypassing defenders, showing off your style, and activating the SkillBreaker.SkillBreakers: after the Trick Bar is filled, a SkillBreaker trigger will appear. When triggered, performing an X amount of tricks will add an X amount of additional goals if you score during that time. Performing a trick on all 3 defenders will end the game with your win.Tackles & Taunts.Video GameplayNote: the video footage was taken before the release patch; however, the review is still up to date and the in-game changes were minimal.

OptionsThe overall game options are really barren and extremely lacking, only providing the player to alter the screen resolution (which must be altered using a pre-game-launch configuration window) and camera angle. Regarding the camera, you may select one of six camera angles during play. The different angles provide static/dynamic, half/full-field, front/side, and isometric views. Graphics and Sound options do seem to be in the making though. Also, it may be important to consider that the key bindings/button mapping can't be changed either; however, I found the default configuration to be sufficiently acceptable. Gamepads and keyboards are supported.ConclusionCurrent State of the GameThe current state of Metris Soccer feels very much like an Alpha build. There isn’t really much to do at the moment. You can startup a 3v3 match against AI, complete Contracts in a set amount of games, or play some practice games. Even if I exclude the lack of playable content, there are a lot of unpolished aspects that leave me with a feeling of incompleteness. For instance, the only game options include changing the camera angles and screen resolution. The AI will sometimes run in place (even the goalie, although that is kind of funny), most of the camera angles will clip with a background asset, facial textures are very low quality, abruptly turning the characters feel so slow, and most important of all, the gameplay doesn’t feel very fluid. It doesn’t just stop there. A few annoying bugs and gameplay design choices made me feel that I'm fighting myself, almost as much as the enemy players themselves. More specific examples of this include: random deselections of the currently controlled player, the goalie not responding to certain commands, late activation of tricks, premature passing commands, and being forced to sit still and gawk at an enemy when he is performing a trick on you.Other Areas Needing ImprovementThere’s just so many things that need to be improved, and since I want Metris to get better, that is the purpose of Early Access after all, I came up with a list of things that these guys need to address. First, there should be a button to toggle the camera angle. Next, there needs to be a flashier UI with pretty particle effects, iconic graffiti and splatter animations, and commentator sound effects to make it feel like a Street game. Finally, Metris really needs to use much higher quality textures and animations. I read on reddit that the developers didn't want the textures to be too realistic in order to avoid comparisons to FIFA or other AAA sports games (Source); however, they should have went with a different art style in that case (cell-shaded, heavy bordered, etc.). At least make it so that the faces don't look blurry on the customization screen.I understand that it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present and game features to be missing during Early Access, so don’t say that I didn’t take that into consideration. I mean, I’ve reviewed many indie games at various stages of development before; however, what it all boils down to is whether I believe the average gamer will feel comfortable with the price knowing the amount of improvements needed to for the game to leave EA. Even with a slight bias towards leniency, I feel that the price is just a bit too much to accept. VerdictLooking at the Early Access notes, the developers seem to have an understanding of Metris' weaknesses and an idea of how to continue developing the game; however, the current gameplay feels so shallow that many players will probably have a hard time enjoying this game. Even though there is an extreme lack of ""Street"" variations of sports games, especially on PC, I just can't bring myself to overlook so many of Metris' shortcomings in order to give it a positive recommendation (at this moment in time). That being said, I have personally loved playing the Street games on console in the past, so I will still continue believing in the developers with the hope that someday, Metris will live up to the heavy expectations of the Street legacy.This review is written for UberCrit[ubercrit.com] & Before You Buy.

Early Access Review
								A cold nostalgia over warm embers of remembrance. FIFA street series..wow, those were the days.Should you purchase the game in its present stage? Nope. Do I like where the game is going?Perhaps..the devs put in an update a little less than an hour into the release, that speaks about their dedication. At this conjuncture however there are far too many glitches and the animations are wayy too early into early access, it is simply not fun at the moment. The game requires a MASSIVE and I cannot stress it enough, MASSIVE overhaul in terms of...well, everything. I bought the game because I support the devs and would love to see something reminiscent of the FIFA street series on steam and the negative review is to keep the devs on their toes and to forwarn potential buyers. Ps- soundtrack is unique and good. I wish the development team the best of luck for this endeavour. Edit- Two minor updates in, the game is till the same.Review subject to changes. (obviously)			"

								What is Metris Soccer?Metris Soccer clearly takes inspiration from the Fifa Street games, including skills like the Tornado Twist, Zidane Spin, Rabona Exit and Hop Nutmeg in an assortment of skills a user can choose from. The idea behind the game is to ""Take to the streets and play in locations all over the world, as you try to become the best. Score amazing goals, pull off epic tricks, and taunt with style as you embarrass your opponents."" Here is a video of my gameplay and what you can expect to see from the game.

								They need to fix alot of things here. Don't buy until they fix player movement, celebratoin, tackle, and every aspect in this game. I know this is Early Alpha, but you guys better fix that before release. At least make it fun at first, cuz I found it boring since 5 mins of gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
Great game with huge potentialI think the game is lots of fun and although it isn't 100% perfect it gives a feeling which is unique. Of course there are lots of problems to be solved and it will be a long way until this game will be ""ready"". The gameplay is very nice and although the players won't get the ball always after tricks, after about 1h playing it is familiar to me. I think I will enjoy the evolution of the game and will delight myself.			"

Early Access Review
								Metris Soccer is an odd / interesting beast. Firstly I’d like to say well done to the devs for attempting to break in to a huge market that’s dominated by two huge companies.  Dev teams that have had years of iterations to try and create a product that represents the beautiful game. Metris soccer is directed more at the FIFA street side of the market than the real life game. What does that mean, Metris soccer is about flair, tricks, freestyle and tekkers. The game is in early access and I was sent a key to try the game and to record some game play for youtube which you can find here

So is it any good? Should you buy it? Honestly it’s a tough one. I played the game for 30 mins or so probably not enough to really get to grips with it but I couldn’t help feeling a certain lack of  control over the goings on. If an opponent plus off a successful trick you are left motionless or your character falls over. If you attempted a trick you must be standing in the perfect place for the trick to be successful otherwise the ball rolls away and out of your control. Something that feels unlikely for the best freestylers in the world. It also means that there isn’t really anyway to link skills together.  This part of the game is the meat and veg of it. You have to perform tricks to beat people. Not because its aim of the game but because the passing element is virtually non-existent.  Passes are continually intercepted along with shooting and goalkeepers needing more work.The environments are nice although character models and animations could do with a little tidying up.So back to the original question is it any good? With the above all said I quite enjoyed my time with it. It’s not polished, it’s not finished. It’s a bit clunky. I wouldn’t at this stage recommend it. But if the devs can fix some of the elements above and add multiplayer they may have something unique. Should you buy it?This is a tough one! With Early Access I always feel you are backing developers to produce the game you want rather than paying for the game you want right now. The problem with some Early Access games is that they fail to deliver an end product.My honest feeling is that there is a long way to go with this game, and big strides need to be made. These strides have taken the developers of fifa and pro evo years to complete can MetrisCode make them? I have no idea. If you like football I would suggest keeping an eye on future developments and game play and then deciding.  So in answer to the above. Should you buy it. NO but keep it on a watch list SDG     "
