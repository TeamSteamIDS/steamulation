												Great game, my favourite of the championship manager titles, so addictive! so much of my life wasted that I can never get back! (ive played them all since the very first version on Amiga, which is now a long time ago when I had hair where I wanted it and no hair where I didnt!) anyway, this game is the pinnacle of the series before SEGA ruined it with football manager, (which I dont like, too complicated and too many pointless features)If you like to go outside and look up at the sky, see the beauty of the world and its many varied creatures and like to breath in the fresh air, THEN AVOID THIS GAME, otherwise if like me, you like to sit in your house covered in crisp crumbs staring at the screen, spending countless hours and days chasing the dreams of your chosen football club, while the world outside carries on with out you, THEN BUY IT, you wont be disappointed.It runs perfectly on Windows 7 and dont forget to buy Craig Lindfield! (he becomes the best striker in the game)			",47,5,2,5,12,2,29

												I guess I'll write a review for this xPI find this one to be a bit harder then older CM games.  I'm one for a challenge on this type of game, so I usually start at the bottom and try to work up.  I even look into what team is in the lower leagues are considered relegation candidates.  In older games I do actually avoid relegation and do a good job on my team, however, this one seems to not be so easy going on that.Its so hard to balance things, probably not impossible though, just I'm yet to do it.Thankfully the game has Benefactor mode which basically throws loads of money at you and gives you an easier time, however with the catch that with so much money at your disposal, you are expected to do good.  This is the easier option for sure cus in a sense you can select who you want in your team and just buy them.  Sounds good, but dont fail.Its a good game and a good distraction.  Hell look at my hours in xPFor £3, yeah thats a sound price if you want it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I quit playing FM 3-4 years ago, i could not get in to it as there was to much to manage for me. This game seems perfectly fine by me, i can not see any negatives other than it being a bit more simplistic than fm from the same time. I suspect the stats are not perfectly correct when it comes to gameplay, but i do not have much proof.			",68,8,0,15,6,2,11
