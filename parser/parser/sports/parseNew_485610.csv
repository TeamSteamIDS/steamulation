												Ball 3D: Soccer Online is a game with simple mechanics, quick and easy tutorial to learn. Overall is a game that you would only really play once with friends, but could possibly be played alone for a short period of time.Definitely try this game out if you want some laughs with friends, and is a free game so why not? :)			"

												This game is legendary,  I have often said that too much detail in a game can destroy it, this is a perfect example of what I mean...What this game lacks in detail, it makes up for in mastery.... the game is extremely easy to play and very basic when it comes to it but when you are up against people of equal skill and who have a footballing brain (sometimes passing back can result in getting forward easier) this is when the fun is second to none.There's no attributes in the game, which means everyone is equal. You are able to pay money, but it's only for celebrations and cosmetics.You play as a little disc which is locked in 3rd person view, very small in height but a fair circumference, you use 1 button only to kick which is LeftMouseButton (Holding it determines the distance) You can add spin with E+Q  (Holding it determines the rate of spin), You can use spacebar to jump.There is one additional button you can use which is Shift, this allows you to hit the ball into the air, which is useful to position the ball in a better way for you to take advantage. obviously the objective is to score a goal in the opposing goal.The community is brilliant, I've never met a community as good as this one for a sports game in regards of accepting not everyone is as good as the next player.If the core game isn't enough for you, then there's other games you can play, such as tennis, basketball and racing, which is all played by the same little disc.I own Fifa and Rocket League... and I still find my way onto playing this instead of them, that should account to how much of a gem this game is.If I was to mention the only bad thing about this game.... I would say keepers need to have some sort of implemented stat boost... like faster movement or higher jumping or more radius on their hitbox.... but that could only be because i'm used to other games which is from this genre, Don't get me wrong, it's highly possible to be a good keeper but personally I find it slightly unresponsive. That aside, I'm fairly new to this game so the learning curve is still present.   "

												This game is awesome and I would recommend you to give it a try!A few days ago, when I saw for the first time Screenshots of this game on Steam, I thought that this could not be a good game, but I decided to give it a try.And what could I say? I love this game so much. I have already played 43 hours and I can't get enough.First hours of playing this game were very funny, but after some time you will become a better player and you are ambitious to achieve this. You are trying new things out and you are trying to do the tricks mentioned at the tutorial.If you are getting better and better and you play with other players online who are also getting better, then you will see that you have a very competitive match. Everything is about tactic and timing. The fun is still there all the time when playing this game.This game has eSports character and it would be very fine to see it on an eSport league like ESL.Give it a try...			"

												I'll be honest, I downloaded this game as a joke, I thought it looked terrible so I thought I'd waste 10 minutes on it, how is it I now have 11 hours on it and I only got it last night? It's so fun, it takes a lot of skill to actually play and if you get really good you can pull off some nice skills. I made a few friends out of this, started off pretty terrible and now we're decent.Give it a try, there are quite a few different modes (Football, Basketball, Ice Hockey, Racing and one other I haven't tried yet) all with completely different ways to play and it's completely free with no P2W mechanics, only cosmetics though some effects can be quite annoying to look at.The people can be...'colourful' but there are some decent people on there.Honestly for a free game it's perfect because it's actually free. 9/10			"

												Ball3d (Formally know as Ball3D: Soccer Online) is a free to play soccer game that puts on the table a simple gameplay, a very modest grapichs scheme and a basic concept. Like in football (or soccer for this review sake) your goal is to get the ball inside of the opponent goal and prevent them to doing the same in yours. With this simple premise, the game throws you in the field with few tools, some teammates and a task to achive. Win the match.The gameplay is what makes the game interesting. The core mechanics are pretty basic, with LMB you load a bar and that bar sets the power of, in contact with the ball, it will be kicked. RMB or Space let you jump and you set the height by releasing the key at the right time and if you press Q or E while charging the kickbar the ball will curve in the air, making it harder to catch for the opposive team. This three are the base of all the gameplay in the game, plus WASD for movement.But the fun part is in the complex mechanics, for example: If you press Shift while you load the bar with LMB the ball will lob (or go straight up, if you dont know the concept). This can be used with Q or E to make amazing skills to dribble a defender away or make some space for a clear shot to goal. Beside this is the side-dribble mechanic (with the kickbar full, press Shift + A or D) to escape from a sticky situation or humiliate a defender who dares to challenge you.This concepts maybe seem basic, and thats the point. This game is not P2W, but rewards skill, teamplay, game sense and knowledge of the game in general and maybe its a bit overwhelming at first but give it a chance, it will take alot of your time away.

												Ball 3D is a game I thought I would play ironically with friends when we wanted a laugh and were too tired to play anything else. Unfortunately, one of my friends seems addicted to the game and has now logged over 40 hours into it within the span of a week. He endlessly screams ""Ball 3D"" while playing the game. I think he might need to be put down. Thanks, Ball 3D.			"

												At first glance, this is a simple game that seems like a Rocket League-esque knockoff. More or less random chaos, chase and kick a ball around for a few minutes, and leave when you're bored. This is a fair and accurate evaluation... at least, it's the same things that can be said for a grade-school level football (soccer) game. However, like Rocket League (and football, basketball, hockey, etc.) there is a high skillcap. A few searches on YouTube reveal just how competitive Ball 3D can be.Personally, this game has achieved what an older (now likely dead) sports game called ACE: Cyber Revolution failed to: create a fun, casual sports game with a high skillcap that could someday be recognised as a part of ESL/an esport.

												Well. I'm playing this game since Autumn 2012, and just 2 months later i started streaming and commentating some official matches. Now i'm kind of retired commentator/streamer but still i'm playing this game to day and it's still a lot of fun. Game in actuall state is almost completly different from the very first version i ever played (except for some UI options and the fact that your avatar is a ... huge puck... living puck... this puck is breathing, has dreams, has life goals, some of them have also families, and some of those families consists of SMALL CUTE PUCKS... they are going to school, learn how to move, learn some basics about the world... then they starts playing football... they loving it... and soon they are football superstars playing on a huge stadium... where (virtual) people watching pucks.... playing ♥♥♥♥ing football... and so on). Back then there wasn't anything to control kicking the ball except for height and power (no ratotions, no shift kicking, no sliding the ball from one side of avatar to another, etc.), but now - it's dynamic, enjoyable and fun. A lot of changes has been made (to mechanics, behind the scenes, to interface), some of them were controversial, some were really good, some were really bad. But now, we are here!Alright, comming back to the ""real"" review:Main gamemode is football (or for americans: soccer), as its rules are really simple i'm not gonna even describe them (except for fact, that there are bounds). Very popular addition to this is ""Real Football"" where there are outs, goal kicks, corners. Of course there are other gamemodes (hockey, racing, basketball, etc.) but those are less popular.You can play the game with other people by joining rooms. Rooms can be created by any player (which we call ""host"" and granted automaticly admin rights - which can set any aspect of the match) with max 32 slots (good internet connection here is recommended for both host and client). Soon there will be dedicated servers which will be running 24/7, where everyone can play. Of course you can play with stupid as water in toilet (or great as a Greek god) bots, but i recommend it just for practice or when you NEED to play Ball3D without internet connection.According to networking code: it's good, obviously it can be better, but it's in good state, espiecially with optional antilag system. With antilag turned off: everything (ball, every avatar including YOURS) is being calculated and decided by host with no client-side calculations. What's that mean? For example, when you try to move your avatar, you will have to wait certain time to actually see this in-game (the higher latency to servers, the longer you will wait for ""refresh""). With antilag turned on: everything (ball, every avatar including YOURS) is being calculated and decided by host like previously, but with client-sided calculations in the same time which are called ""predictions"". Simply, game is trying to predict what will happen in next x miliseconds, when there is no refresh from host, so you can move your avatar almost without this inputlag. In this case, stable internet connection is mandatory, since any issue can cause some weird situations (use at your own risk... I warned you).This game is about teamwork, but individual skills are important as well. You can't win just by rushing opponents goal and dribbling without passing, because soon or after - you will be rekt. Patience here is the key for winning, waiting for opponent to make a mistake. I said that individual skills are important as well. They are, especially when you are enforced to go 1v1 (doesnt matter if field player or GK) or if you want to score an amazing volley from almost any position (it's really difficult and you will see it very rare).Basicly this game is easy to play, hard to master. Many players, which i assumed they are completly new, wrote reviews and pointed out that this game is boring after some hours. It's like playing LoL. Everything is the same, except for a match which is unique. I know that LoL has much more depth, but Ball3D can be related to this in above case.There are many unofficial/official leagues and cups in many countries, and some are international so if you want to feel some competitiveness, your happiness will be fulfilled here. And there is one league already comming this September being sponsored from developer so don't miss it out!TL;DR If you really didn't read what i wrote, then you saved a lot of time which you can spent on Ball3D now :) If you did read: congratulations! You wasted your time!Now, go play this game. NOW!			"

												This game is fun, and its free. You play as a flat circle resembling a hockey puck, The controls are simple and your objective is to score. Its free to play with very optional celebrations and other minor things that make no difference and doesnt force them on you at all. Has an offline mode which is pretty good and online which is fun. The only thing that would make this better is if you could have AI in online to fill in vacant spots. Lots of different game modes too. This game gets a 6.5/10 from me.			"

												 I don't normally review games but since this game doesn't have much reviews, I thought I could go for another review.  Gameplay  Even though this game looks really cheap and poorly made, it is actually really fun and lots of work has gone into the making of the game! There are about 10 game modes and there are soccer(football), hockey, ping pong, darts, racing, and more. The game modes make the game really fun and gives everyone something to play with.   Music  Lots of music in this game. Some of them are in-game, intermission, and on the main menu. The music is mostly funky and comprises mainly of hip hop.   Graphics   If you like playing games for the graphics, you're not going to like this game. The game is mainly built on unity and the graphics aren't going to suprise you but they are going to get the job done.  Overall:Gameplay 8/10: Really fun especially when you play with friends! Music 4/10: Doesn't really blend in with the game and isn't exactly that good. At least it's better than other unity flash games.Graphics 7/10: Not the best graphics but it won't kill you.   Final Verdict:7/10 TLDR: This game will not appeal to everyone but I recommend you give it a try and see if you like it or not!			"

												The graphics are simply superb and the game almost bug free. Its a true pleasure to play this game just because of how simply smooth the mechanics are and the high skill ceiling, The market place is fairly priced and you even get money to spend from the start. The multitude of gamemodes help with the fun and replayability of the game. I myself usualy keep the settings around 9x antialiasing with the shaders on high and phsyics on the max settings. with a 4k resolution setting, the game is simply STUNNING at these settings!			"

It get svery dull and repatitive, the online gameplay could use a little work, as everyone's pings are in the 200's and above most times compared to the host.My rating? Out of 107.5			"

												Really nice game. Graphics is pretty cool. Some additional effects looks great. Sound is ok too, not the best, but still ok. The best thing in this game is fun from playing. It's great game for 10 or 20 minutes to relax, after school or work. Players have different level of skill, but as beginner I easy find rooms to play.What can I say more? Just start and kick ball.

												Currently writing this review I have spent around 1.5 hours playing this game and believe me there's lots to say.So despite this game being complete FREE and small in file size the game offers so much more than just football! You are able to select different stadiums and game modes such as (Basket Ball, Hockey, Racing, Darts) and a couple more. There are also tons of customization that you can add to your little hockey puck which I also think is pretty amazing especially this early on in the game.  This game has only been out a week and honestly has so much into the game already, if you are looking for a quick easy and free game to play with you friends I recommend this all the way. I can honestly see this game having a really good future a head of it.			"

												I have played this for 2 hours so far and I have to say it is a solid title.The game is free to play but not pay to win. Extras purchased are purely cosmetic from ball trails to unique goal celebrations.The physics and controls are great. The game has a lot of replay value due to it being very easy to pick up yet but difficult to master. Simply a pure soccer experience.Hopefully this game will be noticed through Steam and will gain quite a large following. An active community is what will keep this game alive.Well done to the developer on producing a solid, fun, and playable title.			"

												Honestly, I got the hardest erection I have ever gotten when the Ball 3D  came out the fance and did terrible thing to me, if you struggle to get your old boy sky high this is the game for you!! I told my friend Sooty_ about it, i shouldnt really tell you this but he has erectile disfunction, but anyway told him about it to see if it would get his python up. It didnt work but it was the best experience of my life watching his fat face trying to pop a boner on face cam xD 10/10 Would Recommend, Try it with your Dad, he might♥♥♥♥♥♥you after!!!			"

												This is not your average football game that you control an entire time and expect to have the same gameplay. Ball3D has been around for almost 5 years and it delivers one of the best multiplayer experiences ever! If you are looking for a game where you control only yourself and skill determines the winner of the game, you certainly will enjoy this game. Believe me, the dev listens to the community and expect a lot of potential from a fun little simple game			"

												Ball 3D is an excellent game. I only have one concern though, I would like to see something other than discs touching the ball. Another possible mode for workshop models that can be animated so that it seems more like soccer. It would be nice to see there be actual kicking and passing of the ball in this other mode, a catch could be to have a certain amount of hours to play this mode (but it should be a reasonable amount).

												Hallo,meine Ladies and Gentlemens hier ist meine langersehnte Review zum bekannten und weltberühmten Ball3D.Dieses Spiel sieht aus wie Rocket League nur mit Chips.Diese Änderung klingt simpel, aber Ball3D ist ein komplexes Spiel mit einer Grafik, die selbst Geralt neidisch machen würde. Ein weitere positiver Aspekt ist das Pay2win Modell, dadurch kann jeder egal ob fett oder arm das Spiel spielen(Ich bin beides). Das einzig negative am Spiel ist, dass es Terrorismus auf jeder Ebene unterstützt( Im Ladescreen steht ""Joint bISIS"")Wenn man auf Fußball steht, sollte man dieses Spiel spielen.Wenn man auf Chips steht,    sollte man dieses Spiel spielen.DISCLAIMER: DIESES SPIEL MACH SÜCHTIG			"

												Originally i got this game for a meme cause memes are good so why not??, anyway i load up the game and all of sudden the graphics hit me in the face, I was absoultely astounded at how good this game was given the fact that it is a free game, at this point i realised this is the best game i have ever played in my entire life then after aproximately 3-4 hours of playing it i saw a player his name i forgot but we'll called him johnothan the 2nd for context. Now i got into a game and after a few minutes of playing he joined and straight away i realised this is not an ordinary player so i staired him in the eye and saw that he was glowing bright red and had to be put down so i doxed him and i came to his house to euthanise him as glowing blue people are nothing but a danger to life on earth as we know it.

												The graphics are simply superb and the game almost bug free. Its a true pleasure to play this game just because of how simply smooth the mechanics are and the high skill ceiling, The market place is fairly priced and you even get money to spend from the start. The multitude of gamemodes help with the fun and replayability of the game. I myself usualy keep the settings around 9x antialiasing with the shaders on high and phsyics on the max settings. with a 4k resolution setting, the game is simply STUNNING at these settings!			"

												Pro:- Simple but funtastic, lots of modes, but actually only soccer is good. Hockey is ridicioulos when it comes to jumping and dont mention basketball or racing.- Tricky to control the ball, but thats the thing where skill comes in. Needs a lot of practice to handle the ball properly. Challenging and fun.- It's free, so give it a try.Con:- Teamplay is the spice of this game, but its not necessary to score. With good skill you can score anywhere from the middle line.- Lots of ego-players and children do play this game, so expect to play with a 11y which is rude, ego-manic and kicks people when they are better. Anyway, nothing for older players EXCEPT you go into a clan and play professional, but currently I dont see the basis for a league of this game.Maybe funny on LAN party.			"

												Just buy Rocket League.It was fun for a bit, then just annoying. The server admins I encountered are abusive such a pausing before goals, swapping people on teams, even having 1 v 31,  and the gameplay is just weird there is a racing mode, a mode like foosball where you can't cross the half line, and regular soccer, but the UI is so terrible I don't even know how to switch between them as a server admin, and they aren't listed on the server rooms. There also seems to be a part of the community thinking this is an e-sport which is 100% false, it is no where close.All of the customization is paid, you even start out with 100 of the paid currency, and a chest which buys you literally nothing, and a chest you can't open without paying for a key. There is even single custimazations worth 20,000 of the currency which will set you back $40USD for a gold chain, or spikes on your puck. The devs seen to be clearly just milking the game for money.			"

												36/100Early TL;DR: Bad graphics, but it can be fun with friends.Through my ~30 minutes of playing, here's what I have to say about... uh... ""Ball 3D: Soccer Online"". The very first thing I noticed was the game didn't have any filters to nicknames. Honestly not a big deal, but filters of some kind should be in place, esspecially if children are playing the game. Now the next thing I'd like to say is that Ball 3D is not a good looking game, nor a good sounding one. The sound effects aren't the worst, but the menu music is not very enjoyable, to say the least. The game feels really slow paced because of how slow your character, or rather object, moves. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but could be boring for some. One issue I found was that it can be difficult to block shots, but I was told by a devoloper (Maniek in the comments for this review) that to block shots easier you should rapidly kick. Speaking of kicking, that's something I think this game did decently. You can kick the ball, and choose how hard you hit it, and you can choose to hit it straight up, or curve the shot to the left or right. I think that brings a little something into the game that makes it more interesting. The last thing I'd like to say about the game is that it will be much more enjoyable with a friend to play with. All in all, Ball 3D isn't that bad. The game is free, and very fast to download, so I'd suggest you get a few friends and try it for yourself.			"

												With bad graphics and horrible gameplay, it also has horrible controls... With the similar controls to resident evil, ""Tank controls"" but then when you pair that with a football game it just doesnt work out, the graphics are horrible and i have a good computer, the game was capped at 60fps. It didn't offer anything new or exciting and me and my friends could just score goals easily to much as the controls were unable to save or do anything against the others. I'd suggest just ignore this game if it was the Plague and just keep searching for better football games as this truly isn't one.			"

												honestly, i thought this game would be terrible, i downloaded as a joke.  oh boy was i right this game is soooooo bad.your player STROLLS slower than a granny with a zimmer frame. you cant even kick the ball whilst you move. if u are lonely and have no friends downlaod, if u cant aford fifa or rockeet league, download if u are looking for a good  game to play  with friends over the holiday. well honestly download.... no DO NOT DOWNLOAD if this gaem cost 3 pence i would still demand aa refund. when u finnaly find a server you will have to wait a further 10 mins just to spawn in. if i was to describe this game in 1 word......♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111			"

												From a guy who has played this for a LOT of hours before it came to steam:Pros:- Amazing game to play with friends;- Takes communication and strategy;- Makes you feel amazing when accomplishing a nice play or goal;- Has (more like used to have [check my cons below] an high skill cap.Cons:- The creator decided to remove features essential to the game and make them premium;- The skill cap of the game was lowered by a lot with the introduction of shift, which makes the ball just go up in the air, and some people just do that all f***ing game;- Game is just not has intense anymore with the permanent shifting from everybody and not as skilled;- Developer doesn't listen to the community, been told that shift completely ruins the game, and still keeps it, while adding sh**ty updates to the game, like stupid animations to try to get money.TL;DR : I had spent hundreds of hours in this game, which used to be amazing, until the introduction of shift (a ""skill"" which ruins the game), and until the dev decided that making money was more important than player satisfaction.

												This game was terrible! First off, you are a soccer playing disc, who thought this was a good idea in the frist place! I can gaurntee you do not have 100% control. It is as laggy as heck, and it feels like i am playing on a potato. How can you kick a ball as a disc you ask, well the answer is... YOU CAN'T.  You just ram into the ball and pray that it will go in, no skill is involved at all whatsoever! Money cant buy back the time you spent on this free game.			"

												Timmy's first Unity game receives netcode!Does it function?Yes, that it does well.Is it fun?No.I'm afraid to say this, but the game visibly didn't have much polishing done, despite that being important for semi-simplistic games like this. It functions well, but that a game does not make. It was soccer but without the fun bits of actually kicking a ball or racing toward it, and all the fun of chasing it neck-and-neck at a slug's pace or just rotting off at the net.Having used Unity before I can say it felt like every Unity project I've ever made. They weren't fun either.No offense to the developers.			"

												After half an hour of gameplay i've found that this game is quite fun but has some issues. Finding a game is a bit of a roll of the dice considering there is no ping in the game browser and you don't find out if you're pushing higher ping until you join. This wouldn't be an issue is lag spikes didn't happen around the 80 mark, something other games don't seem to have a problem with. Each game has a country flag to show you approximatly where you may be joining, this doesn't of course get different areas.In conclusion, it has potential..			"

												Holy crap! I wasn't expecting to have this much fun. The game has many different game types (basketball, soccer, racing??), so you can find a sport you're into. I've only played soccer, but when I find a solid game/server with people who want to play semi-seriously, I can play this for hours. Seriously, I bought a Vive a few weeks ago, and while pretty sweet, nothing I've played on it (so far) has been as much fun. I mean...I'm actually writing a Steam review for something.For the DEVS:- I think teams should be auto-balanced as people enter/leave, and admins can make adjustments. If you're mid-game, the admin is playing as well so isn't going to want to keep stopping play. If the admin doesn't want people playing as they enter, then they can make the game private.- A stamina bar with a short speed boost is needed. It'd add that extra bit of strategy.- I haven't looked into it yet, but is there some sort of friend system? That'd be great to have an easy way to keep up with other good players. Or maybe some sort of communities/groups thing?- Is there voice support? Typing while playing is a PITA.			"

												Ball 3D is a fun game. I'm not one to usually play sports games, but looking for something to play for a little while with a friend, we tried this game. I assume it would be fun with more than two people, but we had fun with it. My only suggestion would to make the in game 'characters' move a little bit faster to keep the game going, instead of going after the ball.Overall a good game, would recommend if you have some extra time on your hands, or are looking for a free game to play with friends.

												Although i haven`t played this game for that long, i can still say the game looks and feels way better than you may think at the start by looking at the screenshots. Once start up the game you are welcomed with a nice tutorial that will help you get through the game, then when you join a server you are happily welcomed by an awesome community that will go like ""Hey nice shot"" or ""Unlucky mate"" or they might laugh at your stupid miss : (  and also i forgot to tell you that ther is also basketball and hockey which are awsome modes.  My last sentence: GO AND TRY THIS GAME			"

												Although I haven't played with it that much but it was enough to realise the major flaws of this game.Servers are player hosted which means you will have double of your average ping compared to a proper server. Except if the host has a good connection.Since you have to create the rooms, you have to know how to do it (most importantly port forwarding). Some hosts fail and you can't connect to their rooms.The ball has weird physics. At one point the ball is slowly crawling forward and then 2 players touches it and suddenly skyrockets. After that the ball bounces 2 times max and is back to snail speed.Vertical camera movement is too restricted for my taste. I can't see anything because the camera is too close to the ground.You're most likely to get kicked by these self-entitled admins without explanation or because other players (""alpha-males"") tell them to do so.Even though my experience with the community was 80% positive, I have to mention ""those"" experienced players coming to troll new ones in beginner servers who'll talk s*** if you happen to beat them. And that is pretty amusing if you think about it!I might still play this with my friend (you should try it out too as the game is just ~150mb) but I don't think I'd enjoy this game alone because of the reasons mentioned above.But yes, I recommend this game as it's fast to download and you can get right into the game but after that it's up to you if you keep playing with it or not.

Probably cause im american and the brazilians or argentinians that kick me think im not good at the game, which is dumb because im actually pretty good, i just dont do that fancy bs moves they try to do and keep to the basics and i still score pretty easily. anyways matchmaking is just dumb and needs fix, lags kills the use of other servers as well.
