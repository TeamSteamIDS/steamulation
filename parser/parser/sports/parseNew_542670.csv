												my first ever steam review: don't buy this, it's contains just the bare minimum of what is required in order to be considered a game. it basically plays itself. you just have to stand there and watch the scenery go by. no collision detection at all, run into a tree? no problem! it contains one single level on which you do 2 laps (yes, a skiing game with laps), and then it just ends. no back to main menu, no option to quit or do anything. you just stand there until you quit the game from the steam overlay. it all just feels extremely lazy and unfinished.

												I had high hope for this when I saw it but sadly I will be sticking to ""Fancy Skiing VR"" for the time being. I could play Fancy all day and feel just fine but this one had me starting to feel funny after 5 mins. To move left and right you tilt your head just like in Fancy but in this one even a slight tilt jerks hard to the side. The guy who made the video review said there is haptics when the poles touch the ground but I never got those and it didn't seem like my poles were doing anything, heck it doesn't even look like my poles can reach the ground unless I crouch way down. I also do not like that you can just ski right through all objects, the most it does is slow you down.			"

												Nice skiing game I have to say! Only tested it for maybe 10 minutes so far, but the immersion is very good, you get great sense of speed while skiing and the graphics are cool even thou I hope it will be better soon. Check out my Youtube video record of my first impressions of Extreme Skiing VR on my HTC Vive here:

			Check out this new Extreme Skiing VR gameplay on my HTC Vive and get my first impressions. This is a great ski game in Virtual Reality with roomscale, quite immersive and cool Vive graphics.		

Its quite a fun game to play and definately something to show-off for your friends that does VR for the first time, or havent tried the game out. Im gonna do more testing later today and edit my review after more time of skiing.Edit: After some people complaining I was giving this game too much positive opinion, i deleted my personal ""score"" of the game. Well honestly i dont think this is a game you will play for hours, especially since its just one track available so far, and there are better Skiing games out there already. You will test it once, twice maybe and thats it...until the devs can make some more effort with the tracks, graphics, physics and so on. Its an early stage early access, so yes its maybe not worth 8 dollars either, but hopefully the devs can make something more out of this game im future, so im not doing a refund and i wont delete the positive review. I think more winter sports games are welcome in VR and this is still a first try so why not give them a try. Thats only my personal opinion.			"
