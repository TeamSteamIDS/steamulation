Early Access Review
								This game (well, ""these games"" technically) show great potential. You get 4 varied games and they are a lot of fun. One minute you are pretending to be a Jedi, blasting troopers with their own laser blasts, next minute you are fending off zombies in an spooky dark old hospital, then you are flexing your bow and arrow skills against geeky skeletons before relaxing with some trippy snowboarding. All of these games have a unique visual and play style which is a nice touch.Sure, there are things that need work on in the game, which is what you would expect with an early access game, but it's still super playable now and a lot of fun. Can't wait to get back to my VR setup to play this again.			"

								Simple, yet effective games. I didn't expect much from it, but truth be told, just for the ""zombies"" one it worth the bought.It's a four games pack:- Two specially fun and immersive (""zombies"" and hoverboard racing or whatever is that), that transmit very well the VR feel, and the two most replayable I think. - One about lightsabers/Star Wars which is also fun but not as the level of the two previous mentioned, the lack of license make it lose points (you know, I wanted to choose my jedi/sith and see some stormtroopers). Also a ""use the force"" feature would have been great. Apart from that, it's cool just hear the lightsaber and act (or should I say overact) like jedi.- And the last one, which in my opinion is the worst, is somekind or archer game. Maybe too tricky for me or maybe I didn't play too much, but I found it a little dull.So in general, a game that you put when friends come to your house and you want to show them (or give the a try) how does VR feel. Specially as a said before the zombies one, the hover racing or the lightsabers one. Nice evening passing the glasses and watching some jumpscares or overacting.I really recommend it!			"

								A collection of six mini-games of varied quality. It shows promise, but is let down by lack of instructions and some dodgy music and sound-effects.

								This is another showpiece for the tech and nothing more.  It's basically several mini games in one: bow and arrow, lightsaber, gun, hoverboard and tetris.  Nothing terribly deep here but damn it's fun.  Especially if you get some friends over.  This should be one of the first experiences you try in VR.			"

								This is my most played VR game. After the most recent update (FEB 17) its just the go to game for me and my friends for fun. The Devs are also very active. They update the game with big updates in a good time frame rather than loads of little updates every week that you cant notice the changes. Really am happy with my purchase. Its well worth the asking price and if its on sale the its a true bargain. Have fun!			"

								This game is fun in short bursts or to just mess around with friends and see who can get the highest score. Super cool that they added a TETRIS like mode too. You can never go wrong with that. I would defineteley reccomend this to anyone new to VR or anyone else who just wants some quick fun. YOU CAN BE A EFFIN JEDI!

			Well Rogue One ""A Star Wars Story"" is out and it is ridiculously awesome, so I think it's finally time that I start my training to become a legitimate JEDI!

								Its an ok collection of simply games. each game in its own right needs polishing but on a whole they are fun. I would not reconmend the game as it is right now but if they makers of the game contine to improve it then sure. Im giving a thumbs up in the hope they contine the good effort.			"

												I had to delete my original Positive review.I think I got this game for a couple bucks during early access.Unfortunately I don't think this game is worth the new $22 pricetag.The mini-games are fun but not $22 fun.			"

												Doesn't bring anything new to the world of VR gaming. Had this been released when VR first game about, it could have been okay but - a year in - I expect more from the games. This is lazy development.			"
