								Review Update - Assetto Corsa V.08Short version: I highly recommend bying  AC. Although right now it is not a finished  game, but still a game in early acces (~beta) and key fetures like MP are not enabled yet.But what you get right now, is well worth the money and one of teh best racing sims out there. What the heck is Assetto Corsa?AC is the work of a small Italian independent Studio: Kunos Simulazione, in sim racing circles around the world known for Net Kar Pro, held in highest regards due to its driving/physic engine and tyre model.  Never heard of it? -  Just like me. I was happy with the likes of GT 5/6 and Forza, never cared for what was going on on pc and didn't know what I was missing. Anyhow, Assetto Corsa is a pc racing simulator that tries not only to appeal to its own core audience of pc sim racers, but is aimed at console players too.  Assetto Corsa builds up on the predecessor Net Kar Pro, and if successfu,l will see updates, DLC and additional features for years.Assetto Corsa  - What makes it special?IFUN!  - Yes Fun, becausedriving is as much fun in the game as it is in real live. AC is a simulator which gets and provides exactly that.Unlike a lot of otherr sims AC is very accessible, easy to get into but hard to master. The Driving Experience in AC: Just take a seat in the 1st car you like and start driving (my 1st love: BMW E30 DTM@Mugello) - Within the first round I had a big smile on my face, never before had I experienced such a great feedback and immersion with a Racing Game. - with a pad none the less The cars are  alive and responsive, you really feel  weight transfer, the tyres, and every part of the track - imho neither the GT Series, nor the Forza titles or the Sim Bin games I tried on pc  come even close. AC's driving/physics and tyre model is exquisit and unique in its way of easing you into it and letting you explore its depths. If you are looking for something in a racing game that is more detailed and refined than what you already know, then Assetto Corsa is without a doubt the right choice for you. Pad/WheelGreat improvement with Pad support in the latest update, no issues anymire.Though every Sim Racer will tell you, that you have to buy a wheel to enjoy this game that isn't true at all.  To this day I'm driving with a pad and have put 100+hours into AC with a XBox360 Controller and had more fun than I ever had with GT 5 or Forza or any other racing game - i.e. most of the pc simulators sounded like work to me till AC came around. I don't own a 3 Monitor setup, Racing Seat, wheel etc. - just a decent pc which allows me to play on high settings. So you can have fun and lots of it, and the driving experience is still a lot better than GT/Forza.  Amount/Quality of contentKunos got their hands on some 1st rate licenses, among them Mercedes (not yet in game), Lotus, BMW and Ferrari and more. AC focuses on GT2/GT3 cars and open wheelers  like the ""almost F1"" Lotus Exos S1 and the awesome old ""Lauda"" Ferrari . But more cars are to come, historicals F1, and much more. Every car is beautifully modelled and whileForza and expecially GT feature hundreds of beautiful cars from all ends of the spectrum,  Kunos is not an industry giant like them and can't ever compete with that amount of original content. But the car selection is still more than decent, all  the tracks in AC are laser scanned and the variety is great - i.e.the Nurburgring GP track and it feels and plays awesome!But here is the main thing: Assetto Corsa is moddable, that means fans are invited to produce and create tracks, cars, skins, Apps and much more - easy to install and a superb enrichment to AC. Just take a look at the beautiful skins or useful apps in the community videos - absolutely amazing, the creators deserve much praise. A big thank you to all the modders and unsung heroes out there!Graphics/Sounds:Very good, but not the very best (upcoming Project Cars) and the performance depends as always mostly on your GPU.  I use a Palit Geforce 770 4GB and play it with high settings. But this game is as you know by now not finished yet and will see a lot of improvements on quality and performace - and some of it has already been done. A low level pc with onboard grafix won't do, but with a high end system you can easily play on resolutions beyond 1920*1080.Sound is above average and good, but is lacking punch in some cars and will improve with future updates. For those who can't wait for that, there are of course already some sound mods out there.Conclusion  - Enough of the rambling rave - be part of Early Access!There are a lot of things that are not perfect in AC yet, and some that are even quite frustrating at the moment. Some issues like setting up and finetuning controllers have been fixed and teh latest update saw the AI behaviour extremely improves. Almost all the frustrating and unfair behaviour are gone, most races are really great fun now with clean racing. The new AI is certainly among the best out there: they really race, they do not drive in a straight line behind each other and bore you to death. They actually give the very immersive impression that they want to beat you, they overtake you and each other, they make mistakes, defend their racing line and so on. With Update 08 most if not all of the terrible AI behaviour is gone anf there are only minor problems left.I can't stress enough how impressive the work of the small KUnos team really is. They kept word on every promise they made, gave or announced additional free contet and their updates are coming every 2 weeks - V08 is definitely a hughe step toward a final release version. Full VersionThe full version of Assetto Corsa game is epected to be released within the next 2-4 months, and the complete content will be available then. That includes Multiplayer, Career mode and certain cars/tracks etc. Till then you get updates every 14 days, which include bugfixes, new features or new content. Until now Kunos stayed true to their word and kept the good things coming. To me this a must-by for everybody who likes to play racings games on whatever system or plattform. If you want the full time hard core simulation immersion - AC delivers just that, but if you just want to have fun driving or racing without a hassle, just pic a car, and AC delivers just that too.And while it certainly isn't perfect and unpolished in some areas, it is very stable and relativeley bugfree (2 crashes during 150+ hours of play). Of course there is much to be done, bugs to be fixed, Controller, grafic performance optimization, adding features like Multiplayer etc. - but I really feel by now that Kunos deserves trust.I will update this review when and if essential features are added and the final version is released.

								Maybe the saviour of PC sim racing?Don't get me wrong, there are other sims on the PC that are stunning in their own right, but Assetto Corsa might be the first in a long, long time that may be able to capture the hearts of the true sim racing crowd and the more casual racer/gamer. And boy does the PC racing scene need a fresh boost like this.Talking of physics for a moment, I am not sure it's as all-conquering as some are saying, but that doesn't take away from the experience - the physics are still pretty darn impressive and right up there with the best on PC and destorys the consoles (as you would expect). One of the breakthrough aspects of the cars is how planted and solid they feel under the limit, which means those fresh to real sim racing will find it less frustrating to enjoy and ""get it"". But push any car to its limit and you'll quickly realize there is serious depth here. I currently prefer AC to any other sim out there when i think of physics, fun factor, potential, and so on.The current car and track list--which is now coming in stages whilst in beta-- is drool worthy. Ferrari F40, 458, BMW M3 GT2, Spa, Monza, Imola -  it just goes on and on, and all the tracks are laser scanned, too. Some classics are missing, but with modding support and promises of DLC in the future, I can see many of these such as Sebring, Mid Ohio and Brands Hatch, coming in due course (along with many more tracks and cars).The key now is to intoduce good community aspects into it's UI, and a multiplayer experience that pushes the boat - not just a bland server list where to be in the know you have to join fragmented leagues in multiple forums all over the world. It should all be handled in the user interface.Assetto Corsa has the potential to bring a fragmented community together. It has the graphics, physics and interface to change the face of sim racing on the PC. Buy it and support Kunos, they seriously deserve it.			"

								+ vehicledynamics/handling+ looks good+ sounds good+ laserscanned tracks+ nice selection of cars+ mods- AI/KI- no weather- no night- first kunos wanted to sell it as a F2P Game and you feel and see it in almost every aspect of this game (5sec penalty, no false starts, pitstops, no flagrules etc)- kunos want to get a big company so they care more about nice pressevents and nice pictures then turning this game into a real racing simulator- no longer every 2 week updates- many, many, many idiots/jerks/♥♥♥♥♥♥s/cheaters in public multiplayer- maybe a DLC nightmare in the future (3rd party paycontet already available)- almost impossible to do close door-2-door racing cause of massive microlags in multiplayer- lags in general (when the player in front of you is hard on the edge of his car - his car starts to lag/warp and you most likely crash him/you/both of you out of the race if you dont slow down and let a gap of 1-2sec between your cars)- maxed out graphics needs huge gpu performance- damagesystem in its current state is ♥♥♥♥ed up from top to bottom- overall it feels like a tuned up forza motorsport (physic) with by far less content and costumisation of your cars (i played fm3 and loved it also) (most likely cause they wanted to sell it as f2p ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ where you would have to pay a lot of real cash for a nice paint or spoiler)- Trento Bondone Hillclimb Track is a bad conversation from netcar (the devs also forbidded to mod it into the game for modders) and is by far the visual worst track and yes you can also fall out of the hole track/level into an endless flyinspin when you crash at the wrong place...like in a 0.2 version of some modtracks. I HOPE THEY FIX THIS ASAP.So is it a good game? More - then +.If you like driving/racinggames like rf,gtr,iracing and own a wheel it is definitely a must have. ATTENTION: Nordschleife will come as DLC with 10cars and is NOT INCLUDED in the release version of this game.If you more confident with a simple xbox controller then wait for project cars or stay with forza motorsport/gt.Singleplayer sucks cause of KI and limited simulation of real racing.PUBLIC Multiplayer sucks cause of many, many, many wreckers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wannabe schumachers.Best solution is to download some hillclimb/rallytrack mods and enjoy the driving from point a to b. ALONE. Or join a racingleague for fair and hard racing (but not too close :))This is my personal opinion after 770hours of testing and driving, bugreporting and following the developement since day 1 of ea release.Cheers and have funUPDATE: now programm state is 1.1.6improved sounds: very nice, special in replays on shorter tracks. with headphones....5.1 surround sound sounds not so good aimproved graphics: good for people with 1gb vram improved tyres/physics: if you stay away from the simcade settings optimal - still benchmarkimproved multiplayer: yes, door-to-door is more possible, many options still missingimproved ki: thats the part what make me the most sick about this game. After they introduced the ki in the ea i had read a review about it in the official ac forums where the guy said that the ki is more acting like real human beings, some are aggressiv some passiv and he told his experience of his first singleplayer race. and after i tried the singleplayer mode 2 months after the release i had exact the same experience like he had when the ki was ""new"". its still impossible to do a simple trackday with different cars driven by the ki and have fun race. damn its even impossible to follow a abarth 500 train cause the ki driven ferrari behind is unable to overtake the 500 but when you overtake the ferrari he will most likely crash you instantly out of the race. whats the point of playing a racinggame where the ki is dumber then a texas instruments calculator? and the devs said in the ea phase that most players will only use singleplayer and not multiplayer so they focus more on singleplayer....ähm wtf?!?and now they splitting up the costumers into ""good dlc buyer cashcow players"" and ""bad only stock/mod content poor players"" in multiplayer....wtf?Yes the game is still in developement but where are the times when you buyed a game and it was (almost) complete and with all features players wanted and features which are also needed to say it is a simulator and not a mariokart. But no kunos said they dont want to get competion against simbin, iracing, rfactor so now you have the result. ki not working, singlepayer racing only 10 laps max....multiplayer which you also cant enjoy to its full capacity if you dont buy dlc(´s). Please Kunos stop seperating each part of you game into a calculation part to get money. If you have a full package you will get your money cause you will have a overall good product and not a thing which falls apart in every aspect when you watch it close.			"

								*UPDATED to .21*For me, one of the best racing sims out there. definitely recomendable. I will make a list of pros and cons (list for V0.94) so you can decide for yourself:Pros:-Best driving simulation I've ever tried, the car is so predictable that you can even go sideways playing with a mouse. Dont get me wrong, you really NEED a wheel to enjoy this game. Almost every car is easy to drive in your confort zone, try to go above it  to earn some tenths and it will become tricky before you lose the control of the car.-You get a bunch of cars (a bit of everything) and a few laser scanned circuits. We are talking of the closest to reality models you can get on a game here. More to come, the Green Hell as dlc in October I think-Mods (with dev tools soon *already released). mod apps (displays, corners performance,..),mod sound, mod tracks (one of high quality already, crappy ports too), and mod cars (soon* already released good ones: shelby cobra and gp2).-Small and friendly dev team. They ask, you answer, they give (list of wanted cars and traks) and you ask, they answer (if you have some problem)-Game modes: Im just here for the multiplayer but there is a lot of challenges, time atack mode, drift and drag mode too. *multiplayer is enjoyable already, you have some jump in and drive servers and more serious onesNow the cons:-As early access: everything works in single player, the AI needs a bit of agresivity tuning, now avoids you an doesnt defend its position. The devs have said to v1.0 there will be 2 sliders for strenth and agresivity. Multiplayer have some lacks but it was  released this friday so it will be better for sure.- you dont have a massive list of cars like lets say Project Cars-As the time writing, is not possible to have another light source than the Sun, so no night races yet. You can race from sunrise to sunset with dynamic time and stuff- Not weather yet- Car damage (visual and mechanic) is not implemented yet,  seeing the perfection of the grip simulation I'm sure it will be top-notch tho- *You will find some idiots on the multiplayer from time to time in open servers, but what multiplayer game doesnt have them? (btw i've only seen one in 150h, the rest is just lack of experience)final thoughts:If you are still reading this, buy it, you wont regret it			"

												Best racing sim ever.- Fantastic GFX, reflections, smoke etc etc- Cars look amazing- Engine sounds that actually get under your skin- Superb G27 support- Native tripple screen support and track IR- All cars FEEL like actual cars- Great tracks- Well optimised (apart from the smoke ;))- Decent multiplayer track days and eventsI've been playing AC for a while and it has been my go-to game for that racing buzz on the G27. No other game comes close in terms of making you feel that you are part of the car and giving you that racing buzz.My favorite racer for some time was GTR2, but it was getting a little old and tired in the looks department and it's feel. I've got a ton of racing games on various platforms and it is safe to say that AC has the best feel hands down of any.Step into the legendary 98T lotus as an example, up the boost, watch the engine strain, hear the tyres screeth and feel your car squirm as the boost comes in and you fight to keep the car facing forwards on the track, whilst meanwhile that beast of an engine sound is giving you a rush. Limit the boost to save the engine, fly into a corner too hot, try to take someone on the outside and up the boost again trying to outdrag them as you fly past and look to the left screen seeing the engine flashing red and them dropping back in your mirrors - you know you are pushing it hard and the engine won't last like that forever!Honest this game is a credit to the developers, and for anyone who thinks it doesn't have enough cars or tracks, this game is all about quality and not quantity.Now they have added the Yellowbird it is a fantastic addition. Such a tailhappy fun beast of a car to drive and drift around in.You've got your sporty production cars, tail-happy beasts such as the mighty Cobra, and limited production cars / race cars. All of the sounds are unique and the charteristics of each car make it a different game with each car you step into.Absolutely spot on, and worth it for anyone who is into their racing sims.It's worth noting that if you want to push the visuals on multi screen setups you do need a fairly hefty system though. I am running an I7 4770k under water and two GTX 780TI AMP's. I can max everything out apart from the hi-res mirror reflections and smoke needs to be turned down. I would imagine for a single screen though that somehting like one 780 would be plenty.			"

								Let me be as frank, and honest as possible, this game is absolutely amazing, but there is a caveat.  So I did not really play racing games/sims and one day I saw Grid Autosport, and it had a really fun look to it so I picked it up and with my XBOX controller, started having fun.  The AI is terrible on that game, but in multiplayer with friends its a great time.  I enjoyed it so much, I thought, have I missed out on one of the best genres of games? So I picked up Assetto Corsa, and tried it out.  It was fun in third person view with the controller, but as I read through forums, and spoke to others I was missing out.  This is a SIMULATOR, a program DESIGNED to mimic real life driving and thus cannot be enjoyed fully with sticks and buttons, and that a wheel, no, a good wheel was going to improve my experience.  Well, for my birthday, my wife got me the G27 wheel, and my goodness, this is where this game absolutely excels.  There is nothing like it, I truly feel as though I am driving the car (to a point) and I LOVE IT!  I tried Grid with the wheel, and its not bad, not bad at all, its the difference between Outrun and getting a day at a real racing track playing AC.  There is also modding support, so if I want to drift one night, I have a some drift cars, want to drive F1, those are there, and the amount of tracks and cars provided by the community, are increasing daily.So....to sum it up, if you are looking for a game, this probably isnt for you, but if you are looking to have a real racing experience, this is where its at!

												There are a few pluses to this game: Laserscanned tracks Semi-elaborate car settings options, although I don't like the handling model (see below) The Force Feedback is nuanced and communicates well what a car is doing through the steering wheelI tried to like this game, but unfortunately it is also very lacking in many areas which severely offset the positives: AI is unaware of players and will continue their set path no matter what. Their ability to fight or defend is mediocre at best. No weather effects (rain) No nighttime racing Lacking career mode Sounds are sometimes accurate, but for the most part it's too flat. Sounds are very digital and lack in reverberation with surroundings.  Handling is not that great, I feel especially the tyre model is lacking. Obviously people will be very sensitive to this because it is supposed to be a great simulator. Unfortunately I must disagree, so I'll try to be elaborate on this one. Front tyres will not respond correctly when trailbraking, and mid-corner they do not bite (i.e. generate lateral force) as much as they should. This is very simple to showcase: try and flick the wheel left and right through the exit barriers of the Nürburgring Tourist exit; even high-downforce racing cars with proper racing tyres will barely change direction in this game, whereas I can make my silly road car on road tyres shift tyre load very easily and rapidly. This phenomenon is also visible in (record) hotlaps from the top guys on the leaderboards: even they have to coast terribly long at corner entry and mid-corner, otherwise any car in this game will just go wide. This can easily be shown by for example looking up real-life time attacks on the Nordschleife and comparing the corner speeds with those in the game. There is just no way to really push without the front tyres giving up, and that is just a shame. I tried my fair share of extreme car setups (minimum spring and damper stiffness in the front and maximum in the rear, maximum rake, etc.) just to get the front end turn, but the physics engine just does not respond accordingly. Again, this is visible in the way even the leaderboard players have to coast so much through turns.Another thing is that drifting in this game does not look natural at all; whenever the cars oversteer they continue to move as a solid body in a given direction and at the same velocity. It's not possible to make the car increase its angular velocity (i.e.: spin out) by abruptly stabbing the throttle or the brake. It is also not possible to power out the cars from corner apexes and gradually straightening the wheel. As a result, there is no chance to do controlled drifts in which cars harmoniously slide from corner to corner as if they are dancing, and certainly not with a lot of tyre smoke from spinning the rear wheels under power. Look up any video of AC drifting to see what I mean; as a result of the non-accurate handling model cars will just go from uncontrolled slide to uncontrolled slide, there is never an actual feeling that the driver is in control of the drift angle at all. What's more, this unacademic and totally disrespectful response of the developer says enough about his lack of knowledge and approach to an iterative process of improving something technical like a physics engine: http://imgur.com/a/NgYYQ This guy can't be a real engineer if he can't even handle some constructive peer reviews...But most of all: I'm especially fond of online racing, but this game has just the worst online system of any recent driving game, and I want to elaborate on this game-breaking experience that makes me regret my purchase of this incomplete game. There simply is next to no variety in online lobbies; it is always the same track and car combinations that appear, and making a custom lobby will result in a lack of players that are able to join, let alone actually join. This is due to two main reasons: Hosting an online lobby is done with a seperate dedicated server tool that imposes unnecessary restrictions on the host. First of all, a single car model with a particular colour has to be manually assigned to every player slot beforehand. There is no way of selecting one or multiple classes that are allowed, but instead there is just a list of all the car models without their specifications. Not only is it very hard to know which cars are evenly matched to each other, but it results in extremely limited choice. In practice, it is either having to deal with one-make races or a fixed varied list in which one or two cars of each model is available; for example, two Ferraris 458, two Mercedes SLS AMG, two Corvettes, etcetera. In the latter case, when a car is taken by another player, it is prohibited to drive it anymore because it belongs to the prior assigned server slot; if the two McLaren P1s are already chosen, you are out of luck and have to choose another model. The host decides which cars are available, both in type and in quantity. A ridiculous decision; this has to be the only car game in recent times that carries over this real-world restriction/scarcity into the digital world. Some people even go afk in the lobby just not to lose their virtual car in that server to another player...Furthermore, the online tool cannot be setup to cycle through multiple tracks, let alone a new set of available cars. Every change has to be done manually and servers have to be restarted with every edit, kicking all the players...The online experience is further worsened with the next point below: DLC system splits up the game into many different sub versions. In other games this is no problem because you can join all lobbies, but are just restricted to use the content that you own. Not in Assetto, where you are just denied into a server when you lack just one car or track from the list that the host setup. In practice, this leads to even less variety, because lobby leaders know that they will not get many players joining if they choose cars from several DLC packs, so it's mostly either 'vanilla game content lobbies' or 'DLC lobbies' that are available.Care for some online GT3 racing? You are forced to buy Dream Pack 2 and 3, as well as the Red Pack and lately the Porsche pack as well for the Porsche GT3 car. Want to have a supercar battle? Same problem, lobbies will probably have at least a Porsche sportscar, so you must buy any of that DLC as well as the Tripl3 Pack DLC for the Ferrari 488 GTB that inevitably is in the lobby list. If you own just the vanilla game, then forget about proper online play altogether. All in all, this game is fun if you want a semi-realistic hotlapping game, or if you are planning to buy all the DLC. Otherwise, I would definitely not recommend it.			"

												Full opinion of Assetto Corsa:PRO:- The Most realistic simulator currently available on Steam.- Great Graphics-Engine.- Good Sounds of Cars.- The tracks are created in Laser-Scan, equal to reality in every details.- The cars interiors are gorgeous.- You can change all the parameters of the machine.- The forum Game is very popular. You can Post mod or exposing problems / bugs to developers.- Multiplayer is Fun, with various features, formed by serious people.CONTRO:-Where is the night and the rain?-Some Bug in Multiplayer.-Unable to play via keyboard.-HDR Unoptimized.-Carreer and events much passable.-There isn't Workshop.What to say? I'm Italian and I'm proud to own a simulator completely Made in Italy so damn beautiful and long-lived.If you have a steering wheel this game MUST be your in ALL THE COSTS!Who played with the keyboard ... stay away from this.One of the best simulators of all time.

												A great example of Early Access done right, Kunos was always communicating what they were working on and delivered updates frequently.As for the game itself, if you want a racing simulator, Assetto Corsa is the title you want. Period. It may not have the same eye-candy as some titles, but it delivers in the physics simulation, force feedback (use of a wheel is highly recommended), and native, FOV-correct triple-monitor support.Kunos has stated plans to continue building on AC with DLC and core updates through 2017, so even if you didn't get in on early access, there's still a great value to be had here.

												I love this game. Assetto Corsa dawns a new era of the racing simulator. Assetto Corsa is a simulator that brings the revered true-to-life racing experience to the casual gamer. This game bridges the two worlds together without losing rigidity as a racing simulator. This is a simulator that will punish you for entering a corner too fast, or giving too much gas in a corner. But at the same time it is so delightfully simplistic and intuitive that it is easily playable by almost anyone. Assetto Corsa is one of the few racing simulators that is fun, and still encourages you to make mistakes and learn from them. If you are coming from console games like Forza, or GT and are looking for something more, then this is the game for you. Assetto Corsa is truly the best racing simulator there is.  However, this game is by no means perfect. One of the biggest problems that I have for this game is the lack of awareness of speed. This leads to the driver entering the corner much too fast, and creates an inorganic driving experience. This problem is mostly notable in the interior driving view. Other reviewers have mentioned this as a flaw and it certainly is one. I found the best way to correct this is to adjust the FOV or go to either the bonnet cam or the bumper cam. If you are someone that can get used to the inside cam (where it occurs the most) then this might not be a problem for you.			"

												I have old i5-3230M GT650M laptop.When I bought AC(ver 1.6?) it is unplayable at 720p, graphic low and more than about 8 AI cars. I mostly played practice or hot lap. But I did not complaint. The driving experience itself is good enough..Now ver 1.9, with same laptop,1080p low, 12 AI cars,  no problem!! 50~60fps!!24 AI cars reach 30~40fps at some tracks. playable!Whta a great job!Some games just want to kill your GPU..Kunos, keep up the good work!

												I am 50 years old and not much of a gamer, but enjoy simulations of all kinds, which Assetto Corsa is. They are a small group of people and do a good job listening to us. They have improved this software so much in the past year that I had to update my review.   One thing I am sure, from hearing about what others are describing about AC, is that each hardware setup (computer/wheel/screen/vr) behaves a little different.     Then of course there is the settings (comuter/wheel/software). So much can be gained or lost here.   Go through (assettocorsa ini) file and set everything to your computer/wheel.    I got Razer Cortex, which shuts down background apps and Malwarebyts, which cleaned hundreds of pups.     Download the (Anti Clipping and Fanaleds) apps for your wheel.     REFLECTIONS set down to low and static reflections set to very low, may help.    I find it harder to drive in game than a real car so be patient and be aware of your speed. 50 mph in-game still feels like 30 mph to me.   I still have to remind myself of the power I have, without any repercussions to the $500 000 car or myself/public property. I had a V8 Vega (300+ horse, curb weight 2500 pounds), could, at times, leave me shaking for the rest of the day. I could only imagine the skid mark a car like the  LeFerrari could cause in your underwear.     Assetto Corsa's physics really are incredible.  This is getting very real. Assetto Corsa is worth all the money and time.  One other thing that has me so addicted is the track and car mods.   Checking to see what is new every day is one of my favorite things to do. Just try searching Google Image ""Assetto Corsa car mod downloads"" and see for yourself.     I can't emphasize this enough. Sim guys are some of the nicest and most helpful people from all over the world.  The guy's at Assetto Corsa must love what they do and it shows.   Have fun. Paul			"

												Assetto Corsa is a realistic racing simulation game developed by Kunos Simulazioni. In Assetto Corsa you get behind the wheel of one of many realistically recreated cars ranging from the little Abarth 500 (upgraded version of the Fiat 500) to the beast that is the Pagani Zonda R. You'll push these cars to their limits as your storm around the tracks this game has to offer including the legendary Nurburgring (part of the Dream DLC Pack 1).Before I get to the main part of my review I want to point a few things out which have had an impact on my opinion of the game. Firstly, I'm not a racing sim expert, far from it in fact, most of my racing experience comes from the arcadey side of the genre so I'm less used to the level of realism found in AC. Secondly, I played using an Xbox 360 Gamepad rather than a wheel and pedals since I don't own a wheel. Thirdly, I own the Dream DLC Pack 1 so my review will include things only available as part of the DLC. Finally, I haven't followed the game through it's development and I've only played the most recent version which is v1.1.6.+Good graphics and visual effects+A good selection of cars which are all well modeled+A good variety of tracks including a laser-scanned Nurburgring +Quite a lot to do, including: drag races, solo track practices, time trial events, race weekends a career mode and much more +Surprisingly good controls for a Gamepad+A fair amount of customisation options for the cars in regards to tuning and paint jobs+Great sound effects for the cars+All of the cars, even different versions of the same car (e.g. a production model and a GT model), feel very different which makes driving each one unique to driving the others+It's very easy to get into for beginners like myself+A huge amount of mods+Lots of info displays which you can choose to use when racing+Despite AC being out of Early Access, Kunos are planning to continue adding more and more content to the game which can never be a bad thing+AC supports Oculus as well as three monitor setups, while I personally don't make use of these I know they're important features for a lot of people+Reasonably quick load times+/-Penalties feel a little too harsh to me but perhaps that's just because I'm not a racing sim buff-The AI are pretty bad, they seem to have a path which they absolutely have to take and don't feel at all like they're actual drivers which is what you would expect from a racing game. On top of this they're also very 'timid' when it comes to overtaking and unless you go off the track chances are they'll just stay behind you for the rest of the race-While you can change the time of DAY that your race takes place at there's no night time in the game which is rather disappointing-Weather effects go no further than clear skies, clouds of fog so there's no rain which is again, rather disappointing-The soft-body physics is really bad, doesn't look at all realistic, for example driving 150mp/h into a solid wall left my bumper with some small dents and scratches-The controls which can be bound to the Gamepad are very limited, for example you can't bind pause to your Gamepad so you have to reach over to the Esc key every time you want to pause which gets frustrating very quickly-The mouse cursor is always visible on screen, one my biggest pet peevsVerdict:For regular gamers - Worth Purchasing (8/10)For Racing sim veterans - A Must Have (8.5/10)A fantastic racing sim which can be enjoyed by those new to racing sims as well as veterans of the genre, though it's far from flawless. If you have any interest in racing games I suggest you pick this one up.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.			"

 Brief Introduction Assetto Corsa is undoubtedly one of the most popular racing simulators out there, despite all the good things and bad things from this game, I feel a bit half-half about this game.But before we get into the review lets go over what the developer had to say about Assetto CorsaOriginally posted by Devoloper of Assetto Corsa: Assetto Corsa features an advanced DirectX 11 graphics engine that recreates an immersive environment, dynamic lighthing and realistic materials and surfaces. The advanced physics engine is being designed to provide a very realistic driving experience, including features and aspects of real cars, never seen on any other racing simulator such as tyre flat spots, heat cycles including graining and blistering, very advanced aerodynamic simulation with active movable aerodynamics parts controlled in real time by telemetry input channels, hybrid systems with KERS (Kinetic energy recovery system) and energy recovery simulation. Extremely detailed with single player and multiplayer options, exclusive licensed cars reproduced with the best accuracy possible, thanks to the official cooperation of Car Manufacturers.  What I think about the Game  Pros… As a proper car simulator, I think you should be able to feel every little bit of the road, and with Assetto Corsa, you’re able to get that. The actual physics of this game is magnificent with a force-feedback wheel, this is achievable. With a decent wheel and pedal system, you are able to feel the understeer, the oversteer, even little bumps in the road – this means that you can feel it build up, and you know when you’re going to lose it. In this whole simulator aspect, I think this beats out its competitors, such as Project Cars. Despite losing out on graphics to Project Cars, it makes up in terms of physics and overall “realism” to the driving experience. The details put into the exterior and interior of cars, even moving parts of cars is phenomenal as well. As of the Japanese car pack, Assetto Corsa dives in and out of different car pop culture, whether you're on the touge tracks of Japan to the sweeping curves of Eau Rouge (Spa). To say the least, most other PC ""simulators"" only offer one or two cars per each region but Assetto Corsa hits the nail in the head in terms of variety. and Cons Being given this great first impression of realism makes me so reluctant to criticize this game, but once I dug deeper into my hundreds of hours of Assetto Corsa, these small missing details of a racing simulator starts to bother me more and more. Weather effects aren’t available in this game, like driving in the rain, and I think that as a racing simulator, it’s a must have. The AI isn’t that good, but neither is the AI in its competitors. Thus flags are a thing, but no marshals? Pit stops too, where are they in single player  is the realism in them?  It’s not like they don’t have it in motorsports. Where the crew changing your tires?  Where are your car jackers?  Where are your post-race celebrations? C’mon and you still call this a racing simulator. I want to see yellow flags going up when there are crashes half way around the circuit, I want marshals to be waving the blue flag so I can go “Hey Dan, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself because you’re♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I want the full enjoyment of your pit-crew working on your car. Developers, wake up, you might as well call them “Need for Speed: On the Track”. All the Assetto boiz are going to dislike this but it’s the truth. Overall Thoughts It’s a great simulator, great handling, great experience, but has way more things to improve on. If you’re going to label your game a “simulator”, don’t give us something half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and something that’s not complete.  Conclussion? Yes, despite all the downsides of the game, I think it's one of the best racing games, let alone racing simulators out there. But developers, get off your asses and do something about it. (If you found the review helpful, giving it a thumbs up would be nice!) If you're looking for more Steam Friends? Look no more - feel free to add me! Thus, hit me up if you want to play Assetto Corsa with meEdit1: A few gramatical errors.Edit2: Thanks @Inbekannt - pitstops are a thing now in Assetto Corsa, adjustments made to the reviewEdit3: Change to the review as of the implementation of the Japanese Car PackEdit4: Thanks @Boogle. silly vocabulary error.

												Having spent 500+ hours in the last 2.5 years, I can say this is easily the best racing game ever and a true successor to the GTR2 category. It is irritatingly realistic, requires a lot of practise and epic patience to get your laps right and comes closest to the real thing. Earlier versions had optimisation issues but now, Assetto Corsa is a charm and is a must-have for all car guys/racing fans. There is a sense of achievement when you get your laps/setups right.Pros-1. Physics are bang-on perfect! If you are looking for realism, this is as real as it can get!It has reached a point where its painfully real. For example- You set your toes and cambers to tune the cornering, it affects the temperatues (inside,outside and mid tread of tyre gets different temp) and the suspension reactions. You then fine tune the suspension which affects your previous toes/cambers. But mid-way you realise your height, spoilers, Anti-roll bars and spring stiffenss need adjustment which you are able to perfect but when you run a lap.... It has all went to waste because the last update (while being brilliant) offsets something else completely ruining your whole life.No corner is as easy as brakes, steer, accelerate out... You've to be aware about the tyre loading, temperatues, current fuel load and age of tyre before deciding on that ever-fluctuating time to brake and to steer.2. A huge array of cars and tracks. Fulfills every guy/girl/helicopter's need in terms of car choice- hatchbacks, small sports cars, japanese sports cars (the only DLC I refuse to buy), sedans, SUVs, vintage cars, vintage legends, supercars, hypercars, GT4, GT3, GT2 and F1. And believe me, each one of it has a completely different character and satisfies when you get it right. Tracks, I agree are just about enough but can seem limited at times. Solution? Download more through various concerned sites.3. Brilliant community support- A lot of fantastic mods are available, which are very welcome by the mod-friendly nature of the game. In addition, there are lots of racing leagues being organised very professionally by players (very much like iRacing).4. Very affordable pricing of the product! Even the DLC are completely affordable for even college students. I feel the 'Value for Money' factor is off the charts for Assetto Corsa.Cons-1. Career mode starts off from the basic hatchbacks races and progresses upto the Formula/GT series in a very slow fashion. Whilst, from a real life career POV is very real, gets really boring in 2-3 hours. I found it boring to establish expertise on FWD hatchbacks but it definitely helps you understand the basics of driving a car fast. This progression gives you the feeling of differences in street vs race cars.2. Engine sounds has always been a weakness of Assetto Corsa, which has improved upto a certain extent, yet still not on par with other racing games in the market. Solution? Mods! Available sound mods are simply brilliant and eradicate this issue completely. (Google ""Fonsecker"" if you want a jump start on sound mods)In competition-Assetto Corsa makes Codemasters' Formula 1 look as real as Mario Kart. Project cars which is 5 times as costly to buy (incl DLC) doesn't come anyway near in terms of realism; and Assetto Corsa doesn't come near PGC in terms of graphics. iRacing is the only real competitor to AC but loses out on pricing, that thing is damn expensive. NFS,drive,forza etc etc aren't in this league so no use comparing.All in all, just buy the game already, if you ready to learn racing from the ground up (even though you have won championships before), and if you have a lot of patience. There is nothing like Assetto Corsa. It is a step ahead of every other game else.			"

												if you want a true to life simulator of car dynamics and car physics then this is your game.if you want a simulator that perfectly captures each car's individual driving and handling feel as well as each car's individual engine note, this is your game.if you want a simulator that accurately models drivetrains, this is your game.AC with the bonus pack and both dream packs is an absolutely brilliant game, and with the 1.3 update brings new improved tyre models and physics along with reworked sound and some more polishing. cars feel incredibly planted with new tyre modeling (as should be the case on semi-slicks and slicks) and gain of grip/loss of grip works perfectly. it will only get better, and better. really the only thing that needs to be added is laserscan sebring and laguna seca along with a polished fully fledge career mode and its a 10/10 game. as of now its 9/10buy with confidence			"

												Went racing in September last year trying to go drifting. Failed miserably.Friend told me about how far racing steering wheels for games had come and how good everything was.Hadnt touched one since Colin McRae Rally on Playstation 1.Googled 'best drifting simulator' found Assetto Corsa. Sold spare set of wheels for race car, bought Logitech G92, game and graphics card for PC in December.Done nothing but sweet sweet Skids until Janurary. Got bored, discovered user created content and online play. Now I tandem with teams on small Japanese racetracks in LSX powered Silvias.Went back out on track in February, Killed it drifting.11/10 havent even tried to drive a normal car.			"

Early Access Review
								Did you ever drive a Ferrari in a racing game before? Of course you did, plenty of games in the past had Ferraris in their repertoire but the FERRARI 458 ITALIA in AC feels for me actually the very first time to drive one of these hot beautys. Easily playable with a thumbstick controller if you don`t have a proper wheel ready in your pocket.At the moment Assetto Corsa is in Beta which means it is a giant Tech Demo without the upcoming career mode, multiplayer and has no AI and physical damage yet but the AAA graphics (laser scanned tracks!), great handling and outstanding  sounds/effects makes me believe that we have here one of the best Driving Simulators coming up for a discount price till it`s release probably in 2014. Here you have Life for Speed, rFactor and iRacing mixed together to an excellent and amazing racing game. This game is simply superb! Not only for sim fans :)			"

Early Access Review
								This is my first Steam review; I hadn't felt much inclined to really write one before now, but after 100+ hours on Assetto Corsa I feel compelled to. I'm definitely a car game enthusiast, and Assetto Corsa is the best racing simulation I have ever played. No other game, in my opinion, comes close to conveying such a sense of how it really must feel to drive these cars. Assetto Corsa has nice graphics and sounds, but it's the laser scanned tracks and an advanced physics model that really set it apart. To provide specific ideas as to what this means, weight transfer is beautifully conveyed, the way the cars behave makes sense, and you are driving on surfaces that virtually exactly match reality. Something I really enjoyed for example was how the same cars handling varies with tyre choice. Take a street tyre for example, you will feel the tyre roll and the car slide relatively easily and quite predictably. Put on a racing compound however and you now feel the car chassis working harder, and when the grip does give out the slide is much more dramatic and less easy to control. There is huge depth and many hours to enjoy exploring such aspects, without it ever becoming frustrating or unintuitive. Assetto Corsa is still 'early access' as I write this, but there is already a promising and welcoming community, and plenty of good content, with more coming in the form of additional manufacturer and track licenses. This is a must have for any driving enthusiasts game library.			"

												It's difficult to write a review for Assetto Corsa as it means you need to think about the game and thinking about the game just makes me want to play it right away. Assetto Corsa. This is a simulation game and the learning curve reflects that, you learn to drive each car as they're all very different.There's a great selection of cars and a good selection of tracks with quite a lot more to come from the Assetto Corsa team.Visually the game is stunning, the level of detail both inside and out of the vehicles is truely wonderful. The tracks look realistic and there's isn't this over exposed lighting or over the top effects that you see in a lot of so called simulation racing games.  The enviroments in Assetto Corsa  look clean, crisp and believable.  There's the option to enter photo mode and mess around with the direction of the sun, field of view, focus levels, light levels and some pre-set filters, it's well executed and gives you the chance to get the perfect screenshot. The tracks are laser scanned for that ever so more realistic driving simulation, this applies to the ""Next Generation"" tracks but not the ""Historic"" ones. The physics engine is great, it acts how you would expect it to and every curb and bump on the track has a direct affect on your car. The force feed back is amazing, it lets you know exactly how your car is handling and it all adds up to an immersive racing simulation that brings a smile to your face. In Assetto Corsa you go from sliding off the track at every corner to setting decent lap times, pushing yourself that bit more each lap and it's a very rewarding experience. There's a ton of game options ranging from practice, challenges, race, online and all with sub categories.With enough driving assist options for any level of player, full traction control, full anti-locking brakes, 100% stability control and all adjustable from full to completely off. As you would expect for a PC game there's enough visual options so you can get the frame rates set to what suits you best.I use a R7 265 2GB graphics card and never dipped below 65FPS, 1080P with a custom settings, anti-aliasing x2, anisotropic filtering x8 and high to maximum details, so I would say this game is very well optimised.There's full key mapping for keyboard, steering wheel, pedals and xbox 360 controllers. I would recommend a steering wheel with force feed back as it's so much better. The main menu system is fast and easy to use. The menu system when you're driving is great, you can a choose a huge amount of options ranging from gear indicator to suspension physics and you have the option to drag them and place them where you would like.I feel overall the sounds in this game are very nice, there are a few cars which sound too digital to me but I've never driven them so it would be unfair to judge. The A.I for me is pretty good, there's been a few tweaks to make them better and with the original Assetto Corsa content (Not mods) the A.I does a great job of doing consistent lap times as well as being smart enough to avoid crashing and give a good challenging driving experience. Even at 80% difficulty which is there lowest setting they are pretty fast. The modding community is on fire with this game, obviously some mods are poorly done but there's also some that are on par with what the Assetto Corsa development team have created and that's saying a lot because they do superb work. Cars, tracks, textures, Ui, there's pretty much a mod out there for everything. There's still a few issues with this game that need to be addressed in order to make it the full on simulation game. Pit stops only work in multi player and still need to be tweaked, there's no flag system yet but there is small mod for it and the penalty system is really awful and needs to be removed and rethought. The option for weather and night time driving would be a great touch but it's not something that's game breaking.9/10. Grazie Kunos Simulazioni, Grande lavoro.			"

												Assetto Corsa is, to me, the shell of a perfect racing game, and with more time and money I can see it being a truly incredible product.The physics, handling, track quality and as such, general racing immersion of AC is a level above other racing titles like Forza, Gran Turismo, or Project Cars. RFactor may offer better physics, I haven't tried it.AC may be behind some of the above on graphics and AI, and is definitely behind Forza and GT on car and track selection, and the depth of the career mode.So you have to figure out what you want in a game, due you want fidelity to real life, with accurate simulation of each car, precise aerodynamic and drivetrain calculations and laser scanned tracks, or do you want to be able to drift around corners without sacrificing lap times? Do you want a false sensation of speed, or an accurate introduction to cornering and car weight distribution? Do you want top level AI and reward intensive career progression, or are you happy endlessly lapping empty tracks, looking for slight improvements in your cornering technique.I much prefer the later, but I don't mean to disparage those who enjoy the former. I've spent my last 30hrs in game lapping one track (Zandvoort in the Netherlands), with one car (the McLaren 650S GT3) and the experience has been hugely enjoyable as I try to approach race car driver speeds (which I'm sure I'm far off, currently only the 5th fastest on RSR for that combination). The feel of laser scanned track through the force feedback is incredible, the handling dynamics superb and the complexity and precision of high-speed racing is endlessly fascinating to me.If you want to genuinely feel the sensation of racing a well modelled 458, or a McLaren P1, or a GT3 or F1 car through Spa, or the Nurnburgring, this is a near perfect way to do it (short of somehow renting one!)If you're a fan of driving, buy AC and invest in developing technique. If you're a fan of arcade style multiplayer, or the quick fun of frantic drifting buy something else.Highly recommended, from someone looking forward to the new car releases in May and June. If they can add some American and Japanese tracks, expand the list of road cars, continue to tinker with the AI, and maybe, eventually, develop a solid career mode, then this will be a perfect racing game.

												DISCLAMER! This review is based on my experience using a Xbox controller. (63 hours so far)Graphics (car): Very detailed.Graphics (environment): Not great but passable and enjoyable. Performance: Runs great on i7 4790k + 970 (80FPS+ on high setting)Sound: Let this speak for itself (youtube) Force feedback (controller): Even with a controller I have sense of control on how my car behaves on the road.""Damage"": The physics isn't great when you bump into things it feels like playing bumper cars. (youtube) and the car damage are mostly scratches.Single player + AI: Single player is great and with many challenging modes. However, when you are racing against AI they will pretend not to see you and hit you.Multiplayer: The community is awesome. Everyone wants to race but every now and then someone will try to ram you on purpose.Multiplayer (server browser/host): Easy to host but no steam integration. Expect a lot of EU servers. DLC: Might seem overpriced at first but completely worth. Tons of high quality cars and tracks.Overall, great sandbox racing simulator.			"

												version 1.0.0 just dropped.  It brings new vehicles, maps and a completely overhauled sound system as well as better vehicle damage, better mechanics and handling, overall the game feels ""miles"" better compared to the previous versions! Well done Kunos. ohh and career mode is now availible to play... this game is honestly a steal, for the price to content ration!TLDR: Everything that could have been improved, was improved......Edit: AC is no longer in ""early access"", more career missions have been released to further the game aswell as tweaked mechanics on some vehicles, and a hint at future licensed vehicles to come.Every corner in the game you take, you always get a shot of adrenaline, you can never know if you are going to fast that you might spin out, or just that perfect speed that would end up giving you a an advantage on your ever soo close opponent that is trailing right behind you.

												After spending 150 hours in Project Cars, I decided to buy this.. so this is more of a comparison than a review.. or both? The first thing I noticed was how much different the FFB feels. It's difficult to explain, but I'll try. It feels much closer to driving a real car. There's a wider ""soft zone"" than in PCars, as PCars tends to feel fairly stiff even with the smallest movements. You can turn down FFB strength on PCars to compensate, but this makes some of the more dramatic turns feel ""off"" or too weak. Assetto Corsa gives a more balanced and dynamic feeling throughout the various turn radiuses. You also feel everything on the road to the slightest detail and the laser scanned tracks add even more detail to this. (Also the grass actually feels like grass, sand like sand, and your car slides appropriately! In PCars the grass is like quick sand.) Overall, it just feels right.The car handling and physics also feel more akin to a real vehicle. Because of this, I found the driving more intuitive and found myself making more consistent laps. The game feels much more stable as well. I haven't encountered any bugs and even in VR it runs silky smooth. PCars can be pretty glitchy and unreliable, both in the physics and sound.. making it pretty frustrating sometimes. Drifting of course is far better in Assetto Corsa, (not even comparable, honestly) which is what I'm going to spend most of my time doing personally. I don't really see much point of going back and playing PCars other than to play with a friend who doesn't own this game. My only gripe is that I can't tune my vehicles to the precision I'd like, this may be a misunderstanding on my part because I've seen videos of people tuning (for example) their toe out to 1. (Maybe an update took this out?) I can only do increments of 5 or 10 with the same vehicle. If there's a way to choose any number, please let me know.			"

												From the outset I would just like to say I do own Project Cars and have at the time of writing 630+ hours but only 16 hours of Assetto Corsa (Just bought it).People say that AC's more accurate physics simulation over pCars features and looks makes it the better purchase but I beleive that some compromise between AC and pCars would make for a more rounded and enjoyable simulation-bPhysicsIMO the physics of Assetto Corsa tend to lean quite heavily on understeer (much like Grand Turismo) and pCars on oversteer. It feels as though every car wants to understeer... but the result of this is that Assetto Corsa rewards you more for precise and smooth driving whereas pCars you can generally chuck the car around and achieve ridiculous lap-times.In terms of braking I managed to get the settings at a somewhat decent level but the fact that you cannot adjust brake pressure (or disk size) is quite debilitating. The braking quite often feels... mushy-mushy-mushy-FULL LOCK and so you are severly punished for not using ABS (which at factory level is simulated quite well). pCars on the other hand better handles progressive braking however it's too rare that you lock your wheels (which is unrealistic). Assetto Corsa though does a better job at simulating the impact of flat-spotting your tires.The default setup on AC seems to be heavily biased towards the front brakes and so you will almost always lock the fronts rather than the rears. But I immediately noticed in AC I felt way more comfortable trail-braking than in pCars.In pCars I felt I had a better idea of what needed to be changed in the setup in order to drive faster or smoother whereas with AC you can't really see or feel the difference in two setups you can only judge them by laptimes. AC doesn't quite have the level of detail when it comes to tuning your cars and the impact seems less emphasised.FFBThis has been constantly praised as far better than pCars but it is hard to describe why because it is based on feeling. As with pCars the default FFB isn't great and so it will take a short while to get it to feel how you want but AC has a great custom app that will adjust the FFB strength on a per car basis on the fly. AC also has the advantage that you can creat a .lut curve to adjust the linearity of your wheels motor. pCars however has a greater range of options for FFB which can be a blessing and a curse. When I first started playing AC I couldn't shake the idea that something was missing in the feel through FFB and it took me a while but I realised it was the body of the car. pCars feels as though you have the road-->tires-->springs/suspension-->steering wheel whereas AC seems to skip the springs part. The result is you feel a disconnect between you and the car and the game ends up feeling clinical. You also don't visually see any roll in the body of the car (more later).UndersteerIn terms of understeer you can add the enhanced understeer option which is a great indicator through the FFB but I feel that it hampers your ability to try and correct and at times the understeer feels like your set in it. You can turn that feature off though and understeer is pretty much the same as pCars. OversteerOversteer on the other hand is completely different. with pCars you can sometimes feel locked into a spin and correcting it is almost impossible whereas AC the oversteer is more progressive and you can feel the different stages of slip and you can correct it far easier and it feels more intuitive getting the car back straightened out.BrakingAC does a better job of brake rumble and you can feel more accurately when the wheels are locking up and so you can adjust your braking. In comparison pCars you only know when you've locked up your wheels when you try to steer and nothing happens (except in an open-wheeler where you can tell by looking .)AccelerationThis might come up again later but I feel as though pCars gives you a better sense through FFB of acceleration effects so even if you weren't looking you could better tell whether you are going quickly or slowly.Track SurfaceIMO the differences aren't that significant but I do feel that pCars has overdone the bumps a little whereas AC is a little more subtle and realistic but then again pCars the feel of the bumps differs based on springs and dampers whereas I haven't yet detected that in AC.VisualsThis one should be quite quick, it is more of a subjective category but I do feel pCars looks so much better and specifically more involving.In terms of the track pCars has AC licked it feels better seeing the trees and waving flags but a pretty track does not a good sim make.The cars in AC from the inside feel fake and a bit two dimensional, they have nothing on pCars and look only slightly better than something Codemasters would do which is a little disappointing because they have Ferrari and Lamborghini. The result of this is you start to feel detached (a word that keeps coming) from the game and more like a casual observer rather than feeling as though you are in the car. [I will say that I do not have VR and that is probably going to render the previous sentence moot]The outside of the  car is really no better, they look arcade-y and again it's not such a big deal but with cool brands in the game it is a little bit of a let down.One thing I find quite important is the camera shake and movement (especially look to apex) I think this is something AC definitely needs to work on as pCars gets it right and AC is too sterile resulting in you not feeling the speed of the car you are driving. In pCars you get a sense of rush and anticipation when trying to spot the braking zone because everything is speeding past you so quickly. In AC you can only really get an idea of your speed by looking at the speedometer.ContentCarsThis one is a little more tough. pCars has many more tracks and Cars by default and so the range is a little more extensive and I imagine when pCars2 comes out this divide will only grow larger. However, AC has those exclusive cars like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Fiat and Alfa Romeo (which Jeremy Clarkson says is the ultimate Petrol head's car maker.) and most importantly I think Lotus road cars.AC tends to lean more on road cars (like Grand Turismo) but I think pCars has a better more vast selection of Race Class Vehicles.TrackspCars has more tracks for sure and has more of the race tracks we all know quite well but I don't think it has more or less variety than AC in terms of the type of tracks. AC does however have a nice drift playground.The most important thing in terms of content though is that AC is far easier to mod and so there is a literal boatload of Cars and Tracks you can download. Again this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt as the quality of the mods are not all that great where as if you get MDMT's modded vehicles for PCars; the quality is absolutely mind-blowing for a mod (but they take a while to make).FeaturesBoth have career modes done differently - AC is more like Grand Turismo the careers are a mix of challenges and races whereas pCars simulates a drivers journey through the ranks with race contracts offered based on performance in your class. I much prefer practice (QRW) on pCars as you can drive a setup and pop into the pits with your tires still warm and grab a bit more fuel and that creates more motivation for longevity during practice mode. AC has a quite disappointing pit system.ConclusionI recommend both this and pCars the choice is up to you, do you need to own both? No. Should you buy both? I say yes.Overall my impression is that AC is more accurate but far less involving and exciting. AC can feel a bit bland in regards to content and overall feel. Buy AC to hone your racing skills but buy pCars to have fun.			"

												I was a GTR, GTR2, GTR 2 Power and Glory mod, rFactor, rFactor 2 kind of guy. After watching the alpha previews of Assetto Corsa back in the day, I was skeptical about the sim. I had my rFactor 2 pride and was proud to be on rF2. After a considerable number of months later, I picked up Assetto Corsa... I kind of got tired of the slow development of rF2 and wanted to try something different. It took many hours of fine tuning my FFB and learning the good mods from the bad mods. The cars at first seemed so much easier to master than in rF2. After many updates later, Assetto Corsa improved the physics, optimized the graphics, and continued to develop new and different class cars; all of which has enhanced my experience with the sim.Assetto Corsa is my go to racing sim. The sound can always use some improvement, but overall, the total experience is very pleasing. Furthermore, the modding community is HUGE, and there is always something new to try or fall in love with. Back in the day, the Lambo Miura was a fantastic mod, and then it became a part of the official car list.  The mods such as  the Mazda 787B continues to impress me, the Virtua Simulazoni cars, the IER cars, the Rally Legend Cars, and all the fantastic tracks make this sim almost priceless.I have uninstalled all other racing games and now focus solely on Assetto Corsa. If I am not racing, then I am most likely cruising on Lake Louise or Nordschleife in the Miura, Countach, GT40, Shelby Cobra, RUF Yellowbird, and when I want to speed around Tokyo city on the c1 Shuto Expressway I drive the JDM pack cars. There is a little bit of heaven for everyone in Assetto Corsa, just my review...			"

Early Access Review
								Although this simulator is still only in its Beta stage (0.6.2 at the time of writing), the body of work that this small Italian game developer, Kunos Simulazioni, has managed to produce is truly breath taking, especially when you consider just how small they are. I'm talking 10 people: small, and with heaps more mouth watering content on the way with bi-weekly updates in the lead up to the full release of v1.0, Assetto Corsa has the potential to become the best racing simulator ever produced. Physics:Kunos have spent countless hours on developing and refining the physics engine to produce the most realistic driving experience that money can buy. Using sensors on various places on real world cars, they can accurately replicate the technical sides of the car. They're also receiving feedback from real professional racing drivers as to how particular cars handle on certain tracks. Which leads me on to tracks. Kunos are using laser scanning technology, so every bump, camber and curb will be near enough identical to their real world counterparts. There are the odd glitch or two with sticky curbs and such, but this is to be expected with this being still a relatively early build, and will thus be ironed out. ... Oh yeah, did I mention that they're releasing a laserscanned version of the Nordschliefe in September? Because they're doing that... Yeah. Anyone who knows anything about motorsport or sim racing should know how big of a deal this is, because it's never been done before by any gaming company... Ever. Graphics:The visuals are pretty decent. There are some situations where it doesn't look that great; with jagged edges and a few poorly textured surfaces, and other times where the game looks absolutely stunning. The game gives great ""bang for your buck"", in that you don't need a $100,000 super computer to play it, and still have a great looking game (**Cough**Project CARS **Cough**).  In fact even when some of the settings are set to ""low"", it still looks good.  For example, the cube map resolution takes a massive chunk of performance if you have it set to ""high"", but on ""medium"" or ""low"" it still looks brilliant and you get a huge boost in FPS. Audio:The sounds, like the graphics are also really good. I'd say they're probably second best behind Race Room: Racing Experience. As with the physics, Kunos have tried to accurately represent how each car sounds with microphones and various other pickups to get each car to sound very distinct. They've also managed to implement backfiring and overrun gurgling, which is a first that I've encountered, and it is joyous. Whether it be the whirring turbo of the KTM X-Bow, or the completely bonkers twin-turbocharged V8 in the Ferrari F40 (which quite frankly is just a scary car to drive), this is some of the best sounding cars I've ever heard in a video game. Although the BMW Z4 GT3 isn't quite right, as it's slightly too high pitched and needs a deeper gargling growl that the BMW cars tend to have. Final Take: Physics: 9/10 Graphics: 7.5/10Audio: 8/10 Kunos have created a beast. And when multiplayer drops, watch out iRacing, these boys are coming for you.			"

												My story:I think one of the first things that people ask about this game is do you need a wheel to play it. I can say that no you dont need one to enjoy the game; however, having one brings a whole new level of depth to playing it. I started out playing this game on a keyboard, that's right a keyboard, and there was not a second that i did not enjoy it. Then i switched to a controller and the game got even better. Faster laps, more precision, the game just became a ton of fun.Recently i was privileged to try the game on a wheel and i can thoroughly say that this game is as authentic as it can get as far as the driving experience in a video game is concerned.Edit: I've now put a couple hundred hours in with my own wheel and I think the most memorable moment from that entire time is when I first plugged in my own wheel and ran my car off a curb. I was in awe, it felt like I had actually just driven off a curb. The force Feedback is insanely accurate.Let's talk about graphics:Sure this game doesnt have amazing graphics where your wheel is gonna go in a different direction than the car, but that isnt something that you need to notice because after about 2 minutes in a car you are immersed in how your car handles and how fast you need to take the next corner. Also when you're going by the trees at lets say 250kmh there really isnt time to look at them :P As far as the tracks are concerned they are phenomenal, lazer scanning is such a huge plus and they're going back to update some of the original tracks.DLC:THEY HAVE A PORSCHE PARTNERSHIP, 12 Years away from any serious racing simulators and this company got it. If that doesn't speak for this country i'm not sure what does. Sure it's a little extra but its so worth it, i mean the DLC is priced incredibly well less than $10 per pack that comes loaded with content.. All three of the dream packs are stunning and they give free content along with the update, and i dont really know of any other company that gives anything away for free. This company has just as much passion as many of the people that play the game. They are currently striving to include some of the most iconic vehicles and tracks out there.Mods:There are countless mods for this game and although not all of them are the best there are some REALLY good ones out there that are on par with Kunos' content.Multiplayer: People complain about the AI a lot, but let's be honest if you're racing the AI you shouldnt even buy this game. This game was built for an online experience and with over 800 servers up 24/7 there is always one that you can find with tons of people, or you can find an empty one for you and your friends to race on. It's also very easy to host your own server from your computer, the game comes with the files to make managing what content you want on it so easy. Theres always a server for whatever mood youre in.THERE ARE SERVERS WITH DRIVER RANKINGS SO YOU DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH TROLLSI say that in caps because a lot of people complain about that, but it really isnt an issue. Those people are just butthurt.I 100% recommend this game, it's a whole lot of fun even if you dont have a wheel. A controller at least is a good point to start with. A keyboard is doable but it takes a lot of time and finger cramping. Hope this was helpful :D			"

												First off, the game is amazing. I got this game when it was in early stages, and purchased all the dream packs that there were; I think the total cost for everything at the time was like 60 bucks. Although now you can get the base game with like 20 cars or something like that included with your 30 bucks. Okay, now let me talk about the pros and cons.  Pros:  Amazing Graphics Amazing Cars (Whether You Get The Dream Packs or Not) Supports The Rift and Vive for VR Supports 4k, Multi Monitors, and Gaming Chairs Amazing Simulation Works Great With G27 Force Feed Back Wheel Car Tweeking And of Course Much More for You to Find Out Cons: Very Expensive With all the Dream Packs Not Many Different Seasons and Forms of Precipitation Single Player is Limited but Still Fun And not Much More     Hope fully you thought my review was helpful, definitely hit the thumbs up on the helpful icon...Thanks:)     Also Im open to Friend requests btw...

Posted: September 10, 2015
												I've taken 2 years to finally write a proper review of Assetto Corsa, to try to like it and write a positive review. But I've been let down, so there goes a thumbs-down review.Assetto Corsa came out almost 3 years ago as an Early Access release for a reasonable price taking into account the amount of bugs, lack of content and everything that an uncompleted game brings. The title got a quick nice response from users for its remarkably detailed physics and the absolutely superb work on cars and tracks modelling, being the tracks laser-scanned. Another positive point well welcomed by the community is the full mod compatibility, which extends the possibilities of the game in terms of content and personalisation to amazement. Kunos though are a very small developing team which has worked so hard to release new tracks and circuits, all of them officially licensed by brands, and refined the game architecture to add capabilities, fix bugs and improve and optimize graphics and performance. All this work is released slowly, drop by drop, long time between, but at least they release it.This year though they decided to get the game out of Early Access, and with a nice full-price tag of double the initial price. The game itself works smoothly, quite well optimised (don't trust the minimum GTX460 required, you can run it with a GT540 easily) and with full compatibility with any wheel or pad. Where's the problem then?As said before, the amount of content is alarmingly low. After some years the number of cars and tracks hasn't increased much and the variety isn't quite wide really. You have the full Lotus catalogue and most Ferraris, and then a few other cars like a McLaren MP4/12C and its GT3 version and some other road cars. Don't misunderstand me, having such fleet of Ferraris and some of the fasterst road cars is rather coool. But the problem is that they end up being all the same. All the Lotus cars are similar, Lotus cars are similar to some other featured cars, Ferraris are similar to the other high performance cars... After all, you have an acceptable amount of models, but you can summarise them in a few. There isn't a car that outstands among the others, or different types of cars like go-karts or more motorsport disciplines. In fact, you can differentiate 4 categories: F1 cars, Supersports cars, Sportscars and Abarth. I've driven every single car released and it's like that. Despite that, with the first non-beta release a DLC came out, which adds the Nordschleife and ten cars, which again you can summarise in 4 new real additions. And for a price of 14,99€, right after having paid 49.99€ for a game that seriously lacks content. Unreasonable. The game is limited to hotlapping. AI is just unraceable because it will just stick to the racing line. Make a move and they'll bump into you as if your car wasn't there. Rival cars will never make a mistake nor get corner-cutting penalties, which you get every time you put a single wheel outside the tarmac and that slows you down to 50kph. Practice and Hotlap sessions are fun though, they feel as if you were actually there driving on a client run. The entire circuit for yourself, just you and your car. Actually it's fun, especially using a wheel. It ends up challenging yourself to beat your lap time, but after some laps it gets boring...Although it's been announced as out of Early Access, the game itself proves it is just the same as before. Only fully playable mode is hotlapping and you can only play on dry track and not at night. The fun part of this game is pushing against the clock to beat your lap times, but if you can only race in the same weather and light conditions the challenging aspect of the game is lost as soon as you have lapped a few times every circuit.Online was released in mid Early Access and it was reasonable and justified that it didn't work at all. Later updates made it more stable and raceable, but nowhere near from easy to use. It worked with a ""booking"" system. There's a server list with the race info (players, ping, track and cars allowed). Those which are post/pre-race are open for around 5 minutes for people to join by ""booking"" an entry on the race. There's not even a matchmaking room, you just click the ""booking"" button and wait 5 minutes to play, although most times when the countdown ended the server would just crash and force you to book again. If you manage to enter a race room, it is most of the times empty.Bad part of this is that despite being claimed ""1.0 version, full release"" the multiplayer keeps just the same.Mods are more or less easy to find. There are portals and forums which have the Mods and Download sections and uploaders generally have a decent knowledge on the matter, so their work is usually nice although don't expect to find everything you're looking for because most of the mods get banned for copyright and licensing. The game though isn't very respectful with mods. After an update you may find that none of the mods you downloaded are compatible, and as they're mods they don't auto-update. Annoying stuff if you have a large collection of mods.In the technical aspect, Assetto Corsa is close to brilliant. It may not have rainy weather, or night racing, or a proper damage system, or headlights that actually work or breathtaking graphics effects, but the attention to physics has no rival. Aero effects, weight balance, force feedback... Absolutely amazing. If we take a look at updates changelogs, most of the updates have to do with these things. Handling then will be completely realistic, tricky as it should be.It is not at all playable with gamepad though, but this game is a simulator so it's rather ""dumb"" to play with anything different from a wheel, which works perfectly once set up. The base is solid and really promising, but the lack of content is a fact to consider. Not only that, the gameplay is limited and lacks basic functions. I don't want to compare this game with another one because it's not fair and every game is different on it's own, but Assetto Corsa isn't the best option for a race simulator right now. I'd say it's better to wait until more content is released, but I've done that for a long time and it's becoming hopeless. It's not fair to double the price of the game when it has almost the same things that you had when it was Early Access. Not to mention the DLC...*PATCH EDIT*2 more DLC...4.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								When I looked at AC, I was unsure if it would be for me. I liked the idea of a racing sim, but I came from the F1 201x, GT5/6 games on the PS3 so was unsure if it would be too technical for my liking....and frankly too hard.Well, I'm so glad I bought it.  I initially got the Technology Preview for buying NetKar Pro for a few quid, but the early access was far more fun than I thought it would be.  The game has constantly been developed by Kunos with regular updates (every 2 weeks) and now multiplayer is out it's made it even better.  I started with a DFGT but purchased the T500RS and TH8 shifter just for AC. It was a good investment in my eyes as it brings the cars to life.  The Lotus 49 around Monza 66 is my favourite, and it's such a beast to handle - but great fun in trying!Handling - This blows any console game out of the water. I bought Race 07 and that doesn't come close to AC.  I haven't been able to try pCars.  The FFB is superb, and I can only hope they continue to improve this. If you have cold tires with a heavy fuel load, you really notice the difference in turn 1 compared to low fuel warm tire runs.Sound - This could be better.....and will be!  AC recently mentioned they will use a new audio method for a better experience.  It's still pretty good as it is, I can't complain as I still think it's good.Cars - Whilst there are a lot less cars to other games out there, it takes so much time to get really good with the cars I just don't care. There are some car's I've hardly driven as other cars get me hooked.Tracks - The bumps in the tracks are something else. You play F1 and it feels like you are driving on a perfectly smooth track. You go around the Nurburgring on AC and you have to work for a decent time and learn where some bumps are to avoid (or use for better traction).Multiplayer - There are tonnes of servers up. It's easy to host a private lobby but you do need to be comfortable playing with config files as there is no GUI yet in the game.  Most tracks allow 20 cars.  Lag isn't too bad either, I regularly play against someone in New Zealand when our server is in the UK. It's not perfect, but it's raceable and far better than other games I've played online.  On the down side the options are pretty limited as MP is in the Alpha phase.What else is in the game:AI RacesTime Challenge (where you have to reach a checkpoint within a time period)HotlapDrag Race (AI only atm)Race WeekendsSpecial EventsDrifting (I've not done this as I'm turd at it)Mods - There are loads of mods out there already. Hotlap leaderboards, car skins, tyres wear/temp mods, nicer GUI's, and tracks!  Whilst they aren't as good as the offical tracks, it makes the future very bright for AC.  Like any MP game, it's better if you have a good community to race with.  I do @ www.acracers.com.Frankly, this is my favourite game period. I enjoy other genres, but this game keeps me coming back for more.			"

  Category Score Notes   Visuals 9 One of the prettiest racing games out there, Assetto Corsa can look nearly lifelike with the right post-processing settings. At dawn or dusk, the amount of detail is nothing short of stunning and the available photo mode makes it easy to capture wallpaper-worthy screenshots. Shortcomings include a lack of weather system and the relatively bare scenery at some tracks.   Sound 7 The quality of the sound varies from car to car. Some delight your ears with crackles and pops and whines while others leave you feeling disappointed, though one has to remember not every car sounds exciting in real life. Developers have stated they are still working on improving sound assetts and the sound engine.   Physics 9 Few racing games can match Assetto Corsa when it comes to physics. Suspension, tires, track surface, and more are all accurately modeled to offer the most realistic driving experience possible, short of the real thing. Naturally, this does mean you'll want to play with a wheel to enjoy the full experience.   Force Feedback 8 Force feedback is always going to be subject to opinion as not everyone agrees on what it should be doing. Assetto Corsa's version does a good job of communicating weight transfer but can fall short when it comes to fine detail. Overall, it's easy to know what the car is doing and anyone who spends a few minutes configuring their settings should have a good time.   Cars 10 Assetto Corsa features 69 cars at the time of this review, with more being added regularly. LaFerrari with a functioning KERS system, working active aerodynamics on the Pagani Huyara, and even McLaren P1 software updates that affect rear wing behavior are just a few examples of the painstaking amount of effort Kunos Simulazioni has put into the details of every car in this game.   Tracks 9 17 tracks are currently featured in the game, all of which are recreated down to the smallest bumps, cracks, and camber changes thanks to laser-scanning technology, including the famed Nürburgring Nordschleife. The total selection is relatively low but that's the price you pay for quality - quality that makes the driving come alive when combined with the excellent physics.   Multiplayer 7 The multiplayer can suffer from trolls and bad drivers like every other simracing title that supports open races. That being said, the netcode is solid and the multiplayer experience can be excellent if you choose to join an organized league. Unless you're willing to shell out lots of money for iRacing, Assetto Corsa is almost as competitive as it gets in this category, though it's a shame the community gets fragmented with each new DLC.   AI 3 The AI in Assetto Corsa can best be described as ""serviceable."" It's there and it can drive pretty fast if you let it, but it combines a tendency to carelessly crash into the player with (oddly) over-caution. It's quite easy to block them while ahead but if you get them off the racing line, they almost always do everything in their power to return to it regardless of the consequences.   Career 3 It's difficult to enjoy the career with the AI in its current state. It can feel quite repetitive without giving you any sense of accomplishment. A handful of races are impossible to win even with world record lap times and others are quite easy to dominate despite being on the same difficulty setting. Some series also advertise ""race weekends"" without actually offering them.   Mods 9 Assetto Corsa is currently the hotbed for simracing mods. If the game doesn't already feature a car or track you want, it's probably on a website somewhere or soon will be. You can mod everything from the cars, tracks, and sounds to the menu, HUD, and career. The downside is that the developers will sometimes update the game in a way that break mods until they too are updated.   Overall 8.5 If you're looking for a hotlap simulator or a platform for league racing, then Assetto Corsa is second to none (or at least it will be when it gets a proper spectator/replay system). Casual pickup multiplayer racing is still entirely worth the money, but you'll probably want to skip the purchase if offline AI racing is the main thing you're interested in.  "

								This game saved me a fortune - for just £29.99, I now know I can't drive that Lotus Evora S I've always wanted. While I limit myself to a Mondeo, anyone else who wants a racing sim will be impressed with the current build state.You can also import your own tracks and cars, and tweak literally everything. It looks and drives great, but needs a Golliath of a PC to run this at the highest physics and graphics detail - as you would expect for a game built to use all that extra PC power available to it over a console.

												Kunos Simulazioni came under a lot of criticism from most sim racers for their previous title NetKar Pro, but they have learned from that experience as Assetto Corsa is an outstanding racing simulation. The early release of Assetto Corsa has satiated the long awaited sim racing community, as the beta and bi-weekly updates kept everyone satisfied. Sim racing fans will argue about who has the best tyre modelling, most accurate tracks, physics and visuals, but Assetto Corsa has managed to take all that and package it up in one great racing sim, with a top-notch physics and sublime tyre modelling, spending time with each car you will appreciate the nuances of the physics each vehicle has to offer. The visuals speak for themselves, crisp, clean and easy on the eye. The tracks are accurately modelled and replicated from laser scan data. The force feedback, even after logging on a solid amount of hours, is appreciable with subtle feeling still surprising me.On top of the regular developer created content, Assetto Corsa already has lively modding scene, making third party tracks and cars, so the future is really bright for this sim and I don't doubt most will still be playing this in years to come.With a great core, Kunos Simulazioni has proven that they have built Assetto Corsa into a successful racing simulator.

												All things come to him who waits. I have this game since it's early access version, 0.4 or so, and always liked AC's physics, because of it's balance. Anybody can drive a car, even the most powerful one, but going on the edge, barely under control, that's something few can master. This is where Assetto Corsa shines. If I had to point out one thing, why you should definitely try it - that would be the pure driving experience. Take a car of your preference, cruise it, push it, race it. You will have fun either way. Furthermore, each update and DLC proves, that Kunos Simulazioni is a very consistent group of people, who are passionate about cars and aim to make Assetto Corsa the best car game in the world. It may sound crazy, yet the sanity of the plan is of no consequence, because they really can do it.			"

								At first glance it's just another racing sim. At the first drive I was cursing I had just done my money on another poorly built sim. I jumped on the Steam forums to voice my displeasure and discovered the ""problem"" was entirely mine. I needed to set it up properly. So I researched, dug around and found all I needed.Some tweaking and testing, fiffling and faffing..... And WOW!!! My first lap in a BMW M3 GT2 at Monza had me in awe. My second lap had me raptures. By my 3rd lap I asked for Assetto Corsa to marry me.I'm fussy. I'm picky. I hate lazy coders and slackware and this, THIS, at alpha (really??) has the potential for AAA from a small team. Plenty to do and lots of cars and tracks already. No issues, fast GFX, absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing amazing physics and awesome sound (inside cockpit GT2 - eargasms!!!!)Goes amazing with FFB on a G27 - as yet I'm voicing opinion as I am waiting for my G27 to arrive. Yep. It made me spend more money - within minutes of playing it. And there's a reason for that.It's a must if you like fast. MUST. No if's, no buts.MUST. Get it. You. Yes......			"

Nikki Lauda's Ferrari 312, Sennas' Lotus 98T? Doesn't impress you still? Ferrari 458 italia on Imola trying to beat Stig's time (yes, theres an achievement for it). How about ""THE PHYSICS ARE GREAT"" then? Forget your arcades like Gran Turismo, Forza, NFS Shifts and GTR evolutions, this is a simulation, and it's a great one at that. If you own a wheel and a PC it's either this or Project Cars... why not both?			"

												* Written a week after the 1.5 update.Assetto Corsa is, to me, the shell of a perfect racing game, and with more time and money I can see it being a truly incredible product.The physics, handling, track quality and as such, general racing immersion of AC is a level above other racing titles like Forza, Gran Turismo, or Project Cars. RFactor may offer better physics, I haven't tried it.AC may be behind some of the above on graphics and AI, and is definitely behind Forza and GT on car and track selection, and the depth of the career mode.So you have to figure out what you want in a game, due you want fidelity to real life, with accurate simulation of each car, precise aerodynamic and drivetrain calculations and laser scanned tracks, or do you want to be able to drift around corners without sacrificing lap times? Do you want a false sensation of speed, or an accurate introduction to cornering and car weight distribution? Do you want top level AI and reward intensive career progression, or are you happy endlessly lapping empty tracks, looking for slight improvements in your cornering technique.I much prefer the later, but I don't mean to disparage those who enjoy the former. I've spent my last 30hrs in game lapping one track (Zandvoort in the Netherlands), with one car (the McLaren 650S GT3) and the experience has been hugely enjoyable as I try to approach race car driver speeds (which I'm sure I'm far off, currently only the 5th fastest on RSR for that combination). The feel of laser scanned track through the force feedback is incredible, the handling dynamics superb and the complexity and precision of high-speed racing is endlessly fascinating to me.If you want to genuinely feel the sensation of racing a well modelled 458, or a McLaren P1, or a GT3 or F1 car through Spa, or the Nurnburgring, this is a near perfect way to do it (short of somehow renting one!)If you're a fan of driving, buy AC and invest in developing technique. If you're a fan of arcade style multiplayer, or the quick fun of frantic drifting buy something else.Highly recommended, from someone looking forward to the new car releases in May and June. If they can add some American and Japanese tracks, expand the list of road cars, continue to tinker with the AI, and maybe, eventually, develop a solid career mode, then this will be a perfect racing game.

												At first glance Assetto Corsa's approach to the racing genre may not appear unique or even new, but once you delve in, racing wheel in hand, it's evident that the developers have focused on translating the sense of driving to a level that may just redefine the racing genre. But will Assettos Corsa’s approach place it among the greatest racing titles ever, or will it be a forgotten name in years to come?

												I have to leave a review for this game. At first I was so frustrated about how tough it is to drive the cars so I decided to get a refund. For about a day, I did a lot of research to see if there is any other racing games out there worth considering, I ended up considering to buy Project cars or to re-buy assetto corsa. After watching a lot of reviews on YouTube comparing these two games I decided to re-buy assetto corsa, due to the positive reviews, and I absolutely don't regret that now. Yes, it takes patience and yes it requires practice but it's worth it all! After take the Pagani Zonda for a spin on the Spa, I finally understood what the experts are talking about when they speak about treating the car with tough love and drive it like you hate it, cause if you don't, the car will ""bite"" and you find yourself of the track within seconds All in all, a very great game, that's absolutely worth recommending!

												Played over 1,700 hours and still not bored.Assetto is all about the thrill of driving. The force feedback together with the sublime physics engine make driving a pleasure. Every car feels unique and has a charm and character of its own.In terms of features there are elements that other titles in the genre have that Assetto does not. What you quickly realise is that when the driving feels this good that everything else is just a bonus. "

								As someone who has spent a decent amount of time on a real race track, I'd say this game is fairly realistic and L337. Great car physics - significantly better than Forza or Gran Turismo. Needs a wheel to be properly enjoyed.9.9/10. Why 9.9? Needs the Porsche license (which I believe is currently being wasted on Need for Speed, or some other garbage-y garbage).			"

Early Access Review
								Where do I start? I looked into this game after a few Google searches on what games I should play once I get hold of my Logitech G25 again and after a few YouTube videos, I decided to go ahead and buy it even though I didn't have my G25 wheel back from my buddy yet. I took a ""risk"" and ended up buying the game for its full price and played a few laps with a Xbox 360 controller. It didn't seem anything special, the tire/handling physics definitely did stand out but I didn't want to judge this game from my experience with a 360 controller so I waited.Finally I got hold of my G25 and set it all up in order to try this game, and WOW, I have tried many driving simulators on PC, PS3, Xbox360 and all with Force Feedback wheels but I have not come across a game as Realistic as Assetto Corsa. After a few practice laps, I made sure my rotation was set to 900 degrees with 100% Force Feedback strength and fully manual setup with no traction control, just 100% Stability (as I was testing the Zonda R).I still cannot get over how good it feels, everything is so realistic, the graphics are way above average when compared with other driving simulators and I'm sure it will only get better as this game is still in Early Access 0.4. I have not yet played a driving simulator that can provide me with the most ACCURATE yet CHALLENGING Force Feedback, which is very rewarding when done right. Force Feedback has never been better on a game in my opinion.From the Early Access 0.4 version, this game is definitely one of the best investments I have made in Driving Simulators. I feel like even with early access, it was worth every penny of my money (which I haven't recently felt even with other games, not just driving simulators) and it will only get better once AI is released, once Career mode is released, and once Multiplayer is released. The Assetto Corsa Development team is heading in the right direction with this game so my expectations are very high and I'm sure myself, and other consumers will not be disappointed. I'm personally most excited for Multiplayer and I can see myself spending countless hours in Drag, Drift and Track modes competing with other enthusiasts.Should you buy this game? YES! But make sure you have a good Force Feedback wheel to go with it, preferably with full pedals, a H shifter etc.Last but not least, I have also recently invested in 3D gaming, and this game was easily the best looking 3D game I have played on my 40"" Samsung (with Nvidia 3DTV Play Software), once all the depth and convergence settings were done right for each camera view, but that's pretty much something you have to do for all 3D games so I wouldn't even consider it a con.Go and buy this game!

												I´ve waited a long time with my review, because I wanted to see what kinds of addition this game gets over time. But well, here it is:Assetto Corsa is a very challenging and rewarding game. It is one of the few titles that truly deserve to be called a ""Racing Simulation"" in a genre where many games proudly boast the moniker, and then severely disappoints in that regard.Pros:- A true Racing Simulation on PC, one of the very few titles to come out in recent years- Good production value, you can really see that the devs know what they´re doing- Extremely good physics engine- Good graphics- Relatively fast AI- It´s stupidly easy to use mods- there are tons of high-quality mods of cars, tracks and UI apps readily availableCons:- 80% of the included tracks are Italian- 40% of the included cars are Lotus (seriously, there are 7 variations of the Lotus Evora and 5-6 for the Exige... Who the hell thought this was a good idea?)- Some other cars are sorely missed instead (No R34, Lancer Evo, RX-7, Challenger, Charger, C63 AMG, SLR, and no Audi´s,  Porsche´s, Toyota´s, Ford´s, e..., at all!)- AI is extremely taxing on the CPU (I have a 4 GHz AMD Octacore, and yet CPU occupancy goes above 95% when I race more than 10 cars, causing the game to stutter on my system)- AI is incapable of actually fighting for positions (they may drive quickly, but once you have caught them, you´ll easily overtake, and they will never undertake even the slightest try to get the position back)- The flag, pit stop, weather, day-night mechanics are NOT available yet. This means no chance for real competitive gameplay yet.Total: 7.5/10. Don´t get me wrong: It still is one of the best racers I have ever played! But i have to admit, I most likely only love it so much because it has no competition. There are a bunch of things that are wrong with this game, that need to be critizised.But when you´re hunting your ghost on the Nordschleife, piloting a (Mod) Mazda 787B on a cold track... you´ll forget about all of the flaws. You won´t notice any flaws, and even if you did: You wouldn´t care.In these moments, the game deserves a straight 10/10, and it will be worth the asking price all of a sudden.recommendation: Hell yes. If you are into non-arcade racing and have a capable rig - you have no excuse to not buy this.			"

												Assetto Corsa makes Grand Turismo feel as if it is purely arcade compared to it. This game is extremely sophisticated with a myriad of optimization options, and Profesional mode in this game is how it should be played! This is the most advanced racing simulator I have ever seen and it seems as if the developers are just getting started! Anyone who is a racing sim fan will love this game but I warn those semi arcadish fans because this game is not for the weak hearted. Be prepared to spend hours upon hours attempting the races if you play it on professional mode because that is what will happen!  "

												So finally this game came out of early access and is finished and there can't be any excuses anymore. The game didn't changed much. Kunos simulazioni are still really bad at communicating and are very arrogant banning you if you criticize the game or ask something. I'm not talking about childish comments like ""your game sucks"".The game has a big potential. The physics are good. It has great force feedback. You feel the car, you feel almost everything through the wheel, the driving feel is really good.Developers keep adding new cars and the game gets better and better in this department, but still i want to see subaru, nissan, ford, audi, peugeut, opel and many more. It‘s a racing game so we need more cars. Of course i don‘t want fake 1000+ cars like in GT series, where you get the same 50 cars in different colors which counts as different cars. But i think ~100 different cars is a must and it's going the right way. Yes there're mods, but i want professionally created cars/tracks, not by some amateurs. There's no auto updates for the mods, so if you have like 50 of them you must update them manually every time. And some mods for this game cost money. I don't approve such behavior and will not support it.The track selection is not very good at the moment. Still there‘s no famous nurgburgring, but it is annouced as DLC. It‘s not like i‘m against DLC, but i think such track must be included in the game from the start. Especially seeing how good the game sells they should have the budget now. I think Kunos did not expect such luck. It would be cool to have some fictional tracks as well.AI. It's bad. AI is not aware of you, they just trying to drive trough you. So racing against AI is not very fun. At least they've sorted the difficulty so it's possible to beat AI now even if you make mistakes.Penalty system is absurd. It punishes you every time you go out of track, no matter if you cut the track or slide off the track. Where's the logic behind this? I'm already punished myself by going off the track and lost time and stupid system makes me go on 50kmh for 5 seconds and lose more time.There‘re challenges too, but they‘re so hard that there‘s no fun playing them, it feels more like a hard work than playing a game so all the challenges are pointless. The best times should be achievable to all players (after some practice of course), even for those which are playing with keyboard/mouse or with a controller, not only for aliens. Online leaderboards should be the place where aliens rule. Oh and forget the game if you're playing with a controller. This game must be played with wheel only. If you're looking for something similar to forza or GT, know that this game is nothing like this.Multiplayer. It's a joke. MP is boring and pointless. There's no leaderboards or player profiles, no statistics. Most of the time there're too little servers, you just can't find a game. You can join the league, but it's not fun for a casual player to compete with pros.After releasing the full game only tools for kicking people were added. Of course now every mod can ban/kick whoever he wants or dislikes without any reason.Community is one of the worst. AC fanboys are the worst, you can't say anything bad about AC or criticize it. The game is perfect for them.What year is it? Almost 2015! And there's still no night racing and no weather conditions. Even GT5 has this and it's some old game made for an old console.Graphics. The cars looks really great, but everything else is just bad. Like from 2006 but enhanced with hdr and bloom.No leaderboards. It is really fun in raceroom experience to see the times from all over the world, find your country and try to beat the time.There are few game modes. Career which consists of races and time attacks, It will take some time for you to complete it and you'll try the cars.Time attack. It's some broken game mode which makes you go slower. The slower you go in the first couple of laps the more points you get.Drift and drag racing which i'm not interested in so i can't say anything about them.Another small annoying things:When in photo mode you can't hide the racing line. Mouse pointer do not disappear while playing. Can't pause the game and check apps.Racing line is completely broken.You can have some fun in career mode and in MP with friends, but besides that i can't see how this game could be fun for a non hardcore sim fan. I'm still trying to like this game. It has some really attractive things and hope Kunos will improve the experience for non hardcore sim fans.Pros:Great physicsGood graphicsGood performanceSetup sharingCons:]Lack of tracksLack of carsNo workshop supportNo leaderboardsShallow career modeChallenges are impossible for a normal human			"

								This game has an amazing atmosphere about it to begin with. I find it hard to play it in less than 4-5 hour stints. I just can't help myself. Odds are, you're checking out this game because you like cars. LOOK NO FURTHER! With everything from the physics engine, to the graphics that look frighteningly realistic, this Racing Sim has it all. Beautiful layouts of tracks, cars, intuitive UI for modding the cars' geometry with various suspension setups; that help to not only enhance your Sim experience but to teach about the way cars work in general. I have only played for <100 hours but thats because I thought I could make Raceroom Racing Experience a little bit more like this game.ITS NOT POSSIBLE! I'VE TRIED! The attention to detail really enhances one's experience. I haven't had a single dull second in this sim. In summation, you should stop reading this and buy the game already!			"

And with a community of moders and the ability to add cars over time, I'm sure this game's garage will develop into something truly comparible. I understand this is PC vs Console but who cares. Graphics aren't as important as the feel of being connected with the car and the speed you're actually going. AC translates the feeling of speed in a way I've never felt with GT6. If you have a wheel and love racing games, get this game, period.			"

												Assetto Corsa under $60 for everything (Not on sale)iRacing over $1000 for everything plus a monthly subscription of $7-$12....Amazing tracks (Lazer scanned)Amazing cars (Scanned and modeled)Amazing FFB (You can really push the limits of the car and yourself)Free cars and tracks now??? ok!Loads of mods avaliable created by the communityNot so good multiplayer (To have a descent online race you must join a league or use SRS)AI Were awful but have improved a bitSF-15T's ERS too basic.Not much else I can say about the negatives other than this sim really needs some kind of multiplayer scoring system with dedicated servers and races, maybe this isn't the sim for it but it certainly would flourish if it had that kind of capability. Just look at iRacing, mediocre FFB, mediocre graphics, insanely expensive and they're doing well because they are soley based on a multiplayer system.In conclusionOne of the best racing simulators out to date right now it just lacks multiplayer capabilitiesEdit: This is not a arcade or even a simcade like PCars. A wheel is a must, playing with a controller or keyboard just doesn't cut it. Please don't buy it then leave a negative review saying it was too difficult, its a sim.			"

												Assetto Corsa has a lot of potential but fell short in some ways. However, at it's current stage, AC is indeed a great racing game for racing fans.First of all, the driving physics is great with excellent suspension and weight transfer physics where the cars tend to sway and bank in corners realistically like what I expected it to behave. The tire physics is also pretty decent with some good amount of simulation in it's tire model, despite it feels a bit too predictable to me. The game's drifting physics is great though as it feels fantastic to throw a car at a corner drifitng in this game. In my honest opinion, the suspension and weight transfer physics in AC blow other racing games out of the water but the tire model fell a bit short in comparison to Race Room or pCARS due to its predictability. Even though AC has one of the best driving physics among racing games on Steam, what made the game standout to me is this game also offer accessibility  to players who does not own a wheel. The game plays great on gamepad with more precise controls offered than other racing games. However, a wheel is still a must for games like AC as AC is known for its amazing force feedback that made having a wheel the optimal way to enjoy this racing game. Still, if you only have a gamepad, the game is perfectly enjoyable to play on gamepad considering the game offers a reasonable amount of assists such as stability slider(0-100%), auto gear change, ABS and traction control. More importantly, I personally find AC's driving physics to be fun to drive with good amount of depth with each car feels decently unique to drive around a track. Isnt it what racing games supposed to be? Racing games should be all about racing on different tracks while driving different cars that handles differently, instead of pointless grinding for upgrades and cars.In terms of content, AC offers a variety of licensed manufacturers from Ferrari, BMW, Mercedes Benz, KTM, Ruf, Lotus(both classic and modern), Fiat, Mclaren, Pagani and Shelby that ranges from humble Fiat 500 to Nikki Lauda's Ferrari 312. At the same time, AC also features super cars Ferrari 458, coupe such as BMW Z4, FIA GT3s like Mercedes Benz SLS GT3 or lastly, fire breathing monsters such as Pagani Zonda R or Ferrari 599XX. There is definitely something for everyone and if thats not enough for you, you could always head to sites like racedepartment.com to download additional cars made by the community where you can get Japan's only Le Mans winner, Mazda 787B, single cup racing cars such as Ginetta G50 GT4 or even the pretigious German DTM cars. The car list can be a bit too Euro centric to some people but the developers had also announced more manufacturers are coming to AC in the future, for example, Audi, Lamborghini, Toyota, Nissan and Corvette. On the other hand, AC's track list is pretty lean to some as they only feature 10 locations that are all based in Europe at the moment that includes Imola, Monza, Silverstone and Spa as examples. AC's tracks are all laser scanned where you can feel every bump and crest when you drive on it's official tracks which does add a lot to the authenticity of the game. In my opinion, AC is still lack of popular tracks such as Brands Hatch, Laguna Seca, Le Mans Circuit and so on. Still, you could always find community made tracks to further enhance the game's track list. Do note that AC's mod community quality varies wildly so you will definitely need time filter through mods to find gems in the modding community. At the same time, Kunos has intentions to support the game for the next 5 years so do expect the game to have quite a few DLCs. So far, the first official post release content pack seemed to be a decent expansion pack where it comes with the 20km long laser scanned track, often nicknamed as Green Hell with 10 additional brand new cars introduced into the game. At the same time, the developers will also patch in free cars and tracks from time to time such as the recently patched in Ruf CTR2.My main criticism with the game so far is, AC is lacking in terms of features if one compared it to some of it's competitors, rFactor and Project CARS. At the time of writing, there are many features that are common in real life racing series such as night driving, rain weather that will affect your car's grip, AI pitstops and flags penalty. The developer had confirmed that Flags and AI pitstops will be added into the game eventually but rain and night driving will probably not included in the game until it's sequel. Another criticism of mine would be, AC's AI is fairly rudimentary as they are completely unaware of player's presence in the field where they might crash into your back occasionally while they have some tendency to over brake at some parts of a track that made them easy to overtake. Since Early Access, the developers had been patching the AI to perform better but it is still a far cry from what rFactor, Raceroom, Grid Autosports or Project CARS can offer. The multiplayer servers are also barebones with confusing UI and lacking of the robust multiplayer feature that iRacing has. However, the worst part of AC would be it's optimisation where the "">95% CPU Occupancy"" issue that will cause stuttering and poor AI performance still persist till now if you race with more than 20 AI cars. This issue is particularly severe if one plays on community made tracks with less optimisation but one could always opt for less cars on grid to eliminate the issue. There are optimisation being fixed with patches but I sincerely hope this issue will be fixed in the future. Still, optimisation issues are expected in racing games such as AC due to it's more computational intensive simulation in comparison to Grid or NFS while some racing simulators in the market, such as rFactor 2 are said to have CTD issues in some cases.  If you just want a great racing game to race with 15 AI or hotlap solo around a track, these optimisation issues are unlikely to occur. Lastly, the career mode in AC is completely forgettable as it is just a few preset championship events that offers barely anything new from what you can do in the race menu. The career mode also does not offer any progression system that is found in Forza or GT6 where you had to buy and upgrade cars. In conclusion, Assetto Corsa is a decent racing game at its current stage with reasonable amount of content. Just like French cheese that tastes better as time goes by, I have no doubt that AC will improve over time with official DLCs, new features and also mod content from it's healthy mod scene being added into the game. At its current stage I do recommend this game if you are a racing fan looking for a more simulation heavy racing game and do not mind some of its flaws as AC is still a competent racing game at its current stage.I had played more than 70 hours so far and I could see that AC will be on my HDD for some time in the future. It is definitely a great time to be a PC gamer as more and more racing games such as Assetto Corsa, Game Stock Car and Project CARS are developed independently for PC.			"

 It's really sad to see people simply giving negative review for seeing Stefano's (dev) reaction on forum. The incident has passed on, the professional driver Fredrik Sørlie and Stefano has peacefully ended their conversation on Reddit. They aren't fighting anymore. Also, the game is purchased by a different company now. Things will be different. For now, I will leave this comment just so that people will stop getting the wrong idea. I will revisit and rewrite this review once things have settled, but the current situation with this review section is just outrageous.			"

Early Access Review
								If i'm honest I started to get a little worried that this game would fall into the DayZ trap and be in development forever,with games like Project cars on the way I was starting to lose all interest in Assetto Corsa......until the 1.0 update.The game now looks absolutly STUNNING,yes we need more cars and tracks but the game itself satisfies my racing urges and plays fantastic with the Xbox One controller (which i will be upgrading to a new wheel as soon as possible).The cars handle and move much better than any driving sim i have played in the past and I am a huge Forza and Grand Tourismo fan,and this was keeping me on consoles,the fact PC had no good racing sims,now I can say PC has everything I want in a gaming platform.Sorry Forza and GT........Assetto Corsa has risen the bar for a quality racing sim.

												I've had this game for over a year now and I can say it's by far the most fun and realistic simulator I've ever played. The modding community makes great mods if you get bored of the tracks and cars that the game comes with. My only complaint would be that the speed looks nothing like what you're actually going and that the motion blur just looks like you're losing frames, but other than that, there's no other problems.

												Best racing simulator ever. There are few games that genuinely put a smile on your face, but Assetto Corsa is definitely one of them. Pulling out a huge successful slide or racing with sweaty palms for victory, this game delivers that all with tremendous success.The driving physics are as real as they can be, and that for me is top priority in a racing sim. Pulling slides in a 458 makes you feel the same kind of excitement that I would presume Chris Harris feels when he reviews cars (even though he is from another planet when it comes to driving). After over a year of playing it's just getting better and better with more content to come. Awesome mod community with a lot of potential to add even more content makes this a must have racing sim. If you like cars and driving, you'll love Assetto Corsa. Benchmark for all racing games, for years to come. And referring to Mr. Chris Harris: ""This is MEGA!""			"

												This game is addictingly accurate. Even playing with a controller rather than a wheel you get so much feedback that driving the cars feels to natural. That's not to say easy -- some of these cars and the challenges the game gives you to complete with them will kick your♥♥♥♥♥ But the physics make sense. You can improve your setup and driving because you'll know exactly what you did wrong and you'll feel how the setup changes impact your lap.+Great tracks and cars already with more coming and a great modding community.Never been into racing sims, but I can't stop playing this. Long story short -- get this game.			"

								Wow... I have been looking for a game like this for a while. You can play the game two ways: 1. You play it like a simulator sweating your♥♥♥♥♥off. Loads of fun.2. You just kinda chill out and go out for a nice sunday drive, maybe even drift a little. Loads of fun.Any way you like it, you're gonna enjoy it. The game is really well optimized, and it seems to work with nearly any racing wheel. I used a 9-year-old racing wheel, and it worked like a charm! The fact that the game has modding abilities, makes me fall in love with it even more. Wether you want to drift around on Rainbow Road with you BMW M3 or cruise around Paris with your Fiat 500, the mods have got you covered. The realism that Kunos have put into the game, is outstanding. The car sounds, the handling and the looks! The game looks and sounds epic overall. It's astonishing that the game is only in early access, since it sure feels like a complete game. I cannot wait to see how the game turns out on release! Kudos Kunos. Kudos...9.5/10			"

												This game is just amazing. The moment you get on the wheel you know everything feels right. I was impressed by Project Cars, had to buy a steering wheel to play it though, unplayable with gamepad. But Assetto Corsa is ages ahead of any street racing game. The tracks really do feel right, they are laser scanned, the cars feel right, the street feels right and it's totally playable with a gamepad too. The game engine graphics is amazing, you can play with really high grapchics and have a constant of 60 FPS. Congratulations to the dev team of Kunos Simulazioni. 10/10.			"

												What the team @Kunos have done with this is nothing but incredible.I had the chance to follow the development since it's very early stages and seeing this sim grow and evolve into what it has become to date, has been an amazing ride on its own.Let's get a few things straight, right of the bat: Asseto Corsa is NOT a game. This is a HARDCORE DRIVING SIM at its finest. The sooner you understand this, the better. Assetto Corsa is unforgiving, it is frustrating, it is relentless. It will beat you down and eat you every time you make a mistake without mercy. You want to know why? Because that is exactly what happens when you drive a racing car at its limits. You will need to study it, you will need to learn from it. It is a beast that needs to be tamed before you can even dare 'playing' with it. And even then, it will NEVER be your pet. It will always remain as a wild animal, and as such it demands your respect. A fairly decent WHEEL & setup is very much needed, if you wish to enjoy Assetto Corsa the way it was intended to. (You 'can' use your keyboard / joystick to drive but I would consider it blasphemy. Not to mention that you'll never know what you are missing) Setting up your wheel might be confusing and even troubling at first. But the process you need to go through now to get that done is quite simple and easy. You'll just need to read a little. Long story short it basically goes like this: Config wheel drivers. Using the 'LUTgenerator' with the proper .csv file generated by the 'WheelCheck' app is absolutely a MUST. (Google is your friend) Config in-game wheel settings. The most important thing here is getting rid of all the so called 'artificial effects'. Meaning that, ideally,  the only slider you need to leave at 100% is the MAIN FFB. (basically you want the FFB signals to come as RAW as possible from your wheel with nothing extra added, even your 'minimum force' should be at 0, because the LUT takes care of that automatically.) Once everything is setup, you will need the 'FFBClip' app when you hit the road with your favorite car & track. This will help you very easily adjust the FFB on-the-fly for each car & track combo, so your wheel does not clip. (It is important that your wheel does not clip AS LONG AS YOU STAY ON THE ROAD, otherwise it doesn't matter, i.e: when you go through sand/grass terrain in a track it's fine for the wheel to clip, as that is obviously not where you're supposed to go nor staying for too long)That's it. You are now officially free to go to any track with any car and enjoy the ride. (You are welcome.)Now I'll point a few of it's best / worst / missing features:BEST:Laser scanned tracks. As precise as they can get.Real cars with every detail taken into consideration. Coded with real engineering information, data taken directly from each and every manufacturer.Unparalleled level of immersion and realism once setup is rightfully completed.Infinite amount of MODS and love from the community. Cars, tracks, telemetry, liveries, and even complete seasons available for download, you name it, search it, and most likely you will find it.Online works great. The net-code is well optimized and you can play without any issues even with higher pings. (People complaining about the online have absolutely no idea where to get into and find decent people to drive with. They are just entering public servers full of kids crashing each other with keyboards, nonsense. AVOID THAT. YOU NEED TO FIND A LEAGUE, WITH PRIVATE SERVERS and join their community, THERE IS WHERE YOU'LL FIND ALL THE PROs and all the good that racing seriously can be)VR GLORY OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED.Great variety of graphical settings, you can easily play this without any problems with a lower end machine if you set everything to minimum.Performance is GREAT at the higher settings, if you have the right hardware.Last but not least, devs are absolutely great. They have added and fixed almost everything the community asked for. Community feedback played a huge roll in this evolving sim. Not to mention that, their base of operation is actually within one the laser scanned tracks (Vallelunga). So this people are for real, they have direct access to everything, official engineering information, pro drivers opinions... The whole package, literally. Kunos Simulazioni is the real deal.WORST:OVERWHELMING AND UNFRIENDLY FOR NEWCOMERS.The sound engine could be better, although it gets the job done, there is room for improvement, especially with some of the lesser cars. (A good pair of headphones makes this less noticeable)Limited damage models. Damage does occur and cars can be beaten down to the stationary point. It is just that I find it not accurate and have seen far better damage models, even in arcade racing games, sadly.VR SUPPORT for VIVE users arrived late, very late, and you still have to navigate the menus without your headset on. Because menus are not implemented in VR yet. Once on the track though it works wonderfully. FIRST SETUP CAN BE A PAIN IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, even worse, you might even give up this precious gem because of this. I think this could be vastly improved as well.AI is fairly stupid and slow when attacking corners.MISSING: Night time (although there are mods for this)Rain (I love driving in the rain, I think it is the true equalizer in racing. It is what separates good drivers from legends. I would love to see this officially implemented in Assetto Corsa.)VR menus.Overall, I absolutely recommend this amazing SIM to people who love racing and are seriously interested about it. I'm far from a professional driver, but I can hold my own in a real track. Not to brag or anything like that, but I went to driving school when I was just a little kid, and had the chance during my youth to actually drive and train with real racing cars (from karts all the way up to TC2000 here in Argentina, nothing too fancy), so I consider my self experienced enough. Assetto Corsa is second to none, trust me. And I played them all, extensively. (iRacing, rFactor 1, rFactor 2, RBR, Automobilista, you name it...) Even with all its quirks, and everything you have to put in to fully enjoy it... (Mainly hardware money and the time invested setting everything up perfectly). This is for people who do actually understand the physics involved in a true racing scenario and are not afraid to step into the journey of its steep learning curve.The rest of you, wanting a more casual experience, buy Project Cars on PC or go buy Gran Turismo with your PS4. These are far more enjoyable games with a controller/joystick.This ended up being a longer than expected review, but I felt the need to give my honest unbiased opinion after seeing so many ignorant negative reviews recently. I hope this review help you guys in making a more informed decision before buying Assetto Corsa.Cheers from Argentina.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been sim racing for about 6 months now and have tried many sims including iRacing, rFactor and Game Stock Car, as well as many simcade titles as well. I can say without a doubt that Assetto Corsa feels like the best. That's not to say the others are without merit, they have their own strengths and weaknesses. But when it comes to communicating the way the car feels to you through a force feedback wheel, AC is second to none. You can truly feel when your car is riding on the edge of available grip and the car will react accordingly to the inputs you give it. The physics and FFB are something that need to be felt to be believed.The AI needs some work but can be passable, however I feel that online leagues where this game will shine for those looking for strong, clean, competitibe racing. Public lobbies can be ok, however you may find griefers driving the wrong way and trying to wreck others. Ask around forums or check steam groups if you are looking for clean racers.I hesitate to speak too much on controllers as I use a wheel and pedals, but I will say with many aids turned on it's not impossible to keep yourself on track. It may be a fine way to learn the tracks while waiting to purcahse a wheel.I have no doubt Kunos will continue to supply top-notch free and paid content in the coming years which will be finely supplimented by content created by modders. AC will definitely be a hub for great racing from many different fandoms in the motorsports world. I highly recomend it.			"

Each will take you days to master.Cons:Wheel not required, but you can't really enjoy this one on a keyboard. I tried.No global leaderboards? What century is this? (Mod available though)The #1 racing sim in the world. No question.			"

The price it is going for right now which is about €45 is NOT WORTH IT.No nighttimeNurburgring is in a DLC packBarely any car brands to choose from.			"

												This game runs really now on the Vive, courtesy of the latest patch. I have a 1080, so I switched off post processing, ramped up the AA, the detail settings and the super sampling, and it runs very smoothly. The cockpit scale is perhaps a little off, but the overall experience is excellent. Thanks heaps to the Dev's for supporting Open VR and not just hoping Vive owners would rely on reVive.			"

								This is my first review I felt I needed to make on such a great sim. Started playing Assetto Corsa when it was first put on steam. I could not have picked a better simulator. I've played a LOT of racing simulators/games, but this one sticks out the most. With the modding community releasing new cars and tracks every other day. The original cars and tracks in the game are top notch! The handling is awesome. The graphics are beautiful. Overall the atmosphere is pretty sweet. I'm glad 1.0 is here it was definitely worth the wait, and I can't wait for future content I will be supporting the developers for such a great simulator!The only con's is: # 1 The AI they are really buggy, But it does not matter because in a simulator you race against real people for the full effect and it does not bother me one bit!#2 To get the full experience you will need a racing wheel, I have tried it with a controller and it was just a mess, than again it is a Simulator.

								Assetto Corsa is by far one of the most enjoyable racing (simulations) out there. There is already a huge mod community developing content. This game gets the basics dead on: menus, load times, UI, hardware optimization, open platform, etc. It also gets the complex stuff right as well: Game physics, graphics, sound, etc. Physics are the real standout. If you have a racing wheel, you are in for a special experience. Is it perfect? No. Sounds could be better. Graphcis are not going to blow you away. And some nice features like day night cycles and weather are not planned. (keep in mind this is a small team building this game)If you want a fun racing sim with a great mod community that does everything well, then AC is your best bet.			"

I was gonna give a positive review, especially for the effort bringing stunning porsches line-up here. But i have acknowledged by stefano's behaviour towards fredrik sorlie.. i decided to give this title a negative review. Because it is a massive insult and unforgiving bigotic behaviour.

												Assetto Corsa.... One hell of a Racing game! And A Superb Sim! 95/100!Assetto Corsa, A racing game for true enthusiasts and Mild drivers alike. Lets start off with the physics..You have several types of Car game physics ""Arcade/Sim and Simcade"" assetto falls in the category of Sim. It may not have Clutch bite like Rfactor, Or the intense Simulation feel iRacing does, But you get a very close feel of both without costing you a fortune or looking dated. With most sim racers, They either have bad UI, Dated graphics, unsupported games and Awkward to set up Servers..but with AC. None of that, and all the great driving physics you can want! Pros:-It has mods and full mod support.-Still getting updates (Not too old of a game)-Graphics are Nice (Maybe not as visually stunning as PCARS but it has a lot of nice details, And unless you are worried about background details such as trees and houses. it's okay) Some ingame screenshots can look real if done correctly.-Wide Variation of cars (American/Japanese/European) -A Career mode (Some might not be bothered by this, others like a goal in their racing game, always a plus)-Easy to setup and use Server base( Could be better but it isn't hard, especially for a Sim based game) -Wheel support- Multimonitor support-In game apps that allow lots of live data to be shown (tyre temps, fuel, g force, FOV adjuster)-Lazer Scanned tracks The game as a whole is really fun, With both wheel and gamepad, I wouldn't recommend to any keyboard warriors however. The game isn't too demanding but modern ish tech is needed for a decent framerate.(obvs)Now on to the cons:-No clutch bite ( when bringing up the clutch in 1st it should crawl slowly like a real car, however it doesn't do that)-No day/night cycle (no night time)-No Rain The game is superb, if you are after a Good racing game (sim based) Then this is a nice medium, That won't cost you a fortune, has plenty of cars and tracks (lots of mods too, easy to install) And a friendly-ish Comumnity , AC is a good buy! Plenty of drifting,touge,Hillclimb,GT3,BTCC and more! AC>PCARSTl;DR I great Racer for Avid or new sim Racing fans looking for a modern nice looking Racing game. Works nicely on Gamepads and wheels, Needs day/nigh and rain modes. 95/100.I Recommend Assetto Corsa and give it a 95/100. Happy Racing! "

												It's a great way to get a realistic drive experience, you just need a combination of a good FFB Wheel and good settings (matter of taste).

In my Opinion:Pro:+drive experience +laser scanned tracks+car and track mods+many updates+car sounds+many dlc's~graphics (you can use mods)con:-menu (looks boring to me)I never had an issue till now, so i can't say how the support is.

Posted: December 28, 2016
												This game is my first proper racing simulator, my only previous track racer was shift 2 unleashed,and lets be honest,it wasnt that realistic. I consider myself a somewhat casual gamer, especially when it comes to racing games, burnout paradaise, the crew, and iven GTA , i feel at home when playing those.And yet i felt tempted to buy Assetto Corsa, due to the cars like Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche,all in the same game, and my favorite, Mclaren. But mainly because its a simulation, despite the fact im using a controller, and despite i never driven a car in my life, i still wanted to get that actual feel of the car, the thrill, how it moves, how it behaves.I took Mclaren P1 to Brands Hatch, and decided to use 3rd person camera, to hear how the car sounds, and my god it sounds good.From the Top Gear series and some YouTube videos memory, i coud tell it sounds like the real deal.I can feel every bump, apex, and paved over parts of the track, when i lost it, i coud get it back, when i drove off the track, going too quickly into the corner, or going too wide, i coud tell it wasnt due to the game, but me. When i did several laps at Brands Hatch, i was geting faster, taking the corners better, started using the DRS because i ddint iven knew you can use it in the game, and having a blast driving around, and i was doing all that, in 3rd person camera, just to hear the engine of the Mclaren, its amazing, and also the tracks are laser scanned.The game can look beautiful, well from looking at the screenshoots, i have an AMD FX-6350, 8GB of ram and GTX 750 1GB OC,the non TI version, and i can run the game at smooth 60 fps and 1080p, without looking like it came from early 2000s.I did not have enough experience with the AI, as i did only 2 races 2 laps each, with a single opponent, and i used lowest AI difficulty setting 80%.I coud stay in first place, throughout the whole race, the opponent iven overtook me once. The AI was 2 seconds behind when i finnished.When it comes to car selection itself, its very good, its quality over quantity, i dont know how many cars are there exacly, especially with the dlc, i got all Dream packs, japanse pack, trpl3 pack, and Porsche pack 1. But there seem to be plenty enough, there is something here for everyone, from open wheel, to retro rides, coupes, everyday cars, supercars, and GT.You can read on all the cars, about their specs and history, you can also view them in showroom, opening doors, looking inside etc. You can change the colour of the cars, but not sure about the vinyls yet.When it comes to settings, on track and in options, theres plenty, all kinds of  HUD telemetries, and you can iven move them around and set them to your liking, you can set your fov, your siting position in the car, and i belive iven traction control and other '' controls'' on the fly aswell, you can ofcource setup the car itself in the pits. There are penalites and all that jazz, you can turn that off, among other things, in the options menu. There are plenty of assissts in the game to help, and iven presets, from gamer, to proffesional. The controller support in the racing itself is really good, plenty of options to set, but strangely, it doesnt work in the menus, you need to use the mouse.In other options, you can change volume of tire screeching, engine, tarmac, etc. You can also set the virtual wheel rotation as in the ammount of movement the guy behind the wheel in game have to do, and plenty of graphical options aswell, the game is rather well optimized.When it comes to content, there is career mode, practice mode, hot laps, drift, drag, quick race, championship, and challenges, You can iven create your own Championship aswell, and there are options in eariler modes, from time of day, allthough there is no night, or rain in the game....yet, temperature , the surface of the track, the ammount of oppnents,22 is max i belive, laps, and other things.Despite im a complete nub and a somewhat casual player, and this being my first proper racing sim, im having a blast, plenty of cars, somewhat good tracks, tho there coud be more, and im sure there will be in the future, as they are laser scanned, plenty of modes, rather scrub friendly, and well optimized.If you have been wondering to pick this up as your first sim racer, but worried if its ''too hardcore'' or too difficult, dont worry, if i can win with a controller in 3rd person camera against an opponent, anyone can.And most importnantly, the game is being improved all the time aswell.

								This is it, Assetto Corsa is simply put the best racing sim I've ever played. Right out of the box it has the best, most naturally feeling and pleasing physics out there. Do you want to drive slowly? For the first time ever, you can. Do you want to drive over the limit? That works too.It's also the first sim to officially support drifting without adding weird, mode specific physics, and the fact that I had to watch several real life instructional videos to get the hang of it speaks volumes of how good this is.The most important thing though, it just feels good. The force feedback on this thing is simply way ahead of the competition, cars feel real, you can feel every bump and elevation change on the road, you can feel weight shifting (not only lateral but also longitudinal forces too, somehow), it's just bananas.Let's also add the fact that it looks gorgeous and has fantastic performance, plus official mod support (not yet imlemented, but there's plenty of awesome mods already in the works), and great developer support and you got yourself a great sim that's bound to last.The fact alone that I've played this for over 15 hours already and it doesnt even have AI or multiplayer support yet (it's an early access after all) speaks for itself.It's good, if you got a wheel, then get this thing, it's kickass.

												I bought this for two reasons:    1) Project Cars is running like a dog on my AMD 290x graphics card    2) It was 50% off on steam and had good reviewsI am just getting in SimRacing and have bought quite a few pieces of software to go along with my shiny new G27 Wheel. iRacing, DiRT RALLY, Stock Car Extreme, Project Cars, WRC4 to name a few, Assetto Corsa is the best of the bunch, by a considerable margin.The graphics are not the very best, nor the sound and I have seen better presentation, but this is about simulation - not gloss. AC is more natural to me than any other sim I have played. The grip, the traction, the weight transfer - the complete package is just amazing. After playing this for a little while, nothing else feels quite right!There are some mighty contenders - iRacing, Stock Car Extreme and DiRT rally being very high quality Sims - but they all pale in comparison to the mighty Assetto Corsa. Graphics: 8/10    Would have been a 9 if it wasn't for Pcars!Sound: 7/10    Varies quite a bit between different vehicles - some are amazing, others averagePresentation: 8/10    OK menu system and Configuration options - could be a little betterContent: 10/10    Comes with a decent amount of tracks, cars and game modes    LOADS OF FREE QUALITY MODS!!! Tracks, cars - you name it    Paid DLC too...Feel: 10/10    This is where AC shines, it feels amazing - nothing and I mean NOTHING can touch itGrin Factor: 10/10    Absolute Quality - no other racing game comes close to making me smile like this ;)Overall 9/10   Forget the rest, this really is the best!

												This game is best enjoyed if you like to hotlap alone or to play in private servers. The AI is bad (at this moment), the official content is a bit poor (there will be DLCs), career mode is simple (premade themed individual races, no story, no unlocks, no car improvements), and playing online against random people in open servers sucks bad (trolls everywhere, you know), but if you enjoy the pleasure of driving in a very realistic way, even alone, this is one of the best car simulators of the last years. The mod support makes the game even better with tons of community content, as cars, tracks or in-game apps.Steering Wheel very recommended.			"

												Fantastic Racing Simulator, with a very active modding community and some very good external apps - RSR Live Timing for example is a must.Game can still be quite temperamental with unexplained fatal crashing  and the online multi-player is still missing many elements, such as unsatisfying results screen.However the positives far outweigh the negatives and this is a must buy for any race fan and a game I expect to still be enjoying far beyond the 1000 hour mark.Edit:As a little addition - I think it is only fair to say that the game has become considerably more stable and much less likely to crash out in recent updates.Much effort has also been made in streamlining the online multiplayer experience, which ran like a bit of a dog in the earlier releases, but which now holds a good average and perfectly adequate frame rate with 20+ online players participating.

												Reasons to buy this game:+ The physics engine is very realistic+ All tracks are laser-scanned so even the smallest details get put in the game+ Cars sound exactly like in real life (I'm a track marshal at Zandvoort so trust me on that)+ Multiplayer on dedicated servers with 25 players.+ Works fantastic with a 360 controller without having to fiddle with settings, i am able to accurately steer and keep up with wheel users.+ The game supports quality mods, many of which are readily available across the web+ Kunos adds regular new content in the game a few times a year, mostly for free.+ Despite being a sim the game is not hard to get into, all assists can be modified.Reasons not to buy the game:- You only play racing games where you do 200km/h drifts and you don't like sims- Career is a bit meh- You believe that braking before corners is for sissies			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!This is the best physics engine in any racing game hands down. Might not be the absolute best for just racing or serious trackwork for dedicated sim raccers (although it it still amazing for racing), assetto corsa comes into its own for drifitng and being able to hold a slide just if you want to learn how to control a car on the edge of its grip. Assetto corsa is the only game I've ever played where the handeling model will let you dance on the edge of a cars grip with full confidence that it wont bite back. Everything s controlable and smooth and if you stick with this game for even a little while you will learn so much as a driver. The modding support community is also a massive bonus for heaps of extra free conent but the DLC the Kunos provides is amaing as well, they're one of the best devs ive ever  come accross theyre really close to the community and support the game with regularuodates and DLC. In my opinion, dont even wait for a sale, just buy this thing its worth every penny if you like cars and youll never regret it!			"

												Im a pretty keen sim racer, I have a dedicated setup on an obutto with Thrustmaster T500rs, modded pedals, H shifter, sim vibe, triples and recently a Rift CV1. I have been league racing for a few years in games like rfactor2, Assetto Corsa and iRacing.Assetto Corsa is a fun game and if i could make the choice again i would still buy it. But for me it had become somewhat of a hot lap simulator to do a few laps in every now and then. Its a pretty game, it works well with simvibe but the multiplayer matching was crap and the single player events were a bit rubbish as well.  In Comparison:* Assetto wins the gfx competition hands down (until you consider the rift implementation).* The rift implementation in iRacing is much better due to what i believe is the pixel density improving the horrid jaggies. RF2 will never support the rift so although i have loved it dearly its now dead to me. * The mulitplayer implementation of iRacing cant be beaten, its head and shoulders above any other racing game and this is where replayability is born* Physics can be a bit subjective without actually being on the Dev staff of each company but i feel that iRacing and RFactor2 have the slight upper hand. The fact that real GT3 racers use their real life car setups in iRacing says a lot about just how realistic it is.* League racing iRacing and RFactor2 are better by far, in many respects Assetto feels incomplete in comparison* Content.. I dont care for road cars, I like to race in race cars so a lot of whats in Assetto has low appeal for me* Straight up single player fun.. DiRT Rally is the winner of this category for meSummary:If Assetto had a strong multiplayer system including ranking that was even half as good as iRacing and a better menu system + rift implementation it would probably be my goto sim racing game. But as it stands its near the bottom of the pile, one rung up from RF2 but only since RF2 is rift-less			"

								Assetto Corsa. I wasn't one of those guys who hyped it before I played it. Hell I was absolutely skeptical when one of my better friends went absolutely nuts about it on Facebook based on Kunos' reputation alone.Unlike him, i've actually got the PC hardware to actually play the game. When I first loaded the game I was incredibly underwhelmed. Bearing in mind I just spend 33 bucks on an impulse buy, and that I play on a 360 gamepad due to the logistical nightmare of setting up my wheel, I was rather underwhelmed. The framerate was choppy, aliasing was absolutely everywhere, the textures didn't look nice at all, but the worst was that it felt a bit arcady. Cars felt like they were far too reactive and the BMW M3 GT2 felt like it had too much grip.Well, one visit to RaceDepartment.com forums fixed absolutely EVERYTHING wrong with my initial set up. You do have to fiddle around with the Nvidia control panel (if you're team green) and the in game set up to get the best visual quality, but one of the biggest oddities in the game is the way Kunos handles assists and tyre compounds. Its not something that is intuitive, and i had to put some research in to actually understand the UI. I eventually found out that i was running on the SuperSoft compound, which to my knowledge isn't actually used in GT racing.Once I flicked it down to the harder compounds, absolutely everything fit into place. The car felt absolutely divine, playing on a controller was not a problem at all. Never going to be as good as a wheel but those without that option need not worry. One thing this game has changed the way I play race sims is the racing line. In Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsports, F1 2012/13, anything that actually offers a racing line really, I've taken that option. Assetto Corsa has weaned my off that reliance, at least in the game, and has given me the confidence to give it a go in others as well. Playing this game with only the rev counter and gear indicator on the bottom right is truely an experience unlike any other. I booted up the game as of writing, intending to see how the M3 GT2 goes on the harder tyre (I tried out the Zonda R earlier today, it was brilliant). I recorded 10 minutes of it and spent the remaining hour just lapping and learning the track and car.Assetto Corsa is truely astonishing. I had not heard of Kunos' reputation before hand with netKar-Pro, I knew absolutely NOTHING about the title before I plonked down 33 bucks on the recommendation of a friend. I am now absolutely in love with this sim and can't WAIT to see whats Kunos has in store for the future.			"

												I WOULD recommend this game if it hadn't come to light that the lead developer has no clue of how to take criticism on the forums and would rather have a mental breakdown in response to it than calmly look into or at least acknowledge the person's inquiry. Yeah, nice job working PR. How dare someone that has loads of experience in driving cars for multiple manufacturers tell you to try something with your tire model and see how it works? Keep surrounding yourself with yes men until your active players fall to two-digit figures. If I worked on cars that were featured in this, I would be horrified by what you're doing. Either get a grip or find another job. At least see a therapist.Here's an article talking about all of this:https://pretendracecars.net/2017/01/10/another-year-another-stefano-meltdown/As for the game itself, it is pretty good. Just use your own judgement on whether or not it's worth giving money to a company headed by an easily displeased manchild.			"

												Best Racing/Road Car Simulator out there... Its primary focus is all about realistc driving experience as possible... really cheap, offers great value for the money, cheap DLCs enrich the experience with new cars and tracks. Think of it like ""Microsoft Flight simulator"" type of game... it is really a hardcore simulator here but will also appeal to casual car fans too!  A must have for the most affectionate car lovers though! 10/10			"

												Bought an MX-5 and planned to race the nurburg.- Told to myself it might be worth buying AC, nurburg and japanese pack.- Realised I suck and would have crashed if trying to run for <10min- Upgraded probability to finish a lap without crashing from 0% to 50%.Most valuable and money saving game ever !Thx Kunos !

								This Simulator is Solid. In comparison to Race 07, Simraceway, GT6, and forza. This is the most realistic and exciting Sims I've come across. I use a Logitech G27 and its flawless. I've spent a good amount of time on real tracks it the real world and this is it. Can't wait to get my hands on the full version. Assetto Corsa is great. Hope they release a rally version.			"

								I own almost every driving/ racing title ever made for the PC other than the monthly premium titles with a micro-transaction existence. I am writing this review and the title is still in development and is in Alpha/Beta stage.  The reason that I do not care about if it Alpha or Beta is because it is excellent at whatever stage it is currently.  This title has it all, it allows MODS, it allows private servers, custom skins... the works! The physics model is excellent and the sounds are absolutely spot on. Camera views and the ability to record and save your replays so you can analyze any section of the track at any point in the race is incredible. Sure there are lots of other racing games out there, but you will be hard pressed to find better than Assetto Corsa.I love this title and give it 5 out of 5 Stars. - Hajimoto Approved! ;^) "

												A great driving simultator.I don't do multiplayer but I can say that the single player ""Career Mode"" isn't terribly exciting to me. And random races are kinda frustrating--the AI and the fine-grained, non-adaptive difficulty settings don't make for great racing. You choose 85-100%—which personally I don't find works terribly well since one setting doesn't seem to be perfect for all cars/tracks for me. I'll set it to 88% and blow by everyone in the first lap then do another race at the same setting and never see anything but the AI's taillights. I've had more exciting races from Gran Turismo and that series isn't exactly known for the quality of its AI.But when it comes to having a good physics simulation with ample support for mods, that's where Assetto Corsa shines.And Porsche! Did I mention AC has access to Porsche? (Kunos is the first developer to have access to Porsche since EA got the license in the late '90s.) That alone was enough to sway me toward AC over its competitors. If you're a Porschephile like me, the three Porsche Pack DLCs are definitely worth picking up.If you enjoy hotlapping a good driving simulator, Assetto Corsa is a great game. If you want something that skews toward more ""exciting"" racing against AI competitors or if you want the prettiest racing game on the market, there are probably better choices out there.			"

								Well I must admit i did purchase this game in march I really like the handling and the force feedback is awesome , but I was rather put off by what seems to be a over complicated  UI and a mind blowing set ups.I opted to use my time racing F1 2013 , but this week I was  reintroduced to AC by some friends , and wow im hooked , being less than I'm pressed by what I've seen of the F1 2013 DLC .. I mean 2014 , I looked into AC and I'm thinking I will be dropping off the Codies Bandwagon..I'm only going to purchase 2014 if I get good reviews from ppl I know and trust.AC is not perfect by any means , but the best parts of AC and the Best parts of 2013 chopped up and put in a blender could yield some amazing results.id its one thing I really am super happy with about AC its the force feedback its 2nd to none .Anyway to all the people I've took  the♥♥♥♥♥♥of , who played AC ..

												This was my first attempt at early access.  I needed a racing game like Forza and GT, not grid 2.  Asseto Corsa has mostly delivered on that. Migrating to racing sims has been tough.  Cars are harder to drive, and there aren't many options for customizing anything other than the setup. Considering that real driving involves that, not upgrading everything whenever you feel slow, I can deal without the modability.  Being early access, there isn't much to do.  There are a few challenges and enough to keep you racing for quite a few hours, but I can't wait until the carer gets implemented.  The physics, the sense of speed, the sound, and the graphics are all top notch. While there is still some optimizing to be done, this game runs beautifully and racing with AI or alone is bliss.  Multiplayer has yet to be implemented.  Another thing I really like is the ability to mod the game and add apps.  Open mod support is huge for games in general, but a racing sim will see some really cool stuff, we already have!  The apps are for the UI and there is source code to encourage the community to develop apps.  Apps are generally used for displaying some data, but its nice being able to customize my UI, and place everything, from lap times, to the odometer in a specifc place, out of my way.  I have logged over one hundred hours in this beta, and I've been smiling the whole time (except when AI bumps you off the track, bt they are getting better with each update, drive cautiously)UPDATE(3/16/15):  The Nord has been unleashed and its epic.  The car pack equally insane.  AI has been greatly improved, although most would argue they arent all that fast or competative.  There are flags now and some other minor tweaks to gameplay features including tire blankets, fog, factory settings, etc, etc.  The only complaint I have for the game is the career.   Everything is unlocked from the start tho, so get out there and get driving.			"

I am little disappointed with Mazda 787B (sounds and skins) there are many errors on the mazda 787b, but anyways we have Mazda cars in the game at least so...

								This game was a suprisingly fun experience. As an avid Forza fan for years I have always wanted something I could play on PC. Now, don't let me lead you on this is NOT Forza. It is a very different type of sim-racer ( for those looking for a direct replacement ). It is much less forgiving, but focuses more on the accurate reproduction of racing. It is a gorgeous game, far prettier. The handling is a lot more on the realism side; and as such are pretty difficult to get used to.. but with the right setup even an Xbox 360 controller will be tolerable. The track selection has improved a lot since very old updates of the alpha I had played, and the game has gotten a much larger selection on cars. Even 2ish days experience on the game, I am thoroughly enjoying it. Highly recommend.			"

												Alright guys,after almost 20 hours spent on this game i decided to make a review.This game impressed me pretty much.Game looks stunning and it's moddable.It has huge amount of mods that acctually look pretty good.I know Kunos is small company but they didn't made enough cars.Yes there is DLC but without it game looks poor,thanks God there are modders.And now the biggest issues i heard in reviews about this game:AI!Yes,AI could have more aggressive aproach and similar,but it isn't that bad.When i read reviews i expected game to be like Gran Turismo,but it's far better.If you put AI to 100% it acctually can give you a little real racing experience.So my conclusion is:This game has some issues but overall it's best game i played.I'd like it to be more like Race WTCC game,better AI,races feel more real and similar but it's nice looking.Best thing is that every car feels different.I use this game to practice for real racing because there is mod for Automotodrom Grobnik located in Rijeka,Croatia and looks pretty real because i'm driving on that track next year with my Honda.I would recommend this game for every car fanatic,racing fanatic or just ordinary gamer.Hope i helped!

												Best racing sim in a long time. Get that Ferrari 458 GT2 dialled in around Spa and you'll be grinning from ear to ear. Get a decent racing wheel and you can feel every little slip of the tyres, bump and knock. Now it's not without it's faults, for example there is no Rain or wet tracks, nor are there night events and the graphics aren't as pollished as some other SIM's but once you get used to the AWESOME physics and feel of the cars it's hard going back to any other racing SIM.

												It's an excellent hot lap simulator. Unfortunately that's all it is. And It's not worth 60 dollars.Kunos continues to be opaque with development, and throw tantrums during any criticism on the forums, banning people that complain. I'll sum it up.Online:Netcode is garbage. It's extremely difficult to join a race. Server browser sucks and doesn't have enough options. It's not as though that matters, because there's nobody playing.Single Play:The AI is nonexistent, so racing offline is a no. They simply don't recognize the fact that you're there. Smashing in to you in an attempt to stick their pre programmed lines. The penalty system is absurd. Two tires off the track and you'll have your speed cut. Get rammed by the braindead AI? Speed cut. Forced to swerve and cut a corner because the AI doesn't acknowledge you as ""there"". Speed cut. The Career mode is a joke. It never feels like you're doing anything or progressing in anything.There's a time attack mode that is...odd. And pointless, since there's no leaderboards.Simulation: ALMOST peerless. Everything feels super tight and realistic. The only thing that's lacking is the sound design and force feedback. The forcefeedback is absurdly high by default. You can fine tune this pretty easily, it just takes time. But the game doesn't seem to want to save my settings. I come back to the game to find my degrees of rotation back to a full 900 despite what I have set up in the in game profiler, and the stand alone one I have.The UI: Terrible. Everything feels extremely wonky. Once you have everything set up and are ready to drive. I'd say race but again, its a hot lap simulator, it opens it in a SEPARATE INSTANCE. Which makes streaming a nightmare.Even out of early access, and being out for a full year it's worth 30 dollars at best. There's not enough tracks, and not enough cars. There was dlc announced before the game was even released.The cars themselves look superb, but everything else looks last gen at best, ps2 era at theworst. This is mostly a problem with usermade tracks so its excuseable. Because the PC is starved for sims that have the latest roster of cars, this game is basically a must play. But buy it on sale. It's not worth full price. It wasn't when it was in EA, and it's not worth it now. I wouldn't spend more than 20 dollars on it. Almost every aspect of the game besides the driving feels incomplete or lazy.Edit December 2016, hope you like DLC.			"

								I never played any racing simulations before. I was never interested on them. But when this game was on sale, I was eager to buy it. I just wanted to know what simulation was, because I just played arcade racing before.At first, I played it with controller. I played with it for about a month and I enjoyed it. But then I realized that I would get more fun if I used steering wheel, because it was simulation. So I bought G27 wheel. Of course it gave me more fun and I felt like I was driving in real life.The physics is amazing. Each car will give you different experience. Some cars are difficult to drive so you have to practice. The graphics is nice too. The tracks are accurate. But some contents and features are not in the game yet because it is early release.This is a must buy game for any simulation fans. Perfect game. 10/10.			"

												I hummed and Arred and read mixed reviews. In the end i decided to download. I certainly wish I downloaded the game earlier while it was on sale. Whilst I have only played 5 hours so far, I can certainly see myself spending manny more on this game. The Mod Community is fantastic and there are so manny extra tracks and content you can download. This is the first game I have really been able to enjoy the use of my G27.  The feedback and sensation is just like a real car...This is a simulator, not arcade. I have read some reviews refferring to the cars behaving like boats or soap on the floor. The vehicle behaviour is ultra realistic and makes it really more fun. If your are after nitro boosts, arcard fun with bulletproof damage then go play need for speed. If you enjoy realism, Sims and a big modding community (I also enjoy Euro Truck 2) I would suggest you download the game. This game has put more smiles on my face in 5 hours then others have in weeks and months...			"

Regular updates and upgrade and DLC packs make this game continually fresh, and the mod support is staggering. There's great sim racing communities around it.

								This is one of the best games I ever bought. It might not have that many cars and tracks, but you can spend a lot of time even with one car and one track. Every car feels and reacts different. I spent hours upon hours discovering how a car behaves in certain situations, and how to drive it to its max.It is truly a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. I recommend playing this with a good steering wheel. I think this is the only way to really get the full driving experience out of this.I have spent around 150 hours so far, most of the time on track, but also a couple of hours in the replay mode trying to get a good angle for my next screenshot. And don't forget that this is still Early Access. Once it is finally out, with all the content, career- and multiplayer mode released, I think I can play this forever. And all this for only 35€, I have spent a lot more money on games not even half as good as this one. So if you love (sim-) racing or if you consider to try it out for the first time, you should definetely get it. It offers a great experience.			"

												TL;DR: The following review is inaccurate (because it is now a year old) and although the game has goen through huge improvements on the points criticised and other things, I still do not recommend this hotlap-simulator.Update: a year after, it seems like the netcode and AI have been updated and make the game become playable with other cars on the track. They added 4WD support and a few free cars next to the DLCs to show off this new feature of the physics engine. DLC #3 has been released, with some Lamborghinis, nice to see them deliver that promise. One of the Lambos in the game however is community content that has been promoted to be part of the official game (if I remeber correctly). All in all, if you are searching for some fun driving cars around track with great realism and don't care for AI or online multiplayer, you might want to try the game. Beware though, it is a simulator, so it is best played using a steering wheel, preferably a 900degree, so you can use the full lock of the cars.With the announcements of the Dream Pack #1 DLC I felt like I needed to warn potential buyers of this game.So here it goes:After having pre-purchased this game and having early-access being able to play the beta, it was a pretty good experience, the physics are okay most of the time and feel incredibly good with lower power rear wheel drive vehicles (eg: BMW M3 E30, BMW M3 E92, BMW Z4 E89, BMW 1 Series M Coupe, KTM Xbow, Lotus Evora SR, Lotus Elise SC)The front wheel drive cars do not feel that great to me, but as I am not a fan of these I will pass the subject.Now for the gameplay aspect:Menus are reasonably well designed and constructed, the options menus is very big with a lot of options (very nice to see). Just a little side note, menus are a seperate process from the game engine so you can let your PC cool down a bit between two races which is a nice segue to bring you to the graphics engine part of the game...Graphics, well oh boy... The optimisation... the obvious lack of thereof... The graphics look good but it's nothing extremely spectacular and yet I struggle to max out the settings and get a decent framerate (my system: 2-way SLI of GTX 680s, an i7 4770k @4GHz and 16GB of RAM)The in-game UI is very minimal and is not very well optimised for the multiplayer aspect of racing in my honest opinion, but Kunos has THE answer, modding... Yes, like the rest of the game, you can mod, and the UI is coded in Pyhton so you can either make your own or download one from someone else.I will not comment on multiplayer as my experience was sub-par to all the other simulations I've played but it was about 8-9 months ago so it might have changed.The AI is horrible absolutely not aware of you the race on rails they are not braking when you are and thus bump into you and thow you off track, the difficulty of the AI is also something strange... You, well I at least, can't keep up with the race leader, if you don't overtake the AI in the first 3 to 4 corners well the cars in front of you are going to vanish into the distance and you'll never catch up, interrestingly, if you turn the scenario the other way around, if you are the race leader, even if you don't drive that well and don't set lap records they'll never catch up (assuming you don't crash of course).So finally Assetto Corsa becomes a solo player hotlap simulator with... not a lot of content.37 cars of which probably half are just variants of the same car10 tracks where 3 of them have a second shorter variantA drag strip for quarter and full mileA dedicated drifting playground ""track""But this not a lot of content part will change in the same horrible fashion that game developpement has seen fit to go towards... Yes you guessed it, they have at least 1 DLC planned.Regarding the controls also very important to note, if you do not have a steering wheel... well do not try the keyboard and the controllers are a nightmare to use and to make it worse...You have to have a 900 degres steering wheel because the game supports it but also likes to map the 900 degres of rotation to a 270 degre steering wheel making the force feedback way too powerful and the steering way too sensitive and imprecise.Also apparently 45EUR (or your regional equivalent) is not enough... they want to add content but also fill their pockets because yes game devs also want to live they do not work for free, they are planning to release a DLC in the coming weeks... months...? but thanks to its naming scheme we know that it is far from the only DLC that is planned...What the F is wrong with game devs nowadays? Why DLC? Whay not wait to release the game for full price when the game is ready and finished, when there is content that make the game worth buying?At this point I don't know what I should do with it other than poke it with a really really long stick to see when new content is going to be added, and see how much the DLC will cost...As I generally do with any game that does include DLC in its roadmap... look at blizzard people please, they have a roadmap that says:1-dev2-bugfix3-release4-make sure everything is stable5-dev DLC*6-Bugfix DLC*7-release DLC*(8-repeat steps 4 to 7)* In Blizzard terms, DLC means expansion that is downloadable, your game does not tell you all the time ""this content is part of a DLC to unlock it buy the DLC"", no instead it doesn't show anything of it in-game, it does show however a nice thing on the Battle.net Launcher saying that there is an upgrade available for this game. A Blizzard expansion is typically more expansive than a DLC and for a good reason, it add a butt-ton of content and updates and patches and additional balancing and new awesome Pixar-like quality animations for cutscenes...PLEASE EVERYONE STOP BUYING DLC...And here isa little bonus (yay more text). It's the comment I left on the Assetto Corsa facebook page regarding the announcement of the Dream Pack #1 DLC:Not long ago they made something ""very fun and appropriate"". They released a video teaser of the contract deal they signed with Lamborghini in which they show 4 different cars that are not part of the game, and obviously advertises the game as having these cars in it when obviously no one has seen them in game... They're part of the upcomming DLC (not the lambos, these are clearly coming later)The modding aspect is great, allowing and encouraging modding is great. But making an engine adding 10-15 cars plus a racing variant of some of these cars and another engine another racing class (essantially the same model but with 300 HP instead of 350 and weighing 1100kg instead of 1250kg doesn't make it that different), 10 tracks and asking the community for their money and hard-work to make the game worth a damn by making mods, and asking to please not upload poor quality mods because it's an elite game, we want to have good content... (The please do not port is a genuine thing on the modding part of the assetto corsa forum, feel free to go and check it ot yourself)I am not happy about the money I spent on the game, it was too much for the content provided...I would prefer for them to remove their branding for the game, because frankly ""Your racing simulator""... Well it bloody hell isn't mine...Thanks for making it this far :)			"

												Fun driving game for a lap or 2. I was going to give it a bash again and see if I could get into it, however, I have just seen a certain 'Stefano Castillo' abuse a fan (who is a professional driver) on the Assetto Corsa forum, who fairly and respectfully asked a question and pointed out a few things within the Sim.Stefano is apparently the 'KS (Kunos Studios) Dev. Programmer' and his reaction to someone who has no doubt spent some money on the base game and DLC's is absolutely ridiculous. Full off expletives it went on and on and on. This guy needs some help.If this response had been given by a BIG and professional developer, all hell would break loose in the marketing department. I have a feeling, with attitudes like that, AC is going the way of Project Cars.Sooooooooo promising but not quite finished in noticeable area's backed up by a bunch of rude, arrogant, vile people who do not care about who buys the game.Grand Prix 2 by Microprose is better. Go by an old PC and play that. You will learn more than from this piece of...........			"

												This game refuses to let me play a race, and the developer refuses to offer any support. Whenever I start a game it asks me to install Steam, which is rather odd because I launched the game from Steam. If I click install, it makes me quit Steam which makes me quit Assetto Corsa, and it reinstalls Steam; but will do the same thing if I try to start another race. If I click cancel and dont install Steam, it just takes me back to the main menu in Assetto Corsa.I emailed the developer about this, and their response was to post my question to their forum, and hope that another person who paid money for this game will tell me why this game refuses to acknowledge I have Steam installed. I sent a response saying this was unacceptable, and the developer refuses to respond to that. Are you serious? You're charging $50 for a game, you refuse to fix bugs which are worse than game breaking (i can't even start a game for it to break), and you refuse to offer any support at all. Dont waste your money on this, the developer has essentially abandoned the product, and is simply defrauding Steam users purporting that this game works and is actively supported.			"

												A must-have for anybody interested in motorsport. The game runs well even on my current budget rig (AMD Athlon X4 760k, AMD R9 270, 8GB DDR3) and is easy to pick up and play with a controller. The game allows you to pick from a wide array of cars and tracks, and gives you the option to change each car's setup to your liking. Mod support means that you'll have plenty of community content to mess around with as well. DLCs also add more cars and tracks if you're serious about the game. The only negative I can think of is that people report a lot of ""rubber-banding"" and other latency issues during online play.			"

												Apart from being not a fully finished game, having trouble with wanky AI Drivers, Server Connections and so on it's quite a good racing simulator. And it is a Simulator, which needs some practice and consistence. The amount of cars and tracks off-the-box isn't that high, but the quality of them is. Having a look at Spa for example, it's a great detailed and laser-scanned track, which is a sheer pleasure to drive at. Same thing with the stock driving vehicles - it's a reward if you learn to handle them. Of course, there is no rain like in pCARS, no night or weather at all, not that much eye candy stuff in Assetto Corsa. Kunos SImulazioni focused on the driving and the physics of the vehicles and with that it delivers excellent force feedback on many supported wheels. Probably the most outstanding thing is the modding community, as it's really active and gets sometimes even featured by KS, which is great. The driving community on the other side is like in almost every other game full of nerds, midskillers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s alike. Don't expect the best experience, when you join a server with random people in it. ...oh and better wait at Spa and look how they manage to get the first corner after the start ;) Seriously, it's fun and if you're into cars anyway, check it out!

												I have never ever enjoyed so much hot lapping in a racing game.I know it's a racing game but much of my time has been spent hot lapping because there is no racing game that has made it so enjoyable just taking in the car solo, one at a time. I'm beginning to start racing only after passing the 100 hours.Every track and car needs to be learned, just like in RL. If you don't know the track well you're not going to be competitive. The AI races with realistic aggressiveness, meaning they don't use you as a brake in corners. To me this is THE best racing game/simulation. I wished they had weather and night racing though. But as is, it's a perfect racing game/simulation that's friendly on the hardware.If you have some interest in racing game, whether you already own a wheel or otherwise, get this game. Enough said.

												Assetto Corsa is a half finished game and I cannot recommend it.  AC works fine as a hotlapping sim.  You'll ohh and ahh at the graphics but that's largely all there is here.  For something to be called ""your racing simulator"", there actually has to be racing involved.  It should be called ""Your Hotlapping Simulator"".- No Single Player Pit stops- No Rolling starts- No weather- No Night racing-The Single player portion is largely worthless.  The AI is not worth running against.  They run off track, run over each other, and run into the back and sides of the player.  -Each time Kunos ""improves"" their game, it breaks some other part (sound for modded cars, graphics, etc- The force feedback is far over exxagerated- The tire model is laughable compared to other sims and thus the reason it is changed with each patch.- you'll cringe at the CPU Occupancy errors stating your CPU is at 99 percent when while running a CPU monitor, it shows 60 percent usage-If you have Windows 10, forget about running this sim.  Devs on the official forums response is to reinstall windows or DDU your graphics drivers (in other words, they can't fix it).Wretched game In my opinion.  Had the refund option been in place when I purchased it, this turd would have gone back to Kunos.			"

								if you're into racing simulators, it appears this is going to be the one to beat. Graphically it utterly trounces Gran Turismo and Forza, and as far as physics behavior, even in its very early pre-release stage, it ties or beats the latest iteration of Gran Turismo and leaves Forza far behind. Best of all, it's on the PC, not a console. If you're looking for an arcade racer like NFS, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a simulator, I can already tell this is going to be an incredible addition to the racing sim genre.			"

												Jacko Rating 9.5/10Assetto Corsa is a brilliant simulation racer with especially good attention to detail and controller/Force Feedback.Let's breakdown the review into sections;General - This game provides a dozen different tracks with variations to these as extra tracks along with approx 60 cars depending on what DLC you have bought.  Its a real racer with many different settings in order to create the perfect simulation experience for you.  Hardcore racers can adjust things so its very difficult and beginers can tweak things down and turn on assists, a plethera of settings here.  You have various styles of racing from flag to flag or time trials and a campaign for single players as well as mutli player options and online leaderboards to keep you occupied.Graphics - Pretty slick but not as polished as perhaps Forza or Project Cars.  The details are there it is just not as eye poppoing as some other titles.  The tracks are to my knowledge a true to life depiction of the real ones and the cars are faithfully represented here.Audio - I found the audio to be very good with respect to the engine noises as well as the ambient sounds such as tyre squeels and exhaust backfires etc.  Music if you have it on is not bad but who cares when you are racing.Gameplay - Here is where the game excells and this is the best and the closest thing to real life racing I have ever played.  You will feel every bump, indent and parts of the tracks and the cars handle uniquely which means each one is a pleasure to master.  The feedback you get is amazing and this game begs for a proper racing wheel although you can still play and win with a controller.If you like real racing sims and prefer a detailed difficult racing game to a simcade then this game is for you.Superb, addictive and realistic sums up this pearl of a game.Race On!

Early Access Review
								Possibly the most promising racing simulator available on the market today.You can make a long list of comparison points between different racing sims. More content, better graphics, et cetera, but at the core every racing sim should be compared by the one thing they all share in common, the driving model.And this is where AC shines. The feel of the cars on the road are probably the closest any sim has come to replicating real life while importantly staying fun. Cars don't feel overly slippery and lack grip to add extra challenge and frustrate players. On the other hand they aren't glued to the track like arcade racers and can be difficult to control when pushing to the limit. It's a driving model that hooks you in and wants you to get better no matter the car you're in. Assists like traction control, stability control, ABS and driving lines also feature to help newcomers to racing sims get up to speed.While it might be a tad lacking in content in it's current early access state, the commitment to future content is evident and the quality of said content is fantastic. Highly detailed cars, authentic sounds and laser-scanned circuits meaning each official circuit in this game is as close as we'll likely get to actually racing the circuits ourselves. While Project CARS hogs the limelight with it's graphical quality and amount of official content, no car there truly feels as fun to drive there as they do in AC. And AC isn't a bad looking game at all might I add, check the screens and videos for yourself.To top it off, this game is also 100% moddable. The amount of custom cars and tracks already available in early access state is staggering and the quality of some of these is incredible. While PCARS might have more base content, it's lack of mod support limits it's future in the community, whereas AC could last for years with new content being released all the time by Kunos and it's playerbase respectively.Single player right now is limited to single race weekends and hotlapping, but a career mode of some fashion will appear when the game is fully released. Multiplayer is also constantly improving and already provides for excellent races that can only get better as the netcode is refined and more features are added.If you have a wheel, buy this now and you'll have no regrets. If you have a controller and want a racing game that's more challenging than any other racing game, buy this now and you'll have no regrets.			"

You found it right here - Assetto Corsa!**Update**Ok, now i've clocked 500+ hours in Assetto Corsa, and what is my view now? It has changed - for the better.Content:We got more content since last time. A couple of cars and i think a track (Nurnburg GP). The latest of cars was the 98T - a mechanical monster! Raced in the 80's using carbon fiber and around 1300BHP with a weight of only 540Kg its fair to say its a scary beast, and beautiful modeling and execution regarding physics and FFB. Just as good as the other cars in this sim. The car is a thrill ride. Content wise we have a good range from street, super cars, GT and formula. And a good amount of laser scanned tracks that got character thanks to the collision layer which adds the bumps/dips/noise that our wheels go over which also translates awesomely to the wheel through FFB. Also worth mentioning is that Kunos landed more licenses and will give us more free content that wasnt promised at start. For one we will get the Corvette C7 included in the price! And a GT version will come in the much anticipated Nordschleife DLC. More about that further down!Multiplayer:Last time i wrote the review there was no multi player - there is now. And although lacking a bit its amazing fun. Funnier than any sim or race game ive done because of the excellent true to life physics and FFB. The new netcode that was just coded in the fluidity is great. Even driving against people across the planet they look smooth and you can have tight races - which is super. Very happy with the netcode upgrade to say the least. We also now have ""slipstream"" activated in MP which means you can go up behind someone and then get a boost from that cars ""air pocket"". This changes MP racing a lot!We also got FREEJOIN which means you can join in progress and even exit when you feel like it and change car if available (not during race). This is also a huge step up from earlier MP where you chose your car and that was it.Third good thing is that the admins are getting more and more power to force assists off. This came in the last patches and we can now force damage, fuel and tyre wear so the races get more equal. We are still waiting to be able to force Stability Control, ABS and TC, but im sure its coming very soon. This is where AC is lacking a little atm. Not being able to force all assists off and no real penality system yet. There will be however so its nothing to get hanged up on. Kunos even testing their own build with simple pitstops which was not announced for the 1.0 version. Maybe it wont come, but at least we know they are testing it. Good enough for me. So far they added things that were not scheduled for 1.0 so... :)Graphics:Kunos have upgraded the graphics by adding more effects and post processing. You can now make your own filter profiles and switch them while on track! So you tweak a lot of effects such as color, exposure, blur, vignette and a whole range of effects giving amazing results. You can make as many filters as you like and even share them with others. This way you can get great looking graphics without doing yourself but instead download a filter (or more) from someone else. Do you like realistic looking? More saturated with cool effect? Its up to you - you choose. No forcing by the developers. Just like it should be - freedom.Sounds:Nothing has happened in the sound engine since before, but(!) something IS happening as i write this. Luca, the sound master of Kunos is working hard to implement FMOD into Assetto Corsa! This is basically technology to have lots of effects on each sound. Reverb, occlusion etc. Trust me when i say that the cars will sound amazing when this gets implemented. Because FMOD has a good track record in other games like Forza 5 for example plus a whole range of other games. It will make a huge difference. Looking forward to this big time because sounds are one of the greatest immersion creators in games/sims. Hell, in any entertainment!Mods:Kunos (the developers) already released the tools for track/cars finalizing, and we already seen lots of tracks and a bunch of cars already. Some of the cars are top notch quality with amazing modeling, phyics and sounds. Some scratch made tracks have been made as well and they are equally amazing. These things take time to create and perfect so we also got a ton of track conversions from other sims/games (with permission) and i dont lie when i say that the track number have exploded! And from here and forward there will be more and more and more. Kunos endorse modding and help any way they can so this title will have a large library of tracks, cars and apps to enjoy.DLC (or further development of AC):So far the first DLC will be the grand track Nordschleife, and of course its being laser scanned with the latest techniques. Every little dip/bump will be there and every object around the track is in its correct place. This DLC will also feature 10 GT cars. Some of them includes Corvette, RUF and Nissan. There might be more to this DLC, but we have to wait and see. Me and everyone i know is looking forward to it big time. I hope Kunos will be able to sustain themselves by making juicy, meaty DLC's with content we racers want. There is a classic DLC as well i think with SPA and a lot of old powerful cars. Lots to look forward to since Kunos have stated they will improve and build on Assetto Corsa for 5 years!Final word:As you can imagine, as a simmer and race fan i cant get enough of AC. Mainly because of the physics and FFB which is at top class. Any sim/race game i try i cant stay long because its miles away from the feeling of AC. This sim feels like driving a real car, and its challening and tons of fun. Races are very intense thanks to that, and its easy to get addicted to the feeling. Kunos goes the extra mile making sure Assetto Corsa will be in the top which we see when they keep adding things that was never on the agenda from start. They keep improving the sim beyond what i thought they would which is amazing. And its taking its time because they are but a few very talented developers, but its worth its wait because the sim is already a meaty excellent driving experience, and i cant wait to see and play it in a couple of months time. Its almost so i want to freeze myself to see how excellent it is in the near future, but at the same time i cant stop playing it so thats a no go. I will just have to continue enjoying myself and take it as it comes. :)Long review. Im not good at writing them, sorry for that. But i still stand by what i wrote at first. If you want to feel that you drive a REAL car then AC is for you. The driving experience is already there and the details around it is being built up patch by patch. Kunos have impressed me, and im not easy to impress since i require depth and authenticity. Also a big plus is developers who stay close to their customers and listen, and they do. So, im totally sold on this experience and i hope to see you too on the track soon! ;)PS. the price they ask is low, very low, for a high end product as this one. This is the same type of simulator real car companies use!			"

Early Access Review
								I've been playing driving sims for a few years now and this is without doubt the best ever. It's not just the beautiful graphics/artwork, the handling physics are by far the most advanced too. I'm usually a multi-player junkie but at the time of writing this (early access), the MP hasn't been released yet but I've already clocked up more than 115 hours just hot lapping. Not something I've done with any other game.If you like driving games, whether sims or arcade, this is a must buy for you!The developers, Kunos Simulazioni, are a small team of 12 Italian guys with a passion for cars, fast cars. They have out done the competition not only with their product but also with their support in forum, ironing out bugs and issues that have to be expected at beta stage, but also listening to suggestions from the community to make the game better for everyone.  All of the cars have been meticulously reproduced to an exacting standard. Telemetry data has been gathered directly from the manufacturers of every single car and applied to the unique physics engine to give the most accurate driving/racing experience possible to date on a PC or console.They have also laser scanned every inch of every track, including Silverstone, Imola, Monza and many more. And thanks to a community vote, laser scanning of Nordschleife is due to start soon for release in Sept 2014!Anyway, enough typing from me. It's time to get back to the Ferrari F40 at Imola!			"

												Now, this is one of the best sim racing on the market! Why?+ price+ laser scanned tracks+ good graphics / nice effects+ one of the best physics (better than pCARS and Raceroom)+ nice career, with some good challenge+ now the improved AI is not perfect, but I'm really happy for the changes+ support: new tracks, new (continuously) improved gameI can't say very negative things in this moment. Maybe the missing weather... and yes I'm really like to see more tracks!			"

												This simulator is, with its excellent performance easily hitting the hundreds of frames per second in some cases, a gift to the virtual reality community. With such a steady and high framerate, unlike its competitors, Assetto Corsa does NOT constantly rely on framerate smoothing mechanisms like Asynchronous Timewarp, rather delivering VR's required 75 or 90 frames per second without problem.I've had the honor of trying AC in both the Oculus DK2 and the consumer model. It's quite a treat as it rivals iRacing in terms of fluidity and smoothness, while not being a massive hit on the bank. An excellent choice for your first VR simulator pick!I must stress the fact that SteamVR/HTC VIVE owners would rave over this title if it had support implemented for it. Given SteamVR doesn't make use of Asynchronous Timewarp, it's software like this that'll benefit SteamVR because the game can simply keep up the headset's required framerate without a single hitch. I highly encourage the devs of AC to continue this awesome VR support and consider doing with SteamVR as well! VIVE owners will love you for it!Video first impressions with the Oculus Rift CV1

			Remember the main complient this simulator got when first run on the DK2? PERFORMANCE. Assetto Corsa supporting the new Oculus Rift CV1 is quite the welcome news, seeing that the developers clearly...

												As a simulator this game is absolutely incredible. The physics are a bit unforgiving if you drive beyond your limits, as it should be. Furthermore, the graphics look wonderful (Use the Glide filter to prevent brightness adjustment, by the way) and the selection of cars both mod and official are pretty decent.As a racing game in today's market, it's not that great. Single-player AI is pants-on-head stupid, the track selection is incredibly small, and multiplayer is almost entirely unplayable at 200+ ping. Official leagues don't exist, public lobbies are filled with idiots, and you'll rarely ever find a good room of people using any of the more interesting disciplines, like the Lotus Eleven.If you are a racing simulation enthusiast, this is a decent choice for you. I love driving the Mercedes 190E DTM around the Nordschleife, right where it belongs. The tracks are all very well done, and some of the mod tracks and cars are unbelievably fun and/or to AC's laser-scanned standards. Lake Louise is a fun loop around the Canadian Rockies, and Bridgehampton is just as bumpy as you'd expect a race track situated in Long Island to be. You can drive a Supercharged Cobra 427, but you can grab the mod with the Competition and Street versions as well. There's also a very good NA Miata mod.If you are anything but an enthusiast, maybe hold off until there is a bigger selection of cars and tracks, or find a different sim to play. I can't recommend this game because SPR is almost broken and MPR is unplayable, if not frustrating.			"

												EDIT: Ok, so i have lightened up a little since last time. Since the 1.5 update i have been playing it sporadic, with so much love that i almost cant explain it. But it still misses out on rain wich i think it's a disgrace to the Ayrton Senna legacy, if they continue to let it out. Monaco too.... So my thumb stays down until further notice. No rain no gain.  ""The waaaiting is the hardest part"" Tom Petty once sang. I think it describes this sim perfectly since there are lots of promises but no will of doing them justice.  Green hell with DLC cars was kinda expected september this year but we still havent seen it. It's a good racing game but the waiting is the hardest part as said before.  I will certainly never buy an early access game ever again.			"

								For shear driving pleasure out on the track, Assetto Corsa is where it's at. I'm yet to find a game that does my G27 justice in the way that Assetto Corsa has - On the limit of grip the feedback is superb and the physics/handling seem bang on to me. Whilst this is still an early build of the game and the content/features are a little light, what is there is fantastic. I have high hopes for future development of this game. In particular, a few Japanese cars wouldn't go a-miss. To summarise: if you're a motorsport fan, BUY IT! 9/10 for what's currently present.			"

												In the old days of PC racing games - and by old I don't mean too old but think mid 2000s, there weren't many choices. Sure, there are plenty of arcade racers, but many of them unfortunately were forgotten and relegated to the proverbial dustbin of history (though there are ones that still thrive, like TrackMania and Whiplash). As for more realistic games, there were a few titles PC players could choose from; Simbin with their GTR2 and Race 07 titles, ISI with rFactor, Papyrus (RIP) with Nascar Racing 2003 and even though they were incredibly arcadey, EA's Need for Speed, among others. However, two franchises never came to PC and stayed console only - those being Gran Turismo (for PlayStation), and Forza (for xBox). And PC players, myself included, yearned for a great racing game that had the graphics of those games whilst the level of realism offered by more hardcore games like the SimBin games or rFactor. This isn't to say PC didn't have good games, but what the consoles got was something else altogether. Fast-forward a few years and here we have a game developed by a small Italian firm named Kunos Simulazioni. Their goal was to produce a realistic racing game that has the intricate graphics offered by console games (at least, that's what I gather with this game; I assume that's what the devs were going for). It was given a fancy Italian name because what is more Italian than race cars? I digress, but anway, Assetto Corsa, when it was first released, was eye opening. Who would've thought that a game of this caliper would come to PC? Granted, Kunos aren't exactly a new firm; they did produce NetKar Pro, but I've never played that game, so I cannot say what it is like. However, what I can say about Assetto Corsa is this: it's a really good game, but it does have some issues.The first thing I noticed about this game after setting up my race wheel was the force feedback. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the force feedback is incredibly well done. The fact that you can actually feel the road while driving is astounding, and because of this gives me confidence in what the car is doing. Every kerb, every crack in the road is felt but not exaggerated, making playing fun and exciting. It makes rFactor's limited force feedback feel like mushy peas in comparison. I will say this; you might've noticed I said ""race wheel."" Yes, this is a game that benifits incredibly from a game wheel with force feedback, or at the very least, a controller with force feedback. Keyboard control is possible, but it detracts from the game and using a keyboard removes one of the most highly praised parts of the game. The game is more than just force feedback though. What I really like about this game is how easy to drive a good number of cars are. I know a lot of people are going to say ""but the GT3 cars should be incredibly twitchy and nervous and blah blah blah"" but hear this: GT3 cars are meant for regional racing series (like Blancpain, Super GT GT300, or Dutch Supercar Challenge) and also meant for ""gentleman drivers."" What is a gentleman driver? Simply put, someone with limited (or in some cases, no) race experience that wants to race. It's no wonder these cars are going to be easier to drive than say, the Lotus 98T or the Ferrari 312T or even the new McLaren F1-GTR. Sure, there are some hard to drive cars in the game; the 3 I mentioned earlier are good examples of that. However, not everything requires superhuman skill to drive. And for that, I give Assetto Corsa high marks. I also love the tracks; they are incredibly well done and I love the atmosphere that surrounds them. Whether it is something as primitive or ""organic"" as the Nordschelife or as high tech as the Nurburgring GP circuit, you get a good idea on how the track feels. And finally, no more awkward versions of Spa! The one in this game is one of the most realistic versions out there.Onto graphics; what can I say? They're great. Just take a look at some screenshots. Kunos has easily matched the graphics level of the console games, with highly detailed car models and tracks. The UI is unobtrusive, though can get a bit clunky trying to select cars and skins. Sounds are for the most part good, though there are some better third party sounds available. I guess that is a good thing since they can be replaced, but by the same token you'd think Kunos would've done good sounds themselves; I guess it was a cost issue. Oh well.Now the things this game needs fixed, and there are a bunch of them.First is netcode in multiplayer. Quite frankly, it needs reworking. A small tap from one car could send another car flying off like some sort of Newton's Cradle. It's hilarious at first, but there needs something to be done about that. Sure, at high speed having cars bounce off each other in two different directions makes sense but not while the cars are going 20 or so mph. Multiplayer racing, while good for the most part, does need improvement because of that. Second is optimization and stability, which this game needs. I know piling on mod after mod can make the game more unstable, but ever since the game started using FMOD for sounds I have been having more and more sound crashes, making playing a sort of ticking time bomb. It especially sucks when you're on a great hotlap and suddenly the game goes six feet under. Optimization is sorely needed as well. I understand with the Dream Pack update there were CPU optimizations brought in, which is great, but there need to be graphic ones as well. Third is the general state of the game. And I don't mean ""Is this game going to die out or not"" because right now I feel that Kunos is doing its best to keep the game ship shape. However, what direction does Kunos want to take this game in? As a hotlap game, it's great, but put any sort of AI racing and it's quite frankly subpar. Multiplayer has its own issues to deal with, and on top of that the game has probably one of the most insipid penalty systems in any racing game. Going off track - even if there is no advantage gained - grants you either a 10 second penalty OR you have to slow down to 30MPH. This is incredibly dumb and in multiplayer situations it can lead to some stupid crashes. I know the first thing people will say is ""well don't go off track"" but let's face it; you are bound to go off track sooner or later. But back to what this game wants to be; does it want to become the next rFactor? the next Gran Turismo/Forza? Or both? It is hard to say, and maybe Kunos doesn't know either. In all, this is a great racing game, and is a breath of fresh air that PC players desperately needed. The collection of cars and tracks is great, and the modding community is thriving, producing some content that rivals the stock content. Would I recommend buying it? Yes, but if it's on sale with the DLC as well. And when Kunos does fix the issues and takes the game in whatever direction they choose, the game will be on every PC racer's bucket list to play.			"

								this is a very VERY amazing game, even as an unfinished product it feels even better than any other finshed retail sim . The graphics are stunning and the couple of cars you can currently drive are very detailed and beutiful in their own special ways. The sounds are very good and the game itself feels very good to drive. I highly recommend you buy this, more things will get added over time for no cost and the current game is well worth the 39$ if not more than that.Anyone with some spare money and a passion for cars/racing should buy this game, you will not regret it "

												After enjoying racing sims for the past seven years AC will hopefully keep the enjoyment coming.I'm very keen on seeing how the multi-player turns out and how strong the league scene will be.I much prefer league racing over pick up racing ( iRacing official series / open servers ) as league racing tends to be a lot cleaner.As i can only really do one night a week for league racing ( work reasons ) I am also hoping for a good single player experiece.From the few hours I've spent on AC I'm very impressed with how the cars handle, especially at low speed corners where some sims behave very enexpectedly.Any mishap is clearly a ""oh I did this or that wrong"" not a ""WTF"" moment.Graphics wise i have no problems getting 90FPS running triple monitors with a GTX680 at moderate settings.Hopefully AC will still do more optimizing so when we have multiple cars on track the frames won't take a nose dive.All in all I'm impressed with what I've seen so far and infact have gifted AC to one of my sim racing friends.edit: In fact make that gifted to two friends. Feeling a bit like Santa			"

												I'm a real life driver. No I don't mean professional driver or track day'er. I drive to work, Tescos and so forth like the typical player. I was looking for a game that gave me a ""realistic"" feel in terms of acceleration, braking, turning, road feel etc. Asseto Corsa delivered with flying colours or shall I say my Thrustmaster TX did? Actually no, I've played a few ""arcade"" / semi simulated games and this by far gives you the best force feedback as if you were driving on a real road surface (I haven’t Project Cars but i read the reviews for both before choosing Asseto Corsa.. the consensus was that AC had a more realistic feel).Interestingly I decided to use my real life car around the track but had opportunity to coach with an amateur rally driver. He gave my some tips when cornering/braking for turns. That worked well on the real life track so I thought I would apply the exact same concept to Asseto Corsa... Before my ""real life"" lesson, the Nürburgring (Tourist)I was hitting around 7.30ish with the 599 XX (admittedly that was slow in general)... When I applied real life track day tips, my time reduced to around 6.58. Let that be the testament of translating real-life driving to their in-game physics engine are phenomenal. Whenever I play AC, it DOES feel like I'm driving a real car.That said it does just feel like when you play online, you are just competing to show off lap-times so it can get very tiresome if you encounter some of the “professional drivers in Asseto Corsa who take the game extremely seriously..” "

												So as far as realism goes, Very good. Looks over all, Very good. Online mutiplayer, garbage. Carreer mode, meh at best. PROS: Looks very nice while playing. The driving aspect is good through controller and a wheel is best! (DUH)  Tracks are fun, and the variety of cars is great.CONS: I started out with Career mode. Let me tell ya. Borin as hell. No realistic feel what so ever. They are dumb AI. Single line race and easy to predict. Easy to get first place. Dont even have to finish the race. Get in first place and just stop in front of the other cars and watch them retire. Then you can retire and walla.Mutiplayer: (sigh) This is where it all goes wrong! I was hoping for a very fast pace join in and race game. This is not it. Join in and watch peeps screw off is more like it. Trying to get the feel for the track/qualifying is a problem simply due to the other people. There are always people crashing into you for fun.  Starting  a race can take up to 20 mins before any magic starts to happen, and when it finally does start, you got those peeps that are not serious and want to crash. I thought thats what GTA is for. Over all It doesnt take long before I sign into a another game and have a dissapointed view of this game. THE FIX: Dont play this game, Play a different one. (For me at least). My friend who convinced me to get this game say's otherwise.			"

												I love this game. I really do. But I can not recommend this game at all. I bought this game when it was in early access for about $35.00. I have watched this game grow into what it is today and now you can just see greed taking over the developers, I have spent 120+ hours waiting for new cars with every update but now they have DLC. It would be even worse for the people who bought this game now for $55.00.  So on top of the original price tag of $55.00 people still need to pay $17.00 for the dream pack. What an utter display of corporate greed. (They also say that it is their first dream pack that came out and implying that there are going to be more. I'm sorry but no. I just can't recommend it.)

								This is the most realistic racecar simulator at this date. The real next generation in simracing. I've tried every other software possible in my quest to learn driving fast and this comes closest to reality. Even at it's early stage without multiplayer or AI it's a joy to drive around on the beautiful, laser scanned tracks. If you don't like snap oversteering, unexplainable spins and strange car behaviour, give this title a chance. You'll not be disappointed.			"

												This game feels just great. It looks good as well. You get plenty of cars and tracks and probably more in the future. You get the option to modify your car exactly to the way you like it.Is it all great then? No. the penalty system is idiotic. You get your braking wrong and slide of the track and get a 5 second penalty and you must slow down to 50 km/h or lose your throttle for 5 seconds. It also gives you the penalty if some maniac pushes you off the track which is frustrating.Overall I'd say this game is good fun, and if the devs remove the current penalty system it might be the best racing game in the history of the universe ( and whatever was before that ).

								It might lack the 'shiney' of a certain near to release driving game/sim but this has BUCKETLOADS of playability.  The handling of each vehicle so far is amazing.  I have played a lot of driving games, barring full sim games like RFactor, and you really can feel each wheel through the steering wheel.  You can instantly feel which rear wheel is stepping out and can react accordingly before it is to late.  The in cab camera view is spot on.  The way it tilts into the corners is sublime.  It is so well done you don't even notice it, which to me means it is just right.I play this with my G27 with a brake modification and everything just works perfectly.  It is one of the very few driving games I haven't had to spend hours calibrating.I have one very minor gripe, which I add is a personal thing, I find the menu system quite clunky and a little unclear in what you are setting up.  Having said that this game is still in early development and i wouldn't be surprised if this is revised at some point.Absolutely love it.  If you are a fan of driving games this is a MUST.Remember gameplay over shiney is always king. "

												All right I've just redone this review 8/9/2015 at 1:00A.M. Okay so let me put it this way in level of realism from lowest to highest  Project Cars> Assetto Corsa > Iracing. Iracing is in fact the MOST realistic sim out there in terms of physics, handling, and car behaviour in general due to its laser  scanning and ultra realistic tire models so thats what you would get if you were 100% serious about sim racing (I have all 3 of these sims). Unfortunately its not budget having to pay for cars tracks and subscriptions so the next best thing for simmers is this. The physics arent as good as Iracing but they are waaayyy more realistic than Pcars. The graphics also being pretty decent with being slightly better than Iracing (Iracing has AMAZING reflections on the cars). If your just starting out this is good game for you to get into sim racing (YOU NEED A WHEEL TO SIM RACE) if you have something like a G27. I'm not rich so when I upgrade I can't get any direct drive wheels ($2000 each) so I'm getting a fanatec after being in the sim racing community for a while. So I'm going to kinda do a comparison for all of you here of all three games to see what best suits you. I have been playing sim games since GT Legends (thats where I started) so I'm pretty aquainted with racing games by now and you can trust my info on this though this is not my most playes sim racer.   Pcars                              -Best Graphics              -Arcade physics            -Decent Tracks            -Large track variety         -Most Cars (no mods)        -Well modeled cars          -No Mod support                 -Controler recomended   -Offline play              -Decent Price -Good for fun   Assetto Corsa  -Middle Graphics-Semi Sim physics-Decent tracks-Decent track Variety-2nd most cars (no mods) -Well modeled cars-Mod support-Controler not recomended-Offline Play -Decent Price-Good for begining simmers   Iracing-Worst graphics (of the three)-Full blown sim physics-Laser scanned tracks (realistic)-Decent Track Variety- Least cars (No mods)-Extremely detailed cars-No mod support-Controler Not recomended-No offline play-Expensive-Good for experienced simmersI hope this helped all who read have a better grasp on these games to make a wise decision on what they shoudl buy based on what they need and what these three sims have to offer. If you found this helpful please give me a thumbs up so others can see. Thank you for reading and I hope all of you have fun out there racing!			"

												This review is more for controller users:Assetto Corsa is nothing short of fantastic. Physics are phenomenal, even at an alpha state. Graphics are very good, and the gameplay customisibility(modding support) are just great bonuses to the game. I have tried this out on a G27 on my friends account and the steering wheel is obviously the preferred way to play this game. Nothing will match that in terms of preciseness and accuracy to actually driving the real thing.Now for controllers. I have an Xbox One controller. When I first played the game, it gave me the CPU occupency level of over 95%. I can tell that it's just a bug and the work around for it, while it is tedious, is completely fine. Just set the Xbox One Controller as a steering wheel and manually map out the commands. Xbox 360 Controllers already have a profile so it's good to go, but if you have an Xbox One controller, it's best to manually set it up, until the future patches come in enabling full support of the XOne. Gameplay with the controller : This game is just straight up difficult with the controller unless you sink in a lot of hours, fiddle with the setup and find a good setup. I am about 3-6 seconds slower than a wheel time that I see on YouTube on Monza, depending on the car. Keep in mind this should get better once I understand the corners, braking points, and set ups to how the cars work as I move forth with the game. Is the game playable with the controller? Simple answer: Yes. There are people who say it isn't but it is playable. You just need to have patience and fiddle with the settings ALOT to find your ""cup of tea."" After that, you will get better. I assure you. If you buy this game and you have a controller, be patient. Don't give up. Stay focused on your driving and be ready to troubleshoot your errors like no other. This is an amazing driving simulator. It is not an arcade game. Give feedback to the developers about your controller settings and just keep on at it. You will learn to love this game. I know itWheel users, do yourself a favor and buy this game. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this review. You shouldn't have been reading it. You have a wheel. This is a simulator. It's like PB and J, Cookies and Cream, Cheese and Pizza. If you're not into that stuff, just know this. Your wheel will love the game more than you do.9/10 (Due to controller support but it should be fixed in the upcoming patches).Happy Driving :)***Edit as of 12/23/2014*** The game is out as a 1.00 release, and while to some, it doesn't feel like a complete release, it is definitely WAYYY better than it was when I did this review. The controller issue got fixed for me so the game is a beauty to play. This is a must have for driving enthusiasts.			"

												A great all around package, boasting some of the best road cars around, flashy yet crisp graphics, and a very good looking UI compared to the competitors. It's not the top simulation on the market, but it is a great stepping stone for those looking to move beyond simcade games into something  more realistic. While playable with a contrroller, you definitely want a full force feedback wheel to get the most out of this one. Below I will go over the pros and cons in a bit more detail:Pros    -the graphics look fantastic, and it isn't too demanding on your PC to get a beautiful looking race environment            - the physics, while not mind blowing, are more than sufficient to provide decent racing, and fun driving, particularly the road cars. Definitely leaps and bounds above what gran Turismo, Forza and PCars are doing in this department             -the car selection is great. While other games have done race cars to death, Assetto Corsa has the best selection of road cars around, from Ferraris to Mustangs and everything in between. It also has race cars, but the road cars really stand out, and with the above average physics and great graphics, it really makes for a truly immersive experience              -the laser scanned tracks are extremely detailed and stunning to look at, really bringing the experience together-BEST.DRIFTING.ANYWHERE......yes, you can drift here. Yes, it is awesome               -Force feedback isn't the best on the market by any means, but it gives you a good idea of what your car is doing and will help you master the art of controlling it. Still, above average and better than most everything other than GSCE and RFactor 2                -Updates. Kunos is always updating and improving Assetto Corsa, along with releasing more content. We are on Tire Model 7, and have had 3 dlc packs, free content, and have more being relesed all the time. Japan pack today!!!               -The mods. This title has a great modding community behind it, many modders carried over from RFactor, who put out tons of quality content. The mods work great here, and much of the time are indistinguishable from stock content Cons     -The sounds are far from perfect, and a greater range is needed (a bit bland, need to work on the highs and lows for the growls and whines of real cars). UPDATE: The Japan pack is a step in the right direction, and with a high quality set of headphones, they actually have quite decent range             -The AI started off as some of the worst anywhere, slow and stupid. They have since greatly improved, but they still need a good bit of work. Sometimes they are randomly aggressive, but can end up in a train, ""racing"" single file if your unlucky. It's hard to find a good match for your skill level, 98% I beat them on most tracks, 100% and I rarely see them beyond lap 3             -The online competition. I can't really fault Kunos for this, but while better than the Gran Turismo/Forza crowd, you still do get a lot of noobs and wreckers. I think it's mostly because, as I mentioned before, Assetto Corsa is used as a stepping stone from racing games to true simulations. Maybe I am just spoiled  from iRacing and RFactor 2 Leagues, but I am yet to have a race where half the field is still racing by lap 5. It could really do with a skill matching/ranked racing system.As you see, the pros far outweigh the cons, and Assetto Corsa is a worthy purchase for any sim racer or car afficianado. With a sense of realism foreign to most gamers, it will have you kicking the backend around corners and fighting to gain each second. It still is far from perfect, and I still prefer RFactor 2 physics, and iRacing's competitive racing, but to just hop in a dream car like a Ferrari 458 or Corvette Stingray and tear up the track, Assetto Corsa reigns supreme. And with the constant inprovements, updates and new content being released all the times, who knows what the future of this title holds.  A solid 8/10 from me.			"

												I'm not a big gamer, I only ever play the Nurburgring, I use a Logitech G25 with separate shifter and pedals. I'm in my mid 40's with a family so can't spend day in day out practicing. I've driven the real Nordschleife 'tourist' circuit in a Jaguar XF Sport with other real cars on track too. (I'd like to see complete random cars on track, that start in random positions of the circuit when you do a free practice for added realism!) I got this game on early access (and spent most of my time on Monza until the Nurburgring made it's glorious appearance.) So this review is ONLY based on a comparison for aforementioned track. I run a Crossfire R290 reference setup on a 32GB Asus ROG Tytan (i7-4970)  so graphically, my setup should handle anything and everything I throw at it. Assetto Corsa looks great, Project CARS looks a bit greater however the ForceFeedback on PCars is awful. AC on the other hand gets it spot on. Touch a rumble strip in AC, you rumble. Touch a rumble strip in PCars, nothing. (most of the time.)

												I'm not a big gamer, I only ever play the Nurburgring, I use a Logitech G25 with separate shifter and pedals. I'm in my mid 40's with a family so can't spend day in day out practicing. I've driven the real Nordschleife 'tourist' circuit in a Jaguar XF Sport with other real cars on track too. (I'd like to see complete random cars on track, that start in random positions of the circuit when you do a free practice for added realism!) I got this game on early access (and spent most of my time on Monza until the Nurburgring made it's glorious appearance.) So this review is ONLY based on a comparison for aforementioned track. I run a Crossfire R290 reference setup on a 32GB Asus ROG Tytan (i7-4970)  so graphically, my setup should handle anything and everything I throw at it. Assetto Corsa looks great, Project CARS looks a bit greater however the ForceFeedback on PCars is awful. AC on the other hand gets it spot on. Touch a rumble strip in AC, you rumble. Touch a rumble strip in PCars, nothing. (most of the time.) PCars offers more in the way of variety and content (a lot more to be honest) but if I'm after a quick(ish) lap of my favourite track, I come back to AC.

												I have change my mind about this game for several reasons. This game is NOT complete, if you have brought it wanting and expecting a £35.00 (At the time of writing) game, then you are going to be dissapointed. Don't let them fool you this IS still in early acsess.A list of things that are broken:Most conserningly for a 'complete' game, the A.I is the worst I have seen in a racing game in along time. They do not know where you are on the track, and will in effect ram you off the road by overtaking in the worst points. This also means that the career is only possible if you are on easy and some kind of God. Also it makes any race very annoying. I may not be the greatest driver, but getting more than third in most races in impossible.The down-shifting is broken. It will wait untill the car is at 3000 RPM untill it changes down.You need a wheel, otherwise it is unplayable, meaning it in NOT a relaxing game to sit down and play.There are some, good things, one major thing is that the handling physics ARE good, but you will only get 20 hours gameplay max from hot-lapping.My outcome is that this game is to damn expencive.(P.S I do relise that the dev's put alot of hard word into this game, and I think that this game, whilst in my OPINION is not the greatest at the moment this COULD be an exquisit game. It just not worth £35.00 yet. I will continue following this game and I will change this Review when the next big update comes out)Also my wheel's rotation sensor is broken, but this is the ONLY game in my Steam game list that does not fix this temporarly, meaning on this game, 90% of the time I have to go through long lists to get force feedback working properly, taking sometimes upto 30 mins to fix this, EVEN GTA 5 DOES THIS!

								Updated: 12 Feb, 2016Here I will put some changes that I saw:Graphics is now excellent. The blurred image was a bad configuration setup. The environment could be better but in general is great.More cars avaible! Ok, we need to pay DLC, but its not expensive.Carrer mode is not so exciting but its ok.Dirigibility is improvedIA is much much better (not perfect)!Still my favorite simulator!!! 2nd one is Dirt Rally.Posted: 25 Nov, 2013 @ 8:00pm	Buy this game ! Especially if you like simulators !This game has all the quality I was hoping for a simulator, a few points I raised :Sound : Awesome, I liked the sound of cars, environments , incredible detail .Graphics: Still needs to be polished, the game is heavy yet, the image is blurred and the track is missing more texture detail.Cars and tracks Laser scanned !Many cars are coming, we have cars from lower classes or supercars for all tastes, even F1 cars and antique cars ! Very detailed , each with its unique driveability !Dirigibility ( turning point ) : I loved the simulator , I can feel the cars perfectly in my hands ( G27 ) , something that I was waiting for is the H gear with clutch(like real life) and this game has!We now have career mode in a simulator on PC ! Always wanted a game with career mode on PC and now we have !Uncomplicated : You can increase the complexity of the game by setting the car the way you prefer , but if you simply enjoy running without spending hours and hours configuring every car on every track you can too!It is amazing , love it! I am doing this review because he really liked this game and want to support this development .I made this review based on experience in the following games :GT Legends , GT , GTR , GTR 2 , GTR Evolution , RACE 07 and all expansions , RaceRoom Racing Experience, Gran Turismo 5 , Richard Burn Rally with RSRBR 2013 FIA WRC 4 WRC 3 , Project CARS , F1 2013 Game Stock Car 2012 GRID 1 , 2 , DIRT 1,2,3 , Euro Truck Simulator 2 , rFactor 1 ( very little )			"

												Profile says ~150 hours on record but believe me with Steam offline, it's well over 2000.I'll attempt to explain what I like and dislike about the game.Great WIP game for $30. Once it's polished up & bugs ironed out(which will take a considerable amount of time), it will be worthy of $60 even if you're not that into sim racing. Just cruising on the roads, keeping the car straight,  heel-and-toe downshifting to keep the rear in-check and pull out with speed is believeable and exhilarating. If you can drive. The sensation of speed is amazing. But if you are into sim racing what are you waiting for? pick this up and start hotlapping like your life depends on it!I must however note, regarding the price: Be prepared to pay even more if you want to race online with more people because of DLC limitations. Yes, most people race with the DLC so if you want to race them, you'll need to buy the official DLC just to be in the same lobby. Alternatively, if people are racing with only base content and modded content, you'll have to guess where to download it from...most cases...Racedepartment website...otherwise (rarely) I have no clue.I must also note as far as AC as a ""game"" is concerned, isn't stellar. If you're one to play racing games for the Career you might want to look elsewhere, you might. Bit boring in presentation, & lacks any sort of narrative(currently) that said, it does have a few modes: Career, Drag Race, Drift, Special Events, Race Weekend, Time attack, Hotlap, Quick Race, Practice. I find myself racing and qualifying online exclusively and when there isn't a lobby I like with 2 or 3 others I head back and play Quick Race exclusively, sharpening my driving technique and playing around because modded tracks and cars was a huge selling point for me. For the other modes I do use: Drift needs work with the points system and Special Events is actually fun, and there are many many events to challenge you and keep you racing. Drag is pretty good too; The AI is a challenge and there is a working tree! I'd like for there to be a Drags mode online with special drag slicks. That would be something brilliant.Pros:Excellent graphics-Cars are highly detailed with full interior detail and tracks are fantastic also. Doesn't require as good a computer as most thought this is because it is a well optimised game. Medium Gaming Rig can run at 40FPS solid. You can tweak/turn off many things to gain performance.Great physics & getting better. Arguably BEST driving physics on the market.  There is however almost no external damage to the cars in Assetto Corsa. BeamNG takes the cake for crash physics(yes you should pick up that game if you're a die-hard crasher with a top PC. Shoutout to crashers: stay away from Assetto Corsa pls and if you need online crashing pickup Wreckfest, second-best crash physics with online. You won't regret it I promise.).Good selection of cars, around 40 cars come with the base game. Most the phsyics for these are solid aswell.You can tweak the usual things for a car before racing including tyre type, PSI pressure(all 4 tyres), dampers (compression, extension and fast), springs, ARB, packer rate, travel range, camber, toe, height, power & turbo power limit, brake bias, downforce, gear ratios & final, etc.FULL support of mods including modable UI, sounds, vehicles, tracks...the list goes on...Big selling point. And there are plenty of mods being pushed out by the community. I can imagine this game reaching RFactor levels of modding in 2 or 3 years.(only issue is some mods can be broken with new updates...with some creators updating their mods..others abandoning them)Great offline replay mode, with extensive photomode built-in. You can also view various telemetry data in realtime including tyre heat levels and driver inputs.Lots of customising in the options, view angle, FOV, supports VR devices, audio levels: master, engine, opponents, wind, surfaces, tyre skid, UI etc etc You can even download some theme mods that change the whole look of the menu with new icons and menu design for AC!Good FFB as of now.Supports multiple Steering Wheels with tweakingSupports Xbox360 controller, keyboards and mouse racing (None of these should be used for this sim)Great selection of tracks. Most are even Laser-scanned. No complaints in this department. Everything is STUNNING and true-to-life. Exceptions being the 5 or so fictional tracks, which are still well made. My favourite fictional is Black Cat County Long. Blast to cruise on and race.AI drivers are much improved and only getting better. They now make offline races a blast.The sounds of most cars are rich and lively but you have to use the cockpit view to get the best experience. Room for improvement.The assettocorsa.net forum is generally helpful in sorting out issues, with some users even helping you find problems when Kunos staff are busy.You can tweak your race lots: Time, AI strength (80% to 110 I think), laps, track grip, track temperature, time cycle, penalties, in addition to selecting the opponents' cars and how many of them. You can also choose your placement in the grid, and electronic aids on/off: ABS, TC, Stability control. Online servers have exclusive options to server admins: setting tyre/fuel/damage wear rate and track grip by percent as well as forcing the electronic aids on or off.Cons:Online still needs work, but it's looking good so far. It does need polishThere is no replay save button in online.Very limited, annoyingly, almost non-existent spectator mode in onlineCars pinging off others even at small contactsNot many American cars. 90% European with some Japanese(most is DLC). Not exactly a con but the only American cars we have is the Corvette C7, C7R, Shelby Cobra 427 and the new Mustang. Please add at least two more american cars for variety and competiton. A Viper, Saleen S281 SC and the sexy new Ford GT are my suggestions. Though it won't hurt to add race-spec versions of some these cars too.Criticisms:FFB still needs work but so far it's great. Few more sliders should make it top 5 in sim racing. Almost as good as LFS if you setup everything just right.Updates only adding/fixing new content rather than fixing online bugs and improving online for the players.Not allowing non-DLC players to play against DLC players. I get that you disable the DLC cars for offline but as is it's dividing the community and forcing people to play on only the newest content when they're online. The number of people racing on the base content is declining very quiclky and nearly phased out, much to my dissapointment. Some cars have very little tweaking options, whereas others have a plethora of options to setup. I get the SLS doesn't have adjustable gears, brake balance and Ride height IRL but it would be nice to just check a box and suddenly all tuning options are avaliable across all cars. Would be neat for online racing different setups. Needs built-in leaderboards for time trials, best laps, replays, ghosts and races etc.  You can download an app for this but it should be in the menus with the base game.Could do with some more server options in multiplayer. Like seamless weather transitions and ballast positioning(front to rear percent) to a car, rather than BAM 200kg to the whole car.Could do with a quick manual on how to get started with KsEditor(track importing & editing, AI and replay camera editing tool required to get a new, upcoming mod car/track working in game) and other programs, rather than throwing it out there and expecting the community to figure it all out, help each other and document everything.Would like the ability to select a different tyre compound for the front or rear tyres.

												Oh I have been searching for a simulator like this a long time.It has great Force Feedback support. So i can finally drift properly because this game has also one of the best driving models i have ever seen. It feels so good to drive Lotus 49 on Monza from '66. And try to beat that unbeatable time record. If you love driving for fun go for it. If you want awesome multiplayer experience... This is where the game is not that good. Penalty system is really bad. You just get for a bit of track and you get 5 seconds penalty. In wich you are unable to accelerate or you can drop down to 50km/h and then go on full throttle again. The race as itself in multiplayer doesn't look even like a normal race. Yes, everyone starts from grid. But the race itself is based on time. I think that on one side it's nice idea. But they should atleast give us a feature to make that normal race in wich depends your position. Because that makes your choices limited. In that case you cant just do in one lap stupidities. Then man up. Just teleport back to pits. and then go the fastest lap and simply win. I want that exciting moment in wich I fight for first place.Another problem, drivers... I mean in online. The AI are still a bit dull because they ram you same like normal players. ""Oh, gotta brake a little, this turn is sharp."" And at this moment some jackass bounces from your side to go as fast as he can and you end up in a haystack... And in the end they kick you for staying in way... So, one thing. If you are not gonna play online with your friends. I suppose don't play online. Of course I'm not saying that you shouldn't buy this game. If you are only thinking about it... Go for it! Now! You can customize cars suspension, aerodynamics. Brake bias. Engine limiter, so you can take it to insane RPM's and the engine will hate itself during shifts. Oh, I love this game. Even though i got just 20.4 hours right now. But It's mostly because I'm bored of taking my wheel on table and back to the side. I'd have like 50 hours right know. (And it's also because I play a lot of games, not just one. I'll get bored other way)+ I love to hear that the game is still being furthermore developed. The new dream pack sounds really like dream. In the trailer you can see McLaren P1, Lamborghini, but for me, there is Alfa Romeo 4C. I love that car. The flag system is finally coming, no more crashers/rammers! :D The weather/winter is coming (not sure if winter is gonna be available but I had to do that)AI are getting an updateJust get this game if you LOVE sims. Come on, it is truly awesome.			"

												Update now that it's out of early access:-Damage now added but it's too sensitive (bumpdraft to your rear breaks your windscreen)-Pitstops are in but only in multiplayer-Still lacking any sort of flag rules-Weather and night time doesn't seem to be on the roadmap nor do the devs seem interested in doing so-Multiplayer netcode seems to have imrpoved quite a bit. -Still a fairly limited amount of cars and tracks, though lots of new content coming out and metric ton of mods available-Even though FMOD is now in, sounds are still lackluster and fairly poor-AI still dumber than a sack of rocks-FFB feels muddy compared to other simsFor a 1.0 release it feels slightly underwhelming with all the hype surrounding it. The lack of penalites/flag rules make it unsuitable for league racing. It's fantastic for pick up races and cruising however.As much as I like it, there's not much reason to choose AC over any other racing sim out there currently.-Multiplayer? iRacing-Offline racing? Game Stock Car or RaceRoom-Physics & FFB? Game Stock Car or rFactor 2-Fantastic audio, and immersion? RaceRoom-Graphics? pCars or Assetto Corsa (though I think AC wins this one)It has a lot of potential going for it and the devs seem dedicated so I would still recommend it. tl;dr CORNETTO CORSA 8/10 IT'S OKAY---EA REVIEW BELOWStill early in development and missing some features you'd see in other sims (pitstops + limiters, working headlights, damage, etc) but extremely promising. Physics are top notch and FFB feels amazing. With more content and fixes (I'M LOOKING AT YOU MULTIPLAYER NETCODE), this could be very well the much needed spiritual successor to man kinds greatest GT racer, GTR2. Oh and the modability of this game is stupidly amazing.tl;drCornetto Corsa 9/10 BRETTY GUD			"

								I really thought twice to buy this game, but then I watched videos reviewing this game and I decided to give it a chance. One of the best decisions I took this year. The game is awesome, so far the closer real ""feeling"" of driving I've experienced. All cars, including the slower ones, are so damn nice to drive. Even being alone in the track I can keep playing with the same car in the same road for hours. Feels better and better every lap. Great game, I'm pretty sure this game will kick♥♥♥♥♥when it comes out.			"

												If I'm being totally honest......*suspense*Assetto Corsa is an absolutely incredible racing simulator - not an arcade game, simulator.First off, the physics (if you are playing with a wheel) are just insane. While racing on the Nurburgring (or any other track for that matter), it's almost as if you can feel the suspension movement of the car through your wheel. 10/10 from me.Secondly, the graphics... oh, the graphics. They are so good. Now I may be slightly biased because I play in 4k, but my god, are they good. The reflections, the detail of the exterior and interior, the mirrors, lights, etc. are just inches away from being the same as real life. I can't even imagine how good this game is with VR. Another 10/10 from me.Thirdly, the customization. Once you load into a server, whether it is private or online, you can change everything from the tire pressure to the fuel in your tank to the camber to the ride height... there is just so much. Granted, you cannot customize your car with upgrades and ultimately personalize it, but hey, this isn't Forza guys. This game is focused on simulation, not arcade. Also allow me to mention the fact that all of the gauges inside the vehicle work, like the coolant temperature, fuel, and so on and so forth. Another 10/10 from me (in terms of realism, not arcade).Next, allow me to mention the price. 30 dollars?!?! 30 dollars?!?!?!?! You'd think Kunos is going mad for releasing such a good game for such a steal.Also, Kunos has been killin' it with the dlc. Every dlc pack is of the highest quality, and they will keep releasing content for much, much longer. I mean this game is far from being complete.The only downside about this game is the singleplayer, which could be better but I'm sure they will fix that in the future.Overall, I think Assetto Corsa is a very good simulator, and beats the pants off Project: Cars. I would certainly recommend it to anybody with a wheel who is looking for a great racing game on PC. "

												After almost five months of should I buy this & after spending hrs reading people coments on half  dozen forums.The problem being is it a sim or arcade  do the cars handle correctly is the sound any good & so on.Now one thing I do understand about the sim people is the age old debate on what is sim or not , its been like that from day one.So simply asking around led to the same mixed bag of  pros & cons.So in the end I decided to do my own research instead of the endless real sim debate.In the end I pick this over the like of RF2 / Race Room & I-Racing.Not that I dislike any of the others , however that said I can not agree with both I-racing & RaceRooms use of Micro sale DLC system.I also know of both sims before AC so I understand how long & how much work it as taken to get to this point from one person to todays still small team.You can feel the passion that as gone into making this Simulation & it offer a lot more in the future without need to buy a state of the hart PC to run it.People have pointed out the sounds are not that good , & for the most part I think they are wrong , I mean ok some bits need to be worked on.But that can be said of lots of little bits , however AC as kept things simple I find the menus system very good & clear , there is all the setting & tweaks to keep any hard core simmer busy , while at the same time you can just jump in & play out of the box so to speak.I did  however find a lack of manuel a bit of a oversite , but they have a very good forum where you can find most stuff out.There are also  mods & apps of all sorts that can be added to improve game play.The sim feature the now standard challenges & events along with pratice & a racing & online mode.Ok one of the biggest issue I can see is the AI its not the worst ever but not the best to & makes racing intresting if not frustrating.But like all those issues listed by others here they will be fixed or added given time.Given the scale of the jump made here by the develope by moving into a crowded market as the PC Sim racing market is & producing  very high quality sim that cn hold its own with at least three of the above.Having tested Rfactor 2  & Raceroom  they are a little different but not by much in my eyes anyhow.I lie the fact that AC's Developers have not gone for Flashy menus & stupid voice overs & kept it simply above driving.If they just keep adding Cars & improving the core & not start wasting time adding pointless flashy cut screens  & new mneus interfaces.What they have made so far I find fantastic its plays well it looks good & it runs well & even mods seem to work very well.I think the Future is looking very good for AC & its evolutions . Its was so nice to have a sim that tooks with dowloading to first drive about 1 hr very much plug and play not some thing I am use to with Sims of the past.I have not problems recomending this one to any one that enjoys having fun in cars of all types.But please understand that it is an ongoing development very much like Euro trucks 2 & a few other game out their that go along this type of constant development fase.So to those who say its no finished or this and that is missing . So what I have faith that all these things will come given time & that sometimes its better to wait & get  better overall product than some thing that says its as everything from days one & then falls way sort of the mark.For me a must haave product that will grow in a time scale that allows both the developers & the end user to get several years enjoyment from it with out braking the bank for new hardware .Very much a 9 from me & not at all over hyped as some would say.

								It is early access but at this moment Assetto Corsa is better than 90% of PC race games! Close to real car feeling, quick responsivenes of controller (I'm using xbox360 conroller), good graphics. Main lacks are: AI, damage model and multiplayer. But hey!, it's 0.4 version. If you want to test your skills, fight with yourself trying to beat best time - this early build is for you.Car handling in my opinion is better than in SHIFT2 and SimBin games (Race 07, RaceRoom). You can feel every angle of a track. Every car is different and it takes time to learn how to drive it. Also you have to learn every single track or you will spend more time on the roadside. At this moment AC shows its all pros. You just want to learn. Sit in one car on one track and drive for several hours until reach perfect lap.Xbox game pad gives much joy (I don't have race wheel) even with almost all aids off. Force feedback effect works perfectly. Also responsiveness of analog stick and sensivity of LT RT are very good.Graphics and sound depends on taste but I like them.Assetto Corsa is closer to Race 07 than SHIFT2 but I think it defeats them both.I have no comparision to Project C.A.R.S. so I can't tell which game is better. Definitely Assetto is one of the best despite of early stage.			"

								i regularly visit the nürburgring and hockenheimring for trackdays and played many racing games like gtr2, race 07, Gran turismo, forza, project cas... but assetto corsa is the best simulation in terms of handling and realism.If you have a wheel for the game you don´t need time to adept because it instantly feels familiar.It makes a lot of fun even if you are just trying to beat your laptime. You can clearly feel a difference between the handling of the cars.It has mod support and even it is in early access stage you can download tracks like the famous nordschleife.Drifting is a lot of fun too but i think the fly off handbrake needs an update because it is very hard to initiate the drift long ahead of a corner. The game may not have the variety of forza or GT but if you love realistic handling this simracer is the best you can get "

												Second to none tire wear and track grip simulation, good selection of cars and tracks. Outstanding quality for a game made by 12 people. Server browser is in severe need of some polish but that is a lesser priority right now. Porsche license is the first one for a true racing sim in decades. Community is a good one. The modding scene is fairly large. Good things are on the horizon for Assetto Corsa, with the addition of the Porsche 919 Hybrid 2015 and 2016 LMP1 cars, as well as the Audi R18 LMP1 car, and the Toyota TS040 LMP1 car. Many different types of racing to be had, from 90's DTM to modern F1. Assetto Corsa blows the competition away, especially from a price standpoint. 9.5/10			"

												Top of the line Racing Sim. First class development team. No tricks, gimmicks or confusing paywalls, just pure driving with the most desired exotics, racing and street class cars available. Plenty of challenge scenarios including Drag racing, hotlapping and drifting etc. Or just create your own race with the AI.PROS:- Realism / Graphics / Modding community / Brand licensing / Multiplayer / Gameplay / Controller support / VR support / Triple monitor support / Reliability / ValueCONS:- Lack of dynamic weather, but unless you want to pick apart details such as personal preferences in regards to UI or what it might not have in regards to content vs some arcade game, then I would really be hard pressed to find any cons.  In fact, Assetto Corsa is extremely optimized and runs smooth. It doesn't require a constant internet connection, subscriptions, or overpriced content. The game has been advancing since launch, always improving with every update whether it's adding textures to tracks, or improving physics, or adding quality content. Heck, they even give you free content....  Kunos Simulazioni has raised the bar.  All other sims should take notes.* Also worth mentioning is the fact that you can pretty much tailor this game to how you wish via the modding possibilities, as they are endless.10/10  I will drive the F1's, Ferrari's, Lamborghini's, Audi's, Chevy's, Ford's, Mazerati's, Porsche's, Toyota's, etc, etc, etc. AGAIN!

												This is the ultimate Racing Sim on PC right now, hands down. The physics are superb, graphics are surprisingly great, the mod support is overwhelming and the community is awesome! It doesn't matter what kind of racing you like, whether it's Formula 1, GT3, Rally, Drifting (like me) or just normal track days, AC has it all! The track selection is on the smaller side but with mods you can easily triple the amount of tracks in the game!The game has all the settings you'd ever want, support for almost every steering wheel under the sun and car setups that even beginner drivers can understand and tweak to their liking.Overall this is my favourite game of all time, I play this game almost every single day and I've never NOT enjoyed myself!10/10 from me :)			"

												This is a simulator, if you've played Forza 4 and want something more on PC this is the right place to come for the racing and drifting. Car clubs will be on separate forums and designing livery will we on separate software. There is little to no car upgrades and no rims to change, unless that comes in the future. But if you focus on more racing, own a Logitech g27 or better wheel, yep, you've come to the right place. Things will be a bit new and unfamiliar at first before the grip, handling and tuning menus start shining through and you immerse your self in mastering the cars.The modding community alone could make this game gigantic in the future. Gigantic in the sense that you could focus on one little area of racing and find hundreds if not thousands that enjoy the same class, tracks, time period and mode of competition. Promising is just the tip of the iceberg.			"

								BRAVO guys, very well done. It seems like you've struck a perfect balance between playability and realism. Physics are beautifully fluid and rewarding, unlike iRacing which seems a bit over the top with their signature death wiggle. Sound effects are amazing and comparing with iRacing AC cars sound alive. Graphics, I prefer iRacing style, AC seems somewhat sterile and artificial a bit like Grand Turismo. BTW on that note, I hope that once AC introduce multiplayer it won't turn into a console type of racing. Please make it more like iRacing where idiots have no chance of surviving.			"

								Even though this game is still in its early stages it is completely worth getting.  The game is absolutely gorgeous.  Best looking racing game I have ever seen by far but that is coming from a consol background of every GT game and Forza game.  I can't wait to play the full game.  Pros: Most realistic driving simulator I have played.  The contorls are fluid and I just recently got a steering wheel just for playing games like this.  It is a great challenge and I have learned alot.  The steering wheel feel is heavy and feels real.  Cons:At the moment the only one that I have any problem with is the AI.  I physically cannot finish a race without an AI wrecking me most of the time in the first or second turn.  They are working on this diligently and have made some progress since I got the game.  As for getting it while its in early access, I would recomend this to everyone to get a good feel of what a racing game should feel like.			"

It is still developed on and is getting better. You can race it without a wheel but beware if you get it you will want to get a wheel because you will know how much more fun it will be.Ac is just amazing at what it does, absoloutly a must buy!Highlights of whats coming this year:-4x4 wheel drive-torque vectoring-Nordschleife laserscanned and 3 other tracks-Mclaren P1 and loads of other cars			"

												I tried all simulators on the market except for the iRacing. Assetto Corsa is my pick without a doubt the physics/tire model/handling, graphics, and amazing content makes it best simulator on the open market. The 1.5 update show's how beautiful the game is going further and further. The only aspect which is drastic problem for the game and would change it 360 degree is online racing system, things like better flags, more realistic/playable penalties and also small staff like rolling start and let say pit-stop drive penaltie for crash, this would make Assetto Corsa online experience as close to perfectness as possible which is my dream.

												PRO'S- probably the best hotlapping simulator out there- accurate car physics and tire model- laser scanned tracks- detailed cars- accurate car sounds- moddability- amount of mods (tracks, cars & apps); some mods equal or best official content (some even get bought by the developers)- ability to set password and blacklist for your own serverCONS- racing AI; bad awareness and won't overtake each other, don't show any human behaviour (alternatives: rFactor2)- worthless career mode because of it's crappy AI- small car selection (alternatives: console racers like Forza and GT)- small track selection (solved by going to racedepartment and/or official forums and downloading all the mod tracks that interest you, installing mods is as easy as copying a folder into the tracks or cars folder)- barely any visual damage; body parts don't fly off after heavy contact- dissapointing damage model overall; sometimes small contact causes just too much damage to be believable- interface is confusing at first- lack of official servers, dedicated servers require knowledge and suitable hardware or you'd have to rent one- small development team, which reflects in the lack of communication about updates (there's no community manager) and slow improvements- no track rotation in a server without booking, online racing either requires you to rejoin the server after a restart for a different track or to join a different server- skinning (designing liveries) requires Photoshop (or equivalent), skill in that software and patience- no weatherRECOMMENDED- get a wheel to enjoy the Force Feedback (FFB) and physics at its finest- join a league or community (example: our community etcc.ridedomain.com), or dive into actively moderated servers you can find at the official forums (Marty's Aussie server/ALOOG/Minolin/etc)- download track and car mods (and apps if you need 'm)- set up your frame of view using frame of view calculators (search for them on the web)- a decent internet connection if you're planning to race online (check your ping and most of all, package loss)I'm recommending this because the pro's vastly outweigh the cons for me.

Early Access Review
								Since this is one of the rare moments Simracing reaches the general public, let me tell a bit about the setting around the game before actually reviewing it.I consider myself a pretty serious simracer. That comes with it's perks: I have a great group of friends who share my passion. So, I had to buy this game (Peer pressure, yay!) and when I fired it up, I wasn't dissapointed.To those wh don't know: The last proper simracing game (Not counting Iracing since it's subscription based and therefore has no real release date) is from 2007 (CARS is too arcadey), which is Race 07 and costs 3 euro's on Steam.The game is easy to get used to for a simracer who knows what he's doing. In the controls menu, you'll find the regular settings, and a configuration tool to help the clueless.So far, there's no AI (The makers hope to release that in the next update partially) and no multiplayer, which leaves you to do special events, drag race, drift, practice, and hot lap around several tracks, including Monza and Imola. The tracks look lovely and feel realistic. The same goes for the cars; The cars feel real, which is exactly what simracers as myself want.I could see this becoming an E-sports game if the multiplayer is well executed, and it's great to see the attention this game has gotten.People who like features like rewinding are probably going to end up dissapointed, because this is pure simracing. 1 big mistake, and you're out. There's not a respawn option like FPS games have.			"

												While I'd like to see more cars and tracks, which there probably will be, I still enjoy the game. This is the closest racing game to forza on PC (It's physics are more realistic but still..).  There are many car tuning options like gearing,aero,tire compound,etc.  There are also some great mods out for this game.  All in all, I say it's worth it			"

								Best racer I've ever played.Realistic car handling, force-feedback and beautiful graphics.  Playing other (good) driving sims just doesn't seem the same any more; I'm always thinking ""Nah, this bit's better in Assetto!"".It's still in beta at the time of writing, but it's looking like it'll be a classic - even the interface is a joy!

												Assetto Corsa has made waves, as of late, for its hyper realistic handling physics along with its track accuracy. The developer, Kunos Simulazioni, has laser scanned each featured track for ultra-precision. In my opinion the addition of better Ai and added depth to multiplayer would make this game perfect, still its my personal top choice for a PC racing sim.			"

												I'm not sure why I bought this game... maybe it was that little shinning hope that when it does come out of early access it would be a brand new amazing game. Every time I play this game I remind myself how bare bones and awful it is. I honestly don't know why the community holds this game up in such high regards.Not all is bad I mean there's plenty of things to like the number one thing being the physics model it's fun amazing and engaging. There's tonnes of graphics and user options to mess around with which is great, there's also plenty of support for controllers and wheels. There's a decent single player campaign and a fun multiplayer but that's as far as  it goes for me when it comes to the good stuff.Now the bad considering I paid around $40 back when it was in early access and it now has only like 16 tracks and about 40-50 cars... an embarrassing line up of cars at that too, not to mention half the cars are just the same damn♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways and the rest of the good stuff is behind paid DLC. The menus are clunky and more often than not you run into bugs. There is still only 3 good modes more like 2 good modes hot lap, time attack and *cough* ""shitdriftmode"" *cough* and to top it off this game doesn't even try to add Steam Workshop considering its only saving grace is ♥♥♥♥ing mods.I'm honestly shocked how people actually want this... is this what the community wants? Just a nice physics driven game with a huge lack of content? I'm honestly ashamed to even own this game, if the only thing this game has going for it is the physics than I rather look elsewhere for a game with actual content.			"

												I really want to like this game, great driving, good mod support, good graphics, just lots of good. But the game is yet to feel finished, they realised the first DLC recently, and I was thinking to myself, ""what? That's absurd! You can't release DLC for an Early Access game!"" So I went to the store page and found that the game wasn't in Early Access anymore.And this is the meat of my issues with this game, it's contentless. There's a miniscule number of cars, and a tiny number of tracks, and this would be ok, if the game was $30 dollars, but it's $50, almost full price, yet, there isn't enough to warrant the price.I feel jipped when I play this game, yeah, there are mods, but when a game's best feature is something someone else has done, then there is a problem.This asking price is also annoying for those of us (like myself) who have a limited budget, when I first purchased this game for $30 dollars, I felt a little ripped off, but I thought to myself, ""don't worry, they'll add more content."" Yet they haven't, and I still feel like I've been had. Despite me paying almost half then the current asking price, I still don't feel like I've got a good deal. If I'd purchased this game for $50, I'd probably be ripping my hair out currently. Yes, this game has a lot of good points, but due to the fact that there is a laughably low amount of content in this game, I simply can't recommend this game to anyone who has respect for their money. If you have money coming out of your eye balls, then go ahead, buy it, enjoy a very good simulation of driving, but if you don't, then move on, because this is simply a waste. "

												Could/should have a better multiplayer implementation (and I have faith that Kunos will continue improving it), but as it stands it's the greatest racing simulator ever made.  Great cars, great tracks, incredible physics and graphics.  Sounds of some cars are weak but gradually getting improved with each patch.  To be honest, driving it solo without sound would be a better experience than any other racing sim to date.			"

												Thought this game was too hard when I first started playing it because the cars didn't seem very responsive. The only way I could get round a corner without crashing would be to take it slow, and everyone would overtake me, so I' ended up coming in last. But I realised that actually selecting Pro driver setup, as opposed to Gamer or Racer, actually made it easier. The car is more responsive. I think it's because it turns off things like traction conrol and ABS, which are designed to stablise the car and end up making it too rigid to drive fast. Just thought I'd share my experience, select Pro and this game is awesome. Love the detail and accuracy that's gone into the cars, inside and out. (Now) love the realistic handling. Love the tracks. And love the community. Looking forward to driving all the cars on all the tracks and seeing it develop over time.Update: This game deserves the ""Whoa, Dude"" award because it teleports you (with VR HMD) to a vast array of different cars recreated with precision accuracy and detail. With the right set up this has got to be the closest you will get to the real thing. The tracks are ultra-realistic as well and I'm looking forward to driving one of these cars round one of these tracks in real life to see if I can get the same, or better, lap times.			"

												Before you read the rest of my review please understand i would love to give this a recommendation but at the current time just dont feel i can.Since i purchased this in the early access stage i have tried repeatedly to enjoy this game, yes i believe there should be some enjoyment in playing a simulation and not just tedium. Unfortunately i cant recommend this game except to the most hardened driving simulation fans and even they will suffer at some point from the absolute perfect driving of the A I . This isnt even mentioning when the AI wish to pass you on a corner etc the answer seems to be quite simple - rear end you , this leaves you ( not them at any point i noticed ) careening onto the grass / track edge for a penalty or slow down to 50kmh ( something you would expect to find in an arcade game with catch up enabled! .Unfortunately this games just feels like an exercise in stress. I will commend the team for improving the overall driving experience since the early access but the A I simply hasnt been well adjusted. Another unusual presence in this game is the career mode choices , a time trial just for ""the fun of it"" seems to be thrown into career mode, whilst i can understand this gives you chance to practice the track before engaging in a race so does practice ( thats kind of what its there for ) .I think ultimately the developers need to understand that whilst there are many hardened sim racers out there who will thoroughly enjoy most of this experience they have ultimately sold themselves short by not creating a particularly enjoyable experience.  If you are willing to invest a lot of time of the steep difficulty curve and love racing sims then get it. If you like racing games in general this probably wont be your cup of tea.			"

								One and a half year since my previous reveiw, so thought I would write some more. I only drive this with a wheel and a playseat. I have tried it with an controller, but didn't manage to get a setup I was able to drive with. I have seen others be able to drive with a controller, so there is hope, even tho this game is ment to be played with a wheel.I haven't tested online since it was new, so I can't really tell you anything about the online part, except for that it was qutie buggy when it first came out (a long time ago).But just driving around famous circouts in famous cars is a lot of fun! All the cars need different techniques to get the most out of them, and you really get a sense of mastering the car, the more you drive it. I have many hours, screaming at my screen and the game, when I have done parts of the lap close to perfect, just to over reach near the end, ending up crashing.I crash a lot. All the time really. Every third lap in some cars. Which is part of the fun!Since I have pretty much been broke since Project Cars finally was release, I can't really comapre them, but even if you have Project cars, this game is a worthwhile investment!The positive:-Great sound-Great grapich-Realistic driving performance and handling-Laser scaned tracks, for optimal realism-Costs less then a single track dayThe negative:-You can't use any buttons on the G27 to navigate the menues. This means I have to get up everytime I need to do a pitstop, and can ruin AI play as well.-The AI is a bit clucky (or was at least, might have become better)-Career mode isn't all that great. It isn't like Forza or other games where you work your way up. THere are just different modes you need to complete to get to the next tier.			"

								Assetto Corsa is showing great potential.  Especially if you have a 3 monitor set up.  This game has by far the best set up options for 3 monitors that I have ever seen.  Want to adjust your FOV, there is a tool for that,  Want to have the game actually take into consideration the angle of your monitors in relation to each other,  It gives you complete control.  Driver head position, no problem.The real kicker.  You can make all these adjustments in game. Just mouse over the right side hidden menu and up pops a ton of on the fly adjustments.			"

								It's Official, I have never played a racing simulator such as this that has managed to scare the ""CRAP"" out of me getting the idea of driving any type of car at high speeds in reality; I can see why many people lose control at high speeds.  The car becomes so unstable that if anyone so much as hits a patch of wet leaves, they are as good as dead in reality.This is the most realistic racing simulator that I have ever played and Gran Turismo has nothing on it...But it is still in much development and I love the online mode of this game as it allows you to compare times with other players.  I haven't had the guts to use the bigger cars in this game.  The Lotus Exige is PLENTY power for me!   I haven't hit a wall with it yet; there is vehicle damage in this game BTW...			"

								THIS GAME IS A BIG DEAL!I noticed ""Assetto Corsa"" today as it's a special offer for this weekend.What shall I say: I'm absolutely embaraced about what is provided. Although the game is ""pre release"" it's astonishing what you get when buying this game.Talking about me and my expectations: I love driving bikes and cars real world. I also like this ""simulated"". Over the last 15 years (or so) I recognised that there is no ""Moped-"" (==motobike-) simulation which will work for me. Driving cars in our days is simulated in an acceptable manner.""In real world"" I love driving lightweight cars.Driving @home I use a Playseat and a Steering Wheel. (Logitech G27 on PC, the old Logitech Wheel on the XBox 360)What I want: I don't want to race (online/offline) I want TRACKDAY-driving.My main problem is (was?) that the physics is some kind of morbid running the most existing PC Simulations. As I tried a lot my favorite at the moment is Forza 5 on XBox 360. Using PC simulations like ""Race Room"" my major issue is that these Programs to me do not feel like ""driving a real car""! The behavior of my wheel (Logitech G27) is crap, especially when the car oversteers. - Forza 5 does this much more than all other (PC- or PS-) games I tried before. The problem playing this is (mainly) that the Wheel (Logitech Drive Fx) is crap...Playing Assetto Corsa for about 1/2 an hour to me was a really great experiance! The Lotus Elise on track behaves like a Lotus Elise driven on Track... ;->SO now my whishes for the further development:- please(!!!) add the ""Nürburgring Nordschleife""- add any other tracks- enhance the physics- enhance the FF (Forced Feedback) for the Logitech G27The FF of the G27 is my only (little) issue. Hitting the curb is somehow a little ""lazy-implementet"". I'm sure this will be fixed... ;-)Looking from my point of view any kind of KI or Races or what else doesn't matter...OVERALL: THANX to the developers for this wonderful simulation!P.S.: Preferred Tracks to be added:- Hockenheim (all Tracks)- Infineon Raceway- Suzuka- AND: of course the ""Nürburgring Nordschleife""... ;-)			"

Although the game is ""pre release"" it's astonishing what you get when buying this game.Talking about me and my expectations: I love driving bikes and cars real world. I also like this ""simulated"". Over the last 15 years (or so) I recognised that there is no ""Moped-"" (==motobike-) simulation which will work for me. Driving cars in our days is simulated in an acceptable manner.""In real world"" I love driving lightweight cars.Driving @home I use a Playseat and a Steering Wheel. (Logitech G27 on PC, the old Logitech Wheel on the XBox 360)What I want: I don't want to race (online/offline) I want TRACKDAY-driving.My main problem is (was?) that the physics is some kind of morbid running the most existing PC Simulations. As I tried a lot my favorite at the moment is Forza 5 on XBox 360. Using PC simulations like ""Race Room"" my major issue is that these Programs to me do not feel like ""driving a real car""! The behavior of my wheel (Logitech G27) is crap, especially when the car oversteers. - Forza 5 does this much more than all other (PC- or PS-) games I tried before. The problem playing this is (mainly) that the Wheel (Logitech Drive Fx) is crap...Playing Assetto Corsa for about 1/2 an hour to me was a really great experiance! The Lotus Elise on track behaves like a Lotus Elise driven on Track... ;->SO now my whishes for the further development:- please(!!!) add the ""Nürburgring Nordschleife""- add any other tracks- enhance the physics- enhance the FF (Forced Feedback) for the Logitech G27The FF of the G27 is my only (little) issue. Hitting the curb is somehow a little ""lazy-implementet"". I'm sure this will be fixed... ;-)Looking from my point of view any kind of KI or Races or what else doesn't matter...OVERALL: THANX to the developers for this wonderful simulation!P.S.: Preferred Tracks to be added:- Hockenheim (all Tracks)- Infineon Raceway- Suzuka- AND: of course the ""Nürburgring Nordschleife""... ;-)			"

								It's Official, I have never played a racing simulator such as this that has managed to scare the ""CRAP"" out of me getting the idea of driving any type of car at high speeds in reality; I can see why many people lose control at high speeds.  The car becomes so unstable that if anyone so much as hits a patch of wet leaves, they are as good as dead in reality.This is the most realistic racing simulator that I have ever played and Gran Turismo has nothing on it...But it is still in much development and I love the online mode of this game as it allows you to compare times with other players.  I haven't had the guts to use the bigger cars in this game.  The Lotus Exige is PLENTY power for me!   I haven't hit a wall with it yet; there is vehicle damage in this game BTW...			"

It also feels so real, it always remembers me on a real trackday on the Nürbugring :-)A good wheel and a propper chair is recommendet to realy get the feeling that this SIM gives.			"

												Assetto Corsa is one of the best Racing Simulation Games out there.I bought it in sale for 50% of the price and I can tell it is remarkably authentic and realistic, considering that you do not really sit in front of the rim of an M3 GT2. I purchased it to function with my Logitech G27, which by the way works perfectly fine since it comes with full Racing Wheel-Support.Thumbs up!!!			"

												Where to start. 350+ hours into this game. Not a moment of boredem. Bought this game earlier in the year. Started to get into it mainly for the drifting side of things. Got about 10 hours in using my xbox microsoft controller. In which i decided to purchase a Logitech G27. Best decision ever. At current i play the game daily. Gonna chuck pros and cons below to my opinion and of me using a wheel.Pro's- Large amount of mods and easy to installGraphics are good and game runs smooth on my Custom budget PC (3 years old now)Standard cars/tracks give enough to keep you entertainedPhysics are not 100% realistic. But very easy to pick up.Con's - Would be nice for the game to detect between H shifter and paddles so you didnt have to change everytime in the menus The cockpit view could do with a slight motion blur to give a concept of speed. go flying into some corners way to fast if you arent concerntrating. As the game is used a lot by people wanting to drift. A points system would be nice.Aside that. I couldnt recommend anyone enough to buy this game. If you have a wheel or your budget means you can buy one. Then do it.			"

												THE WHEELHOP IS REAL!!!!I'm using the Fanatec Porsche 911 GT3 RS V2 Wheel, and let me tell you. I hopped in the Fiat 500, revved up to 6k rpm and let out the clutch and it was real life. Instant uncontrollable shutter from the steering wheel until i managed to find traction when i let out the accelerator. I paused the game and group texted my friends, ""You guys need to come over and try this!"" The realism in this game is outstanding. Ive owned an SRT-4 neon, Subaru Legacy GT Spec.b, and a LS2 6 speed GTO. All VERY different cars. Every car in this game feels insanely different, and they've captured the very essence of pure racing around the track trying various cars. If you are into cars in general, and have a racing wheel, YOU NEED THIS GAME!			"

								As an inexperienced newcomer to sim-racing, there is not much that can compare to a pulling off an unassisted balls to the wall lap of Imola in a Ferrari F40 without going off-track. In games like GRID or Forza, excitement comes from winning races and the drive to keep playing derives from the carrot on a stick that is the credits you need to earn to buy more cars.AC doesn't even have a carrot on a stick for winning races yet (career mode is not yet done), and I still regularly start it up just to do hotlapping sessions of various car/track combinations. The driving is just that much fun in and of itself, and incredibly challening at that.Online racing is also remarkably fun to do, and once you escape inevitable turn 1 malarky, most racers will happily battle you for position turn after turn with courtesy and giving you your space while you give them theirs. It seems most people enjoy a having great and tense battle more than winning it, and that allows for them to take place cleanly. Most people rather see their opponent win it and have another chance to be a hero in the next few turns, than risk hitting them and ending up in the gravel together.There are a few glaring omissions such as pit stops and better ways of getting in a public race (the booking system makes sense, but it could use some more options to allow e.g. joining in practice mode),  but even if they stop development entirely I feel as though I've gotten more than my money's worth already. And so far, they've done the contrary and maintained a fairly strong update/patch schedule every other Friday.			"

												So now I have 600+ hours in this game I think I have put in more than enough hours to review this game in a fair light, kunos games calls assetto corsa (your racing simulator) and they aren’t wrong there, This is the best racing sim I have ever owned the gameplay is solid the feel of the cars and the FFB on the wheel is amazing.Now I am a BIG drifting head to be honest most of the hours I have put in the game have been me drifting in the DriftJunkie servers =D so if you want this game for drifting I 1000% think you should get this game. And maybe we can tandem someday, The graphic are nice & sharp in all the right places for a sim… sure the graphics aren’t forza standard but then again we don’t own this game for the graphics we own it for the realism it brings to the table.Let’s talk content as this is one place where kunos skimped out, assetto corsa has a small number of cars & tracks and even the career is small when you look at most other racing games. There are no leader-boards which feel is a MUST on any racing game. It’s almost like kunos sat down one day at a board meeting and said let’s forget about content we will just let the community build the game for us & they have. All you are is a couple of clicks away for endless tracks, cars & apps, even the community has made its own leader-boards (RSR LiveTiming) in my mind this is the only con this game has. But the endless pros far out way this one con.Overall I give this game a SOLID 9.5/10 (FULLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME)			"

								Very very nice game, i am comparing this to forza 4, the graphics are fantastic the level of detail is superb. The driving simulation makes forza feel like an arcade game. And for this reason it doesd take a while getting used to, and playing with the settings. The extent of tuning that you can do to the car is spectacular, form tires and cabmer to amount of fuel and aerodynamics tuning. I really recomend you get this game, if you like racing games, there are not many good ones on pc, but this is the best of what ive seen.Only problem i can see, is that the traction control need altering, but understanably this is an alpha, so imsure this will be worked on. But i tend not to use assists, only using it untill i get used to the game, having been used to forza.			"

								More than a game, a simulator. Assetto Corsa is still in alpha/beta and it's already setting standards in the racing fanatics' community. Having a wheel with this game is a must, as is having a screen as large as possible if a correct and accurate FOV is desired. A triple monitor setup is highly recommended.The physics are absolutely amazing; they set the bar for other racing games for sure.Cons so far: relatively few tracks, but more are in the way. Please add classic tracks like Laguna Seca, Eastern Creek, and Nurburgring Long, Kunos!Also, the car roster needs to be expanded. But Kunos is hard at work licensing more cars, as far as I'm aware.Finally, a ""con"" for many people would be the very fact that this is a simulator. It is very unforgiving to arcade racing ""technique,"" like flooring the gas pedal during curves or overshooting curves. That is, of course, if your pride makes you turn off the in-game assists, since this game is really easy for casual/newbies if you turn on assists.Thanks for reading, and yes, I highly recommend this game to racing fans.

								I feel compelled to write this having just attempted to play GRID...Assetto Corsa is the next best thing to actually owning a Ferrari 458, BMW Z4 GT3 or a Lotus Exos. Now, I haven't actually driven any of the cars included in the game in reality, but the fact is the feel right. I play this with a Logitech Driving Force GT and I used a simple gamepad before that, and even then it felt like driving, plain and simple.The handling, sounds and feel of the game are fantastic. You can really feel the difference with the laser scanned tracks and every little bump is noticable. Cars behave and sound like cars, and the interiors are gorgeously detailed. There are a few issues with it at the moment since it's currently in beta (I had my car once do a forward flip after I braked heavily and the nose went into the road) but things are improved every patch.I can't say enough good things about this. It's a true driving simulator and it's hours and hours of fun, though I would strongly reccomend using a wheel with this.Note: If you're after a ""game"" this probably won't enjoy you. Try the aforementioned GRID or Need for Speed or something.			"

												i still remember the first day i bought assetto corsa, it was a tough times sincei'm really struggling to drive in this game, either the car is understeer or oversteerbut after i look up on some guide and tips, i finally can enjoy driving in this game.it takes a while since i'm using a controller to get used to it,while also i learned how to tune cars. i almost regret buying this game but,that feeling change as i play through the gamePros:+Awesome physics+Variety of car,track and app mods+Great Optimization+Beautiful engine sound (especially mazda rx7 engine)+Simple Graphics Cons:-Online experience is not good enough-Menu Interface kinda look boring-Not a lot of cars to choose (can be fixed with mods)i also heard a lot of people said that this game is unplayable with a controllerand you have to get a wheel set up, howeveri wouldn't say its unplayable,i would say if you wanted to enhanced your experiencein this game , buy a wheel setup and it is playable with a controller, its just you haveto get used to it, if you are willing to give time to practice with a controlleri'm really sure you can do it, if you still didnt trust me you can see the video below of me driving in NÜRBURGRING with a controller (i know i'm not the best driverbut just to give you some proof)


YouTube™ Video: Assetto Corsa-RedBull x2010 @NÜRBURGRING Track Mod (hotlap) 

			Views: 177		

			Video of me doing a hotlap in Nurburgring, it was fun and challenging at the same time. still need to improve the time though, sorry if my driving skill is not good enough time: 5:11:64 Assist: all...		

Conclusion: i really recommend it you to buy this game if you really wanted to learnabout cars and willing to give sometime especiallly the ones with controller, its not easy but it is possible. if you dont, i think you will be bored in a shortperiod of time, as for those people that have steering wheel, i highly recommended itto you. i'm still in 100+ hours, planning to keep continue playing this game andhad a plan buying a wheel setup one day.

												Assetto Corsa is by far the best driving simulator I've ever played, and as far as I can tell, is _the_ killer app for VR. I can't entirely explain why, but driving in this game is an exhilarating, gratifying, relaxing, wonderful immersive experience. Pair it with good hardware, and you won't regret this purchase at all. Caveat: Oculus support is still marked as beta, and it _has_ frozen up on me a couple times, so it's not perfect (yet).			"

												Being a fan of racing sims and having years of real driving experience, I've always been looking for a game that allows me to feel the car and the road as close to genuine driving as possible. Assetto Corsa absolutely delivers the real thrill of being behind the wheel of a car. There aren't so many vehicles and tracks to choose from yet, but the ones that are available at the moment - are recreated with maximum detail and with true passion. And more downloadable content is on the way! As to the physics, only iRacing can compete with this game in my opinion - the driving is simply phenomenal. The fact that the development team uses real performance data from car manufacturers puts the experience to a higher level, you can easily lose yourself in this simulation for hours straight. And the graphics are gorgeous, especially if you have pc-horsepower to crank up all the video settings. Cockpit cam is superb, the quality of the interiors is second to none. I recommend playing it in 3D with a good FFB wheel. In a word, this is a must have for all racing fans. And if you are not a racing fan - play Assetto Corsa and you will undoubtedly become one ;)			"

												Best racing game I've played!  I have a Logitech G27 FFB wheel, and it feels amazing!  Also has proper triple monitor support at any angle / distance you like with the in game calibration app.  Not as pretty lighting / reflections and effects as Project Cars, but it feels and drives more real to me, which I think is most important.  The next best racing sim I've played is GTR2, which is also amazing!			"

												This is a game, like many, constantly encouraging me to get a computer upgrade (This game is the only one where I've gotten zero frames without the game crashing). But, to be honest if you have the specs, BUY THIS GAME! It's amazing, and as a racer I know exceptionally well about realism. This may be the most realistic racing game ever made. There's always those driving sims that claim they're the best, but none will ever beat this. The graphics and gameplay are amazing too. Bottom line, BUT THIS GAME!			"

								This game is so realistic and so satisfying that achieving your first clean flying lap will be a fist-pumping accomplishment. It's so good that it convinced me to buy a full wheel/pedal/shifter controller set, *for this game alone*.The track selection, despite being somewhat limited in early-release, lets you get a real taste of different racing styles. Classic 60's Monza, for white-knuckle high-speed straightaways. Tight, technical Magione will feel familiar to autocrossers. The drift circuit, for all the drift pigs to play on. And the sweeping curves and elevation changes at Vallelunga for the sheer joy of motoring.			"

								Assetto Corsa attempts to strike a balance between simulation and casual racer. The team at Kunos Simulazioni have a passion for all things automotive, and it shows with AC's eclectic mix of road vehicles, lightweight sports cars, open wheelers and full on track machines.This is a beta release, so much of the content and features are still to come. But the cars, tracks and challenges available at this point in the development of Assetto Corsa should keep armchair racers happy for a while. The game feels like a gentleman's racer, a laid back title with a subtlety not usually associated with a racing sim. Think Chris Harris rather than Clarkson. When you start the game, no one is shouting at you to drive this and race that with a soundtrack pounding you steadily into submission. You choose what you want to drive, where to race and whom to race against. Menu design is intuitive and is easily navigable. It's a welcome return to when interfaces had function to them with icons and text used to great effect.Pick your car. Choose your track. Go Race. The fun is learning the nuances of each vehicle and trying to exploit them trackside. The Ferrari 599XX EVO is a vastly different beast from the Abarth 500 EsseEsse for example, but each offer their own challenges and provide their own rewards. Take your time to appreciate each car in its own right and you'll begin to enjoy racing for fun again. Driving a lightweight Lotus around a tight, twisting track is as much fun as fun as piloting a GT3 racer around Monza, possibly more so.To get the most out of this title, you will need a wheel but the game supports other inputs and is easily playable using a 360 controller. I use a battle worn and rather creaky logitech G25 and the default force feedback settings work really well, with only some minor adjustment made to the gain. You can of course make many adjustments to your chosen method of control, but I was happy with the out of the box settings.Cars are a joy to drive. I always feel in control and that I can correct any minor mistakes without the rear swapping ends, but I know if I push too hard I'll be barrier bound. AC never let's you feel complacent, it just challenges you to drive as fast as you think you can and lets you feel fantastic when you hook up that record lap. The recently introduced AI is decent but not perfect, especially in large fields. Every update brings improvements and thankfully the days of backflipping BMWs and pirouetting Paganis are thankfully now gone. Small fields of cars with similar performance on appropriate tracks will bring the greatest challenge, with more believable behaviour from your computer opponents. Those wanting multiplayer will have to wait a bit longer for that update though.If you wish for a grown up racer then Assetto Corsa may just be for you, but remember that it's effectively a work in progress and many features are not available at this point. But what there is is at the time of this review is a great indication of what is to come when Assetto Corsa goes final.			"

								good road feedback, excellent force feedback support, awesomely detailed cars and tracks.Can't wait for more tracks and some AI thrown into the mix;for now it's a driving simulator with very high standards!------------------update: AI has been added, more cars and tracks; excellent sim, was well worth the early purchase, we're not at release candidate status, meaning it's just bugfixing now.they added DK2 support (Oculus) which makes this the best racing sim on the planet (for now?), immersion is top notch, the details on the cars is insane, you can walk around the car, explore the cockpit and you really have the impression you are there!Even with the modest resolution of the DK2 (1920x1080) seeing the road and apex of the corners is very much doable, although a step up in resolution would really make this a killer software title for the Oculus Rift.can't wait for the official nurburgring nordschleife to be added, for now I'm using a converted track and just copied into the AC tracks folder, works wonders and very enjoyable!the AI can be tweaked with a simple 0-100% slider, they are clean racers and overall offer a good challenge for slower pilots like me, I'm pretty sure seasoned race veterans will leave the AI in the dust, but they offer enough challenge... much better than the AI in GT5 and Forza :)best sim/racer out on the PC? Yes sir!------------Update May 2015. Assetto Corsa is now past 1.0 release and it's still going strong; Career option has been added, giving it a good single player experience, although I still miss the ""garage"" of GT5 where miles are tracked and cars need maintenance (even minimal is fine) for top performance. Further more the Nurburgring is now completely inside the game, 20+km of glorious roads, although this update (and some nice extra cars) costs extra (DLC), worth the money? if you're invested in the game: sure; A must buy to enjoy AC? Not really.VR integration hasn't changed since release, still the same menu troubles and absent UI elements; a few hotkeys can be mapped to restart race, reset car. and since latest patch you need to tweak .ini files to get exposure working correctly (otherwise it's too bright); with DK2 using SweetFX to increase sharpness does a lot to get better immersion. Overall in combination with Virtual Deskop, AC with DK2 is very much playable			"

								This is incredible! The bmw is a blast to drive, the ai is a tad bullish but nothing like (shift or project cars) they actually have a bit of survival instinct. The feel of each car is of its own and the gas pedal does bite on the high enders. But can be brought back into control under some light feathering. Finally something besides iracing that doesn't feel like plain ol line between slip and grip sims. you can go from slip back to grip with some refined pedal and wheel work! Just feels great! worth every penny. One early access you know will give back versus some developers that get their money and done. anticipated 10/10 if the community is their to support the multiplayer side of the game.			"

								Assetto Corsa is one of those games that make you stand back and marvel at its brilliance. Well, it is almost there at least. I have wanted to get into sim racers for some time and when I saw this on the Steam Store I brought it. The selection of cars in the game is a good as there are several types of vehicles to choose from, these include open wheel, street and track cars. There is a small selection of tracks with some tracks just be variations but each track suits different cars. You can play this game with a Xbox 360 controller but to get that immersive feeling like you are in the car and driving it you would have to invest in a wheel and pedals. The graphics are actually very good, they could do with a polish but they are great for now. A few little tweaks with the car sounds can make it feel a bit more realistic.As for the current state of the game it is absolutly brilliant. Hopefully AI will be introduced soon and it can make the game one of the best racing games I have played (to be honest, it already is). This is a must for any boy (or girl) racer out there that wants a solid sim racer.			"

												As far as PC gaming gets, I've yet to encounter anything that commands my focus and pulls me in as much as this game. The visuals are just stunning, the physics are spot-on, the controller support is just fantastic... I sometimes have to remind myself it's just a game. Singleplayer is very open for mods, so there's no chance it'll ever get boring (Reliant Robin on a Mario Kart track, etc..) Multiplayer is great, but you'll need quick reflexes to avoid aggressive or inexperienced drivers, as they're pretty common. This game is not as much for people who like casual driving games, and I highly doubt this game would be playable without a proper racing wheel. So if you love hardcore simulation, this is your game. My only realy gripes are the often-lackluster AI (losing control in drag races, getting stuck on walls) and shaky connections online, but those are just minor. tl;dr great driving game, very realistic.

Only started getting into racing sims since October 2014 when I purchased my first wheel (Thrustmaster Ferrari Legend Edition) and F1 14.  Since spending the last few days downloading cars and track mods and setting up wheel properly amd playing..........You ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s have just forced me to invest in a Logiteh G25 and think I may start saving for a G27.......Bas♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.....I can't afford this lol. Good job.....Great community, great support and a never ending list of game play options! Many thanks :)			"

												As far as PC gaming gets, I've yet to encounter anything that commands my focus and pulls me in as much as this game. The visuals are just stunning, the physics are spot-on, the controller support is just fantastic... I sometimes have to remind myself it's just a game. Singleplayer is very open for mods, so there's no chance it'll ever get boring (Reliant Robin on a Mario Kart track, etc..) Multiplayer is great, but you'll need quick reflexes to avoid aggressive or inexperienced drivers, as they're pretty common. This game is not as much for people who like casual driving games, and I highly doubt this game would be playable without a proper racing wheel. So if you love hardcore simulation, this is your game. My only realy gripes are the often-lackluster AI (losing control in drag races, getting stuck on walls) and shaky connections online, but those are just minor. tl;dr great driving game, very realistic.

												So that i don't write a wall of text I will just point you to video that was made by Assetto Corsa devs. And it is explaining what you get in the game.


YouTube™ Video: Assetto Corsa - Built For Racers Trailer 

			Views: 29,332		

			Built by racing enthusiasts, for racing enthusiasts... Assetto Corsa will be released on August 26th (EU) and August 30th (NA) on PlayStation® 4 & Xbox One. Pre-order NOW!		

But if you want my opinion. I can only say its realistic physics,laser scanned tracks,every car is different handling. And All in all enjoyable feeling.I was driving Lamborghini,and when I got used to it I was like I will go drive Ferrari and loaded up in Ferrari first corner i was off the track :D then I saw you really need to learn each car and master your skills.When you play multiplayer opponents are respectful they are some who still don't know how to drive and they are ramming etc. but it is a game just try to win :)			"

								This is, by a large margin, the best simulation I've had so far. Everything is realistic to a point where cars feel exactly as in real life. Drifting the 458 is just as difficult and with the same feeling as the real thing (I'm an automotive engineer).The preview is pretty much a full game. I completely recommend this.			"

												Assetto Corsa does a lot of things brilliantly, but does fall short in a couple of aspects:Beautiful & Laser scanned tracks 10/10. Track atmosphere should feel more alive i.e. added crowds, cheering etc on race day.Accurately detailed cars 9/10. Sounds 7/10.Visuals 9/10. Good content and vast selection of both cars (street & race) and tracks 8/10. Ever expanding with well priced & free DLC's.Good FFP, physics & simulation aspect 7/10. Still missing some key elements such as simulated pits, car systems such as brake temps etc.AI still needs improvement, and the team is always fine tuning & updating their behaviour 6/10.Massive modding community, and lots of quality content to be had 8/10.Over all, and as a package, this is one of the most complete Sims on the market and it will consistently reward you for your driving efforts. If you are racing fan, and have a racing wheel, Assetto Corsa is a must.9/10.			"

								This is a game I was waiting for a long time and its finally out and better than I hoped. If you are looking for a lifelike handling car sim with up to date graphics and have a fairly up to date and powerful PC. This will blow your mind if you have reached that point where arcade-like games just aren't fulfiling.I recommend that you buy yourself a racing wheel to enjoy this game properly. It is very easy to drive with an XBOX360 controller asuming you have the right settings first.I would rate this game in the following aspects:Current Content  26/11/2013   : 4/10Full Release Content                 : 8/10/Future use (mods)                    : 8/10Graphics                                   : 8+/10Handling                                   : 9+/10My hardware :CPU : Intel ivy-bridge i5 3570K@3.4GHzRAM: 8GB DDR3GPU: nVidia GTX 660 Ti - Driver : 331.82Rez : Full HD 1080p@60HzOS  : MS Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit""My racing simulator""			"

												I'm more a rally person. Ok I've grinded Gran Turismos on Playstations.. But on PC and sim racing, rally has been my no.1, thanks to Richard Burns Rally.Now I see myself enjoying more and more of driving on tarmac tracks. Driving Assetto Corsa. I've tried iRacing and pCARS etc. iRacing was good but I don't like monthly subscription system.. I guess it is worth it, but still, my gaming is seasonal. Back to AC. One reason for it is Ferrari F40. 90% of my playtime so far is trying to handle that beast. Really handle. Not to drive like my grandma. No more comments on that atm :DPS. This review is for players with decent wheel controller. I'm going to buy pedals with clutch soon.. Thanks F40 & AC.10/10			"

												Game is okay - controls and response from my controller seem sluggish and delayed, which makes it hard to play. My biggest complaint? The fact they just released a $15 DLC pack, and the main game itself has such a tiny collection of cars. on top of that, there is no menu music, the buttons don't clearly state what they are so you're kind of left guessing in some parts, and the controller support only works during a race and not for any of the menus! Why would I want to put my controller down and grab my mouse/keyboard for navigating the menu? In conclusion - game has a lot of potential, but come on AC team. Get your prirorities straight, and deliver us a good complete game before you go fishing for more DLC money...			"

												I love driving in this game. The physics are difficult but once you get over the learning curve it's very rewarding. The graphics are outstanding, as is the sound. But that's all this game has going for it.The career mode could not be more dull. It's a very simple, linear game. And since there are hardly any cars or tracks it gets repetitive. There is nothing to work for. No currency to buy cars, no ""tournaments"" that you can only enter by meeting certain qualifications, no licences. I'm not even sure why they call it a career mode. The experience of being a carrer racing driver is not there.Coming from console gaming, and in particular playing the Gran Turismo series, this game is a huge letdown. I am hoping somebody comes out with a decent sim eventually because there's not much to offer on PC right now.			"

												Honestly i had so much hope for this Sim... the Problem is that its nothing more than a hot lap sim .... the Career mode sucks, no pit stops, no quali, the damage model is a joke, no night racing, no endurance (nothing more than 30 lap race), NO WEATHER and news that the game is going to be ported to console. The game isn't even ready on PC let alone porting it over to a console. Get a grip Such a shame because as i say it has got a lot of hope going for it. Why on earth they made DLC is madness in my eyes. Also there hasn't been a patch since April.... we are in July now. I pray to god they get there act together. At least the game isn't as bad as Project Cars. Its nowhere near as good as ISI or Reiza Studio games.			"

												Il explain my experience here. And a few absolutes. After switching on most games you get to play them However that was not thecase with  AC. I havent managed to play it yet. The General User Interface (GUI) is in one word... Diabolical. It is set up like a website and not very clear what you have to actually do to get it to work. I set the screen at 800x600 because that is the only way I could get it to display the whole thing. (its usually 1280x900/720).Then when I get on the actual track its not clear how to get the car to actually move... Then when it eventually does move, its undrivable with massivve oversteer (not very realistic at all). But if that was the only problem I wouldnt have commented here. I would have sorted it but to be frank this game will never get played. The whole experience of it is as mentioned Diabolical. I like to pick up my controller and press the buttons and play. This requires constant use of a mouse which to me makes it unplayable. If I could get my money back I would. Its terrible. And will never play it.  "

												The best Racing Sim/Hard+software engineer RPG ever made.Want to race beautifully rendered high powered cars around outstanding laser scanned tracks from around the world? Hells yeah! Want a really excellent car set-up ability that really feels like it makes a difference? This game really does have all that in spades. Okay the career is a bit boring, but online racing is good. The cars really handle very differently to each other and the laser scanned Nurburging Nordschleife is an absolute joy to drive.Then a couple of times a year a patch comes along +/- DLC. This is where the game suddenly becomes RPG. You've proved your metal on the track, you've fine tuned those racing machines to your perfection...now have you got what it takes to do the same to your PC and the software? Before you can get back out on to the track you must cut your way through another field of hopefuls, all floundering in the sand trap cos the FPS drop sent them there, desperately trying to find the fix to get them out of the techno babble hell they've been sent to. My fellow hopeful asked a simple question on a forum (the guy had about as much knowledge as me...not a lot) and got this reply....'26% total core load, yes but what are your individual core loads? You might have one core being hammered to the point that it affects the proceeding cores causing a bottleneck.' FANTASTIC! Possibly the worst good point I ever saw on a gaming forum. I've been stuck in this RPG phase of the game over a week. Sure I've learnt some stuff about hardware and software, but really I just want to drive a racing car in a video game. I don't want to be going into game files and changing numbers or spending 20hrs in forums after every patch.If I was to score out of ten, 5 for the drive sim, 0 for the RPG. 5/10.			"

												Do you enjoy Forza? Looking for something similar, but that you can play on PC? Hoping to use an Xbox 360 controller or something similar because you don't have $300-$1000 of disposable income to buy on a racing wheel? Look elsewhere. I bought this because I have played all kinds of racing games over the years, but hadn't really found a good PC racing game. This looked like the answer, but after a little over a half an hour of skidding into walls while trying frantically to saw at the wheel in a vain attempt to regain control of my vehicle, I realized that this is not the game for me.Realistically, in the ""Requirements"" section, a racing wheel should be listed. If you're going to say that you support the Xbox 360 controller, then I shouldn't have to futz with the settings just to finally get it to a point where the most minute of movements doesn't have the driver spinning the wheel frantically from side to side. Honestly, this problem has been SOLVED. Turn 10 obviously is aiming almost exclusively for the 360 controller, but these developers basically just shoved in some nonsensical presets and called it a day. It appears to respond as it would to the analog input of a wheel, which is ridiculous. A wheel has wildly different affordances than a 360 controller, yet the default presets make the game unplayable with said controller.Not to mention the fact that the game crashed multiple times on me in various settings menus. I'm very disappointed with Assetto Corsa. As a racing fan, I was hoping that this would be the answer for my craving for a solid racing game to replace Forza. What I received was a buggy game that only appears to be enjoyable if you've got a racing wheel. Which is fine, but I wish I had known that *before* I dropped $60 on the game. Now, because there is no refund policy for games that you instantly regret buying, I get to look at this game resentfully in my library every time I open Steam.If you've got a pro racing setup already in your home and you're a racing sim veteran, then this review really isn't for you. However, if you, like I was previously, are looking for something to fill a Forza-sized hole in your PC library, look elsewhere.			"

								If iRacing and rFactor had a baby this would be the outcome, the AI is still a bit dodgy and sometimes doesn't acknowledge you're right there with them but they keep improving it and can't go anywhere but up. The feeling of the sim is pretty much right on point (using G27 wheel) being smooth and not overdriving is key or you'll end up scrubbing speed and losing time, once you get the feeling and get accustomed you'll start to see the rewards this sim will give you for respecting it. This is no arcade type sim, so don't buy this if you plan on driving it like you would on forza or need for speed.  Can't wait to see what they come up with once it's fully released with online, this will give iRacing a run for its money especially when Nurburgring Nordschleife is on this service.			"

								My computer is under the minimun requirements (AMD Athlon II X2 255, 4Gb RAM and an Asus HD 5450 1Gb) and I've got a 90º wheel from Trust.After getting and testing the non-steam version of the 0.2 pre release and seeing that I can run the game at playable FPS (~30 @1280x720) I couln'd wait to play the 0.3 version. The release day for the 0.3 passed and I was checking so many times a day to see if there was a non-steam version of the 0.3 alvailable.After 3 or 4 days I couldn't wait anymore and bought the game on steam. 11/10 would buy again. My next move is going to be a Driving Force GT.Can't wait for what is to come - AI, Multiplayer, Asian and American Cars and new tracks. Keep it up Kunos!			"

												Hands down my favourite racing sim on the market. The only bad thing I can think of about this game is that the sounds are not up there with the likes of Raceroom Racing Experience. But then again not a lot is. The physics are really good imo however some people do not seem to think so. Also the FFB is really nice and gives you a good sense of how the car behaves and where the limit is. It is a highly moddable game with hundreds of mods already available from early access. I would highly reccomend this game to any with a keen eye on racing. You do not have to have a racing wheel to play this game but I would strongly suggest you invest as it is a comepletely different experince and one that is worth the money that it costs. So overall, go purchase this game right now.			"

												I'm starting to love this game, though you need to put some work into it (both in terms of driving and setup). Here is a 4 step guide to get you started:1. Run the LUT Generator to (vastly) improve force feedback and then check for clipping.2. Set pre-rendered frames to 1 in nvidia's profile inspector to get rid of the steering lag (if you have any). Tweak some settings while you're there.3. Install Bridgehampton and Caterham Academy.4. Lean back and enjoy. Wait, I mean, DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE!			"

								Do you like car sims or racing games? Do you have a good wheel? If so you must get this game. You can not even race anyone yet and I still have more fun in this then any other driving game. Only game physics that compare to this is live for speed and this is better and it  looks stunning. Cant recomend it enough. Cant wait till the AI and multipayer come. If you dont have a wheel save up and get one because it just makes driving sims the most fun I have ever had on a PC.			"

								I've been playing console racers and sims my entire life and always stayed away from PC sims. I loved Gran Turismo and never experienced anything that would tear me away from it. This, however, made me fall in love with cars and simulators all over again.The cars look jaw-droppingly beautiful and handle like a dream. It takes some time getting into if you're coming from console sims, but it's worth the effort. I use an XB360 controller and after getting the settings right it handles great.Assetto Corsa is the finest simulator I've ever played			"

								I read the review from Gamer Muscle and it made me laugh and because of the detail of the review tempted me to purchase it. So I bought it and I am not disappointed at all. It's a brilliant game especially concidering the fact it's in BETA mode. There are only a few cars available and there are also only a few tracks, but it's still good fun. To play it I have a Thrustmaster Ferrari Edition Racing wheel which is not listed in the pre-configurations, but that's okay! You can easily configure the controls easily. It took me about 1 minute to set it up correctly. I did have to invert the throttle and brakes because they were the wrong way around but that's also fine.The gearbox is impossible to change to manual. I want manual and you cannot change it; although you are allowed to interfere with the gearbox in-game and change up/down at will, but if the game detects it's too early then it changes back to what it thinks it should be. Hopefully this will be fixed at some point...Another problem I have found when using my racing wheel is that the steering is really poor. I turn about 2 degrees and the wheels lock up and I jjust spear straight off. This is with all of the cars I use and it's really annoying because it's ruining the game for me. I have tried adjusting the sensetivity of the steering but so far, no luck... If anyone can help me with this then that's great, I'll test it out and let you know. Otherwise I would like to see it fixed. The game for me is set of maximum settings and it runs perfectly... Very well optimised. This is my setup and it works great on maximum everything.CPU: Intel Core i5 3570KGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680RAM: 8GB Corsairetc.The game overall is extremely good and I can't wait for the finished product! Despite the fact it's in BETA mode and it will have regular updates I fully 100% recommend this game to everyone! It's brilliant and in the short time that I have played I haven't found any bugs whilst in the game... Just a few setup issues as mentioned before.If you're looking at my recorded play time and thinking ""why should I listen, you've barely played it!""; well, if I'm writing a review without having even played an hour and I'm extremely impressed with it then you can imagine that I'll be playing a lot more in my spare time!EDIT: Since the review I have found how to adjust the gearbox to manual! It was right in front of me all the time in the realism settings! I have also adjusted the steering sensetivity and deadzones etc. for ages and it's still awful. And no, I'm not trying to enter a corner at 500 MPH. I'm doing it at a range between 60 MPH (100 KPH) down to ~37 MPH (60 KPH) and at both speeds, it's awful!			"

( ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ build upto 8.5 ) Gradually things have improved and i can now safely say that apart from the ♥♥♥♥in idiots who buy this game and dont use break's on the multiplayer its a solid sim racer wiht alot of potentiall.

												Assetto Corsa is a game for sim racing and fun racing enthusiasts alike. While a representative of neither niche is going to be fully content with the state the game is currently in, the developers work hard on giving the player the best possible physical behaviour of the cars they implement. So far, they have acquired licenses for various brands of makers of road, sports and race cars, a more sophisticated ruleset for races and management tools for server administrators are still somewhat lackluster, but in the works. What this game can definitely deliver: Beautiful graphics, realistic physics, and an absolutely awesome modding community which helps to make the game feel more complete. The developers take kindly to creative approach and sometimes even include the work of the community in their game.			"

								I would highly reccomend this game. It has been a suitable replacement for rFactor and iRacing.  The car list is a little short at the moment, but don't let that turn you down, because the few cars in here a very good cars.  The sounds are great, the driving dynamics are great as well, and the customizable UI is revolutionary, becuase you can have it set to exactly how you want it. The only thing I can think of that it needs is so more street cars instead of having it be all race cars, and the skid force on force feedback could also be worked on. Overall, well worth the $40 dollars instead of paying monthly afor iRacing and having to pay for individual cars and tracks.			"

								I recommend this game with a real Driving Wheel and gas pedals.Otherwise, the turn radius with controllers are very large, and forget about Keyboard and mouse.The sound assets are purely amazing, with good headphones you feel the engine shake in your ears!This game is only for serious racer, it is NOT an arcade game like NFS or Burnout.Caution: This game is heavy in graphics, I suggest a decent GPU (R9 270X or GTX 760Ti and higher) before buying this product.

This review contains spoilers!Kunos Simulazioni has put in very hard work to create something like this especially in early access or alpha version. I think the game will advance after every single version developers will made so that Assetto Corsa will become a perfect PC simulator game. I also love that the developers have included 114 Steam achievements in the game so far.Overall driving physics and especially drifting is amazing, I have not enjoyed something like that before. Sound also is mind-blowing. I recommend it to everyone who loves sports, simulation and racing games.By akuustik from Latvia. "

								If iRacing and rFactor had a baby this would be the outcome, the AI is still a bit dodgy and sometimes doesn't acknowledge you're right there with them but they keep improving it and can't go anywhere but up. The feeling of the sim is pretty much right on point (using G27 wheel) being smooth and not overdriving is key or you'll end up scrubbing speed and losing time, once you get the feeling and get accustomed you'll start to see the rewards this sim will give you for respecting it. This is no arcade type sim, so don't buy this if you plan on driving it like you would on forza or need for speed.  Can't wait to see what they come up with once it's fully released with online, this will give iRacing a run for its money especially when Nurburgring Nordschleife is on this service.			"

								I have them all, every racing simulator on the PC, PS3 and XBox.  Even without AI or racing online, in this early stage for the simulator it is the best.This is the most immersive and realistic feeling simulator I have driven using my Fanatec CSR Elite and Pedals.If I had all day I'd write a detailed review but for now, all I can say is get it or you're missing out on a whole lot of fun and the best racing simulator about with Project CARS a close second.Apart from the fantastic driving experience, I love the fact I can dial down the frame rate and have my GPU running at 38 degrees centigrade vs. 78-82 degrees centigrade in some other racing simulators while the graphics remain as good as any other simulator.

								My computer is under the minimun requirements (AMD Athlon II X2 255, 4Gb RAM and an Asus HD 5450 1Gb) and I've got a 90º wheel from Trust.After getting and testing the non-steam version of the 0.2 pre release and seeing that I can run the game at playable FPS (~30 @1280x720) I couln'd wait to play the 0.3 version. The release day for the 0.3 passed and I was checking so many times a day to see if there was a non-steam version of the 0.3 alvailable.After 3 or 4 days I couldn't wait anymore and bought the game on steam. 11/10 would buy again. My next move is going to be a Driving Force GT.Can't wait for what is to come - AI, Multiplayer, Asian and American Cars and new tracks. Keep it up Kunos!			"

												Hands down my favourite racing sim on the market. The only bad thing I can think of about this game is that the sounds are not up there with the likes of Raceroom Racing Experience. But then again not a lot is. The physics are really good imo however some people do not seem to think so. Also the FFB is really nice and gives you a good sense of how the car behaves and where the limit is. It is a highly moddable game with hundreds of mods already available from early access. I would highly reccomend this game to any with a keen eye on racing. You do not have to have a racing wheel to play this game but I would strongly suggest you invest as it is a comepletely different experince and one that is worth the money that it costs. So overall, go purchase this game right now.			"

												//Post-Release Update//Best and most realistic racing sim yet. It's like driving a real car. Never had that feeling in a game before.  And I really appreciate the mod support, because it is a nice counteracting force to the small assortment of cars and tracks. The graphical presentation is delightful with 4x MSAA +  4x SGSSAA. Caution: AC isn't made for people who wanna enjoy a career mode or race weeks, which is at least for me not a problem. 9/10			"

												Superb racing simulation.  Playing the first 4 hours of the newly released career I was unable to put this game down.  I feel as if I have just driven 4 hours on a real track.  The steering feel and weight are perfect, the feeback through the wheel means you can push the cars to find the limit just as you would in real life.  There is no need to use the 'dotted racing line' on screen as you can feel the cars through the corners.  In the front wheel drive cars understeer is telegraphed and easy to feel as you reach the limit of grip.  More impressively oversteer in cars like the E90 M3 starts with a slight pull on the wheel in opposite to the direction of travel - an excellent simulation of the yaw effect which gives you plenty of warning to react and correct.  A simulation as close to reality as I've experienced, the cars feel properly hooked up to the track.  Well worth the money.Updated for the Steam Awards, Assetto Corsa deserves a shot in the Test of Time category because here is a game from 2014 that even today gets plenty of play time.  They've continued to improve the game and it remains a gem on the pc.VR support is also superb in this game, try the latest Porsche 919 for the full effect, incredible.			"

Driving model is brilliant, graphics are almost photoreal, no unnecessary eycandy. Tracks are laserscanned, cars are licensed and feel and look great and very convincing. Steering wheel is absolutely essential for this title. With keyboard or controller You' ll only get frustrated. Well, it's realistic so pretty damn hard, but if you're dedicated petrolhead go for it, it's worth every money.			"

								Brilliant sim. Its only getting better in my opinion, with more tracks and cars being released all the time.There are a few flaws though, like the Career mode, Force feedback and the online multiplayer (Although that is still in beta.) There is no 'Host' multiplayer button in game on assetto corsa, you have to run your own dedicated server which can be a pain with some routers. Dedicated servers are really good, but i would like to be able to play in private servers with my friends so we dont have to race against people who are likely to hit you off etc. The career mode is in my opinion pretty poor. Its just like a challenge mode, there is no type of series or championships like you would get on other games. There are just time trails, 5 lap races on different tracks with different cars but its really boring and i dont get any sense of achievement even when i do get the gold medal. Im hoping for an improvement so i can play single player, and actually enjoy it! The FFB is okay, its improving but there can be some dodgy moments where you feel like the car is stepping out on you, but it is not and when you go to correct the car, it simply spins the other way. I dont know if thats just with the DFGT Wheel but it certainly can be annoying. However, driving on this game is brilliant. The cars all feel different to eachother, the graphics in the cockpits look real, you can even change your on board settings to fit the 1st person view to where you are comfertable. When you get your wheel settings right, there is literally 0 input lag, so when you move your wheel, it moves in sync with the onscreen wheel perfectly giving you more precise controls with the car.It has a selection of amazing tracks, like Silverstone, Spa, Nurburgring, Imola and you can also add mods to your game which expands the variety even more. The more i play the game, the more i like it and with future DLCs and more mods i can only see the game going forwards. "

This is almost as fun as actually tearing around in my actual car.However, this is not a game for causuals. It's difficult, especially if you're only using a gamepad like I am. Handling this realistic without actually being in the car is hard to manage. You can't feel all the minor bumps, and the G-force, and the wind like a real car.

You can drive Niki Lauda's Ferrari 312T around the Nurburgring. And it'll feel like it.They're still making major improvements, too. Like, brand new race AI? Brand new tire model? Sure!

								Outstanding driving simulator. Easily the most realistic physics and car feedback through the wheel I have ever felt outside of a real car. I own a BMW E30 with sports suspension, and handling of the ingame E30 M3 is absolutely spot on. The FFB effects using a G27 wheel are accurate, subtle, and give the feeling of being connected to a real car.Even at Beta 0.2, with loads more content and improvements yet to come, I can happily say this is the driving simulator we have been waiting for. Here is a formula proving how good is: Live for Speed x 10 + real cars and laser scanned tracks + nice graphics = Assetto Corsa = Driving Sim Nirvana			"

								Assetto Corsa is a visually stunning racing simulator. With graphics backed by solid physics and a fully customizable UI, this has the chance to revive PC racing sims. The contiually increasing selection of cars and tracks provide a variety of racing experiences. From normal curcit racing, to drifting, to drag racing, Assetto Corsa offers huge replayability. However, this game does have some things wrong with it. The AI are both too aggresive and not aggresive enough. Often, AI will come speeding down a straight into the back of anyone who happened to brake too early. Other times, they will refuse to pass someone they could easily overtake. The AI are racing on a two-lane road. If two cars are taking up the lanes ahead, the AI won't try and find a gap, but will instead follow angrily behind. Overall, Asseto Corsa is looking like it will be the game that revives PC racing sims. But it has quite a few things that need to be worked out before this can become a full game. I would recomend this game to die-hard racing fans, but wait for a full release for casual gamers.			"

												First off, the necessities:1) You WILL need a proper wheel. Think Logitech G25/ G27/ G920, Thrustmaster T300rs/ T500rs, Fanatec CSR etc. FORGET about using the keyboard or even a controller.2) You WILL need to learn the very basics of going fast. Wide in, tight through, wide out; Do most of your braking before entering the turn; Learn the braking zones.3) You WILL, most likely (depending on your previous experience with racing sims or real racing), experience a very hard learning curve before you're going to be able to compete for 1st place. And this is only the AI, I haven't experienced online racing yet so can't comment there.4) You WILL, eventually, start fiddling with car settings to gain a fraction of a second in your laptimes.Now then, with that out the way, here's the rundown on the game itself: It is, in my experience, probably the most fun racing sim you can get as of right now. There is a satisfying selection of cars to choose from, with more being released in the form of reasonably priced DLC.This is a racing simulator, pure and simple. Do NOT expect this to allow you to customize cars in-game a la Gran Turismo or Forza. Again, this is a racing sim. You get in your car, you practice until your arms are numb, and then you practice some more.If you like racing, whether you're an actual racing driver, a weekend racer, or just always had aspirations of becoming a racing driver, get this game right now. You will likely love it to bits.If you're more into picking up a controller and just be able to compete straight away, this may not be the game for you. Even if you happen to fall into this category though, I would still recommend getting this, borrowing a wheel if you can, and just trying it... It's that fun and that addictive.			"

												This is the best sim out right now!  I'm having a blast with it!  The physics of the game feel very natural, and so do the graphics.  So many mods to play around with, super easy to mod, and I have even created a number of tracks for it using Race Track Builder.  I mostly use this sim for rally play (with mods of course), because AI is average at best.  I prefer RF2 for curcuit racing, because their AI is far far ahead of anyone.  I can't speak much about multiplay, as I generally don't play it.  My Fanatac gear works great!  If you like sim racing games this is a must have!			"

								Assetto Corsa offers an outstanding and unforgettable experience in the Oculus Rift DK2.  VR is the future of sim racing and if you have a VR+wheel+pedals setup you'd be crazy to not own AC.  Aside from its VR support, it's still quite solid in other areas.  Graphics, physics, sound, and UI are all good.  Multiplayer support is fair but improving.  Car modeling is very good on all fronts, especially the interior modeling.  Support for third-party content is excellent.  Even just one of the best third-party tracks is worth the (quite modest) purchase price of AC alone.  Seek out those tracks and you will be handsomely rewarded!			"

								To really find enjoyment in this game, you have to like racing games, and preferably own a wheel. I, unfortuantly, do not own a wheel, so this review comes from a gamepad standpoint. Overall, this game is brilliant. There isn't a better way to put it, and to get it for $20 was even better. I really appreciate the level of detail in each car, and each track. Driving them though can be annoying and not too entertaining. Get everything right though, and it's a memorable experience.The controls are the biggest drawback here. Like I said above, unless you own a wheel, you are not going to have a great time. I spent quite a bit of time just tweaking settings trying to get everything to an acceptable level. Even now I am not thrilled with the control layout and feel I currently have. Back to the cars, and the game. The menu can be a bit confusing at start, and the depht of cars isn't great. Tracks suffer the same thing too. The cars though are models very well, although I cannot comment on the accuracy of the physics models behind each one. If you are looking for a good racing game, Assetto Corsa is one that has a lot of potential, but don't expect to be immediatlly thrilled by it. It takes time, and a lot of tweaking, to really make the most out of this game. Once you get past that though, there is a lot of fun to be had.			"

								This is an okay game. It could use a better SDK and the ability for players to modify already released cars so that they can drive them with different specs from the default, but otherwise, this is an okay racing game. It needs some music, and has some twitchy controls with steering wheels, but supports practically all steering wheels even the driving force GT steering wheel.-- Content Creation --If you are like me and into content creation. You can make your own tracks using the Assetto Corsa track, make car retextures, create a custom car based on the Formula K car that Assetto Corsa comes with and more. I've only done the car retextures and gotten tracks that other modders have made. This helps to make this among the best racing games out there in my opinion. Especially since there are a lot of modders out there trying to make content for this game.-- Steering wheel controller --Works mostly with the Logitech G27 steering wheel, but the steering wheel's shift indicator doesn't work... (( Look below for solution to this )) It's okay, though kind of takes away from the feel of the game for me. The game with this steering wheel will shift in such a way that allows you to use the manual shifter (H-pattern) when in a car that has an H-pattern shifter, otherwise you're restricted to the paddle shifters for those cars that have that. I prefer the H-Pattern shifter, but there many cars in the game that don't use that shifter. -- Other issues --Currently no career mode, and when its added hopefully it won't force people to drive all manner of cars... Currently some cars are very twitchy if you accelerate oddly quick. This is mostly something from the high horsepower cars.-- Solutions to problems above --* Steering wheel issue with G27 and no LEDs use. Download FanaLEDs program, In FanaLEDs program do File - Open Settings, open Global, change revledtype to 1, then save, close FanaLEDs and reopen it. Now you can set up the RPM percentage you want to start counting at, for me this is 60%. And it will count up each LED on the steering wheel until about 500 RPMs before red line and at red line it will start flashing the LEDs to indicate that you need to shift up. I love Assetto Corsa now that this feature works, maybe they will make it so we don't need to use FanaLEDs to get this to work in the future.*** UPDATE as of Release Candidate 1.0.1 ***The game's cars don't act like the real world cars anymore. In particular, the production car ones. They feel too twitchy and act more like what you'd expect on an arcade game instead of being something like you'd get on a driving simulator game like GT5. Hopefully, they'll fix this for the actual release.			"

								This game is wildly fun and has levels of fun and complexity for virtually any player. The physics in the game are unbelievable, and it's a blast to play. Game is playable with a controller, (not very well in my opinion, I just don't like using my xbox controller) but I use a g27 with the pedals and the H-Shifter. Wildly fun, and still being updated regularly! Patches come quickly and the game developers actually seem to care about their product. If you can get it during the next steam sale (or now if you really want to), PICK THIS UP. There are tons of cars to choose from, many different tracks, and you can tackle the game with any skill level. As of right now, the developers are working on making the AI in the game more suited to race people, as sometimes there are tiny problems in the code causing a few cars to immediately pit and stay there, something or other--don't let this stop you though. The game is still in late alpha and this is to be expectedTl;dr - Game is still in late alpha, 100% playable. Can be played with a controller, I prefer a wheel. Cars, tracks, general improvements and rebalancing of cars as well as AI are still in progress. Physics are incredible, I've never played something more realistic on steam. PICK UP THIS GAME ASAP IF YOU'RE INTO DRIVING SIMULATORS THAT HAVE REALISTIC PHYSICS AND CAN BE PLAYED BY ANYONE!!! "

								I'm new to actual racing sims, having only played Forza 4 and F1 2012. I don't have a steering wheel and pedal set. I play Assetto Corsa with a PS3 gamepad. The game is early access and is, right now, a very good time trial simulator. The way I played it, being new to racing sims, was to pick a car and a track, and play the hell out of it (I picked the E92 M3 and Silverstone GP). I also tried the other cars a bit but my main focus was this car/track combo.If you are also new to racing sims, this is the right way to play, because you want to find out quickly if you can't enjoy racing sims. That is, if you can't enjoy playing the same car and track over and over, slowly eking out an extra second or fraction of a second through gradually better perception of the car's handling and of the track's quirks (because even simulated driving of cool cars on awesome tracks is always enjoyable). I found out I do enjoy racing sims. By now, I've played it well over a day of real time, have considered buying a wheel and pedals setup, and regularly read up on the cars' and tracks' real-life counterparts along with articles on how to drive faster and tune cars for racing. I consider myself obsessed with motorsport now, and I'm sure that when I get the wheel and pedals it's only going to get worse (better?). NB: I also went back and tried Forza 4 and F1 2012 for comparison. It is much easier to drive fast in Forza but I'm pretty sure that's the more forgiving physics model. Assetto Corsa is less forgiving but I feel it is more realistic and therefore I get into it more; it seems like I can make some rather serious mistakes in Forza and they won't matter. To me, F1 2012 actually doesn't seem that bad compared to Forza; it seems like the cars act like they do on TV. There is a fair amount of skill transfer to the Formula Abarth in Assetto Corsa, and F1 2012's video run-through's of tracks also help.			"

The photo mode is Spectacular!!!! You can change everything in it!, change the daylight and sun position, making it perfect for simulating morning pictures, This game is spectacular, i have only a very short time on it for now, but ill make a new review as i go along. This game is worth every dollar. I paly with a gamepad, so my experiences isnt the best but its drivable. best would be a G27 wheel.10/10!			"

I drive the lotus 98T without any driver assists except ABS and it gets my heart pumping and hands start to sweat when racing with others online. In the rift you can really ""Feel"" the G's as the car goes into a corner or when doing an inertia drift. I play this over Project Cars because of how the cars feel. The lotus 98t is much more manuverable in Assetto Corsa and even sounds awesome with the turbo spooling up and down. If you buy it you wont regret it.			"

								It is the best racing game I have ever felt with my racing wheel, it is just SO GOOD. I don't know if i have ever felt so synced to a game like in this one, it just feels amazing! I've had all Gran Turismos and played Forza loads of times and I have always wanted a game similar to Forza on Xbox or GT on Playstation and I think I finally got it. The Menus look ASTONISHING! The GUI on this is just awesome and I can't wait for the multiplayer and for more cars to be released. I am really looking forward for this, by far the best racing game on PC whatsoever.-Fatal1ty.

well, before you read this review, let me ask you a question: Assetto Corsa or rFactor 2? i say Assetto Corsa, here's why:Pros:-Very active devs-Mods-Great graphics (not best tho.)-Pretty good cars that come with the game-The Dream Packs and the Japanese Car Pack just add to the fun, notably Dream Pack 1, which adds the Nurburgring.-Mods.-Incredibly fun with a wheel, but it can be fun with a controller too, since its actually well optimized [at least i think it is.]-Did i mention mods enough? yes? alright. because i can't stress enough how much you need to get mods if you buy the game, the vast majority of them adds to the experience so much.-Runs smoothly on my current setup (GT 730 with a 2.40GHz CPU, 32-bit OS. able to run almost max graphic settings w/o PP)Neutral (consider these pros or cons for yourself)-May get boring quick you if you just do hotlaps. there are challenges though-Sound quality on some of the stock cars sound par despite them sounding like they do in real life.Cons:-Dead multiplayer to a degree.-AI that leaves much to be desired (e.g pass in front of a car. the AI hits the brakes full-on, not always though),-the price for this and all the DLC is $81 (plus tax), and rising somewhat slowly, so buy 'em now before it gets way too expensive-Career that has lots of potential for improvement, but ignored.\Notes:-DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME WITH A KEYBOARD! it's terrible. don't.-I recommend using a steering wheel. you will not regret it,			"

								This is with out a doubt, the best ever driving simulation ever released to date, this one ticks ALL the boxes for me and I would reccomend this simulation to anyone looking for that realistic driving feeling on a computer. I would reccomend using a wheel and even possibly a cockpit type setup so as to achieve a comfortable driving poisition because once you start driving this gem you will not want to stop :)			"

If you're a fan of iRacing, this game will be a great fit, if you're more of an F1 2013 fan expect huge loss in tire grip, but a challenging and rewarding drive when you get it right.  If you want AI racing or multiplayer, hold off till the summer sale or the full release of the game, but all in all, I'm glad I purchased this game.			"

Currently what appears to be the most accurate driving simulator available, it's also one of the best looking, and certainly the one with the best feeling. Laser scanned tracks and superb physics ensures that even the smallest bump is felt, so if you have a good wheel, prepare for an amazingly fun ride that just gets better, the better you get!			"

								The best driving sim on the market, it's as close to realism as you get in terms of car physics. This game is a joy to play.I'm looking forward to the multiplayer being released for it, since it's still in development, and that will be the main point of the game. So still can't say much about some parts of the game.One of the best things about this game is that it loads up extremely fast on even my older computer, I'm astounded by how well it's been coded, compared to other games which take an age and aren't graphically comparable at all. What magic did they embue in this game to get the loading times.			"

								""Sometimes, things in the game make more sense than in real life."" - GzExcept this isn't a game.Assetto Corsa is (at the time of writing) early access and it still impresses me at every turn. The driving physics are very close to reality, save for dying. Most AAA racing titles out today are mostly arcade influenced and stretch reality quite a bit. I frequently hear the Forza series and Gran Turismo cited as very good sims, but they have nothing on this. Those games are built for gamepad controllers, not full steering wheels like Assetto Corsa. This is more about you, the car, and the track.It's hard to recommend this because it's not really a GAME. It's an honest to reality simulator. If any of you have played the Need for Speed series, Forza, Gran Turismo, or other popular racing series, it's time to relearn what it means to drive. I also gave F1 2012 or whatever it was a try and Assetto Corsa's Formula 1 physics are just superior. Test Drive Unlimited 2's driving physics aren't really physics to begin with, mostly a social vehicle game. I think I like Assetto Corsa even more than I would have initially thought because I had preordered GRID 2 before ASC. I was in shock how arcadey GRID 2 was and how close to reality Asetto Corsa was. Also, ASC supports Occulus Rift and Triple Screen setups. I can't vouch for Occulus Rift, but the triple screen setup is also the absolute best I've ever seen EVER. Instead of most games just running the math for a vertical FOV with the horizontal screens adjusting and then moving HUD elements around, Assetto Corsa actually uses multiple cameras. One camera for each monitor. The setup asks for some measurements so that the setup works seamlessly. It asks for screen width in millimeters, side screen angles (0-90 degrees), distance from viewer in millimeters, and bezel size. After fiddling with the numbers for 20 minutes, I got it set perfectly. It felt like I was IN the car, sitting IN the cockpit. Other racing games just stretch the FOV and the A pillar ends up devouring the entire left monitor in LHD cars.If you're equipped with a gamepad and are considering purchasing Assetto Corsa, I hear the gamepad support is pretty good. Other games by default 'dampen' input because of how twitchy the car would actually be if it pushed the input directly and then proceed to spin out. I recommend a full steering wheel AT LEAST with lever shifters. I HIGHLY recommend getting a wheel with a clutch pedal because driving with absolutely no assists like automatic clutch is an absolute nightmare. Driving without a clutch pedal with no automatic clutch is exactly emulative of driving a car with a ripped up clutch plate, shredded teeth and all. I also recommend a wheel with more than 180 degrees full rotation. Wheels get pricey though, so don't worry about buying a G27 or a T500 just yet.I'll probably edit this review as the game develops.What I'm trying to say is 10/10 Hell yeah.			"

												Great racing sim. Even better is the game is constantly being developed further. (new cars, tracks, optimising the vehicle dynamics and etc) Thanks for the good work developers. Tip for new comers to tame oversteering cars, make the front more reactive and rear more stable by: 1) reduce the rear tyre pressures and increase the fronts by a couple of psi. 2) Increase the toe angles for both rear and front (go towards positive). 3) In case the car has dampers, springs and anti roll bar settings increase the fronts and reduce the backs.

If you brake too hard and lock up the tires too much you can feel the flat spot with force feedback if you have a wheel. This game is great. the tracks and cars all feel great. The Nurburgring especially feels great. the high definition laser scanning really makes the track feel awesome. it's insane how bumpy the track is. it really adds to the thrill of racing there.  "

I regret that someone bought this for me.0/10, this is one of the worst devs I've ever interacted with.No joke.Buy Factorio (20 euro, 350 MB) and go play that while your Assetto Corsa or rFactor, if that's any better? torrent downloads, those guys actually deserve money.

The Nurburgring especially feels great. the high definition laser scanning really makes the track feel awesome. it's insane how bumpy the track is. it really adds to the thrill of racing there.  "

												I love the level of detail in this game. The LaFerrari for example has a drainable battery. drive too long without braking and the battery will be drained. When this happens the engine becomes much less powerful and less responsive with less instantaneous torque. If you brake too hard and lock up the tires too much you can feel the flat spot with force feedback if you have a wheel. This game is great. the tracks and cars all feel great.

												This game is difficult for me. I never was a fan of racing sims, I play with a controller and I can keep the car on road but it is still really difficult to abide all the rules and actually finish the race. I recommend it to people who like sims but for me it just slightly difficult. And I realised soon enough that this is not a game I'd like to play when I get time, So I got a refund. Go Ahead and try it. The Car handling, graphics and audio are really good. A Good ""Racing Sim"" not meant for casual players like me. The 1.3 Hours I played were frustrating and maybe a little bit fun.I got the game+Dream packs because I was really thinking that this game is a good game for me and I might end up playing it more than other games but that didn't turned out to be true. Get the porsche packs too, Just too many awesome cars in it and World's best racing tracks. :(			"

												So i tested another car game.PROS.First of all, i have a gamepad (no room for a wheel, no room for a F1 seat, no room for pedals, no room for 3 screens).After 2 hours of configuration and testing, it is playable for powerfull RWD with stability controls at 80% and very tuned gamepad stuff. Playable means you can exit turns in full counter steering, metal to the pedal.Amazing, this is the first game i achieve that on gamepad. Very good, a must have.PC Graphic engine is fine, run fast, do the job.Sounds are ok and do the job too.GUI is ok too, you can customize some stuff, good.Configurations are ok.Well done indeed.BALANCEDAfter that, the game is DLC land (cars and tracks). Ok, acceptable, i was aware.The front train grip seems to be poor and understeer a lot (i am not sure you can avoid understeering even with car tuning)CONSAnd, as usual, we finish by the ultimate failure at this stage (after half a day of testing).The multiplayer.Ok servers seems to have Minorating (good good)But the game online server screen is totally broken.As said, i play game pad, stability control at 80% (otherwise i cannot play with pleasure and will blast other people doing donuts).So how do you select servers with stability control ON ? By connecting to the server....How can you fail so easily after making 95% of the work fine?Ok may be there is tools / mods to achieve this somewhere, but guys, are you really serious?  You can filter compatible DLC but not assists?I should find a league, but i assume i will only found integrists playing wheels in a F1 cockpit + 12 pedals with assists OFF for everything (so i can't play)...Whatever i recommand, it's playable on gamepad.

												Thought it time to write this.One of the best sims out there (yes, it is a sim). Some may criticize that fact that Assetto Corsa is a fully paid game and has still been in development, but to me that is a good thing to have in a game. It allows well-educated and thought through opinions to be shared amongst a larger community, rather than have a length of secret development and a short Beta that gives no full look at issues. Meaning that there is no shock-horror when a game is released swiming in glitches and bugs up to it's eye lids. I love how open the developers are about changes they make, and when updates and patches are set to be released. It helps.Great visuals with good performance (fps, etc) even on my semi-gaming machine that struggles with most new gaming titles. Physics are always going to be debated, but I don't race all kinds of cars in real life to have that knowledge of true car physics. For me the FFB and handling works and feels perfect on my CSWv2 wheel.Mods! Although mods aren't really a review of this game, the ablity to add mods has made Assetto Corsa even more fun to race in as the original list of tracks and cars does leave something to be desired.Downsides are that the online can feel a little hollow without any goal to work towards e.g. rank / license (good that there are so many private servers and events). Also, the fact that the game is so popular on Steam can attract some frustratingly incompetent drivers and some deliberately annoying..uh..people ('let's use that word, yeah'). I guess that's all part of the package in any online game you get.All in all, the most open and available sim out there that you can buy. "

												There is not much to add to all what is written here about the game.Very nice hotlap-simulator and pretty good online racing.Not a real ""game""-mode with a real career and so on, but there are challenges to do (some outdated). If you don't buy this game for AI racing i highly recommend it. If you want AI racing it's still nice, but there are better options.Can be expensive with all the dlc, but they are fairly priced imho and you can wait for a sale.			"

								I have never played a Racing Sim before, at least none of the hardcore ones.  I already thought games like F1 2012 and the Dirt games were hard already. GT always looked boring thus why i never tried it.  However, Car games in general interested me to some point.I found Assetto Corsa one day.  Played it for a few hours and absolutely fell in love with it.  I knew I had to wait for a few more updates before buying it.  The wait was worth it.  When 0.6.2 released, i bought the game to support the developers.Assetto Corsa is an incredible SIM, with great mechanics, graphics and gameplay.  The menu is a pc gamers heaven.  I am waiting anxiously for the next updates and for it to hit MP.  However, I am absolutely glad i bought the game to support it because its potential is infinite.  Its already better than any other racing game ive played and i know a lot of people agree with this sentiment.  Kudos to Kunos for creating this marvel.  Lets hope they continue hard at work with it.  Good luck, and if in doubt, trust me.  It is an investment worth making.			"

								If you are looking to experience the finest in European GT, supercar, and tuner car performance, look no further than Assetto Corsa. Though still in beta, the comparability of accurately modelled autos and laser scanned tracks endlessly rewards the driver. I haven't played a sim until this one where the single player mode was as intense as the MP. The reward is the driving experience, not graphics or gimmicky features like massive careers, money, or upgrades. YOU control the only upgrade the game has to offer: your developing skill as a race driver. If you've enjoyed watching the European series like Blancpain, WEC, etc. this game will not disappoint.

												Assetto Corsa and Rfactor 2 make all other sims seem like they're a generation behind in the force feedback department. The physics are also spot on as well, but to me, force feedback is in a way more important than physics. Force feedback is the way we connect with the sim, it's how we drive. What good would the physics be without the FFB to back it up??? That's exactly where iracing gets it wrong, great physics but bad FFB. pCars and GT6 have it the other way around, good FFB but not the best physics. Assetto Corsa nails them both (physics and FFB) while also having great graphics for a PC sim and a better group of base content than any other sim that isn't also on consoleIf you love sim racing, there's no way you can live on without buying this.

								Now because Assetto Corsa isn't a fully finished product, I won't be too critical about any problems it has... But I think it's good to mention what the developers have done well... So;Let's start with the sounds, and oh boy they're great! So great that you just want to keep turning the volume up on your speakers until they hit 11! I really like the work they've done with it. The graphics are also very good, it's really nice to see the refulections of your dashboard on the Windscreen which obscures your visability (just like in real life). As well as that, the physics are very good, much better than a lot of SimRacers out there!I think the Multiplayer will become something really great, even if it is a tiny bit unreliable and hard to navigate currently in Beta Form. I also look forward to the larger variety of cars that the developers have planned! This was money well spent!			"

												If you're looking for a racing simulator that offers a ""true to real life experience"" - look no further. Assetto Corsa offers top notch car handling and force feedback - truly the best one out there yet!The selection of cars is wide and won't dissappoint, although there is a clear focus on Italian brands.. I wonder why (Kunos Simulazioni - Italian developers) :DAs for the racing tracks, fear not; all the classics are available - Nürnbergring Nordschleife, SPA and so forth..Aesthetically speaking, the car models are stunning and the audio mindblowing!A HUGE variety of cameras ensures diversity and possibilities for every player out there.The sole drawback I can come to think of is the visual damage model.Don't misunderstand me - there is everything from tyre wear to component damage in Assetto Corsa.Coming from Racedriver: GRID - almost anything is disappointing, but adding a more realisticvisual damage model in this simulator would truly add up to the immersion and experienceinstead of just having a broken windshield after a 200 km/h crash..Pairing this simulator up with the Logitech G27 is a dream - 10/10 - I highly recommend!

								Written after RC 1.0.0Kudos to Kunos > This is the best racing sim I have ever played and I'm into this genre since MGPRS2. Amazing physics, tracks, graphics, playability (playing with an x1 controller), simply outclasses every other wannabe-sim, GJ guys, I would gladly pay the double for such a gem !I cant even describe how I feel about the game. You cant ""feel"" it from the screenshots or the videos. You have to play it by yourself to understand what rarity this game is. If you are into racing and like simulations, this is the best one to get, there's no doubt about it.What I love most about the game is to drive competitive on RSR, which is a mod for this game and is just ideal for hotlaping. The car handling is very rewarding and there is a thin line between ideal breaking and pushing and locking your brakes or slowing down too early and loosing a TON of time. I actually never played a more rewarding game then this one, the Delta function lets you know how fast you currently are compared to your best time and there is always room for improvement. To really master a corner (yea, believe me there's much more to it to be able to say that you've mastered a course :D ) it takes a lot of practice and every car acts differently.That's the other thing, the cars. Believe me, THIS game doesn't need 100+ cars. Every car feels different and you can really tell the difference between an F40 and any other car (of course with all the assists off). Some of the memorable experiences driving the cars in this game definitely include the F40, 458 GT2, Lotus 98T, La Ferrari, Mercedes SLS AMG, Pagani Huayra, KTM Xbow R and many more.The tracks, they are laser-scanned, what else is there to say? There's not much you could do any better, since they are like 1:1 copies to real life. Bumps and every uneven part, its there ... If you add the superb physics of this game (track conditions, tyres, tyre wear and temperature) you get the closest 1:1 experience currently available.Many moan about the graphics. I'm not much into this discussion because I still think that this game has way better graphics then pCars (in pCarsthe cars are just too shiny and the model is made brighter on purpose just to be ""shiny"", just have a close look in comparisons).My favorite comparison, you'd be the judge, just look at the corner drive through at 1mins03secs and watch the lightning and reflections:

			Comparativa de gráficos y sonido entre Assetto Corsa 1.0 RC y Project CARS. Es una vuelta al atardecer en el circuito de Spa-Francorchamps con el Mercedes SLS AMG GT3 en ambos.		

After 1.0.0 a lot changed and its really an eyecandy now, ofc. with the correct filter and on full graphics. I play it in 2K with DSR on and I can tell you I could do screenshots of this game till I'd run out of HDD space ...I'm giving this game 10/10 cause its the best in its class (simulation) and I haven't found another game which would give me such a feeling from driving a car. I'm simply amazed :)			"

Having recently tried Raceroom Racing Experience (and seriously disliked the physics), I had little faith in Assetto Corsa, but decided to try it anyways due to the good reviews. All I can say is WOW. The physics are nearly spot on! I have played Live for Speed for a long time, and have revered it as the best game in term of physics. This game is a close second for me currently, and before long, it will probably overtake LFS in terms of physics. In the graphics department, it has already surpassed, as well as in the car selection. The little details make me happy as well, such as changing gear ratios. Instead of being able to pick any number for the ratio, you can only use realistic ratios that would exist on a real car. Pretty neat. Definately worth the money I paid, especially when we will have content releases up until 2018!			"

								Being a huge racing sim lover and seeing this on steam i was like OMG! .... Comming from playing games mostly developed by SimBin i didnt know what to expect from this title with Kunos Simulazioni being a pretty small dev team but damn! This simulator /game is insane, Amazing graphics(if your system can handle the game at max settings) Laser scanned tracks, The car sounds are like ear porn & the car handling is just fantastic.There is also three different settings of driving realism to cater for everybody, From novice right through to pro settings.Im playing with a Logitech Driving Force GT wheel, Its really responsive, The force feed back feels as good as anything ive ever played.There aint alot of cars and tracks too choose from ATM but theres definitely enough too keep you intested and the game is being updated regularly.If your looking for a good driving simulator then this is for you!

								Damn right i recommend this game ! Besides waiting several years not only for Assetto corsa but for me what has been a lull of several years in advancement with racing technology. Finally Kunos has delivered. And the package whilst not quite complete Screams importance to the racing simulation community in more ways than you can imagine,""Have you head that Pagani Zonda?"". A trully tremendous attention to detail in what has become a niche genre. Never the less the streamlined approach and delivery of the simulation is most certainly open to the more casual of player too. Quite remarkable and Thanks Kunos.			"

Life sucks.Cars with paddles that can only be shifted with H pattern..BMW M3 i think it wasI've been trying to get my feet to move..no mods for that somehow. Maybe my character is paralyzed. I will research this matter more extensively by poking myself in the legs with a pin while playing.Japanese pack is great, sushi is alright tooGet Dream Pack 1 no matter what for laser scanned NordschleifeOnline lobby system could use work..a bit confusing to navigate. Maybe I'm just stupidIf I use a big word soon, they might think I'm not stupid.Sometimes my settings for wheel inputs (G27) are deleted for no apparent reason.Go to Assetto Corsa Club, a Russian website (its safe, trust me..I'm your friend out here) for free modsAlmost all the user reviews are in Russian, but the site has Whiteboy mode with standardized ratings for contentGet the Koeniggsegg One:1 for spinout simulatorGood game-Boy with scissors "

												The actual driving of the cars is good, but this is about it. The game is NOT fun at all, and I mean in the sense that everthing is so frustratingly complicated, Menus, Multiplayer, settings etc. Trying to host a server is a pain in the butt you need to have a degree in IT. I have come to the point that I am not playing anymore due to the fact that I cannot have a proper racing session with my friends. Project cars is more simpler, even though not as realistic, but at the end of the day it does not matter.			"

												I can't play any other racing game after this one. Problem is car handling feels dull and boring. So i assume this is the best car game i played so far.Some other stuff: there are not many tracks and garage could be a little bigger, but current amount of cars is enough. You can install track or car mods though. Devs also update the game with new cars and tracks(for free and as DLC)There are lot's of settings for a car or game itself. I'm sure you can configure it as you want.Graphics ain't something special, but it gets the job done. There are also ways to configure post process filters so you can make colors brighter, add some contrast, saturation, etc. I did that and game looks like an eyecandy for me.Multiplayer lacks custom lobby host -> you always gotta find a server to play with your friend.Well... What can i say? A good racing game that pretends to be simulator. I never played sim racing games so i can't tell you if it's realistic enough or not, but it's definetely more challanging than Grid, Crew, TDU, any NFS game.So as long as Project Cars never coming out and being delayed every month... Better get this game, because you can actually get it and play.			"

Posted: February 13, 2015
												Update November 2015:=======================As of the newest version 1.34 the game still has the most annoying flaws I mentioned in my original review. These are jaggy shadows, really bad anti aliasing, moiré effects on the guard-rails, flickering polygon edges, only basic skin variations for some cars and so on. So I still can't recommend the game until you can grap it for 10 bucks.Original Review:=======================Missing content that is normally standard for a racing game, incomplete features, bugs and texture as well as shadow flickering are the reasons why prolonged fun is difficult to come by in this game and why I can't recommend it as of now (v1.04). By my mind this game is as of v1.04 in in a beta state and should not have been released like this.In Detail:I expect from a racing game that advertises fully featured single player modes at least one thing and that is that I will be able to race against AI opponents with a field of at least 20 cars that are of the same racing league and where every single car has its own livery. However, this is as of v1.04 not the case in Assetto Corsa!Further, some of the skins that come with the game are very basic like the ones for the RUF Porsche or the Fiat 500 Abarth. They do not have any numbers on them or stickers, nothing, just plain single- or bi- colored paintjobs. Makes it difficult to drive in a pack of say 20 and differentiate who is who without turning on hovering driver names over the cars.Besides those missing basic features this game has other serious problems with flickering shadows and moiré effects on the guard-rails. Unfortunately no configuration settings so far could fix it and the devs do seem to ignore the issue on the official forums so there is no help for it there either. By the way I am playing on a GTX 970.Other problems are related to performance issues specifically the game displaying a warning about the CPU occupation above 95% but when I check the performance records in the Windows 7 Resource Monitor I can see that my CPU shows just 50% usage. Again no help in the official forums could be found even though several threads for the issue exist.On top of that a lot of small bugs are very annoying like brake bias that sometimes will not adjust when I press the button for it or the game crashing when I try to assign a function to the ^-key on my keyboard and so on.So as of now the fun, even so it sometimes is there when the game works for some time as one would expect, goes away very fast because of the small anoyances that in the sum are just to much to keep it going.

												I've had this game since it was released in early access. I play using a Logitech G27.The only positive that comes to mind is the graphics, although the environments are completely static so it seems as though time is frozen.Its missing many features that a racing game requires to call itself a racing game.All of that can be excused if the driving was top notch but I must say the driving is just a bore.Do yourself a favour and get something else.

								This game is definitely one of the best racing simulators available right now. Project CARS funding is closed for the moment, Raceroom Racing Experience has a way too abusive paying system and besides those titles, you may only find older games like GTR2 or GT Legends entertaining enough if you are looking for serious racing. But this game isnt good, because there are no alternatives. Its good, because the developers are listening to the community and are quite experienced in creating beautifully recreated cars and tracks.Who am I to judge this? I have driven some Formula Student Cars (FSG) which means i got to know how, at least, amateur racing feels like. The pure feeling of the car, riding 60 mph trough a corner only 2 inches above the ground. Your breathing gets heavier every time you get excited to go in the next corner, knowing that you need to stick just a little more to the left to improve your time...And this is what Assetto Corsa delivers. The feeling of a racecar and a racetrack. The passion to go a little further everytime, to set a new hotlap. The passion to drive towards perfection.Knowing that even Oculus Rift support is on the way makes me giggle in excitement.For a Racing Simulator: 10/10			"

												This is that special game in my library that I usually download first after a clean Steam install, is always on my hard-drive without exception, and is the first thing I reach for most nights after work when I'm coming home to unwind.On the arcade/simulation spectrum, Assetto Corsa is almost exclusively simulation. There are almost no arcade elements, so your enjoyment of this title is likely to depend on what you are looking for specifically. I feel like AC is really best suited to the time trial driver, rather than competitive racer, though competitive racing online or in career mode are options too. Still, I would say that this is best for OCD maniac who is trying to lose 500ms off his or her best time, on a course that's been driven a thousand times with the same car.    The attention to detail in the cars and tracks is extraordinary, as are the physics. Turning the settings to 'Pro' will probably create the most authentic experience that you can get shy of the real thing, especially if you have a force-feedback racing wheel and VR setup (I don't personally but only because I don't want 100 cables strewn across my living room floor). For those who have a setup like that, the only thing you would be missing are the G-forces, but otherwise your mind will make it real in the Matrix. There aren't enough good things to say about this game, and the Devs who make it.			"

												This is quite possibly the most accurate racing/driving simulator currently available to the general public.  The track surfaces and car handling dynamics have extraordinary fidelity that makes the cars feel alive.  It also has the most realistic force feedback I've ever felt through my Thrustmaster TX 458.It's a little light on features, content, gameplay, AI, multiplayer etc. but this is early access and the driving shows so much potential that you can forgive it.  I'd rather drive something like this than a game that's highly polished and is loaded with content but the driving model has less fidelity.The graphics are very good in general but the lighting etc. can look ugly at times and is nowhere near as polished and perfect as something like Forza 5.Sounds are first class and the UI is very clever albeit a bit too mouse-focused.  (I like menus that are controllable with my G27's D-Pad)Highly recommended for anyone that loves the sheer joy of driving cars and pushing them to the limit.			"

												This game has the best driving physics out there. Period. You really need to try it to believe it.I first became interested in this game way back when I saw an in-game video showing a player doing some very aggressive driving with high oversteer / drifting. It all looked so believable and unlike anything that games like Project Cars / Forza / Gran Turismo can deliver.Having bought the game and played almost 100h, I must say, the driving physics is something else. There is a tangible sense of tire grip, weight shift (under braking and in corners) as well as detailed camber and suspension modelling that is felt when cornering and attacking curbs. The most notable difference to games like Project Cars / Gran Turismo is how well the game simulates loss of grip on tarmac (drifting). Somehow they have managed to simulate this very convincingly, which makes it natural for the player to catch mid-corner oversteer. It somehow feels more natural to drive and correct slides (compared to similar realistic games) when driving over the limit or applying too much throttle, all this without being ""arcady"".All cars in the game have a distinctive feel to them (and they keep adding new ones through DLC). As an example, older race cars generally tend to understeer into the corner and you have to enter the corner in such a way that you can apply throttle before the apex and oversteer throughout the corner to be competitive. Epic. Modern cars have clearly better handling and either understeers or oversteers. The great physics of Assetto Corsa is best experienced with older cars and soft suspension.Needless to say, this game should not be played with gamepad/keyboard. I use a Thrustmaster 300RS wheel fitted to a Playseats GT seat.The weak points of the game relates to the career mode (non-existent, although they did add custome championships) and the AI that could and should be better (I don't have a problem with them after the first corner, but they keep braking in weird places and changing driving lines erratically prior to the first corner -> often leading to several restarts).I play mainly the ""Special Events"" included in the game, which revolve around either Racing (5 laps starting last) / Timetrial / Drifting / Drag. Most cars have their own special event, so this way you have to familiarize yourself with all of them. To win a race at Alien difficulty or to achieve Gold in timetrial (in pro mode) really requires skill and a decent car setup. Sometimes when driving flat out with the default setup, you find out that you should still improve 2 sec a lap to be competitive, which means that you need to make major improvements to your setup as well as rethink braking points and where to attack curbs. When you do win, there is a tremendeous sense of achievement and you get one ore more steam achievements.Verdict: The physics in the game is very believable and this game sets a new standard for realistic driving simulators. Howerver, the ""game side"" is seriously lacking and in its current state the game is a bit of a hotlap / short race simulation, which is a shame. I would've really liked to have a career mode in it like Project Cars and the ingredients are ther for a nice BMW Cup or Porsche Cup. But... having driven Assetto Corsa for a while now, there is really no going back to the likes of Project Cars / Gran Turismo (my favourite games before) "

With this the cars feel alive and ready to bite back at you at any time.With the I've spent hours chasing down the Stig's time on Imola and really got a deeper respect for that man. :)Just wish I had more time to plough into this.

												I loved going through early access, and it was amazing from the start! A 10 out of 10 for the devs, as this game will beat most racing sims out there, and that this seems like brand new devs, since I have never heard of them before. I wasn't fond of the game when I first heard about it, since it was from a dev I didn't know. But when it came out on early access, I couldn't resist it, and I bought it! It was fun going through early access!A great game for all race sim fans out there!			"

								Currently there are only a few modes to drive in but as stated they will be getting more modes/cars/tracks later (I'm looking forward to the Lotus Type 125.) Driving around in the Lotus Exige & Elise was pretty fun on Mugello. Good cameras on replays (actual racing views, not that closeup arcade crap.) There is a lot of good telemetry within the replays to assist you get better or simply just fun to look at.Nice graphics and car sounds. From the screeching of tires to the pebbles after you go offcourse. Good handling on both of the cars from my perspective. I heard they will be raising the price upon launch and IMO it will definitely be worth the money once they put in Multiplayer, ai & career mode.I have a Fanatec GT3R w/ Logitech G25 drivers and it worked really well, I just assigned a few extra buttons around (looking left/right/handbrake/etc.) My clubsport pedals worked fine with the game, I just had to invert gas/brakes and use automatic clutch (I use paddleshifters.)

												Assetto Corsa is the second PC sim I have tried out, I am no stanger to car racing games with a history of GT and Forza. This sim feels the best for car control and predictability, if you are a fellow sim racer like me, it is well worth the money.One of the best features of the sim is the ability to add mods, or create mods yourself and play them. In the last month and a half I have obtained over 100 additional cars and about 50-75 tracks that were not included in the game, all at zero cost!You are not forced to grind in career mode to buy cars, simply pick a car and a track, and you are ready to rock and roll.Again the cars feel great, the tracks look great, and with a wheel the experience is amazing.

								When a PC game says simulates, the developers  try to live up to it.This game will take practice, that doesn't mean someone cannot just jump in and feel good. yet once you start this and give your senses time to adjust from the arcade like driving you may have tried before, driving becomes a skill again and a pleasure. No two of your  laps are the same, each car has to be handled differently. Turn your graphics up, and enjoy, immerse yourself.I currently only play with a X360 controller, I am saving for a steering wheel. Why? (I have had steering wheels in the past, enjoyed using them, and yet when my last broke I looked and thought why do I need one nothing out there remotely tries to be real any more) this game may not need it, but deserves one. If the team in Italy made a steering wheel and full chasis and wrap around screens, I would be saving for a while, but I would trust they would deliver as they are doing with this game.If you want quick thrills, feel like your a racing god without effort, haven't driven a real car yet, I suggest you do not let yourself down and go else where.What gets many purring like an engine is in the detail, you may not see it, but believe me it's there. Check out some youtube footage, these cars and curcuits aren't copied and pasted, they are constructed and laser scanned.Just remember this isn't a juggernaut company, trying to please everyone and get your money. It's a team of passionate people, who love cars, love racing, and they have a vision and dare to share. They already have some famous and well respected car makers on board, and more are coming.  They have laser scanned tracks, and have more permissions to do so. Just join and learn with us all, and encourage it to be even better.			"

												This game, compared to Rfactor 2, iRacing, GSCE and the like, in my opinion, is superior. The sounds are better than all, using Fmod. The graphics are very good, definitely better than the rest, and even comparable to Project Cars, which isnt a sim. The driving and tire physics are well on par and even surpass the rest of the sims, while collisions are sub-par, but will probably get fixed in the future. While AI are slow, they may provide a challenge to novice drivers, and train them to drive more carefuly.Overall, this game is a good 9/10.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Car physics 10/10Tire physics 9.5/10Collision physics 7/10Modding ability 10/10Dev support 10/10			"

								Bought this game as soon as i acquired myself the Logitech G27.This is not a game for whimps, the AI is ruthless, flooring it like you would do in Gran Turismo and Forza is stupid in most cases.The cars veer of the road and tires squeel constantly as you furiously give full throttle like an imbecile, you just have to think realistic.The modelling, graphics, physics and relentless AI makes this the best driving game i have ever played. The AI profiles does not end up in the same position every single race, they crash, spin out and compete like you the player does!This being an ""indie"" game is completely beyond me, as everything with it screams great, and beats every AAA ""racing sim"" back to the stone age.I would recommend this game if you have some racing wheel and pedals. Do also bear in mind that this game is early access and features in the game will be tweaked, refined or removed\added !			"

Early Access Review
								I literally built a simulator in anticipation of the release of this title. With that being said, I am both completely in love with it, and disgusted by it at the same time. Why?When you get the game running the way it should (for a little while at least) It's freaking amazing. I own practically every racing game there is to date, and the handling, physics, and graphics are awe inspiring. Coming from iRacing, it feels far more real. You don't just lose traction randomly. It feels very realistic. You can counter steer, downshift, or drift to recover from a little too much meat in the sandwich coming to a turn, which is awesome, and it feels like it should. I drove patrol cars at high speeds for many years, and I can tell you the induced skid feels genuine. The recovery, depending on the particular car is there too. Bottom line, amazing, outstanding game, and when it gets close to release I am sure it will put a lot of other titles to bed.Now for why I hate it.I run an AMD 8 core 4.2ghz machine, with 16gb of ram, and 2 ATI HD7870's in Crossfire.. Logitech G27, triple Asus 1080p Monitors, and so on.. My system is pretty outstanding. When you load up to play, the video options are sort of useless. There are options you've never seen in any game before, that you won't understand. I still don't. The most common options aren't there. What the problem is, in case you have it, is HDR. Apparently, with the AMD drivers that are currently available, (Including the new Beta drivers I got last night) They simply can't use the in-game HDR. What happens? This absolutely disgusting flickering, not only accross the entire screen, but also on all shaded objects. It took me forever to figure out that it was the HDR doing it. Turning off HDR and turning the faces thing to an even number fixed it for me, but I feel like I am missing a lot by not being able to use those options. With 2 $500 video cards, you'd think you'd be able to beef everything up.. Not in this case. I'm sure they'll fix it eventually, so don't let that issue stop you from picking it up. The gameplay is fantastic, and well worth the money if you are a sim racer. Also, the selection of cars currently available is pretty outstanding as well. Keep in mind, this is a euro based game, though they will offer us a C7 Corvette soon, which is pretty awesome. I give the game a 9 out of 10, and it's not a 10 solely for the reason that it is still in development, and has a lot of bugs. It crashes often for me, sometimes completely locking my system up, but again, I get it. It's in development. It's the price you pay for getting in early. I've done a ton of alpha and beta testing since 1999, so I am used to it, but for someone that is freaked out by that stuff, or gets angry easily, maybe you should wait until the full release. Whether you choose to get it today, or down the road when it's complete, get it. It's awesome. Even with it's bugs, having to reset my PC 12x a day, I still play it, and I still enjoy the hell out of it. It's awesome. Get it.			"

								Best racing simulation at the moment.I've played and enjoyed throughout the years most of the simulators  available in the market (rfactor, GTR2,  gsc, iracing, race07 series, etc.)  and also the new titles. Truth is, I cannot go back to any of them because they simply feel... lacking. The sense of immersion is incredible (physics-wise), I have never driven anything that feels so close to the real thing (or at the very least that gives me the illusion that I am driving a real sports car). Ever since I started playing Asseto, I can't drive anything else because I feel disconnected. The feel of the road, the sensation when you are beginning to lose traction, the possibility to regain control... it's difficult to explain, but if not perfect (what is?), they have managed to certainly go in the right direction with this title.The graphics, etc are also pretty convincing, but in this area I would say it has more competition (Project cars or RRRE just to name a few. The sounds are correct but at the time of this writing not final, and they just announced that they are going to change them so they are more  accurate and immersive.Of course, bear in mind that this is early access so that means that there are still things missing (proper race weekends, pit stops, polish multiplayer and AI, etc.) Some of these things are important, others not so much, but at the end of the day, having seen what they have managed to do so far, I am convinced that the result will appeal to a lot of people that love simulations and motor sports.

Early Access Review
								Best racing simulation at the moment.I've played and enjoyed throughout the years most of the simulators  available in the market (rfactor, GTR2,  gsc, iracing, race07 series, etc.)  and also the new titles. Truth is, I cannot go back to any of them because they simply feel... lacking. The sense of immersion is incredible (physics-wise), I have never driven anything that feels so close to the real thing (or at the very least that gives me the illusion that I am driving a real sports car). Ever since I started playing Asseto, I can't drive anything else because I feel disconnected. The feel of the road, the sensation when you are beginning to lose traction, the possibility to regain control... it's difficult to explain, but if not perfect (what is?), they have managed to certainly go in the right direction with this title.The graphics, etc are also pretty convincing, but in this area I would say it has more competition (Project cars or RRRE just to name a few. The sounds are correct but at the time of this writing not final, and they just announced that they are going to change them so they are more  accurate and immersive.Of course, bear in mind that this is early access so that means that there are still things missing (proper race weekends, pit stops, polish multiplayer and AI, etc.) Some of these things are important, others not so much, but at the end of the day, having seen what they have managed to do so far, I am convinced that the result will appeal to a lot of people that love simulations and motor sports.

Every car feels different. It is also playable with a gamepad, but i would recommend to use a wheel. The game is still in development, so you have to expect some glitches, bugs and stuff. The netcode needs some work. Career mode is not very good... theres nothing to motivate you. If you dont want to wait for a pCARS release, buy this one, you wont regret it!			"

												I've owned this game since it's mid-stages during the early access period and I only have good things to say. The game offers everything a true racing simulator needs, it has great physics, a good selection of cars and tracks and an extraordinary amount of customization available, ranging from HUD modifications to modded track and car support. On top of that, devs continue to work on the game after it's release to get rid of bugs, increase performance, improve existing codes and additional content. They also do a great job of keeping their customers informed. If there's one thing I miss and hope to see in the future updates is adjustable weather conditions, other than that - no complaints whatsoever, racing game of the year :)			"

								Is it worth it? YES !!!My experience with racinggames: I started with NFS in 1995, play with a wheel since NFS HP 1998 and like both arcade and simulation. My most enjoyed game is DTM3 as it offered the best competitive online challange to me.At this moment the game is still in Early Access and does not include a multiplayersection yet. It however does offer quite a number of well detailed cars and laserprecise tracks. I'm looking forward to what is coming as the game keeps bonding me even when it is only singleplayer at this moment.Assetto Corsa, the good things:- There is a well detailed custom controller setup- You can tweak your car as expected when getting a racingsimulator- The carhandling is very good. Only Richard Burns Rally offered me a better experience.- You can tweak your videodetails as desired between various steps. The game even runs smooth on my tablet on medium/high quality, without AI. My tablet's CPU and GPU are below the minimum specs as described in the steamstore.- You can turn on/off and position heads up display as you want (and probably add more by installing mods)- The game is mod friendly, user created cars and tracks to be expected.- The game offers extreme detailed functioning HUD's.- The game is a good simulator. For people loving arcade games, the assist functions have the potential to make it a great game aswell, but these functions still need working on.Assetto Corsa, the bad things (alphaa fase):- There is a number of 'holes' in some tracks which penalise you by wrecking your car.- New in this alphaa stage are AI cars, but they tend to use 100% of the CPU on a full grid... (I have 24 cores)- There is no damage model (yet).- Damage does not influence carbehavior (yet).- Assist functions for both wheel and keyboard/gamepad don't allow you to drift when desired, also having difficulties with launching cars and the brakinglines are incorrect.- All cars best launch is full throttle in this game, like you don't lose grip... even with launchcontrol turned off.- Some achievements are too easy, some too difficult. Time Attack, start extreme slow means gold achievement, dragracing full throttle launch is win all, drifting goldcoins are doable, but you need to go sideways all the way instead of driving the tracks which is kind of pointless and you can't achieve it by just driving and drifting in the corners, you need to drift on the straights.I give the game for it's current state a 7/10. A multiplayersection, extra content, damagemodels, fixed assist functions and fixed bugs can seartenly raise that number.			"

								If you have a decent gaming rig and a WHEEL this is a great game. Yes, it is in development, still in early stages.Quite playable and seems a lot more realistic than typical arcade type car games.  I would not buy this if all I had was a keyboard, mouse , or stick/xbox controller. You need a wheel set up.  A G27 Logitech is a sensible choice. Works great with TrackIR5 but needs improvement in that area but is serviceable with that device.  Getting controls set up was a bear but not too bad, as I managed to figure it out. Setup guides on the net for various wheel types.  No default (at present) Logitech MoMo pre-setup support but the MoMo does work with it , tested by me with my old Momo.  If you want a decent experience use recommended minimum PC specs.  Looks great, plays good.

								It's still in early access, but what you get so far is a rather good simulation of racing. It has a very realistic physics model, the force feedback systems (if you have a FFB wheel) are amazing, and each car feels massively different, as well as many assists that can be turned off or on depending on how good you are and how much control you want.For race game enthusiasts like myself, it's worth the price easily, especially considering how much content is yet to be released.HOWEVER.There are some things I hope they improve in the future - for example:1. The engine sounds on the cars are nowhere near as good as they could be, or as I would expect from a game as graphically detailed and realistic as this is. Sound effects as a whole sound a decade old, sometimes more depending on the car, and sometimes less as well. Compared to games such as, say, Shift 2 Unleashed which has extremely well made sound effects, it's a bit lackluster - but a small complaint.2. The cars don't seem to be able to simulate physical damage nor stallouts, outside of a full engine blowout by deliberately shifting into a gear that's too low. However, as I understand this should be coming in the future.Other than these, however, so far the game has come across very nicely and is probably the most realistic simulation out there for racing. I highly recommend it.			"

												This game has the best driving physics out there. Period. You really need to try it to believe it.I first became interested in this game way back when I saw an in-game video showing a player doing some very aggressive driving with high oversteer / drifting. It all looked so believable and unlike anything that games like Project Cars / Forza / Gran Turismo can deliver.Having bought the game and played almost 100h, I must say, the driving physics is something else. There is a tangible sense of tire grip, weight shift (under braking and in corners) as well as detailed camber and suspension modelling that is felt when cornering and attacking curbs. The most notable difference to games like Project Cars / Gran Turismo is how well the game simulates loss of grip on tarmac (drifting). Somehow they have managed to simulate this very convincingly, which makes it natural for the player to catch mid-corner oversteer. It somehow feels more natural to drive and correct slides (compared to similar realistic games) when driving over the limit or applying too much throttle, all this without being ""arcady"".All cars in the game have a distinctive feel to them (and they keep adding new ones through DLC). As an example, older race cars generally tend to understeer into the corner and you have to enter the corner in such a way that you can apply throttle before the apex and oversteer throughout the corner to be competitive. Epic. Modern cars have clearly better handling and either understeers or oversteers. The great physics of Assetto Corsa is best experienced with older cars and soft suspension.Needless to say, this game should not be played with gamepad/keyboard. I use a Thrustmaster 300RS wheel fitted to a Playseats GT seat.The weak points of the game relates to the career mode (non-existent, although they did add custome championships) and the AI that could and should be better (I don't have a problem with them after the first corner, but they keep braking in weird places and changing driving lines erratically prior to the first corner -> often leading to several restarts).I play mainly the ""Special Events"" included in the game, which revolve around either Racing (5 laps starting last) / Timetrial / Drifting / Drag. Most cars have their own special event, so this way you have to familiarize yourself with all of them. To win a race at Alien difficulty or to achieve Gold in timetrial (in pro mode) really requires skill and a decent car setup. Sometimes when driving flat out with the default setup, you find out that you should still improve 2 sec a lap to be competitive, which means that you need to make major improvements to your setup as well as rethink braking points and where to attack curbs. When you do win, there is a tremendeous sense of achievement and you get one ore more steam achievements.Verdict: The physics in the game is very believable and this game sets a new standard for realistic driving simulators. Howerver, the ""game side"" is seriously lacking and in its current state the game is a bit of a hotlap / short race simulation, which is a shame. I would've really liked to have a career mode in it like Project Cars and the ingredients are ther for a nice BMW Cup or Porsche Cup. But... having driven Assetto Corsa for a while now, there is really no going back to the likes of Project Cars / Gran Turismo (my favourite games before) "

												Having a blast with this game. Masterfully done so far. These guys know what cars should look, act, sound, and handle like. By far the best racing/driving sim I've played. 10/10. Don't listen to the negative reviews because the game is still pre-release.  Can't wait for multiplayer and full grid Ai races. Sit down, turn it up, and go!

								This game is definitely one of the best racing simulators available right now. Project CARS funding is closed for the moment, Raceroom Racing Experience has a way too abusive paying system and besides those titles, you may only find older games like GTR2 or GT Legends entertaining enough if you are looking for serious racing. But this game isnt good, because there are no alternatives. Its good, because the developers are listening to the community and are quite experienced in creating beautifully recreated cars and tracks.Who am I to judge this? I have driven some Formula Student Cars (FSG) which means i got to know how, at least, amateur racing feels like. The pure feeling of the car, riding 60 mph trough a corner only 2 inches above the ground. Your breathing gets heavier every time you get excited to go in the next corner, knowing that you need to stick just a little more to the left to improve your time...And this is what Assetto Corsa delivers. The feeling of a racecar and a racetrack. The passion to go a little further everytime, to set a new hotlap. The passion to drive towards perfection.Knowing that even Oculus Rift support is on the way makes me giggle in excitement.For a Racing Simulator: 10/10			"

												This is quite possibly the most accurate racing/driving simulator currently available to the general public.  The track surfaces and car handling dynamics have extraordinary fidelity that makes the cars feel alive.  It also has the most realistic force feedback I've ever felt through my Thrustmaster TX 458.It's a little light on features, content, gameplay, AI, multiplayer etc. but this is early access and the driving shows so much potential that you can forgive it.  I'd rather drive something like this than a game that's highly polished and is loaded with content but the driving model has less fidelity.The graphics are very good in general but the lighting etc. can look ugly at times and is nowhere near as polished and perfect as something like Forza 5.Sounds are first class and the UI is very clever albeit a bit too mouse-focused.  (I like menus that are controllable with my G27's D-Pad)Highly recommended for anyone that loves the sheer joy of driving cars and pushing them to the limit.			"

I wasn't fond of the game when I first heard about it, since it was from a dev I didn't know. But when it came out on early access, I couldn't resist it, and I bought it!

								Bought this game as soon as i acquired myself the Logitech G27.This is not a game for whimps, the AI is ruthless, flooring it like you would do in Gran Turismo and Forza is stupid in most cases.The cars veer of the road and tires squeel constantly as you furiously give full throttle like an imbecile, you just have to think realistic.The modelling, graphics, physics and relentless AI makes this the best driving game i have ever played. The AI profiles does not end up in the same position every single race, they crash, spin out and compete like you the player does!This being an ""indie"" game is completely beyond me, as everything with it screams great, and beats every AAA ""racing sim"" back to the stone age.I would recommend this game if you have some racing wheel and pedals. Do also bear in mind that this game is early access and features in the game will be tweaked, refined or removed\added !			"

Early Access Review
								I literally built a simulator in anticipation of the release of this title. With that being said, I am both completely in love with it, and disgusted by it at the same time. Why?When you get the game running the way it should (for a little while at least) It's freaking amazing. I own practically every racing game there is to date, and the handling, physics, and graphics are awe inspiring. Coming from iRacing, it feels far more real. You don't just lose traction randomly. It feels very realistic. You can counter steer, downshift, or drift to recover from a little too much meat in the sandwich coming to a turn, which is awesome, and it feels like it should. I drove patrol cars at high speeds for many years, and I can tell you the induced skid feels genuine. The recovery, depending on the particular car is there too. Bottom line, amazing, outstanding game, and when it gets close to release I am sure it will put a lot of other titles to bed.Now for why I hate it.I run an AMD 8 core 4.2ghz machine, with 16gb of ram, and 2 ATI HD7870's in Crossfire.. Logitech G27, triple Asus 1080p Monitors, and so on.. My system is pretty outstanding. When you load up to play, the video options are sort of useless. There are options you've never seen in any game before, that you won't understand. I still don't. The most common options aren't there. What the problem is, in case you have it, is HDR. Apparently, with the AMD drivers that are currently available, (Including the new Beta drivers I got last night) They simply can't use the in-game HDR. What happens? This absolutely disgusting flickering, not only accross the entire screen, but also on all shaded objects. It took me forever to figure out that it was the HDR doing it. Turning off HDR and turning the faces thing to an even number fixed it for me, but I feel like I am missing a lot by not being able to use those options. With 2 $500 video cards, you'd think you'd be able to beef everything up.. Not in this case. I'm sure they'll fix it eventually, so don't let that issue stop you from picking it up. The gameplay is fantastic, and well worth the money if you are a sim racer. Also, the selection of cars currently available is pretty outstanding as well. Keep in mind, this is a euro based game, though they will offer us a C7 Corvette soon, which is pretty awesome. I give the game a 9 out of 10, and it's not a 10 solely for the reason that it is still in development, and has a lot of bugs. It crashes often for me, sometimes completely locking my system up, but again, I get it. It's in development. It's the price you pay for getting in early. I've done a ton of alpha and beta testing since 1999, so I am used to it, but for someone that is freaked out by that stuff, or gets angry easily, maybe you should wait until the full release. Whether you choose to get it today, or down the road when it's complete, get it. It's awesome. Even with it's bugs, having to reset my PC 12x a day, I still play it, and I still enjoy the hell out of it. It's awesome. Get it.			"

Early Access Review
								Note: I've only played the early-access ""demo"", and anything I say may be invalid when the game is released.Having said that ... The game is fantastic. Graphics are great, but where the game really shines is the handling, which is, in my opinion, the best I've ever played. Now I'm not a race car driver, but this is the closest I've gotten to my real life car. Turn off all of the assists and drive around the track getting used to each individual car's handling characteristics. And that is the really cool thing about this game. Every car handles completeley different. If the car has downward force with a spoiler, you can really feel the difference. If the car is front wheel drive, you get a very understeer happy car. It's just so much fun playing without assists and trying to perfect each turn with every car. The early access demo has a small selection of very nice cars and a few tracks, but no races with AI opponents, or a career mode, so I can't comment on that yet.Now I wouldn't say I'm a hardcore racing sim fan. I have a g27 attached to my desk, and I'm not using nvidia surround or ati's multi-moniter system. However I have played a LOT of car games. Every Need For Speed up to the original Most Wanted, all of the Dirt titles, the (older) Test Drive games, Grid 1 and 2, Midtown Madness... But non of those games are racing sims.The closest I've played to Assetto Corsa is the Need for Speed Shift games. The first Shift I thought the handling was horrible, and never could get into it. When shift 2 came out I gave it another go, and the handling was better but there were some serious input problems. If you get a mod that fixes that, shift 2 (with all handing assists turned off) is a very solid game and up until now was my favorite racing game. Assetto Corsa has since knocked Shift 2 out of the way, nothing comes close to the sheer joy of minute to minute driving as in Assetto Corsa. So if you like racing games, you can't pass this one up.Here is a video of me trying out the Pagani Zonda R

								I hope the developers see this:So far, i think the game is coming along well, but i feel it still has a while to go before it's ready for the final launch.Here are some things I would like to see changed or improved:I am using a Thrustmaster RGT Force Feedback Clutch wheel. It shakes left and right on straight aways, i would like to see that addressed. I heard someone else had the same problem, but I'm not sure what wheel they had.Being that I am a tight budget gamer, I have not been able to buy an H-Shifter. However, I found a program that lets me use my joystick to associate keys on a keyboard with certain positions. My problem here is that I cannot assign keys to shifter positions. I feel that I should be able to assign any key, button or axis to any control in the game. SimBin's GT Legends was very flexible with assigning controls. I think flexibility is key for racers who have unique setups.I am not sure if this is just my graphics card or not, but I notice a slight delay between when I do something and when the game actually does it. I am using an AMD Radeon HD 5670 card. I plan on upgrading very soon, but I hope that delay will go away at some point. I have also noticed that my wheel seems very sensitive. My wheel turns 270 degrees, but on the tracks with the sharpest turns, I find that I barely use 180 degrees of the 270  I have.Again, I hope the developers see this. I am very optimistic that this game will turn out to be the best racing sim, but as of update 0.4, it is not to my expectations. I hope that it soon will be. Great job so far Kunos Simulation team. I hope you find this helpful.This is now on the discussions page in hope the developers respond to it with some fixes.			"

But after subscribing to that service and realizing how much you have to pay, I unsubscribed from that simulation service. My racing wheel has been in the closet ever since then. I have heard many positive things about Assetto Corsa, so as soon as I saw that it was available, I bought it. Although it is still in beta, my socks are blown off right now. This game takes the cake over all other racing simulators with regard to the amount of flexibility you can adjust your monitor setup to match reality. In this game, I know for sure I am seeing a 1 to 1 relationship with perspective/FOF/Monitor Angles/Monitor Size/Seating Position/ Head Height/Tilt...... This makes the game, in my opinion, because I don't have to second guess reality.			"

								Without doubt, the finest home simulator available to date, and I suspect it will be stay at the top for a good few years.  The closest rivals are lagging behind, and whilst a few have features that Assetto Corsa does not (AI, Multiplayer, Pitstops, Damage...) that's because this is still an Early Access piece of software. Fortnightly updates add a tonne of new features/cars/tracks (although a few too many Lotuses, all of which are basically the same car - a bit like Gran Turismo and the 1300 different types of Skyline), plus small intermediate updates to sort any bugs. The graphics are top notch, the sound is the best simulated sound yet, but it's the handling and physics that blow your mind - it makes iRacing, rFactor, GTR etc feel like they were programmed by a child in a couple of days.It genuinely is amazing. If you like driving realistically, then you won't regret it. And for this price you get the full game AND save money on the RRP. Hurrah!			"

								If you love racing and love realism and love great racing sims. Just go right ahead and click on that buy button, it will be the best decision that you have ever made, trust me. AC is by far the best looking, physics, and sounding racing sim by far. I have never experienced a Sim that gives me goose bumps while driving like AC has and it's only in Dev stages still when this is full retail I think all the free time that I have will be consumed by this. If you are looking for a realistic sim then look no further it will be the best $40 you have spent this year. I guarantee it.			"

								Picked this up a couple days before it went on sale on Steam (boo!) However ... I can't say I regret that, because this sim is amazing, even with a run-of-the-mill XBox 360 controller. The physics and controls feel spot-on (i.e. shifts work the way they do in real life, and the cars seem to act like I've seen them act ... i.e. driving the FWD hopped-up (Abarth) Fiat 500 is a different experience from driving a BMW 1 Series M, which is a different experience from driving a mid-80s BMW M3 (which feels quite 'nervous' in the back,) which is radically different from driving a Pagani Zonda R.Better still, everything that happens in the game I can really only blame on my driving, and not some limitation of the game's physics.

												Assetto Corsa (together with a Logitech G27 and an Oculus Rift DK2) has made all the other titles in my library, and even my other hobbies, envious. I've been enjoying racing sims since I first tried Revs on the C64, and so far Assetto Corsa is my favourite.In my opinion the Nordschleife/Nürburgring is the most exciting track of the game. It's included in the Dream Pack 1 DLC, so make sure to get the combo if you haven't already bought the game.The DK2 isn't commercially available, and support for it isn't as good in AC as in Live for Speed or Euro Truck Simulator 2. Luckily, as soon as you get in the car you'll see that none of that matters. The AC mod scene is quite active, and people have already created or converted a number of both real and imagined cars and tracks. They are all free, but feel free to press that donation button.			"

												One of the best racing sims I have ever played. It is worth every cent. Cars are more than beautiful, tracks are pretty nice, physics are the best I have ever seen. Every car feels different. It is also playable with a gamepad, but i would recommend to use a wheel. The game is still in development, so you have to expect some glitches, bugs and stuff. The netcode needs some work. Career mode is not very good... theres nothing to motivate you. If you dont want to wait for a pCARS release, buy this one, you wont regret it!			"

								An early access game as of yet, but development and content seems very speedy. It's quickly shaping up to be one of the best feeling, playing, and looking race sim ever. The physics feel very, very good, lots of input device support and customization, and the game is promised to be very supportive of mods. The UI is awesome, especially in-car/race where you can customize it however you'd like, and do it very simply.Definitely keep an eye on this sim if you choose not to buy into the early access model.

								Asetto Corsa is still in pre-release state, but it's still hours of fun! What really makes this simulator great is the realism that the fantastic physics, force feedback and graphics this game provides. You really get the feel of the laser-scanned tracks driving some fantastic cars. I really can't recommend this game enough. Kunos Studios release new content for it every other friday, which is kind of nice, because it's like christmas every time. Should you buy this game? Yes. I would have bought it twice.			"

								I really should not do this but the first comparision that comes to mind for me is pitting this game against Forza and Gran Turismo. Relative to both games the career mode is sparse, but the upside is the driving physics are far more realistic in this game. Getting your tires off the road is an unforgiving experience (as it should be). You feel the car buck and lose a subtantial amount of speed and control, so cutting courses is not worth it. I wish it had some more tracks, but this is an extremely promising racing game that I would buy again in a heartbeat. If you are not a fan of waiting for kinks to be worked out, I would reccomend you wait a while longer until this game is smoothed out. My main real complaint is the Eurocentric car lineup, I wouldnt mind seeing some American muscle in here.			"

												Got this on Early Access. WOW so glad i did i saw from the start the race sim was going to be AMAZING!!! . This is 1 of the best race sims around. The car detail & sound seems so real , If you use a steering wheel like me the logitech G27 the way the car feels different from car to car. You can do so much with setting up your car before the race from tyres ,tyre pressure all the way up to gears , surpension. The tracks are also very good, If like me you drive from inside the car you have to learn what spot to hit the brakes or ya off spinning BUT all fun learning the tracks & once that is done then how much faster each lap & every corner how fast you can take car to the limit of spinning out. Would say that if you are a driving sim fan then you will not go wrong buying this.... I do love the Zonda car in this & even managed to blow engine up trying to slow down on a sharp corner using brakes & gears let up the brake & the revs was still high for 2nd gear & BANG no more engine :( .Have fun driving & maybe you will see me in a race up against you :) ALL FUN 10/10			"

								Best sim to the date, the laser scanned tracks and official cars are amazing and the mod system is great. You can download lots of tracks converted to AC and mod your own with the track editor.			"

Early Access Review
								I hope the developers see this:So far, i think the game is coming along well, but i feel it still has a while to go before it's ready for the final launch.Here are some things I would like to see changed or improved:I am using a Thrustmaster RGT Force Feedback Clutch wheel. It shakes left and right on straight aways, i would like to see that addressed. I heard someone else had the same problem, but I'm not sure what wheel they had.Being that I am a tight budget gamer, I have not been able to buy an H-Shifter. However, I found a program that lets me use my joystick to associate keys on a keyboard with certain positions. My problem here is that I cannot assign keys to shifter positions. I feel that I should be able to assign any key, button or axis to any control in the game. SimBin's GT Legends was very flexible with assigning controls. I think flexibility is key for racers who have unique setups.I am not sure if this is just my graphics card or not, but I notice a slight delay between when I do something and when the game actually does it. I am using an AMD Radeon HD 5670 card. I plan on upgrading very soon, but I hope that delay will go away at some point. I have also noticed that my wheel seems very sensitive. My wheel turns 270 degrees, but on the tracks with the sharpest turns, I find that I barely use 180 degrees of the 270  I have.Again, I hope the developers see this. I am very optimistic that this game will turn out to be the best racing sim, but as of update 0.4, it is not to my expectations. I hope that it soon will be. Great job so far Kunos Simulation team. I hope you find this helpful.This is now on the discussions page in hope the developers respond to it with some fixes.			"

												I'm impressed with the way this sim gives you a sense of the car's limits, making it much easier to manage the car if you brake a little late or accelerate too quickly. It requires you drive well to achieve a decent lap time, but you can feel your way out of sticky situations that other games would have you already giving up to your fate of a meeting with the wall. The force feedback feels great and commuicates tons of info about the car, more so than any other driving sim i've played.All that said, so far at least, I've found another sim ""Raceroom Racing Experience"" has a speed quality that gets my adrenaline pumping a bit more and somehow feels more realistic, while simultaneously lacking some feel for the car compared to AC (both games played without assists on a FF wheel). I may need to keep adjusting on AC to find the sweet spot with the view. So far AC is very nice and superlative in many ways, but not every way.EDIT: At this point, this is the main racing game i play. The overall experience is excellent, especially the feel of the car. I can spend an hour easily just hot lapping the Nordschleife (user mod at that) and love it.			"

												Assetto Corsa is probably the best racing simulator on the market. It features a wide range of cars including brands such as Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche (yes, many are in DLC packs but they are extremely well priced and are well worth the money) and some great tracks like Spa and the Nurburgring (although still no official Bathurst, but the huge modding community have created it and much much more). The physics are great, and many of the high performance cars can be extremely difficult to tame, but as you drive them more, it is truly satisfying to watch the lap times come down. You'll want a good steering wheel to really get the most out of Assetto Corsa. For anyone interested in racing games, I put Assetto Corsa at the top of the list.			"

								Assetto Corsa is the newest racing simulator that aims to be the simulator of choice for years to come, and at 22% off it’s an amazing deal. This game is full of customization from mod support to unlimited tuning options that can keep you busy for days. The cars look visually stunning, the audio is top notch, and the tracks have laser-scanned accuracy. The most important thing for racing games is the feel, and nothing beats Assetto Corsa.  The physics and feedback both handle very well.  If you like cars or racing, this is a must buy.			"

												Assetto Corsa is a very fun racing simulator. With the DLC coming in and many patches i think the game is just going to get better and better. You can cuztomoize which cars you want to race and how many cars you want to race so you could put 6 f1 cars racing eachother and like another 5 fiat 500's racing as backmarkers I would reccomend buying this game if your into racing or cars in general.Update: Been a long time since that review and since then the game has got better, many more cars and tracks, great dlc for a good price and major bugs are gone. Going onto console has been a great step as well.			"

												I have been playing racing sims for a few years now and this one should be in all sin-racers garages. Support for mods should help keep this one going for quite some time and provide plenty of variety in both cars and tracks. Setup is fairly straight forward for those who just want to get in there and race, but also allows for plenty of tinkering for those who enjoy it. I have bought almost every current sim title and plenty from the past and believe each has their own things that make them all worth playing. Assetto Corsa ticks all the boxes for some good, fun racing so get in there and start winning. :)			"

												Assetto Corsa is clearly a labor of love for the team at Kunos Simulazione, and one that continues to evolve over time.  It is certainly a ""Must Have"" title in my mind for any fan of PC racing games.There are still some features and content I'd like to have but, pound for pound - it's a great Drive and still getting better. I like the variety of cars, the graphics, sounds, accurate and high quality tracks, attention to detail, and VR support. I would like to see it get a few more hard-core Sim features that rFactor2 and AMS have though; better FFB support for DD wheels, improved gearbox/trans model, etc. The ability to add mods is also a plus.AC offers me a strong viceral driving experience where Pcars seems more focused on the Racing experience but, Pcars  lacks the viceral element in it's driving experience. rF2 and AMS are even better in that regard but, rF2's graphics and sounds leave it feeling a bit stale for me.  AMS is better in that area and one of my favorites purely for the driving experience it offers but, AC keeps me coming back for the very special cars, the graphics & sounds combined with a great driving experience.

												Coming from Project Cars on the Xbox One, this sim is just soooo good. Truly the most fun I've had since I got my force feedback wheel! The online servers are full, so you can always find someone to race with/against. That said, it is (almost) a prerequisite to own all DLC, if you want to join the most populair servers. The DLC's aren't that expensive though, so buying them is totally worth it, just buy them when they're discounted ;)The bottomline is: This sim is amazing. It is a must-have for any racing wheel owner			"

								The graphics are quite good. very sim-style graphics. Nothing fancy. doesn't quite look as good as GRiD 2 for example. This is definitely a SIM!! you cannot go full-throttle into a corner, and then expect to drift around it without going off track. Very realistic driving experience. G27 wheel is amazing with this game. especially in drift mode, because the wheel goes sloppy one direction when drifting, and extra hard in the other direction. it's ok with a controller, but to really experience the quality build of the game, you need a wheel with FFB.Remeber to brake!over and out			"

Zero frame drops.  Perfection!Can't recommend this game enough!  And yes, it supports mods for tracks and cars!  Pure driving nirvana!			"

These sports cars tyres are not made out of hard plastic!! they're made out of sticky rubber, the sort that sticks to the road, not acting like your driving on snow everytime your car changes direction!I still recommend buying this game if u have a wheelthis game just cant get the grip part right.

								I was going to wright a really long review about all the reasons this game is worth the coin, but look im not into racing games that much, let alone driving simulations, but in my opinion this game is f-in awesome.I now have to buy a logitech steering wheel and another two monitors because its that good. dont get me wrong its not bad on my 360 cotroller if you change to the settings given on the forum, I like the way that sometimes you have to bring the steering wheel back if you overturn it feels quite realistic even though its on the controller, although it takes a little getting used to.I just hope that these guys finish this game off, as aparently they have tendency to leave things incomplete, but this seriously has the potential to be the best racing game across all platforms, please just make the suspention feel a bit harder as you would'nt see a zonda bouncin down the road like a tractor (slight exageration). I see there is some people that have reviewed the game saying that its terrible and unplayable, but in my opinion these are people that dont have the hardware to run it well or that dont have the patience to get the settings to there personal preference.Oh Look it was a pretty long review anyway haha :)			"

Early Access Review
								I was going to wright a really long review about all the reasons this game is worth the coin, but look im not into racing games that much, let alone driving simulations, but in my opinion this game is f-in awesome.I now have to buy a logitech steering wheel and another two monitors because its that good. dont get me wrong its not bad on my 360 cotroller if you change to the settings given on the forum, I like the way that sometimes you have to bring the steering wheel back if you overturn it feels quite realistic even though its on the controller, although it takes a little getting used to.I just hope that these guys finish this game off, as aparently they have tendency to leave things incomplete, but this seriously has the potential to be the best racing game across all platforms, please just make the suspention feel a bit harder as you would'nt see a zonda bouncin down the road like a tractor (slight exageration). I see there is some people that have reviewed the game saying that its terrible and unplayable, but in my opinion these are people that dont have the hardware to run it well or that dont have the patience to get the settings to there personal preference.Oh Look it was a pretty long review anyway haha :)			"

												Assetto corsa comes from the school of thought that if its entirely too hard to keep the car in control and in a straight line it must be a good simulator. Which is just not right. If driving cars was as hard as this game makes out, we would all be in the bushes all the time. These sports cars tyres are not made out of hard plastic!! they're made out of sticky rubber, the sort that sticks to the road, not acting like your driving on snow everytime your car changes direction!I still recommend buying this game if u have a wheelthis game just cant get the grip part right. Too slippery all the time.These guys need to go drive one of those KTM crossbows and then try and drive the shopping cart they made in this game.			"

								what a racing simulator.This is why I game on pc.Realism is great,feel everything through my g27 most importantly you can tell when you are losing the back end or understeering through weight and subtle vibration so you can control it.When driving the x-bow I can feel every bump of the track that makes the visible suspension go up and down fantastic.I have done some track days in various cars and a lot of go-karting and this is the nearest I have got to the feeling of reality in a game.I have also got gt5 for ps3,race room pc,all the simbin games in fact,r-factor etc.. none of them are as good as this,can't wait for the whole game to be complete.code seems very good so far,no glitches and consistent frames way above 60fps although my tv wont do any higher.engine sounds are very realistic for example the  f40,458 and x-bow are all I have driven so far but all sound spot on.was watching chris harris driving the f40 on youtube and straight after was driving the game and sounded spot on!!!

								A fantastic game for any Racing fan out there. The physics in this game set it apart from any other sim out there; they are realistic yet superbly fun. Even while playing with a gamepad, you can't help but smile when you drive around a corner (even if you end up spinning out).  It's in beta so they are still making tweaks and releasing content every two weeks. However, even in its unifinshed state I would say Assetto corsa is a MUST BUY!			"

								Handles a bit clunky and has issues in a few places, but the cars are expertly made, tracks are beautiful, and the game overall looks clean and sharp. Make it a bit less clunky menu and driving with a controller wise and it will be a great addition to the very few PC racing games on the market!			"

												I have been enjoying this game since I acquired a G27 rig. I love the individual corner adjustment for car setups as it is how i do it IRL in spec miata. The lack of cars and tracks is a little disappointing but each car/track is given the same love and there are no shortcuts. The mod community is a fantastic way to keep an eye out for your favorite cars and the game provides the SDK to create your own content.Great simulator, If you are looking for a racing game, look elsewhere			"

												This is easily the best racing simulator I've played. The FFB is awesome, the feel of each car is unique, the sounds are awesome, the graphics are beautiful, and the modding available for the game just tops it off.I own 2 real drift cars, and have drifted both in Australia and in Japan. After the Japanese pack came out I got straight into drifting in Assetto Corsa. This lead me on a path to find some more tracks, and more cars, I've trawled the internet for what seems like days and downloaded everything I can find including many famous tracks in Japan including some of the Ebisu tracks (Minami, Kita, Higashi, and Nishi), Nikko Circuit, Meihan, Bihoku, and many many more.After this I decided to suss out the online community and have found places to do judged virtual drift competitons, plenty of lads to run trains with, and usually a server close enough with a low ping.I can't put the game down now and I'm looking into new steering setups, the current old Fanatec wheel is a bottleneck to the experience.The low price point and consistent updates from Kunos are awesome, the physics in this game have improved a number of times over it's lifetime.I can't fault this game 11/10.

												I play allot of driving simulators of different areas, ETS, ATS, F1 series, Project Cars to name a few. I was unsure about AC and put it of for a long time before buying it eventualy. I was deeply dissapointed....in myself for not buying it sooner. I play with a G27 and 3x 27"" Monitors in Eyefinity and it is absolutely briliant. One of..if not the best and most realistic simulator I have played to date. With this said, I do have to say that buying the game alone is pointless, you have to get all DLC to give you flexibility in car choice so keep that in mind. One more thing is that VW is not in the game which I find disapointing, I know its a racing sim but sometimes the smaller cheaper cars can be more fun than an all out race car. Where is Merc AMG 45, VW Golf GTI, VW Golf R, Opel Corsa, Opel Astra, where are all the hot hatches? Come on AC, give us the hatches and also Aston Martin would be nice. I have all DLC packs and would definately buy more if I can get Aston Martin, and hot hatches. On the other hand...bloody good work on geting Porche. Not many games have them, very nice to see.All in all its a beautiful and fun well designed game, physics are fantastic, sounds are amazing and you have to know what you are doing to go fast without ending up backwards in a cloud of smoke when all assists like ABS and TC is turned off.If you like realistic racing sims then buy it now. If you are a casual racer and want to get better also buy it now, if you just want to have fun...buy it now.			"

												I used to think Need for Speed Shift 1 and 2 were real simulators (I was just a teen at that time)... until I got Assetto Corsa. At the time, this was the first game I purchased on Steam that cost more than €20.This was a really tough game when I first started. But I thought then this game was the most accurate racing simulator I had ever played (some users will argue that's not the case though). So I bought a Logitech G27 so I could stop sucking. And now I do pretty good! I suggest you buy a steering wheel too!I enjoy every second of the game: getting the feel of the different cars and beating my personal records on Nordschleife is what brings me back to Assetto Corsa again and again.On the other hand, the graphics aren't that great compared to Project Cars (which I also own), the AI isn't perfect at all and the selection of cars is not huge. But the DLCs really do make up for it! My favorite DLC is definitely the Japanese Pack.In conclusion: I really do recommend this game for those who want to try out racing simulators!			"

												Great race simulator. I finally found something better then Grand Tourismo on Play Station. Adjustments on the cars are very detailed. The driving can be fun or very difficult depending on how you feel that day and how you set your races. The big advantage is the online racing. There is a large following of this game and an infinite number of real drivers to compete with.The only down side is the number of cars. Some other games have tons of cars to drive. But I must admit that all cars are very different to drive and need different setups. I also bought a Porch add-on for more cars and was not disappointed by the quality and specs of the cars.If you like a flexible racing simulator that can be easy or maddeningly difficult and always great fun be sure to try Assetto Corsa!

												I really want to like this game for its physics and overall driving experience, that i give 10/10. For the game overall i give a 6/10, as i beleive there isnt a game there. You just drive around tracks with these nice cars, which i give them credit for the cars are done really well. The ai has no character about it at all, they never make mistakes, and when they do its predictable on the same corners, like its programed. The career mode is terrible. Not really any incentive to keep going in career. A career to me is something you can work toward, with proper races, and incentives to win the next race. This career mode basicly gets you to try out all the cars, as you progress through it. This game is a simulator, it definetley simulates a driving expereince, just no game part. If you enjoy just going for a cruise in exotic cars doing hotlaps its awsome. For the game part it gets boring. Multiplayer i have not played, so i dont know and cant comment on this aspect.There is just no decent depth to the concept of Driving in this simulator (game). For example Dirt Rally, F1, Test drive. Using seasons, having a time concept to the game, getting attached to the competitors, a background to why you are racing, maybe even having a money system in it. To make you earn that exotic car you love. To make a car simulator great its the little things over and over that make something big. In movie terms there are some good actors, and acting in Assetto Corsa, but just no plot. Movies are uninteresting with no plot, as you know, and so can games (simulators) be.I think mods are good in games, simulators, but when you buy a product you would expect it to be good in its own right, we shouldnt have to rely souly on the mods to make the game good. If the game is good by itself, mods would only enhance the goodness of the game.			"

												Holy guacamole.Nothing quite gives you the excitement, sweaty palms and pounding heart like racing cars from the early 80s with screaming turbos, well over 1000 horsepower, rubbish brakes and ZERO traction control or anti-lock braking, side by side online with other players at WAY over 350km/h, both trying desperately not to crash, yet aggressively pushing as hard as possible to take that checkered flag.Assetto Corsa nails it. World class simulation, if you're a wimp, I'd like to say look elsewhere.But I can't.You can also have a great time cruising with beatifully modelled and simulated modern road vehicles on laser scanned tracks  with your friends.The VR support is incredible. Assetto Corsa is my go-to app to show off what VR can do.Nothing beats it.Buckle up 0.0			"

												My goto racing sim. Feels and looks amazing. It has a ""Career"" but it seems like a shell of something that could be great. It's just event after event with no feeling of accomplishment after beating it.Special events are a lot of fun and offer a huge challenge if you are into beating lap times.Online can get very messy, it would be best to find a league and race with them. Many can be found on Reddit or race department.Hot lapping seems to be the main focus for many people. (Some even call it a hot lap simulator, they really aren't that far off) You can find ""apps"" that add more to hot lapping turning it into a ""rivals"" type hot lap from Forza.Mods Mods Mods... Some are free some are paid. You can find pretty much any track for the game online. Cars are hit and miss, some can be amazingly bad and some can be great. You can find a lot of rips of cars from other games and 99% of them are trash.Updated a few times a year adding free and paid content, and charging great prices for paid content.FFB feels the best out of all the Sims I have played and it supports many wheels and controllers.Controllers like the Xbox one\360 are easily setup and can be tweaked to any driving style. (with different settings that can be found all over steam and the internet)			"

												Impossible to map clutch to button. Makes it near impossible to use a H-shifter and a two pedal steering wheel. If you don't rev-match perfectly, you're gonna toast the gearbox very quickly. (Auto clutch doesn't work with H-shifter, only paddle shifting)I do understand that they don't have auto blip, as you don't know what gear is next, but not able to set the clutch to a button is just wrong!For those saying it's not realistic, and/or it would be cheating: I wouldn't mind having a ""bad""/slow clutch, I'd still use my H-shifter every day of the week instead of the paddles (like that is realistic on a stock Miata?), but not even the option is strange.

Early Access Review
								I bought Assetto Corsa for $39 at a time, it was three tracks and 5 cars... and I can already say that this is an amazing game. i7 4770k GTX 570 playing everything max but shadow detail low (more than this and it stutters) and no motion blur, reflection medium. I play 1920x1080.  You made it this far:_I play a pad steelseries 3GC, I had to install a xbox 360 emulator controller to refine the custom mapping and steering, very tedious, but rewarding. My settings are Gamma + 1.2, steering speed 0.05. You can play with those settings on the pad, anything too far, and it makes the car unstable on the straight or impossible to turn in corners. Best car to to get a ""feel"" for the control is the E30 of course. Please get a wheel, fanatec, G27, anything. To make a review with no racing wheel but a gamepad is really stupid. Guess What, I am really stupid (or really broke)._the graphics are decent (computer wise) and will definitely show you what xbone / PS4 will be able to do next year or so once the dev will master the SDKs, however, sometimes the aliasing seems, really, forced? what is the word, weird. Not correct.  Textures in high are really sharp, I like it. However, nothing groundbreaking. Overall, decent (maybe my card is not good enough? I don't really care, I bought the game for the feel not the look).However, I tried at 720p resolution with motion blur (low) and shadow high, and the game gets a very very different feel. It feels right. It feels ""next gen"". Whatever this expression means. A little motion blur changes a lot of the feel! My bet is that by the time the multiplayer will kick in, I will have to even lower the shadow and reflection. Arg!the very bad:_you have to be patient to get more content, after the nov release, a lot more tracks and car got release, it is very encouraging. Still no multiplayerNow for the good part:_ Remember when you first played Rfactor, and you were like, wait, wait, wait, Forza, GT 3 / 4 / 5, all of this is a lie!!! Well, you can tell that Assetto Corsa forte is the grip / tire setup. My god, it feels, right, it feels correct, it feels subtle. It feels a good solid notch higher than Rfactor. So far, I only driven the Lotus Elise, and the old BMW M3 E30, and a little bit of KTM. The feel of the grip is the most subtle of all racing game I played, you will be rewarded very generously after a few lap, you will be able to feel the tire like nowhere else. When you pass the point of friction on apex, force feedback is really good, it is as close as what a traditional simulator can be. Nothing can come close to AC concerning tires. 300 HOURS LATER. Well. Words can't do it justice. I need a wheel. _suspension feel / setup. No words can accurately tell how I feel about it, you got to tinker with it to believe it. Weight transfer during braking is hilariously good. It took us this long to get it this right?_car model, drive inside view, drive outside view, replay, it is gorgeous. Feel the leather, feel the double stitches, look at what the dev is trying to tell you. I don't mind not having 100 cars. 30 cars at this level? Hell yeah! So far content is still very poor. _the sound. I play with a 2.1 setup behind a sony receiver and ESS series speakers. hmm. Is it really that hard to model this sort of sound coming out of cars? It is just beautiful, drive the Pagani, you will have some sort of epiphany once you will hear the tires. If the wife is looking at you silly, Grado Sr-80 behind a DAC will do. Shame on you (yes I am pointing at you Gran Turismo). What I want:_Laguna Seca Mazda speed raceway? Nurbuuuuuuuubuuuuubuuuuuurgriiiiiiiiing?_Cobra, daytona and Corvette? _Toyota Camry / Nissan Sentra, just for the fun of it, to trully appreciate the Japanese engineering and what they represent in a daily driver context (and yeah, I will drive them like I stole them), give me something that I can relate to, an accord, a civic, anything!In conclusion Assetto Corsa is a game that needs some love, from the small community to the media (believe it or not, autoblog / jalopnik did not cover this game yet, while covering the release of the xbone and the ps4 to no end that tells you of their cluelessness). Assetto Corsa is a deep game, it is Rfactor on steroíd. The modeling of the car is a work of art. Assetto Corsa reminds me of the feels when I was a kid the first time I played GT Legend, 95% of the game feels right. At some point, the mod will come out of the closet, some DLC will get released and AC will be full bodied. From now, they got my $40 bucks and I have to say that this game exceeded my expectations.From the CPU utilization, I would say that a decent setup to play with would be haswell core i5 and a minimum of a GTX 650ti to have fun with it.What else? Oh yeah, get a wheel, G27, anything, I am not doing it justice I feel so stupid for not playing this game with a wheel right now.Well, this was my first review of a game on steam, that tells you something right?Long live, AC, it deserves more credits for what the dev achieved. Forza and GT player will love this game, anyone can get their guilty pleasure getting the curve right with the E30 and or lotus elise, it is not about going fast, it is about getting it right. Asseto Corsa has achieved a lot of right, grip, modelling, sound and now the drift track allows you to have cheap fun.If you want to peek at what next generation racing sim can do, you got to pass this door. Rfactor 2, Project Car, so much excitement for 2014.Conclusion:4770K is somewhat overkillGTX570 can play max settings AA filter everything at 1920x1080, but you got to remove shadow (low) and motion blur (zero). You can keep reflection to medium. Sometimes it stutters still, I would say it is acceptable, I get 60FPSGrip feel and friction loss point at apex feels, really super good. My favorite car is the lotus elise SC, because of its relatively low power (I am a terrible driver) I run the Magione Track in 1:27:960 (And I am sure I can shave another 2 seconds on this one) to give you an idea. To setup your controler get the lower power car possible and play with gamma (+1.2) and steering speed (+.05) as a base an play with all three filter gama and steering speed before going to the garage and play with the setup. Google xbox 360 controller emulator if you need assistance in the remapping of your gamepad. Make sure that you are running your pad in analog mod so you have two axis to play with, one for steering, one for throttle, braking.Turn off all car assistance and listen to your car!Have fun!It has now been 400+ hours I have been playing the game: no other car game will bring you these sort of emotions playing a virtual car, play it, you ought it to yourself.

								So much attention to detail. I was a little dissapointed I could not open the glove compartments in the car. It felt that real. Best forcefeedback feeling in any game. I am an iRacing fanatic, and have no problem admitting this. The physics are the best since Live for Speed in terms of actually being able to feel the car and not having it randomly go uncontrollable. Hopefully there are driver swaps when the MP comes. Haters, you should probably note this game cannot be run on a microwave oven.			"

								I've been doing the race thing for some time now and can say very frankly that Assetto Corsa wil be THE Premere racing sim out there. These guys really have it figured out and I think they want to be the best. Having said that, I believe that we gamers owe it to them and the racing community to do our best to suggest improvements where it really matters. One thing that comes to mind is the whole concept of racing and that has to do with ""Passion"", the love of it. So if we want Assetto Corsa to be the best then we must do our part and race with the same passion, like proper respect and just have fun. This game is awesome and more than rivals sims like F1 2013. I think we have the opportunity to be a part of a great company, a ""Band of Racers"", if you will. Bravo to the TEAM of passionate and dedicated developers at Assetto Corsa, well done mates!Thank You,Rich Grant			"

								I haven't played that many racing sims before, the only ones I've been playing are GT5, GT6 and this(Assetto Corsa). it might also be good to add that i've been playing this game with a PS3 controller. Anyway, from my experience, this game have a good potential to become a better racing sim. The things I like with this game is the vehicle physics, and the AI. I think the AI is more competitive in this game than in GT, it makes the races more thrilling and fun!The things I don't like with this game yet is the low amount of cars available, but it's still in early access and more cars are coming, so that will change. Another thing that I don't like with this game is that it's a little bit glitchy some times after some updates.. But you have to keep in mind that this game is still in early access.Do I recommend this game? Yes, I do! Well, this game might not be a game for everyone, but if you know you got some petrol in your blood, then this is a game you should buy.			"

								Let me tell you something.Do you know what it's like to be at the helm of a nearly untamable Ferrari and hear the engine roar and pop? I'll wait.Okay, time's up. I'll answer that for you. No. You probably don't know. And I haven't done that in real life, so I guess I don't either, but Assetto Corsa brings you as close to that as possible. For me, the sound is the best part of this game thus far. Every single car sounds different than the last and every one is just as satisfying to hear. From the screech of tires to gravel and especially the unique sound of each engine (and those sounds change depending on your view. Different sounds in the cockpit than an ""over the shoulder"" arcade-style view), every one of those sounds seem incredibly authentic and immersive. First time I got behind the wheel of a Ferrari was exhilarating. First time behind a Formula 1 car was empowering. And so on.Now, my computer is incredibly low-spec. We're talking 2011 MacBook Pro (running Windows via bootcamp) with integrated Intel HD 3000 graphics low. But with a bit of graphics tweaking, I was able to get this game to run at about a cool 30 fps. Which isn't terrible, but it's certainly not the best. It's enough for the casual racer to get a good lap or 60 in. No biggie. So if you have a super crazy maxed out rig, you should be able to get this to run at 60 fps no problemo. In any case, the cars look great.Even though this game is accessible hardware-wise, skill-wise it is certainly not. It does not hold your hand. But don't let that scare you. There are a few cars in here that are slow enough that you can take for a spin and get at least a decent handle on things before trying to tame a supercar. I mean, you could try and go for a few laps in a McLaren but you'll get your butt kicked if you don't know what you're doing. Suffice to say your 6-year-old sister couldn't pick this up on a whim and start beating you like Mario Kart.I don't have a racing wheel (yet), but I managed to get a Dualshock 3 controller from my old PS3 connected and working, and honestly, it's working out much better than I thought it would. Driving simulators with controllers tend to not go well with me since I usually oversteer and give the car waaaay too much throttle. Yay, spinning out! But with a few configuration adjustments, I've been able to take corners smoother than I ever have in any other game. If you don't have a wheel or controller (I'd recommend you pick one up. It makes the game better. And other games too.), there is a nice option where you can steer with your mouse, making much smoother turns than your A and D keys ever could.So, the real question is, should you pick this game up?Weeeeeeell......maybe. Personally, I think you should wait either for it to be on sale for at least 50% off (at the time of this review Assetto Corsa is in early access and it's on sale for half off: $20). Otherwise, a full $40 isn't quite worth it yet. Apparently the full release is going to be a nasty $50 but with steam sales, that'll be alright. There's no career mode yet, and multiplayer isn't for me yet since I'm not good enough, plus it's in alpha right now. Career mode is where I'll be spending the majority of my time when it's available.TL;DR: Buy this game only if it's on sale if you want to know what it's like to sit behind the wheel of a Ferrari and hear its engines roar. Good stuff.			"

								Hands down, one of the best racing games/sims I have ever played. Driving physics feels good, graphics are nice, cars are wonderfully detailed. Works amazing with a racing wheel - but even on controller you can do some quite competitive lap times. Extremely rewarding, provides a challenge but is extremely adaptable with settings regarding your skill level. So far not that many tracks and only around 15 different manufacturers but that is just because of it being still in development. I have heard there will be new content all the way till 2018.9.5/10 would recommend wholeheartedly. Brilliant even in early access, only going to get better!			"

								Review as of 8/11:This game is tons of fun. I've spent a few hours in it now, trying out various things, races, drifting, time trials, and tons and tons of practice laps. You know a game is good when even it's most basic aspect, taking laps around a track in different cars, is a blast. As you get better and slowly add in time trials, then racing, then some trickier manuevers like drifting, this game has great playability and I expect a very long shelf-life. The Graphics as they stand now are lovely, although at times unoptimized (anyone else getting massive FPS drops in the sand?) but even still, with my Dual 660's I'm able to play at 5750x1080 at around 50 FPS, very nice. It's equally as fun to pick up an putz around for 10 minutes as it is to sit in, and really dig into those corners for a multi hour session. I look forward to more cars and tracks in the future, and will update this with my thoughts on Rift support once I get my DK2.9/10 Would Recommend			"

								I've played about 30 minutes of this game, and already, I'm blown away. I was hesitant to spend the money, but for $20 (Summer Sale), this game is a bargain. And to think, this isn't even the finished product. Wow. They just raised the bar for driving sims. So fun, so good.			"

								There are a few ways at looking at a simulation / racing game, is it for instance designed to work with a steering wheel, stick and H shifter off the shelf, how do the cars handle, how lazy is the grip and how realistic is the driving.The short answer is no matter your skill level, you will be both rewarded and punished at the same time in your first couple of drives.This game is still in alpha yet it fails to disappoint even thus far with a lot of content being not available, yet.So after crashing fantastically with all the driving assist aides turned off and learning to tame the beast of the fantastic physics engine, I can hold my hand up and say this is the most challenging sim I've played thus far, Live for speed and console + wheel included... this is harder and somewhat more rewarding.When you clip a kerb the car bounces and your vision simulates in-car circumstances and when you hit the gravel trap a tinkering of gravel exiting the body panels and spoilers of your car reminds you of your mistake along with a dusty and dirty windscreen.Sure I'd like the ability to feather the traction control and ABS interference rather than on / off because at a choice, gun to my head assists off give me much more 'fun' but fustration at the same time since I don't have the option for a tiny little bit of TC for an overpowered car with limited grip, however this is surely to come in the future releases so it's minor gripes to say the least.Laser scanning of the Nordschleife have begun.Buckle up for the most crash tastic or rewarding driving experience you can muster, are you man enough to turn all the assists off ? your patience will tell.

												Everything in this review is based off the game as it was on January 6 2015Pros:Excellent physicsLaser-scanner tracksBeautiful car modelsFFB works greatChallenges are a fun way to kill timeCons:No flag systemPenalty for going off track sucks (explained later)AI cannot race longer than 10 lapsOverall, this game is a great driving simulator - on par with the best out there.  It is my personal favorite of the bunch because of the driving physics, I prefer the tire model in AC to that of the other sims.  Now, there are some really annoying things about this game.  The most annoying thing is the penalty for going off track.  The game cuts the throttle until you slow down to 50 kmph or for 5 seconds, whichever comes first.  This is really annoying because the only time you usually go off track is because you went into a corner too hot and you slide off track.  Cutting the throttle at this point eliminates all chance of you recovering the car and you usually end up in a wall.  The lack of a flag system and short races with the AI are not that bad but the penalty system really needs work.  Still, if you're on the fence about getting this game, I'd recommend you buy it.  I've already got my money's worth from this game and I plan to play it a lot more.			"

Not only is the menu arguably the most difficult to navigate i have seen in a long time, but the graphics are not the greates either. And by that, I mean ""not $50 dollars worth"". Additionally, the physics engine is horrendous!! oversteer is way too prominant and the back end of the car enters turns at the same time as the front wheels! It's like suddenly friction stopped and im being blown sideways by the wind! Yes, I know its still in beta, but I payed for a good simulator, not good potential.			"

								If Asseto Corsa has this polished feel already, I'm thoroughly looking forward to how it is going to be once it reaches full release. As a Fan of Race, Gran Turismo and Forza, I headed into this game with expectations and worries.I strapped myself in and went for a blast around Monza. Well what can I say? I was blown away, truly. Not only by the beauty of it, but the physics and the sound. After several very good laps, I clipped the apex going into Parabolica going in far too quick, the right hand side of my Tatuus FA01 lifted what felt like 4000ft into the air and I ended up nose down comtemplating my over-zelous attitude and arcade-minded approach! Race ruined; yes! Game ruined; hell no!Restart and away I went again.			"

								Genuinely a decent car simulation engine, really great fun if you like your driving like me.Setup with a joypad can be a pain, I had to research the settings on the forums and went through stages where I totally broke the ability to effecively control the car, it's a shame this doesn't yet work right off the bat. I hear a steering wheel is much better but I've neither the time or patience to bother with one right now.The main reason I picked this up however is the solid foundation of a decent driving simulator with excellent modding support, already we're seeing open round tracks being built, the ring, imaginary maps, laser scanned maps, it's that extensability which provides proper replayability when you just want to drive for the sake of it.Cars are modelled excellently inside and out, I would like an option for internal engine noise with external camera, there's a dodgy workaround at the moment for this which I use, the cars have very different power delivery mechanisms, you can really feel the lag and boost of the turbos, then switching to NA engined cars gives you a nice smooth curve to drift with, the BMW's rev to high heaven and sound awesome in the process.There could do with a better perception of speed in the stock game, again, I had to adjust the FOV or I'd just keep flying off the track doing 200mph feeling like it was 30. With a bit of tweaking however you get a decent, rewarding to play driving game.Buy this game if you like driving, don't bother if you're more into arcade racers, I think it would just annoy and bore you.

								Even at the early stage, it is still an excellent game. Just taking any of the cars around track puts a simle on one's face. Don't be mistaken though when purchasing. If you are looking for a realistic challenge, you are right at home, but if you prefer more arcade (Grid 2 style, NFS slide around) kind of racing this might not be good for you. I have been playing on an xbox360 controller and the cars respond very well. I have actually just ordered a Logitech G27, so i will update the review with information about the game than. The updates come out as announced so far on biweekly schedule. If you are hesitating on the purchase, go ahead and get it. If we show support to the developers, they will be able to deliver better product, and it's the early stage where your voice does matter and make a diffference to improve the final product.--------------------------------------------------------Post Wheel Purchase Update: The game is astounding in my opinion. The physics, the feel in the wheel of the weight shifting during corners or braking, it's simply mind blowing. To put it to you this way, I thought I was decent at racing games, but when I plugged in the wheel and set the settings on PRO with no help (aside from using ABS) I realized how much I stil have left to learn. This game will challenege you, it will excite you and when you finally start feeling confident behidn the wheel, chew you out on a corner and spit you out in the grass. Few things to note, there has not been car updates for past few times we had updates, I'm sure they will be coming out soon. The multi works smoothly from experience, although not that many people are online. Lastly, (could be just my computer), but I have significant performance issues when racing around Mugello track. The FPS drops significantly, sometimes getting choppy even. That is the only track it happens on, so I'm guessing after some smoothing out it will be okSo my bottom line, would I purchase the game again, now that I know everything about it, ABSOLUTELY YES			"

								Hands down, one of the best racing games/sims I have ever played. Driving physics feels good, graphics are nice, cars are wonderfully detailed. Works amazing with a racing wheel - but even on controller you can do some quite competitive lap times. Extremely rewarding, provides a challenge but is extremely adaptable with settings regarding your skill level. So far not that many tracks and only around 15 different manufacturers but that is just because of it being still in development. I have heard there will be new content all the way till 2018.9.5/10 would recommend wholeheartedly. Brilliant even in early access, only going to get better!			"

								I bought Assetto Corsa for $39 at a time, it was three tracks and 5 cars... and I can already say that this is an amazing game. i7 4770k GTX 570 playing everything max but shadow detail low (more than this and it stutters) and no motion blur, reflection medium. I play 1920x1080.  You made it this far:_I play a pad steelseries 3GC, I had to install a xbox 360 emulator controller to refine the custom mapping and steering, very tedious, but rewarding. My settings are Gamma + 1.2, steering speed 0.05. You can play with those settings on the pad, anything too far, and it makes the car unstable on the straight or impossible to turn in corners. Best car to to get a ""feel"" for the control is the E30 of course. Please get a wheel, fanatec, G27, anything. To make a review with no racing wheel but a gamepad is really stupid. Guess What, I am really stupid (or really broke)._the graphics are decent (computer wise) and will definitely show you what xbone / PS4 will be able to do next year or so once the dev will master the SDKs, however, sometimes the aliasing seems, really, forced? what is the word, weird. Not correct.  Textures in high are really sharp, I like it. However, nothing groundbreaking. Overall, decent (maybe my card is not good enough? I don't really care, I bought the game for the feel not the look).However, I tried at 720p resolution with motion blur (low) and shadow high, and the game gets a very very different feel. It feels right. It feels ""next gen"". Whatever this expression means. A little motion blur changes a lot of the feel! My bet is that by the time the multiplayer will kick in, I will have to even lower the shadow and reflection. Arg!the very bad:_you have to be patient to get more content, after the nov release, a lot more tracks and car got release, it is very encouraging. Still no multiplayerNow for the good part:_ Remember when you first played Rfactor, and you were like, wait, wait, wait, Forza, GT 3 / 4 / 5, all of this is a lie!!! Well, you can tell that Assetto Corsa forte is the grip / tire setup. My god, it feels, right, it feels correct, it feels subtle. It feels a good solid notch higher than Rfactor. So far, I only driven the Lotus Elise, and the old BMW M3 E30, and a little bit of KTM. The feel of the grip is the most subtle of all racing game I played, you will be rewarded very generously after a few lap, you will be able to feel the tire like nowhere else. When you pass the point of friction on apex, force feedback is really good, it is as close as what a traditional simulator can be. Nothing can come close to AC concerning tires. 300 HOURS LATER. Well. Words can't do it justice. I need a wheel. _suspension feel / setup. No words can accurately tell how I feel about it, you got to tinker with it to believe it. Weight transfer during braking is hilariously good. It took us this long to get it this right?_car model, drive inside view, drive outside view, replay, it is gorgeous. Feel the leather, feel the double stitches, look at what the dev is trying to tell you. I don't mind not having 100 cars. 30 cars at this level? Hell yeah! So far content is still very poor. _the sound. I play with a 2.1 setup behind a sony receiver and ESS series speakers. hmm. Is it really that hard to model this sort of sound coming out of cars? It is just beautiful, drive the Pagani, you will have some sort of epiphany once you will hear the tires. If the wife is looking at you silly, Grado Sr-80 behind a DAC will do. Shame on you (yes I am pointing at you Gran Turismo). What I want:_Laguna Seca Mazda speed raceway? Nurbuuuuuuuubuuuuubuuuuuurgriiiiiiiiing?_Cobra, daytona and Corvette? _Toyota Camry / Nissan Sentra, just for the fun of it, to trully appreciate the Japanese engineering and what they represent in a daily driver context (and yeah, I will drive them like I stole them), give me something that I can relate to, an accord, a civic, anything!In conclusion Assetto Corsa is a game that needs some love, from the small community to the media (believe it or not, autoblog / jalopnik did not cover this game yet, while covering the release of the xbone and the ps4 to no end that tells you of their cluelessness). Assetto Corsa is a deep game, it is Rfactor on steroíd. The modeling of the car is a work of art. Assetto Corsa reminds me of the feels when I was a kid the first time I played GT Legend, 95% of the game feels right. At some point, the mod will come out of the closet, some DLC will get released and AC will be full bodied. From now, they got my $40 bucks and I have to say that this game exceeded my expectations.From the CPU utilization, I would say that a decent setup to play with would be haswell core i5 and a minimum of a GTX 650ti to have fun with it.What else? Oh yeah, get a wheel, G27, anything, I am not doing it justice I feel so stupid for not playing this game with a wheel right now.Well, this was my first review of a game on steam, that tells you something right?Long live, AC, it deserves more credits for what the dev achieved. Forza and GT player will love this game, anyone can get their guilty pleasure getting the curve right with the E30 and or lotus elise, it is not about going fast, it is about getting it right. Asseto Corsa has achieved a lot of right, grip, modelling, sound and now the drift track allows you to have cheap fun.If you want to peek at what next generation racing sim can do, you got to pass this door. Rfactor 2, Project Car, so much excitement for 2014.Conclusion:4770K is somewhat overkillGTX570 can play max settings AA filter everything at 1920x1080, but you got to remove shadow (low) and motion blur (zero). You can keep reflection to medium. Sometimes it stutters still, I would say it is acceptable, I get 60FPSGrip feel and friction loss point at apex feels, really super good. My favorite car is the lotus elise SC, because of its relatively low power (I am a terrible driver) I run the Magione Track in 1:27:960 (And I am sure I can shave another 2 seconds on this one) to give you an idea. To setup your controler get the lower power car possible and play with gamma (+1.2) and steering speed (+.05) as a base an play with all three filter gama and steering speed before going to the garage and play with the setup. Google xbox 360 controller emulator if you need assistance in the remapping of your gamepad. Make sure that you are running your pad in analog mod so you have two axis to play with, one for steering, one for throttle, braking.Turn off all car assistance and listen to your car!Have fun!It has now been 400+ hours I have been playing the game: no other car game will bring you these sort of emotions playing a virtual car, play it, you ought it to yourself.

												An incredible driving/racing simulator.  The standard content of Assetto Corsa is decent.  I would highly recommend adding the Dream Packs as well.  In addition, there is an amazing community of modders who produce professional quality tracks and cars that can be downloaded and added to Assetto Corsa, the vast majority are free of charge.  The community is very welcoming (the official support forums) and you'll get help for ANY issue as long as you are polite and respectful.The driving physics of Assetto Corsa are second to none.  Sure, some people will say that's a subjective statement.  Others may say that they prefer another sim's physics.  That's fair, but no one can say that Assetto Corsa's physics aren't great, even if they think another sim is better.  I personally think AC has the best physics in the biz.  To me, physics matter the most.  After all, we're talking about ""simulation"".  I'm looking for the most realistic experience possible behind the wheel of a virtual car.Graphics and sounds are excellent.  Again, thanks to the amazing community of modders, if you aren't 100% happy with the sounds of a particular car, the odds are great that you could download a substitute set of sounds for just about any car.  Heck, you could make your own if you want to learn how to use FMod.  Likewise, you can download or create your own PP Filters which change the graphical properties of the sim.Again, if you're really into realism you must own Assetto Corsa.  If you're more interested in just logging onto public servers and smashing into others all in the name of fun, stick to console titles like Gran Turismo  or Forza.  Of course there are people who take those games seriously, but there are also people who just want to look at fancy cars and go fast.  Assetto Corsa players, like most Sim drivers, are looking for realism and don't mind a steeper learning curve in setting impressive lap times.There is no car modding, like adding turbos and upgraded LSD's or suspensions like in the console games.  There is no grinding for in-game cash/credits so you can purchase more cars and more parts.  You get every single car right out of the box and can download many, many more.  You can ""tune"" the cars, however, to suit your driving style or correct any issues you might be having with a particular car.  Usually for street cars it's just simple things like Toe In or Out.  Adding or reduce Camber.  Adjusting Tire Pressure.  Maybe slight Aero adjustments if the car has a rear wing or active aero components.  Race cars, however, usually have much more that can be adjusted, like Ride Height, Spring Rate, Bump Stop Rate, Gear Ratios, etc.Assetto Corsa can be played with a gamepad, but you really want to get yourself a steering wheel and pedals to fully take advantage of the driving experience.  Many people run triple monitor setups for racing sims.  I'm running a single 46"" LCD TV as my sole display and the game is beautiful.  With all the graphical settings maxed out I really can say that Assetto Corsa is a gorgeous game, for the most part.  I would recommend this game to anyone who's even vaguely interested in experiencing the ""serious side"" of driving and racing cars via computer.			"

												Absolutely spectacular. Very real feel to driving the cars. I've driven a Lamborghini Gallardo around a race track in real life and they really nailed the feel, the acceleration, the handling of the Gallardo when they threw it into this game, so I think it's safe to say they probably nailed the rest of the cars as well. Graphics look great and the game is easy to run at 60 FPS across all three monitors. The content that is already in the game is enough for several hundred hours worth of playing time, let alone all the rest of the content they are going to release for it. This is the best racing simulation game. Period.			"

												I normally dont really bother with reviews and stuff, but this game deserves one. I have been playing racing sim games since first gran turismo on ps one, also very first F1 games on very first PCs and rally as well! I have played with some of the best wheels you can get and I have played with keyboard and gamepad as well, so I have been around for some time to try it all and play pretty much every racing/rally sim there is, so I will tell you that this game is breathtaking and it is only getting better and better, I own this game from very early access when it wasnt so great but I knew that they will nail it. And they did just that! The attention to detail on each car is immaculate! The physics are incredible! Sound is stunning! Graphics are beautiful! So far a king of racing sim and a real driving simulator!			"

								Wow.  What an amazing game.  I was probably one of the biggest GT fans ever.  I purchased both PS2 and PS3 just because of GT games.  This game (when finished) will blow any console raching game out of the water.  Just the UI is an immense improvement because it's so smooth and quick.  The game is very realistic and probably better than GT5 (have not played GT6).  I'm a hard core race gamer performance means everything to me.  I will probably add more graphics cards once the mods start coming out and improving the textures.  Iceenhancer anyone?Nerd heaven.  I can't believe the amount of customizations allowed in visual display.  Finally it feels like a game publisher has decided to listen to the feedback.  It's kind of odd that when I turn on a few of the Anti Alias settings, my FPS drops to 20, but when I turn them off they go back up to 150fps.This is a great game!			"

								One thing that Assetto Corsa nails - absolutely NAILS - is the gamepad interpolation. They've really put a lot of thought into how analog gamepads control these cars, and what they've come up with is a system that feels better than anything else out there, by a long mile. That, coupled with the great physics, makes this a very fun and satisfying simulator for those of us who can't use a wheel for whatever reason.It's one of the best simulators I've ever used, and in my opinion, second only to iRacing, and that's saying a LOT.

												If your looking for a true racing simulator look no further than this. Every attempt has been made to make it as realistic as possible in the car handling and there visual representation[ not as graphical as project cars but its close enough and the car physics/handling far surpasses project cars.]Feels fantastic with a racing wheel , the force feed back is brilliant [ using a logitech g27 ] and even though it isnt official using revive to play it on a htc vive produces the closest to real racing you will get without climbing in the real car.My only con of this game is ai dont have enough time to play it and master the high skill level required [does have lower settings for a more arcade experience but really you would be doing yourself a miss service			"

												The best racing sim.  The wheel feels fairly natural and the game constantly gets better.  The community is perpetually adding car and track mods and with Automation, one can design an engine there, and upload it to modded cars here.  That is amazing.  There is not another game that matches its presence of style.  While unfinished, there isn't another racing game that seems as flawless as this. Recent improvements are programming for the Occulus Rift, (and probably other Virtual Reality gear, {there is a nice selection of pre-programmed wheel arrangements already}), not to mention the artificial intelligence of the cpu opponents that has evolved to seem more like a real race experience.  More camera angles to fit to your gaming setup than before, and in-game apps to improve the gameplay that until utilized, you'd hardly even notice was needed.  There is much more done and in the works that I'm surely not remembering.The only addition I'd want is to have an option to tweak cars like forza or project cars where there are more options to alter the vehicle to suite ones' wishes.  That stuff feels a little like fluff though, (other game versions.)  Assetto Corsa cars feel more authentic from the start, and some can be modified more than others.  The cars seem so distinct from each other by how they drive alone, it makes perfect sence why some cars have been chosen to be in the line-up.  More variety is almost always welcome, as long as it doesn't take away from the quality, which isn't lacking here.			"

								For anyone who want true track days simulation, this is your game it's well delevoped the cars are 95% similar to reality, for example i drove 458 in track in real life and when i test it on game it's so similar except some sort of low rpm car behaviour or valve opening and closing, but overall it's the most racing game that put me close to reality, I totally recomend it for cars lovers.

Early Access Review
								I grew up playing the Gran Turismo games on Playstations 1&2. I have long since moved away from the horrible world of console gaming, but unfortunately no racing sim seemed to follow me. Well it seems like one finally caught up. Now that it's here I have very few complaints and it's still very much a beta. The level of detail put into the vehicles, both inside and out, is top notch. The environment leaves a lot to be desired, but that's easily forgiven by the true meat of any racing sim... Physics, lots and lots of physics. This is by far the most realistic racing sim I've played, and I can't seem to ever be satisfied with just a couple of laps. Never before have I been able to seamlessly go from keeping a proper racing line through one corner and then powersliding through the next without first exiting the track and making unrealistic suspension adjustments. I have one final word on the positives of this game before I start to mention some of the negatives. The audio (engines) is simply sublime.If you look at any of the big racing sim giants from the console world, you'll see something called selection. A very vast selection of some amazing and some not so amazing cars. I don't particulary care for the not so amazing cars and I genuinely appreciate Assetto Corsa's current roster of cars barring the Abarth 500, but as far as I know they don't plan on including many more before releasing the finished product. I think another dozen would really make this game worth every penny. When I say another dozen, I don't mean another dozen Lotuses or BMWs which this game already has too many of. I mean a dozen truly different cars. Driving a 1959 Ferrari Testarossa on the soon to be included Nurburgring would put this game into legendary status for me personally. Well I guess beggars can't be choosers, but here's to hoping.			"

												The best racing sim.  The wheel feels fairly natural and the game constantly gets better.  The community is perpetually adding car and track mods and with Automation, one can design an engine there, and upload it to modded cars here.  That is amazing.  There is not another game that matches its presence of style.  While unfinished, there isn't another racing game that seems as flawless as this. Recent improvements are programming for the Occulus Rift, (and probably other Virtual Reality gear, {there is a nice selection of pre-programmed wheel arrangements already}), not to mention the artificial intelligence of the cpu opponents that has evolved to seem more like a real race experience.  More camera angles to fit to your gaming setup than before, and in-game apps to improve the gameplay that until utilized, you'd hardly even notice was needed.  There is much more done and in the works that I'm surely not remembering.The only addition I'd want is to have an option to tweak cars like forza or project cars where there are more options to alter the vehicle to suite ones' wishes.  That stuff feels a little like fluff though, (other game versions.)  Assetto Corsa cars feel more authentic from the start, and some can be modified more than others.  The cars seem so distinct from each other by how they drive alone, it makes perfect sence why some cars have been chosen to be in the line-up.  More variety is almost always welcome, as long as it doesn't take away from the quality, which isn't lacking here.			"

												Nordschleife laser scanned in AC is the best, has the most surface detail of all sims. Its the only track I drive atm because its just so addictive. Other tracks are also the best of all sims, Spa or Silverstone for example. The FFB is very easy to setup (unlike Project Cars) and feels brilliant on the OSW. The physics is excellent, all the cars drive and feels realistic, traction loss, oversteer understeer all very very good. Mechanical details of specific cars, are very accurate. Damage is pretty good, both visual and physical. Interior and exterior of all the cars in AC have great details which suits VR extremely well. Although the VR support in AC is still beta it is still very good, I am sure the Kunos team will do a great job in the final release. I would like to see improvements - More weather conditionsMore car packs DLCs (Honda?)More laser scanned tracksBroadcasting/spectating modeBetter online lounge would be nice actuallyLess predicable AI (not as good of iteration as Project Cars AI, but still entertaining)Final VR support asapVR SLI and DX12 engineFYI - I am running wtih MiGE/Simucube Oculus CV1 setupSUMMARY -  Why waste your time driving on non laser scanned tracks? World famous tracks with laser accuracy, world famous cars with real physics right in your living room (or garage)!			"

								Very solid experience so far, even as a pre-release title in its current state. Obviously the gameplay variety is limited, but with a large community behind it with numerous mods it is very enjoyable. Multiplayer latency does have a few problems, as is probably expected from an online racer but hopefully this will improved in the future.			"

												Just played around for a few minutes now and the first impressions are very nice. Car handling feels good with Xbox 360 controller. Assetto Corsa is not a racing arcade, it wants to be a simulation. To adress this, the game is highly customizable. Still, it is fun to play just a single race on standard settings.Edit: Assetto Corsa is a lot of fun. The Nordschleife, which comes as DLC, is a blast. I can only recommend it!			"

								This game is at the moment the best Racing Simulation.The Quality of Graphics and the Performance is very good, the sound could be a little bit better.The ForceFeedback is absolutly comprehensible and the best I felt ever.All cars are very detailed and the Setup Options are already included.Furthermore you can play every car with the real stearing angle.The laserscanned tracks are perfect, almost the atmosphere around the track is a little bit worse than in other games.Moreover the game is moddable.The Multiplayer Alpha is also very good, the Pings are extremly low.There are only some bugs in form of crashes when you drive close to another car, but i hope that this will be corrected in future.The multiplayer Options are also not perfect.In the mode without booking there is no track rotation and an limit for cars, but i think that this also will be corrected.Also there is at the moment no rain, night or pitstop strategy.In addition Assetto Corsa is not completly finished, but it has much potential and makes many things right and the core of the game, the realism of the track and the cars, is already perfect.

 General Assetto Corsa is a good racing simulator, although needs performance improvements and more vanilla tracks and cars. UI I find that Assetto Corsa still needs some work. The UI layout is sluggish and searching for servers for online game play can be annoying; for example a server will say 19 out of 20 grid places taken, then when trying to enter it's full. I find that this happens too often and would be great for a real time update every 60 seconds. Graphics The graphics is brilliant if you have a computer that can cope with it. When I bought the DLC  Dream Pack 1  which came with the track Nordschleife I couldn't run at my normal settings, as the track was too demanding.

												Assetto Corsa.So, after a long time playing that game, unlocking approximately one percent of all the successes i decided to write a review of it.I am part of the drifting community, even though i did race a non negligible amount of time. You got it, i won't be able to talk as an experimented racer but as an experimented drifter.So, what about Assetto Corsa?Well, not bad at all.The first good point i'm going to go into is the overall feeling you get when you play the game. It is so immersive. So nicely done.You feel like in a real race car when racing and a real drift car when drifting. With a controller or a steering wheel you're about to shed tears of joy.Now comes the time to talk about the physics engine. It is absolute greatness. You're gonna have fun on dry roads with e30s or supras drifting all over the place or with GT2 458 and Huracans fighting for first place on dry roads.Now, why did i say on dry roads only? That's simple. You don't have any other road conditions than dry. Of course there are several dry variants, like old tarmac. But no wet or frozen road condition.Talking about what's missing in the game, unfortunately there's another thing.Night time. No night time. There are all the times of the day like sunrise, midday, sunset, all from 8AM to 6PM; but no night time. Coming with that, no lights from the headlights.And to rub salt into the wound there is no weather and time cycles.These are the baddest point of the game in my opinion. Let's hope it's going to be properly implemented later. Now, a good point. Mods. Assetto Corsa has thousands of mods.Remember wet weather and night time missing? Well, some mods propose them. The only bad point about this is you'll have to install it by yourself.Of course there are not only weather mods. There's almost everything you can search for. Want Akina course from Initial D? There's a really nice mod proposing it.Want Formula Drift cars ? dSPEC mod purposing it. Want better visuals coming with better fluidity? mod out there.And so on. All the details about the mods i talked about are below if you're interested.Another thing. Be aware of bad mods. Assetto Corsa has a great physics engine when the cars or tracks are done the right way.You guessed it, the next point i'm going to talk about is content creation. So creating mods.It is pretty easy to get started with content creation. The game developers gave us very good tools to work with to create a good mod. On assettocorsa's official website, there even are tutorials to get familiar with content creation.I am not that much into creating cars, tracks or weathers. But i do like skinning a lot. Pretty much photoshop stuff. And same, it's not that hard. But for sure it takes time to do it right. For exemple, i worked on the Formula Drift cars paintjobs.Last point i'm going to develop is the community. Behind Assetto Corsa hides a very nice and fair play community. Most of the players are not going to hit your back for you to spin out in a race for exemple. And that's great to be part of that community.So, i already wrote a novel, and i don't want to make it as thick as Harry Potter so i'm going to stop there. I talked about the essentials in my opinion.To conclude, for its price without DLCs, Assetto Corsa is really worth it. You can buy DLCs to support the game development and you'll get your money's worth in my opinion.I've been calculating for fun how much i pay for an hour of game play and i spend around four cents per hour to play the game. That's about getting your money's worth isn't it.Your humble servant, i love to say this,Cryms AKA French Power.Details: Search these names on google and you'll get them easily.Wet weather and night time: Bernd's Real Life Weather. You're not obligated to install post process filters with it.Initial D track: Mount Akina 2017 by ScottFormula Drift cars: Formula Drift Replicas by dSPECBetter Visuals with better fluidity: Natural Graphics Mod "

But with the way this game looks and feels when you're on the road, it really doesn't matter. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game. They even have a laser scanned Nurburgring... Buy the game.

That's simple. You don't have any other road conditions than dry. Of course there are several dry variants, like old tarmac. But no wet or frozen road condition.Talking about what's missing in the game, unfortunately there's another thing.Night time. No night time. There are all the times of the day like sunrise, midday, sunset, all from 8AM to 6PM; but no night time. Coming with that, no lights from the headlights.And to rub salt into the wound there is no weather and time cycles.These are the baddest point of the game in my opinion. Let's hope it's going to be properly implemented later. Now, a good point. Mods. Assetto Corsa has thousands of mods.Remember wet weather and night time missing? Well, some mods propose them. The only bad point about this is you'll have to install it by yourself.Of course there are not only weather mods. There's almost everything you can search for. Want Akina course from Initial D? There's a really nice mod proposing it.Want Formula Drift cars ? dSPEC mod purposing it. Want better visuals coming with better fluidity? mod out there.And so on. All the details about the mods i talked about are below if you're interested.Another thing. Be aware of bad mods. Assetto Corsa has a great physics engine when the cars or tracks are done the right way.You guessed it, the next point i'm going to talk about is content creation. So creating mods.It is pretty easy to get started with content creation. The game developers gave us very good tools to work with to create a good mod. On assettocorsa's official website, there even are tutorials to get familiar with content creation.I am not that much into creating cars, tracks or weathers. But i do like skinning a lot. Pretty much photoshop stuff. And same, it's not that hard. But for sure it takes time to do it right. For exemple, i worked on the Formula Drift cars paintjobs.Last point i'm going to develop is the community. Behind Assetto Corsa hides a very nice and fair play community. Most of the players are not going to hit your back for you to spin out in a race for exemple. And that's great to be part of that community.So, i already wrote a novel, and i don't want to make it as thick as Harry Potter so i'm going to stop there. I talked about the essentials in my opinion.To conclude, for its price without DLCs, Assetto Corsa is really worth it. You can buy DLCs to support the game development and you'll get your money's worth in my opinion.I've been calculating for fun how much i pay for an hour of game play and i spend around four cents per hour to play the game. That's about getting your money's worth isn't it.Your humble servant, i love to say this,Cryms AKA French Power.Details: Search these names on google and you'll get them easily.Wet weather and night time: Bernd's Real Life Weather.

												Out of all the racing games I have played over the years (GT1-6, Forza 6, Project Cars, rFactor 2, GTR, etc), I really like how each car drives, handles, and sounds. My favorite being the GTR 34! What a beast, just give me 600 bhp, not 375 bhp… come on man! Cars like Ferrari and McLaren are actually drivable and stable - I had a difficult time getting these cars stable in other games with tons of tweaking; whereas, in AC, stock settings have been okay thus far. Having never driven the cars on the list in real life (really who can afford these beauties?), I have no comparison, but it ""feels"" more realistic and less arcade to how I believe the cars should handle. I feel this game is the “most realistic” and grounded to the road compared to other games.  My biggest gripe to date is the poor MP on PC. All PC players want from AC is: private lobbies, easy MP setup, realistic gameplay, and fun racing with friends. FIX THIS, please. Content - Not a lot, even with all the DLC. AC does have some of the staples of racing tracks - Nürburgring, Spa, Brands Hatch, Monza, etc. I would like some classic tracks like Laguna Seca, Bathurst, Sarthe, Fuji (these are added mods - though mods are fairly good, the sound and track intricacies are not quite the same as the AC tracks). For all those modders, thank you! The modding community does a great job for both vehicles and tracks!			"

												I'm using it with a steam controller. Very enjoyable. I bought Project Cars, Dirty Rally, and Corsa the same week. Corsa has got my attention more. It's not the prettiest of the three, but the handling is great.edit: almost a year later and I purchased other racing games like autmoblista, (rfactor 2, refunded) and other racing games. I'm still playing Corsa. I got a 300rs GT with a g29 shifter using an adapter. I'm not a ""car guy"" but I still play this game. I get frustrated, I get better, I move foward, then I get frustrated, then I get good etc etc. This game is a problem because I want to get to other car games but this is pretty much the most balanced visually, gameplay, and physics wise. Every one should own it but you'll need a steam controller or a wheel.			"

												The most disgusting menu EVER, like the server configurator too.In a distant distant galaxy, many many years ago (2005), the creators of the Factor thought of making a headmotion (and oh god it works perfectly!), but the Italian geniuses from KUNOS can not come to this brilliant decision. Yes, the physics is excellent, the graphics are more or less pleasant, I was ready to put up with this terrible menu, the lack of weather conditions and time of day, but it's time and Assetto Corsa begins to annoy, with no joke. You are great fellows in terms of physics, but everything else in this game is simply unforgivable.			"

Once you learn to drive Assetto Corsa you'll never be able to drive Forza or Grid again because you can't handle the drift-a-round handling in those games.All in all, AC is a great simulator but it is definitely unfinished in the current (1.1) state. There is so much small ""irrelevant"" stuff that feels broken, unifinished and badly working that it makes your gaming experience a lot less enjoyable even if the core game and the engine is good. I won't be listing stuff here because you can easily find these things in many reviews here.Another unpleasant thing that people may find out is that the hardcore community of this game is ♥♥♥♥ing hostile towards everyone who hasn't dedicated his life to racing simulators and doesn't possess at least 300€ racing wheel and other equipment. Asking a simple question about keyboard control mapping does pretty much always end into people telling you to kill yourself and your actual question will be forgotten. And by the way, you can't remap most of the original keyboard controls, they're hardcoded or bugged or something but as an example you can't change your camera switch button.Is there anything good to say then?Yes.If you're a hardcore sim driver you'll enjoy this game and probably enjoy being around the community because they do know their stuff. If you just enjoy driving games you'll still most likely like AC because the driving mechanics are good.If you enjoy great graphics in your racing games you'll like this game even more.The AI in this game is pretty non-existent. It drives but it doesn't race. If you set the difficulty to max they will drive perfectly in a huge queue trough the track and do crazy laptimes but they still won't do anything to overtake anyone. Dropping the difficulty makes them brake a lot earlier and thus makes them slower but still they just drive the track without giving a crap about you or eachother.Pitstops don't work in single player which is really a shame.Wrapping it all together, as much as I've been dissappointed in this game at times I still recommend it to everyone who likes a good racing game. Just grab a few friends and go shoot a few laptimes in Monza with LaFerraris or McLarens and it will be amazing!			"

												As a big fan of rF2 i have to say that i dont like AC, the FFB has gotten a lot better than it used to be, but its still bad, the cars physics are, alright but their quality varies widely from car to car. The UI is good and terrible at the same time, not having possibility to do any settings changes without leaving track back to menu is very frustrating. Kunoz now started presenting DLCs for which you need to pay extra, something you will never see at rF2.AC simply does not offer what i am looking for in a simulator, that is the reason why i wouldnt buy it knowing what i know, and definetly not recomend it. There are far better simulators. Sorry			"

												Wow, so what can I say about Assetto Corsa, how does it stack up to Project Cars?Well, having come from Project Cars first, I don't think I'll look back. The physics engine on this game is far better and less temperamental. Many have praised the game on how true to life the handling is. I can't attest to that as I don't own a driving license lol!I also find the sounds a lot more immersive, whether they're better or not is really a matter of taste, but I prefer the sounds here also. Visually Project Cars takes the crown, however, this is by no means an ugly game and it runs so smooth. The career is fun and more reminisent of Forza Motorsport, this for me is a good thing as I found Project Cars a bit long in the tooth. The car selection is much better here too, such examples as Ferrari, Lamborghini, Nissan etc. The track selection leaves a bit to be desired, though they have been adding more with the DLC packs.If you are a fan of sim racers this is a must for you.

												Let me first of go by saying , that i have played every sim racing game out there , including the Iracing .Having said that i can easily say that ""Assetto Corsa"" is by far one of the most realistic driving experiences on PC .But in order to trully appreciate this game and it's realisam , you are gonna need to invest some money and time into it . Meaning , that you will need to get a Thrustmaster Wheel  458 italia  & Oculus Rift DK2 , and i promise you that you are going to get the real immerssive racing experience available on PC format .This is only for those who are a hardcore racing enthusiats and wanna experience the best of the best . But for a casual PC sim fan a Xbox Controller or any kind of wheel will be enough. I'm not gonna bore with details on why ""Assetto Corsa"" is the most accurate and realistic racing sim , all you need to know that it is , and don't take my word for it ,  do your research online and you will see what others mostly Professional Real Life Race Drivers have to say about this game .

								Cannot say enough good things about this simulator.Whether you are from a driving ""game"" background, or already an avid driving sim fan, you can get into Asseto Corsa very easily. While this is a serious driving sim, you are not thrown in at the deep end, of course if you want to dive in the deep end, that is also available (you can find the diving board and speedo's over there --->  8-)If you want to start by trying a small engine car around an easier race track with all the assists turned on, by all means do that, if you want to jump into a hyper car and fly around  a challenging circuit with out any on as your first try, have at it my son!The driving physics are tip top, absolutely spot on, the cars behave exactly as they should...The graphics are also amazing... The cars are perfect recreations of their real world counterparts, down to the tiniest details (you gotta see the cockpit for the Formular Arbarth, its drool worthy) The racing tracks are recreated from laser scans of the real locations, which means the layout is 100% accurate. If the real track has a 5mm kink somewhere in the main straight, this version of the track will also have the same 5mm kink in it.While it is not required, i do highly recommend you use a quality force feedback wheel and pedals set to play. You can use tiptronic paddle shifters, a sequencial shifter or a full H-Gate gear shifter. If you have a controller with both H-Gate and paddles (such as a G25) you can set both. So if you jump into a hyper car that has paddles, you can use the paddles, if you then change to a car with a shifter, you can then use the shifter, without having to go back into the options and changing anything, you can even manually over ride the auto gearbox. Clutch pedals are also supported (i did say its worth using a good wheel set, hehe)While this driving sim is still in the infant stages at the moment, you can easily see it will become a great contender in the league of top driving sims. it will keep pace with any of the other well known driving sims (on pc and console a like) I cannot wait to see what the final product will be like.If i had to score this game out of 10.. I would have to give it 9.5-10. It loses half a point simply because its so damn addictive,  you can start playing and suddenly a few hours have passed. Well worth the money, even now and the game will only get bigger and better as time goes on.Over all verdict... Two thumbs up!			"

												Great sim with huge potential+ Nice looking game+ Physics are really good. almost spot on, maybe RFactor 2 is better for now. That would be the only rival for realism besides iRacing but both of these surpass iRacing.+ Human input from the modding community is fantastic. means loads of track, cars, weather mods, rally tracks, I even saw a bus and a truck etc.+ plenty of options+ when you tune your car it makes a huge difference unlike Grid+ Still a young game so it should have plenty of development to come. I'm looking for improvements on my negative points+ Simple layout.+ Good standard content- No rain etc bad weather dynamics. Project cars looks to be better for this.- No night time (Le mans?)- AI is not agressive enough and not all that smart. stock car racing still has the best- setting up multiplayer is not easy plus alot of messing around to change tracks. Grid autosport is good at this.~ Humans. With access to a large variety of cars and tracks straight away plus a lot of people coming from arcade racing you get crashed into alot. but thats ok as long as you cosider this. The fresh/new community will improve I'm glad there are no restrictions like iRacing. maybe ranked races could sort this.So a great game. beats the rest in my view although they have other positives I think the realism and looks together do it for me...plus the modding community. Thanks for my 180sx modders. I recomend watching ""empty box"" on youtube			"

												This is simply the best driving/racing/sim there is. Well it is a simulator, so the physics are superb. The team did a really great job on the game overall.Graphics are excellent, the list of cars and tracks is very satisfying and there are many more to come; on the subject of the upcoming content the prices are silly, it is so cheap, the best value not only for the game, but also for DLCs.The next best thing is iRacing and it does not have as much content and the prices are ridiculous, you even have to pay to host a race, again, bang for buck Assetto kills everything there is.Compared to iRacing, the multiplayer, is still not as well functioning at this stage of developement, but it still does work quite well, so this is pretty much the only minor downside to this game.Again, physics are plainly, The BestRate? 10 out of 10, I simply can not let it have any lower than that. The multiplayer is in BETA so it doesn't go into account, don't get me wrong, it works just fine.So if you are looking for a simulator, don't just sit here and read this load, BUY THE GAME, you will not regreat it.

												If you were a fan of rFactor have no doubt you will love Assetto Corsa.Physics: 9/10I've been a racing sim fan for years. Assetto Corsa's physics are on par (actually better imo) than LFS and rFactor.Graphics: 7/10The graphics are nothing to write home about, but definitely good enough. Stay away from the Post Processing presets and find some good ones on the forums. I'm guessing it will run well on lower end systems. I've used the game with Occulus DK2 and it's truly a ground breaking experience.Car and Track selection and quality: 9/10Laser scanned tracks and very very detailed car models. Sound is great on some cars and so-so on others. They recently adapted the game to use the  FMOD sound engine. FMOD is very powerful and allows for great mixing options and a variety of characterful noises.Modding community: 12/10Some of the highest quality mods of any game (sim or not) I've ever seen and the community is huge. Along with VR support, this may be one of the best aspects of Assetto Corsa. 10/10 would buy again.			"

												This is the best sim i have ever played, it completely supports Logitech G27 driving wheel and makes adjustments automaticly, all that's left is having fun. Wheel feedbacks themendously awesome. If you drive fast car, you can feel the understeer, acceleration and pressure of throttle pedal.  Every single car presents individual feeling. Really realististic.if i need to sum up, i don't recommend if you haven't quality wheel set. Please don't consider this game as a nightmare to playing with keyboard ;) Have a good drive ;)			"

												Superb. It's a testament to how different this game feels when you see how many negative reviews and forum gripes call it glitched, unbalanced and BORING. These are people who have never thought to move their *analog* sticks any less then 100% to the left or the right, let alone finessing their triggers!(keyboard users move on, this game is a matter of pure finesse{saving up for wheel}) The game's career has a perfectly crafted progression that layers your understanding of true driving mechanics and like a good teacher will punish you until you learn the obvious geometric elegencies of manipulating 4 wheels like dark souls, monster hunter or quake did with your thumbs themselves. I have played many driving games for years and have only now found myself learning to appreciate camber adjustments and brake bias in a new light of truthful motoring simulation. Even drifting requires a more precise execution that feels easier to understand based on the fluid feedback of the game. At first glance you might find yourself feeling shorted by the 20 something cars and 10ish tracks but once your realize the genius of the game engine you are given to learn in and the many UNIQUE combinations it becomes a joy to bend around every apex put in front of you in any car. And O wait, never ending mods! :DEXTRA POINTS:Yes! Even you can race! The game will let you decide your difficulty in head to head races based on 80-100% efficency in your opponents. I keep my dudes at 90 or a little above for a fair pace that still leaves human openings, while flat 80 is still ""real"" but leaves them acting like trackday newbies tapping their brakes in fear. The only other challenge type than a standard race is time attack which smartly rewards consistency instead of pushing the limit. Just keep all 4 wheel on track to learn and you can make it through, but honing in and going like a pro will be exponentially rewarded!As stated YOU WILL NEED A CONTROLLER of some sort to appreciate the subtle tendencies of the motoring physics portrayed in this game (go play Trackmania if you want the best keyboard driving in the world). 360 controllers are excellent but his game was designed for a wheel and you will always be reminded of that by feeling your controller rumble to the rythm of what you know should be force feedback on a wheel.The game runs great but has a few subtle quirks in the code like the great independant performance engineering the game attempts to depict. Nothing broken but nothing super optimized either outside of the framerate itself which is VERY GOOD . But the thing as a whole has a good feel like an Alpha Romeo or a Lincoln where damn you just can't find a fault with it.			"

However just chillin and doin hotlaps and shaving off seconds of your time is really satisfying, plus there is an insane amount of community tracks and vehicles that can reach surprisingly high levels of quality.

												For anyone wondering PCars is way  more fun.I like this game alot but I cannot recommend it to others for  a few reasons. If you decide to buy it it will not be your loss but it seems that racing sims have been plagued by a few but significant glitches.  Asseto Corsa is no exception to the  palgue that is destroying racing sims lately. Maybe developers are trying to get fans to fall out of love with the genre and create a generation of non- drivers. IDKThe game has absolutely beautifully rendered graphics. WOW just WOW. Impressive. The cars , the tracks, amazing! Ignore the pit crews and fans and it is a 10 on the graphics chart. Cockpit view, frame rate all the above gets high marks no doubt about it. The down side is the game play itself. How can I say it? It is unplayable. Even with the G920 Force feedback wheel it gets  super low marks on the fun scale.  No fun, just frustration. I will go into detail for those like my self who desparately want to believe that is must be some terrible mistake. Physics. On track contact goes like this. I am driving a balloon the AI is driving a Mack truck .I get tapped and all hell breaks loose, that simple. I can ful speed rear-end  an opponent and they might wiggle a little before recovering and driving off. That is no way to play but the AI will run you right off the track and you can do nothing about it, including drive away. They pin you and you are stuck together like two magnets. WTF?Realism. Ok guys so lets race. I have played a score of racers. Sims and arcade. This game asserts itself as a sim no doubt. The AI runs a perfect line everytime. Accelerates perfectly every time.  My car however has no consistency in its handling. Tire wear ? Whats that? Keeping the RPMs up? No such thing. Drafting? Nope. Rules? Who needs those , just drive across the grass because that is the only way you can win a lap.Ok so lets turn the difficulty all the way down and set opponent strength to it lowest. Now it becomes like a Sunday drive. Try turning even one of the difficulty features up to make it more realistic and once again it just become unplayable. It is really sad because this game had so much potential from appearances. It makes me sad because they come close but miss by so much.  Just another beautiful game plagued by zero fun game play. The jokes on me.			"

												This game is an absolute stunner. I've driven in many racing sims, over several platforms, and I have to say this is the best yet. Granted, the car and track choice may not be as extensive as other racing sims - for example GT6 on Playstation - but goodness me, the actual driving experience far surpasses anything else.Let's look at the breakdown:Pros - + Graphics - I mean really, this has epic graphics, shadows, reflections, the lot!+ Sounds - True to life, a big plus for this sim.+ Physics - Again, very true to life.+ Force-feedback - applies only to wheel users - I use a G27 and it's great, you get a very fine feel from the road.+ Detail - Tracks and Cars - the level of detail here is simply sublime.+ Price of DLCs - very economical - only £7-ish quid per pack, for a big selection of new content.+ Multiplayer - fun, and fairly lag-less.+ Stability and performance - I can pull 115 FPS at total max settings; your mileage may vary but it gives you an idea of what can be achieved.Cons - - Choice - There aren't that many cars and tracks to choose from.- Price - £40 (at time of my purchase) is a tad steep, although worth it.TL;DR:""Buy this now.""

												Bought a G27 Steering Wheel recently and this game is just brilliant with it. With the Logitech Profiler and the ingame pre-configs the game just works perfectly. Laser-scanned tracks, detailed physics for every car. The amount of mods is amazing, and the DLC's aren't too expensive with a decent amount of content. The only big con I can think of is that the Nurburgring is a DLC. Also a decent PC is needed together with practice and dedication. Not your typical racing-game. 9/10 You like realistic racing/drifting, you'll like this game.			"

												First of all, i sould say i've never played a Racing Sim. I was hoping for a PC Gran Turismo, but it's a lot more hardcore. I can't seem to even corner properly, i just go straight most of the time. I need more practice :)UpdateWith a bit more practice right now, i can corner a bit. It doesn't do me much good at the moment, i'm stuck on the second career challege (the Fiat 500 Abarth SS race). Now, here's something i've noticed in most racing games: the fixed pattern your opponents will follow and can't be moved from.I crashed into another car, which left me spinning, but the other car just kept driving in his fixed pattern.Normally this isn't much of a deal, but here a wrong corner will make you lose the race. Assetto Corsa  is that kind of game. One mistake, you lose the race and hit the reset button. Which is what i have been doing for the past hour; hitting the reset button. I'm beginning to fear that this game is not for me.			"

Posted: February 26, 2016
												Sadly i love this game... But i can't recommend it to anyone...The main reasons are as follows.-Horrible AI (The AI drive like you don't exist... You will get pushed off at every opportunity.. I race mostly offline and when a car is right behind me i can't race the track anymore i just have to push beyond all my braking points just so that i avoid the AI ramming into me or taking an inside turn when one doesn't exist. I don't understand why this is such a problem for assetto when there are games out there that do pretty good with AI i mean.... atleast the AI is aware that you exist... As for AI vs AI it's non-existent. They just drive the line and that is it... )-Kunos doesn't listen to their customers as to what they want in this game and consistently release DLC's that no one really asked for and are priced terribly high. -I tried a g27 a TS500 and a Fanatec. Sadly they controls are just too senstive. I've tried everything to reduce them from within the game or outside and it doesn't reduce sensitivity. Other games easily have this problem solved by allowing you to change sensitivity of your pedals and wheels but this doesn't exist in Assetto. The closest thing they have to sensitivity is brake gamma which really has a set curve that you can move along and with nothing for steering or for accelerator settings... I do not drive any car with TC or ABS even if it comes as factory. For me that kills all the fun in braking with the right pressure and actually preventing your car from spinning out when coming out of turns or braking hard. Some people like just pushing down on the brakes and letting the abs do the work for them.. To me that isn't racing if all you have to do is accelerate to full and brake to full... It makes no sense to me and i don't see any challenge or fun in that.. I've asked Kunos many times to simply add settings for sensitivity but alas as you can see they just ignore everything even though Kunos well knows it will help alot of people out. You can go and type in sensitivity with assetto corsa in google and see for yourself.-Very bad multiplayer setup. If you want to host a server for a simple race with some friends be prepared to do your homework since it isn't anywhere near as easy as other games where you just click on setup server or custom server or start an internet game. Kunos has almost willingly made it very tedious to run a server of your own.-No crash damage... You do see a diagram of your car come up and turn different colours as you damage certain parts but as for visually don't expect to see anything apart from perfect cars... Makes no sense to me....- Nothing to do with weather or nighttime racing.- No pit stops....- Basically this game simulates a car i guess really well... That is where it stops. This isn't a racing game its just a car simulator. Please don't get mistaken before or if you buy this game.The only reason i love this game.- The physics are great. - FFB is great and you can feel the car really nicely..I'm sorry to anyone that wants this game so badly. I just find it so upsetting when Kunos has such a great game and there are very clear suggestions put to them from many people as to how they can really help change this game. But it is beyond me and this doens't go for Kunos only but it is beyond me why devs don't listen to their customers and tailor the game to what they want or need just like any other seller of any goods. It's usually a demand or a niche that people try to provide to which Kunos fails to do everytime. I mean simple things like allowing additional settings has nothing to do with whether most people will like it or not. Just give people the options to race anywhere with any opponents to have all steering and pedal options available... I really don't see this as hard or challenging in anyway...Lastly and sadly... Assetto Corsa is the only game i know of where i had to do so much research and reading just to even find information that is important. I've got this game during Early Access and i've seen it grow but i'm sorry that Kunos decided to go this way because it saddens me that they really have a rough diamond in their hands... I just wish they would cut and polish it the correct way and the way it's customers want... I still get confused till today as to why devs don't do what their customers ask...			"

												 There are loads of fine simulators out there, they all drive well and look stunning. So if you can afford them try them all and pick which you want to drive at your leisure. I have tried most and have to say Assetto Corsa shines through, even with all of its faults.   Multiplayer not really suitable for leagues. AI too easy to beat  (sometimes) Career a bit lack lustre. No day/weather cycle. Tyres/brakes/Engine/Water/Oil temps missing or lacking in detail. Mods break every update (modders should keep on top of their own work right enough). Low speed spins/curbs of death are annoying. Tyres never leave the road in a crash (Peculiar thing to see) and I am sure there are a few other annoyances. But the good things so out weigh all of the negatives. The feel of the cars, every car feels and acts differently. Tracks are beautifully rendered and you can feel every bump and imperfection. The sounds of the engines and tyres, so different between road and sports cars. The total immersion, sometimes you can fall into the screen and forget it is a sim. Online racing is spectacular, wheel to wheel, out braking in corners etc etc Modded content available, so much so it could become an addiction.  Developers that listen and even take over modded content with full licenses.  So much more to say but that is AC, the more you play the more you want to play. I have over 1100 hours of game time and just cannot stop loving this sim. There are things I want implemented, there are bugs I want fixing, there are cars and tracks I want in it, but most of all I want to thank Team Kunos for keeping going and developing a sim that really will become better and better with time. Kudos to Kunos.			"

												This is the best racing simulator since the best of all time - Grand Prix Legends - driving the Lotus 49 around the 66 Monza track brought a smile back to my face that no other simulation has done since GPL.  RaceRoom comes close to it, but Assetto Corsa has an undefinable 'feel' to it, having at times an almost ethereal qualty.  With a Logitech G27 its incredible, the weightiness of the steering conveys everything happening at the wheels.  Sound design is absolutely fabulous - particularly the Lotus 78T, and there is a real solidity to the handling model.Car choice is varied - the odd smattering of less interesting metal punctuates some of the greatest and most iconic cars ever to have graced the track.If the design team had included the old Spa and Rouen tracks from GPL, along with the Porsche 917K, Ferrari 312P and 1970 512S I dont think Id have been able to leave the house for another week and my girlfriend would be packing her bags....Well come on then....What are you waiting for?

												Unless you're a true racing sim fanatic and have a racing set up ie; steering wheel, pedals and all that, I'd avoid this one. I found it pretty boring. The only reason I bought it was because it was on sale (hardly), and I was looking for a good racing game. Unfortunately I didn't find it here. 4/10Bring Forza to PC Microsoft...			"

												Great driving sim with very decent physics and FFB with decent DLC options.Extremely toxic community though.I got bashed by a bunch of twelvies because I don't like the fact that the DPAD of a supported wheel isn't working. (♥♥♥♥ me, right?)This game has a bunch of decent cars, classic and modern ones though I find the amount of tracks a little lacking. But they're laser scanned so that's pretty cool.You can download plenty of mods (cars and tracks) and cool apps to enhance your HUD in useful ways. The DLC is definitely worth checking out, too.Good wheel recommended.			"

												The BMW E36 is a compact executive car which was produced by BMW from 1990 to 1999. It was introduced in October 1990 in the 4-door sedan body style. The model range was later expanded to include the coupe, convertible, station wagon (""Touring"")!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and  hatchback (""Compact"") . The BMW E46 replaced the E36 sedans in 1998, however the E36 coupe and station wagon models remained in production until 1999, the convertible models remained in production until 2000 and the hatchback models remained in production until 2001.

												There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but at the same time there's nothing really fun about it either.  Assetto Corsa does nothing at all to distance itself from the current crop of racing games.  It lacks any sort of spirit or identity, and ends up feeling far too sterile and almost mechanical in nature.  There's just not enough here for me to recommend this game.			"

												Not a bad sim - produced by a bunch of arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who can't take criticism. The AI is a complete joke and they STILL steadfastly refuse to make standard controls mappable to controllers - even simple ones like pause or opening the menu ffs! Basically because people want it so to assert their self-imposed regal dominance over the 'peasants of the sim world' they just won't do it.Don't take my word for it - the 'developers' forum handle - ""Lord Kunos"" speaks for itself...Is good if you are looking for a featureless solo hotlap 'sim' - I say bring on something from a developer that actually realises they are making a game for the consumer - not to inflate their own ego posting positive reviews of their 'great sim', and banning anyone who dares criticise their 'sim' on the forums.....For example - https://pretendracecars.net/2017/01/10/another-year-another-stefano-meltdown/ "

												This game is buggy, poorly optimized and most importantly, boring.There's all kinds of weird physics that makes you wonder what the hell just happened and why. Sometimes your car will just fly into the air. Some cars are so far detached from the real world counterparts I don't know how the team got the figures they use. Certain drivetrain types (Namely AWD, which was slightly improved some months ago) just don't really work properly.I'm running a frankly underpowered 2 gb 960 running triple screens, and this game drops frames and has stuttering issues like nobodies business. Anytime there's any amount of alpha effects (Smoke, trees[Which are all 2d sprites], grass, dust) the game drops frames. I have to run the game at medium to low to try and maintain a somewhat stutter and tear free framerate, and anytime the car touches dirt it drops around 20 FPS. This game is not a looker by any means. I can run Dirt Rally (With MASSIVE amounts of alpha effects being huge plumes of dust [not AC's 6 visible ""Smoke"" sprites]) near max at ~80fps and PCars at medium high at 60, on triples. Hell, even The Witcher 3 gets better performance than this game.There's little to no customization of anything in this game. Every car gives the option to change tire pressure, alignment and a small amount of suspension. Anything further is a crapshoot and typically reserved for the teams more favorite cars. The car list isn't even that impressive, with numbers being bloated by a crap ton of Lotus's no one uses and ""performance"" packages. Once on the track... well you better like hotlapping around bland scenery because the AI are awful and online doesn't give you the freedom you want.With a lack of any real good official content, the game relies on mods, most of which are half baked and never completed. The ones that are any good get outdated quickly as Assetto Corsa moves on to different methods, meaning the mod owners have to either update all their mods or just drop them entirely (which many do.)On another point, the ""community"" for this game are some of the most toxic I've seen, if not the most. Anyone who has valid criticism or questions gets♥♥♥♥♥♥on and typically banned after being insulted from the devs. The official forums used to be a great place to find mods and work together, but the devs got rid of that because apparently it was just a place where people were inflating their ego? I think it's because the most prominent modders making quality content constantly♥♥♥♥♥♥on the dev's for being incompetent and made better mods.I got banned on the forum for saying that Forza looks better (Which it does) and saying one of the tire model revisions seemed to add a smidge of understeer. The community and ""Lord Kunos"" (The main dev) called me an idiot and a conspiracy theorist.You can't access the forums without linking it to your steam profile page, which means I can't even access the forums to see what's being worked on or other basic things. I paid $40 for a product I can't even read about because I ""insulted"" the devs.			"

												I wouldn't of believed it unless I experienced it...and I did. The AC forum, I was attacked and called names simply because I was critical or asked questions, and reported bugs that made the developers look bad?? They decided to attack using name calling tactics and the first thing that came to my mind was Bell from Pcars, attacking name calling and banning those who didn't speak positive or were critical of them. Fanboy favorites would then act like a pack of dogs, hunt for and surround their intended victim and attack! Which was fine, and really was holding my own until one of the actual ""staff"" members started in, started with insults, but when I responded back...with a rather fresh comeback...they banned me. So they attack call you inappropriate names but when you defend yourself they ""AC"" ban you...Sounds familiar!??I really hoped, though I heard from others about similar gross behaviors of banning for not being a fanboy but didn't want to beleive it. I report good when I see it...report bad or problems when I see it hear about them.So I am giving a thumbs down, this is their official support forum, and without it...makes it hard to report bugs or get ANY support if you're banned from that entire site!, unless of course you make another account with different ip etc 😎...which I could do but a pain in the butt....I guess what bothers me the most here is...these guys are supposed to be and act like ""Professionals"" and should be able to take a little critism/questions without being triggered, verbally attacking their customers..and not ban them when they respond in kind. For the record my response, there was no profanity, and I was merely in a defensive position with my reply that was clearly in tandem with the insults directed at me, I had responses like...don't like don't read...get out of mom's basement for some fresh air....stupid, and referred to them using their postion of power acting like bullies....as again this was after being attack and called names...buy a ""staff member"" no less.I am not saying my response was perfect but agian it was after being attacked. These individuals should be acting in a professional manner and have a higher level of standard applied...Instead of taking the opportunity to address me privately, that the AC staff were taking issues with of my comments or questions they publicly berated me...so I responded...for that, there was no warning, I was banned! This in my opinion, childish and controlling behavior of AC...they desperately want to control the narrative..and if it's negative then they will attack, provoke to you respond..then ban you as if giving them some sorta self accepting ok from their indecent acts.Maybe AC numbers are slipping...support or fan base is slipping because of all their problems taking on console and are feeling pressured because the console market is failing?? I dont know...but as a customer..The way AC staff handled this matter was totally inappropriate, publicly berating, rather than private co conversation and banning someone one when they defend themselves...to me is just bad business and shouldn't be the norm but the exception to the rule. I give them a thumbs down...a fail for the dictator, Stalin type of running of their forum.The actual game itself is ok...there are issues both PC and Console however not able to address them as I am banned 😀I would also add that with competition out their, no day night, or weather transition is unacceptable. Litterly no crash damage, and the DLC is crazy over priced imho (another reason why In was attacked as I said as much on their forum..was quickly giving comparison to ""Rocket League"" lmao by a Staff member...what a stupid comparison and shows you how far they were reaching for something intelligent to say...fail!) and the most unforgiving of all to come into the console market and have NO private servers for their console customers! I have this game now unfortunately on two platforms with no official support.			"

												Makes Project Cars look like a piece of overhyped garbage that it is. Force feedback is excellent, most vehicles handle, sound and look very good. User interface is average. The benchmark for any serious sim racing enthusiast. On another steam profile, I have extensively tested AC, pCars, rfactor 1 and 2, F1 Codemaster 2011, 12, 13, 14,15, RRE and iRacing. Conclusion, Assetto Ofcorsa is the best by a country mile. Am preordering the Rift just for this game alone. I bought AC during its apha stage and have racked up over 1000hrs. It has given me incredible memories in league and casual racing. I cannot begin to describe the preciseness of force feedback. It is the standout feature of this title. WIth proper wheel and pedal setup, this sim will knock your socks off.			"

YouTube™ Video: Assetto Corsa 0.6 Gameplay AI Race lotus type 49 

			Views: 174		

			I earn the achievement 300kmh by falling the through the map! Scrub to 7:06 to the start of the death jump run.		

I hope I have the right URL.  This game is just great, Beautiful graphics, real physics and a slew of cars and tracks to choose from.  I found the menu system slightly convoluted and a bit tedious at times.  Setting up my wheel was simple enough to play but as a new sim-racer I've alot to learn.  My wheel is a DFGT and it's not in the best condition for some reason.  The video above shows a slight oops in the game map as I fall through the map at around 7 minutes and then proceed to earn a trophy for reaching 300kmh...as I'm falling through rmember.  At any rate I've alot to learn as a newb Sim racer and this game makes me want to learn more.			"

												It's a driving sim, and a damn good one. Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and even though Kunos want it to be playable with a controller if you want to get the most out of this you really need a wheel of some sort. There's a career mode, but only in the sense that there's a series of races you can progress through via a menu. Races you can set up manually at any time in a different menu, since the game gives you access to all cars from the start. So yeah, you can pretty much ignore the career mode.There are 3 DLCs, and at the very least you should get the 1st one as it comes with one of the best renditions ever of the famous nordschliefe. The other 2 DLCs are both arguably worth the money, as in each there are at least a few cars worth having.Mods are supported, and the possibilities are vast. As time goes on, more and more content will be created as there is already a decent modding scene for this sim. Kunos is still updating everything as well, particularly in preparation for console release. Also notable is how all of the real life tracks except for 1 are laser scanned for that extra bit of realism.The online racing is slightly spotty, but that's par for the course for everything outside of iRacing pretty much. The AI only recently got to the point where they're consistently good drivers, whch is still good practice before online racing with other actual people.Truth be told, right now this game is best at being a hotlapping simulator. The other elements are improving all the time, and if you truly want proper online racing your best bet is to join a league of some sort in order to get into their private servers with people who know racing etiquette. I still have fun on public nordschliefe tourist servers, where you see every sort of car.One of the best early access games, and one that has delivered a huge amount from a formerly tiny studio. All cars in the game have painstakingly taken real data (wherever possible) into account, and with some of them it's hard to find a more authentic simulator experience anywhere else. Those looking for a forza-like game on the PC, this isn't it. There's no upgrading of the cars, just setups. The driving is unforgiving, and if you've never played a racing sim before and you go into this game blind you're going to have a rough time.Know what you're buying, but I'd say the game is well worth it for any fan of sim racing.

												This game is without a doubt the best racing simulator I have ever played.If you have a wheel setup, this is the perfect game for you. From the racing, drifting, to just driving around because you feel like it, it all feels realistic and fun.Once you have purchased this game I recommend heading over to www.acmods.net and downloading mods that take your fancy.

Early Access Review
								Coming from Gran Turismo or Forza? Things to know...Thought I would make this thread seeing as I am one of the above described. Firstly the game is very playable with a controller but it does require some tweaking. For something that feels a little more like GT or FM (and I do mean LITTLE) use the following control settings...Handling Speed: 10%Gamma: 4Filter: 0.2Speed Sense: 0.1Dead Zone: 0.1Having said that, this game is a LOT more realistic than GT or FM and will punish you for any bad habits. Late breaking will see you screeching into the dirt and it is essential that you pay attention to the speed in which you take corners. Basically I am saying forget everything you think you know about racing sims before playing. So is it a hard game to get into? Short answer: Yes it can be. But once you start playing with the correct mentality it is very addictive and actually a lot of fun. At the moment content is a little bare but the silver lining is that you can just concentrate on driving, there are no AI cars getting in the way. Each car handles very differently and each of them have their own quirks and challenges. Pushing a Farrarri to its limits is both terrifying and exhilirating but as you learn the cars and tracks and gain more confidence, those lap times start to look a whole lot better.Graphically the game looks very impressive for an early access release. The cars look stunning and are already up there with Gran Turismo 5's premium models and I expect that they will look even better once the game is finished. The tracks however could use some more work. Whilst they do look accurate they just feel a little lifeless. There are no trees blowing, spectators, wild life or anything else of interest. Some of the scenery also looks flat and dated such as trees that are simply two 2D images ""slotted"" together (think back to PSOne racing games for a clearer picture). However the game is far from finished so there is plenty of time to work on it. Performance was almost perfect for me, the only annoyance being some distant pop up.So that's what I think of the game so far, in summary....Is the game playable with a controller? Yes with some tweakingDoes it look good? Cars yes, tracks mehIs it GT or FM for the PC? No, it's a LOT more realisticShould I still try it? Absolutely!			"

								By far best racing game i've played. It still being in early acces doesn't mean it's totally broken like e.g. DayZ Standalone. O, god no, this game is very playable with steering wheel support and awesome FFB effect's on my G27 racing wheel.My favorite car a.t.m. is the Lotus 98T, it's a old '80's Formula 1 car with 1400+ HP. The traction and effects are awesome at this car. Let's not forget all the awesome BMW's and Ferrari's, but the Lotus cars don't attract me a single bit, what I would love to see are more ""normal use"" cars like the VW Golf GTi (preferably the Mk5, best handling and torque) or a Seat Leon ST, Ford Focus RS, Golf R(32).What is even better, is that the track I visit alot of time's, The Nordschleife, is going to be in this game as a DLC. This DLC contains the Nordschleife and 10 cars but considering this track is really 100% precise laser scanned this is well worth the price.Performance is good on my system, almost always 60FPS with a AMD FX8320 @4.8Ghz, 16GB 1866Mhz RAM, a 250GB Samsung EVO SSD, and last but not least: Asus R9 280X DCII GPU. Great value for money!			"

												So i played gran turismo on the ps3 and loved it, I knew playing racing games on a keyboard wasn't exactally ideal, but figured id be fine with a 360 controller.. I was wrong, I really don't recomend you get this if you don't have a stearing wheel. I plan on getting one at some point so no big deal, but that is just something to consider. the only other cons i have are the small number of cars currently available, but i'm sure they will be adding more. The cars do look beautiful, and I think once i get a wheel this game will be amazing.			"

								Still in early access phase so not able to review it properly. But, give it car tuning and customization like the other two console based racing simulators, give it credit based career mode and car acquisition mechanics, give it a respectable number of cars and tracks and you've nailed it. Great graphics, sound properties that remind us of cars and not noise, realistic and familiar physics, the great support for in-game apps and skins developed by 3rd party developers. Slightly disappointed with the gamepad vibration function, it does not provide any feedback about kerbs, tyre stress or out of track shocks or crashes.This early access shows it has the foundations to be an honestly great game but for the time being I don't consider my 35 euros money well spent. I'll have to wait and hope for the final release to be so much more to be happy to recommend it.			"

								I bought this game not long after it came out on steam. I loved it! I spent 12 hours on it in less than 2 weeks. Then an update came (somewhere around 0.72) and the game wouldnt let me go on track from there on after. I dont know if thats my computer, me being an idiot or the game being weird. This is a fantastic game and I would love to recommend it, but because of the runtime error every time i try to go on track it would just take me back to the home screen. Its a shame really, once this is fixed il do an update section on the comment.EDIT/UPDATEIt lives! After days of tweeking and fiddling and smacking my head on my desk repeatedly I managed to find a combonation of settings that my computer would chew and then spit out back at me! Thank you game, one of the best games I have ever played finally works.			"

								I have a friend with whom I raced in an F1 2013 League some time ago. When somebody suggested Assetto Corsa to the league, he refused to consider it, and backed up this point by copying a whole page of bugfixes from the most recent update.More fool him.Kunos have done a utterly fantastic job on this game at the time of writing - that is, towards the end of the Alpha Phase. Not only that, but they've involved the community in their decisions, looked for feedback from those who play - In fact, I'd go so far as to say you should buy the game simply to help support the developer. But then you'd be missing out on the point; you'd be buying one of the best PC Racing Simulators out there today.-Overall  This is an Early Access Review, but in saying that, the game is close to flawless. The graphics are stunning. Each car is modelled perfectly. The tracks are all laser scanned. The feel of each car is individual. The force feedback for those with wheels, is immersive. In game sounds are gorgeous. The AI are being constantly improved, and they already far outstrip those in any of the other racing games I play. Possibly the largest asset, though, is the large and very active community, who are a source of advice, feedback, and, of course, an inexhausible supply of mods, which really make the content feel more complete. Overall, it's a wonderful Sim. There is not a car that's not easy to drive, within your limits - but when you begin to push, when you begin to look for the tenths through every corner, when you place the car on the ragged edge, brushing the barriers, feeling the back start to come loose, you will make mistakes. Of course. But that just makes success more intoxicating.-Content  Probably the major con when considering the game. Though each car is beautifully crafted and offers limitless opportunity for driving, there are only a small selection in the base game. There are also only a small number of different tracks, and sadly, a lot of the classics are missing at the moment. Kunos is a small developer, of course, so this is inevitable, but it means that Project Cars is a better choice for variety (Or buying a PS4 and GT5). That said, if you don't mind doing some modding, then there are an ever increasing selection of quality cars on Assetto's forums, or on RaceDepartment. There are few times I enjoy myself as much as when taking my DAMS GP2 car around the Monaco Street Circuit, and at those points everything except the apps are modded.   In short, a lack of variety, but this is remedied by the mods. Plenty of content there for anybody.-Realism This is an important factor for a Simulator, and boy, Assetto does it well. Everything is totally customisable. EVERYTHING. The setup options are fantastically complex, with handy tooltips for those of us without a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, and the wonderful thing is that changing every variable will make the car feel, and handle slightly differently. The game measures time increments of 1/250 seconds, so you can see those changes on the clock to, and it's very satisying to gain a tenth on the straight by increasing the tyre pressure slightly and getting an improved Vmax as a result.   You can customise the grip levels on track - there are a number of preset options in terms of the amount of rubber laid down at the beginning of the session, and the grip will increase as you lap the track, with a racing line corresponding to the average line taken becoming visible as the session progresses.  You can really feel the car changing through the session - it takes a significant amount of time for tyres and brakes to get up to operating temperatures on the faster cars, but there's a massive improvement when you do - and tyre wear is realistically handled, and something that you really don't want to be on the recieving end of.  There's more as well, I promise, but I do need to move onto other sections of the review :')-Singleplayer  There are a number of different options to spend time on, each of which is devoted to a different discipline.   The practice mode is for getting to know a track, or a car, and just putting in some laps, helping tune setups, changing wheel settings, or just generally screwing around.   The Drift mode does what it says on the tin. You drift. Not much more to it than that. Extra points for combining drifts, and drifting for longer, or harder. Fun, but a novelty.   The Race mode allows you to pit any cars against each other, and it offers you a lot of flexibilty in terms of the race weekend - qualifying? Practice? Session lengths? You choose.  The Hotlap mode is for when you're really getting serious. Boost that ambient temperature, boost the track grip, take a nice fast car, and set a faster time than your friends.  Lots of modes for lots of variety, lots of things to do, but in the end you're more likely to end up playing Multiplayer.-Multiplayer  It's a mixed bag, this. The multiplayer itself is excellent. You can choose any selection of cars, and any track (Including modded ones, which is really nice), and go out. The connections are reliable, the lag is minimal, and if you have friends you enjoy racing with, who are of a similar speed, then it can get fantastically competetive. You can apply the same level of customisation to this as you can to single player - all of the variables are controlled by the server host, but the key is that they're all controllable.  That all said, actually setting up a dedicated server is tricky. There are a lot of processes that you need to run through, including port forwarding, and then running the server is heavy on bandwidth and also PC resources.  That aside, it's wonderful fun, and when leagues start to run, then I'm sure a whole new aspect will really kick off. (Speaking of leagues, sign up here if you're interested: wtwr.enjin.com)-Conclusion  There's not really a whole lot more to say. I know Kunos have got some more stuff coming - not because I'm an insider, because they're open and forthcoming, with Forums and Social Media that are in regular use. I know that the first non-alpha release will be coming soon. I know also that it's expensive - indeed, I waited until it was 50% off before buying it. If I went back now, though, given what I know, I'd gladly pay full price for it. It's brilliant. Utterly brilliant. And if you don't have it, you're missing out.			"

								great game, nice driving experience, would highly recommend, couple of areas i think it could do with improvment, the tire sim needs some work i was doing dougnuts and heated the tires up to 700C hot enough to melt metal let alone rubber that cant be right. should they burst or something, the control pad i am using is either to sensitive and slightly over steers and the wheel in the car looks all eratic and when its less sensitive and the graphics do match the movement the understeer is unbareable the whole control pad area needs work as it assumes wheel/custom when there should be one for non xbox Control pads as well ""Generic/FFB Pad"" .. the currect ""wheel/custom"" only detects accelleration on a axis as its expecting pedals I guess rather then game pad buttons, the car damage could be a bit better too. when you crash it looks like some ones been pounding on your car with a small hammer and sanding it with 240 grit and it does not look briliant all these things are no big thing and Assetto is still one of the best car sims yet, I hope they deal with the issues i mention and add more car tuning related stuff for the game			"

								For those who don't have a wheel, I suggest to start by using the mouse (speed 0.50), and start with the Formula Tatuus Abarth at Nurburgring. You will immediately appreciate how good this simulator is, and the great feeling you get from the car. After that, slowly try out other cars (I love the Ferrari 458 S3). I have tried the XBox controller, too, but the mouse is much more accurate. Of course, now I'm buying a wheel! The feeling i get by driving, even only with a mouse, is amazing.

Mods are very simple to download and install from racedepartment or anywhere online.  Tons of tracks and a lot of really fun cars to drive.  Definitely worth trying if you are into cars and racing.  Even a keyboard can make good lap times, but of course best with a wheel or controller at least.			"

												what is there to say about this game? you will enjoy it you will hate it, i played this game since it was in alpha, im still no good at it. i would recomend you get the steering wheel for your computer to play this game to its fullest, have a good graphic card, it used all of mine and still needs more graphics power to run smoothly, then again it is running better now then when i first bought it last year or longer. Of course i would recomend this to my friends but thats because we like all types of games and this is so far the best racing/ driving simulator on PC, the drifting is a bit difficult and you cant do burnouts with out a break pettle, gas pettle and a clutch, but if you have all of that, it is worth every penny.

												Full release, October 13 2015 update review.This game is amazing, and the reason you've probably never heard of it is the devs are too busy spending money on developing the game, and their time on developing the game for them to run any ads.Seriouly if you are into racing games, or realistic racing sims you may be getting exicted by now if you've never heard of it...its okay, you should be. Even if you aren't into either but still like the classics like Need for Speed for the thrill of just driving a race car around for a change of pace; consider, look into, tell some friends or buy this game. The dedication the devs give to this title compared to other greenlight projects COUGH COUGH PROJECT RIP OFF CARS COUGH COUGH sorry that was a bad one, should be commended if nothing else for the history of video gaming to understand and know.Great graphics, great sound, LASER SCANNED TRACKS, real world gravity, weights etc you get the gist. That is all, and remember kids don't buy into reviews that use numbers, don't trust whitey and always bring another pair of socks!MrSoul			"

												Assetto Corsa is by far one of the most realistic racing games I have ever played, It's more of a racing simulatior than just a game. Anyone that is a racing enthusiast should definitely buy this, you wont regret it. More so, I recommend this peice of art to anyone that has never played a racing game or hasn't really gone out and felt the sensation of ripping on a brand new car in real life. The sensation Assetto Corsa creates is very similar on first touch. The feeling of the car gripping the road when going around a corner then nailing the throttle coming out is just awesome. I will say this though, the graphics are quite demanding for a racing game but you can turn them down so it's not a huge issue. I also spent a bit of time testing and configuring the sensativity on my 360 controller to get the sensativity/deadzone before I got it just right so dont let that ruin the gameplay.			"

								I bought this game not long after it came out on steam. I loved it! I spent 12 hours on it in less than 2 weeks. Then an update came (somewhere around 0.72) and the game wouldnt let me go on track from there on after. I dont know if thats my computer, me being an idiot or the game being weird. This is a fantastic game and I would love to recommend it, but because of the runtime error every time i try to go on track it would just take me back to the home screen. Its a shame really, once this is fixed il do an update section on the comment.EDIT/UPDATEIt lives! After days of tweeking and fiddling and smacking my head on my desk repeatedly I managed to find a combonation of settings that my computer would chew and then spit out back at me!

To get most out of the experience make sure you get a good quality wheel and pedal set, but first and foremost you need to get yourself a virtual reality HMD like the rift, because this game for me seems to be unplayable without one.

												 This definatly a must buy if you are a big fan of racing games. It has the potential to be one of the best racing games out there, you just need to give it some time. This is going to be the Next Gen rFactor. It still has a long way to go but when it gets there it will be the best racing game. The sound needs alot of work. The force feedback also needs some work. The AI is the main problem at the moment it is very slow and doesnt do anything, it doesn't overtake, it doesn't defend. Also this game is missing alot of features, for example a good weather system. It is missing a good penalty and flag system. It doensn't have race rules for any of the series. A racing engineer would be nice aswell.  The strongest an most important part of Assetto Corsa is the modability. This game was inspired by the very popular and amazing rFactor. This means that to play this game to its full potential you will need to mod it. The modding community is starting to increase and the number of high quality mods is increasing. By the time this game gets to its 6th year there will be mods for everything and everyone. So as I sayed before just give it some time for it to improve. "

								Yes yes yes yes yes...Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ Coming from a lot of GTR, Race07 (with every possible pack and mod) there was a lot I had to get used to..BUT... Giving it a chance, spend a lot of time tweaking my ""feel"" I came out on something that feels way different from the Simbin titles that I used to play. Used to, because AC has become my goto race-sim and after spending more that 1000 hours in Race 07 that does say something! AC just feels way way better, different (you'll have to get used to it if you spend a lot of time in Simbin games) but better.. The visuals are a lot nicer too.. (haven't really played R3E, so I don't really know about the visuals in that) I have to add though: Visuals especially look nicer if you have an awesome rig (which I don't) and up until a few patches ago I had a lot of trouble getting a halfway decent fps... since the latest few patches there was so much improvement.. I actually have an 80-110 fps on an i3 with a gt630 in a 1920x1080 Resolution.. (before the game used to run fine for a bit then drop to the 14-ish fps, that's fixed now)So now it's playable (fps wise) all the time the game starts to put a big BIG grin on my face.Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ The mod-ding community is great and it's awesome that you can make your own mods. The best content in Rfactor 1 came from the community... so bring it on..Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ There is already quite some tracks made by mod-ers out there.. not all ""as good"" but all reasonable and most, if not all, still being developed (so you can actually give input, and they're being fixed if a patch might break them).. And there are some absolute jewels.. One I'd like to mention by name.. Nordschleife 1.1 from Snoopy... OK one more then.... Joux Plane (by Kegetys?),  But there is more really good mods  out there and the game isn't even final yet.Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞The physics are good both ffb-wise (they have a somewhat different approach from simbin titles or Rfactor, but give it a real chance, you'll see that it actually feels more like driving a car) as world physics-wise ie. how a car reacts to driving over a curb/bump.. This is the first sim that actually made me scout tracks for bumps etc.. because hitting a bump wrong is a problem, your car gets instable and the next corner might not go as anticipated, because there is still an unbalance in the car. The suspension is worked out in a lot of detail. A lot of things have been done with a refreshing new approach..Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ Also there is a lot of talk about the feeling of speed in the game being off.. Its actually spot on (It's most probably the first sim-race-game that does not exaggerate the sense of speed.. (also FOV settings are important))... (run the back-straight (yeah the curvy one) on the NS with close to 300 kph in a Zonda and you'll know what I mean, you feel you are going fast because you are.. 160 kph doesn't feel that fast IRL (sorta depends on where you do it, granted.... and maybe ""in what"" even more so.. but you know what I mean)It's the circumstances that make it feel fast and AC does exactly that. If you're driving 160 or even 200 on the German Autobahn while it's otherwise empty, it doesn't feel fast at all. The excitement in racing isn't in the excessive sense of speed.. but in going head to head and being faster then someone else within the confines of the same set of rules (physics). That is what it feels like on a track IRL and also in AC. The excitement lies in either driving on your own limits, and trying to improve on yourself, trying to scrape another 10th of a second of your time, hoping not to screw up that 3rd corner before the finish, and throwing away the progress you made on the rest of the track..  or in going head to head with someone or multiple ppl, having to move out of your comfortable line and overtake other ppl safely, just to find out on this particular corner the camber is bad and you're going to run out off grip a little sooner then you expected. Those are the real thrills of racing, not the speed. IRL you don't notice the speed after a few good laps. You know how fast you're going (Awareness) but it doesn't feel fast (Perception).. Also the fastest laps, the ones in which everything goes ""right"", usually don't ""feel"" fast at all.Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞ Dev's do understand the meaning of the words challenge and achievement...... A challenge is really a challenge so an achievement actually feels like an achievement, which is refreshing in racegames (Never been so happy finally getting Silver.. and yeah I know there is still gold... maybe in a lot of time with a lot of practice who knows LOL) I don't always get a gold medal.. but when I do I'm gonna be sooooo happyDev's listen to the community... There is still a lot of noticeable development/improvement still going on. It IS still an early access game. BUT In a lot of ways it already feels completely mature.. there some things that are not finished yet.. but they don't stand in the way of enjoying the game as is...  AI for instance is still being improved, that doesn't mean they are not fun to ride with right now, just that they are made even better still. The way the shifter works is great.. you can by miss-coordination actually miss a gear which will slot back in at the right rpm. The engine stall on the other hand is not working as expected yet.. namely it doesn't.. even with auto-clutch off. but that doesn't matter once you're away anyway.. I suppose they didn't think that was important right now, but I do hope they integrate that later.Cars actually feel different from each-other.. more then in most racegames, power-steering actually feels like power-steering (light with less feedback, you still feels what the car is doing but it's watered down somewhat.. like.. eh .. power-steering)The more this game develops the bigger my grin gets.. Nordschleife plus Zonda equals grin-factor*∞Also Japanese mountainroads (Akagi Mountain pass) and BMW E90 Drift is a seriously big grin-factorBut seriously it's a good game, and it only gets better (I hope, but they're on the right track IMO)			"

								After only two days of owning this game, I've already fallen in love with it. The menus are beautiful and easy to navigate, the gadgets you get during races are perfect, the telemetry you get in the pits is awesome, setting up cars in the pits is great and tweaking racing settings to your liking is really easy and clear. Once you actually get into the game, the graphics are pretty good (much better inside I would currently say) and the driving physics are beyond anything I've ever seen. The game poses challenge not seen in racing games such as Forza or Grand Turismo; driving is hard. You will spin out, you will crash, but it's all so much fun. All in an alpha too! I can't wait for tomorrow's multiplayer update!Problems with the game:-Too many cars in a race can cause severe lag (I have a fairly good machine)-The racing line is not currently dynamic-Graphics could do with a bit of improvingThese things are sure to be fixed and added though. If anybody can find a problem with this game, it's themself. My one true complaint is that it's a bit pricy, but still worth it in the end.			"

								for $39.95, what do I expected? I dont know. Just bought as it use laser scan technology to build the track in game.After couple runs, I realized AC is WAY MUCH BETTER than GT and any other so called real-sim racing games I've ever played. No matter you are new to racing or hardcore racer, it will make you smile when you driving. A well tuned car is very different with a stock one.The downside? No many tracks at this stage. Nurbergring, suzuka, laguna seca, etc, all my favorite isnt there. And no many cars to choose. Heaps of BMW and Lotus, but where is GTR, Enzo, 911, McLaren? there are soooo many sports car and race car in the world...Anyway, no complains, just cant wait to see the complete game. Im very happy for this investment. If you like racing sims, buy it, support Kunos, they wont let you down for sure.			"

								This. Is. The best PC driving game on Steam as of the writing of this review. With some of the best looking cars and circuits, the very best physics, and a very talented modding community producing an ever-growing library of add-on vehicles, tracks, and apps, this is already worthy of its full-price despite being an early-access game. If the 'early access' tag frightens you, don't let it. Imagine Microsoft Flight Simulator was about cars and was in HD. That's what this is.If there's any downside, it's that it's not quite fully optimized and can be resource-intensive, especially with some of the more detailed mod vehicles out there. Then again, so were the Flight Simulator games - and MS expected computer technology to catch up with them!			"

								I like this game. The graphics are good, the sounds are great even the physics are suprisingly good. Except for the fact that the cars usually don't turn at moderate speeds, you'll have to slow down significantly to turn, but then again, it's a simulation game. Overall in my opinion, I think I will game this game 7/10. The only problem I have is with the multiplayer, not a lot of players are online. And the servers with the most players usually require track/car mods to be able to play on which is pretty dumb. We need campaign mode and TONS of cars. The new Mercedes SLS was stupid. Good from the inside, from the oustide, looks cartoon-ish.			"

								I bought this game not long after it came out on steam. I loved it! I spent 12 hours on it in less than 2 weeks. Then an update came (somewhere around 0.72) and the game wouldnt let me go on track from there on after. I dont know if thats my computer, me being an idiot or the game being weird. This is a fantastic game and I would love to recommend it, but because of the runtime error every time i try to go on track it would just take me back to the home screen. Its a shame really, once this is fixed il do an update section on the comment.EDIT/UPDATEIt lives! After days of tweeking and fiddling and smacking my head on my desk repeatedly I managed to find a combonation of settings that my computer would chew and then spit out back at me!

Mods are very simple to download and install from racedepartment or anywhere online.  Tons of tracks and a lot of really fun cars to drive.  Definitely worth trying if you are into cars and racing.  Even a keyboard can make good lap times, but of course best with a wheel or controller at least.			"

												what is there to say about this game? you will enjoy it you will hate it, i played this game since it was in alpha, im still no good at it. i would recomend you get the steering wheel for your computer to play this game to its fullest, have a good graphic card, it used all of mine and still needs more graphics power to run smoothly, then again it is running better now then when i first bought it last year or longer. Of course i would recomend this to my friends but thats because we like all types of games and this is so far the best racing/ driving simulator on PC, the drifting is a bit difficult and you cant do burnouts with out a break pettle, gas pettle and a clutch, but if you have all of that, it is worth every penny.

												Full release, October 13 2015 update review.This game is amazing, and the reason you've probably never heard of it is the devs are too busy spending money on developing the game, and their time on developing the game for them to run any ads.Seriouly if you are into racing games, or realistic racing sims you may be getting exicted by now if you've never heard of it...its okay, you should be. Even if you aren't into either but still like the classics like Need for Speed for the thrill of just driving a race car around for a change of pace; consider, look into, tell some friends or buy this game. The dedication the devs give to this title compared to other greenlight projects COUGH COUGH PROJECT RIP OFF CARS COUGH COUGH sorry that was a bad one, should be commended if nothing else for the history of video gaming to understand and know.Great graphics, great sound, LASER SCANNED TRACKS, real world gravity, weights etc you get the gist.

												Assetto Corsa is by far one of the most realistic racing games I have ever played, It's more of a racing simulatior than just a game. Anyone that is a racing enthusiast should definitely buy this, you wont regret it. More so, I recommend this peice of art to anyone that has never played a racing game or hasn't really gone out and felt the sensation of ripping on a brand new car in real life. The sensation Assetto Corsa creates is very similar on first touch. The feeling of the car gripping the road when going around a corner then nailing the throttle coming out is just awesome. I will say this though, the graphics are quite demanding for a racing game but you can turn them down so it's not a huge issue. I also spent a bit of time testing and configuring the sensativity on my 360 controller to get the sensativity/deadzone before I got it just right so dont let that ruin the gameplay.			"

												Ignore my ""time played"" stats - I have reinstalled this game again within the last few days and I play offline.I have played just about every decent PC driving/racing game since Geoff Crammonds GP4 and, until recently, I thought GTR2 was the most enjoyable driving/racing experience.  AC is now King of the Simulators (the only game I have not tried is iRacing so that may be more of a simulation but it is too expensive and I play offline).The moment I fired up AC and took my first drive I knew it was going to be sensational.  I prefer the more natural graphics of AC than the hollywood style of PCars and you can not even compare RF2 or any other top tier racing game.  I purchased a Thrustmaster T150 and, after some tweaking and advice from the internet regarding setup, I was in virtual heaven.  I read comments stating that other users just enjoyed hotlapping and I thought that can't be much fun but it is a joy to choose a car and track combination and spend long hours trying to beat your personal best times.  As an offfline player I was concerned about the reported AI behaviour but it clearly beats the manic AI drivers in PCars and is at least as good as R3E AI.  Admittedly the AI in RF2 is probably still the best but unfortunately the graphics are not good enough to tempt me to play it for long periods of time.Pros:Excellent graphics (with PP enhancements)Superb driving physicsVery good AI racingSuperb mod support (tracks, vehicles, sounds, apps, setups, graphics)Ability to create custom championshipsCons:I honestly can't think of anyIn summary I have enjoyed this game so much that I deleted my PCars, RF2 (demo) and R3E (another excellent game but requires constant internet connection to play) as well as GTR2, RACE 07 and F1 2012.  I could have kept these games on my hard drive but I know that i will be dedicating all of my time to AC so I deleted the other titles.I do not play online and I am not particularly interested in night driving or even driving in the rain.  Assetto Corsa caters for my personal preferrences and concentrates on getting the basics right - the excellent feeling of driving and racing high powered cars in exotic locations.  I am 51 years old but I feel like I am rediscovering my passion for sim racing after all these years - buy this game you will not regret it for one minute.UPDATE - Since my initial review I have spent MANY hours setting the game up to my desired taste (graphics, handling, FFB etc) and the game is even better than I originally stated.  I have installed over 30 really high quality tracks and installed several excellent car mods which has completely opened the game up with far more content.  I have started the career and, once complete, will use the ACCG app to create my own championships/career.I thought I might have been too hasty in uninstalling all of my other race sims so I reinstalled GTR2, PCars and F1 2012 to see if there was any merit in having these games on my hard drive.  The graphics in GTR2 , the AI in PCars and the arcade handling in F1 2012 convinced me that Assetto Corsa was the closest thing to perfection in the current crop of racing sims.  I stick with my initial description of pros and cons for this game and I cannot comprehend any negative reviews regarding this all-time classic.  Minor updates and enhancements continue to tweak the existing model but only night racing and/or rain could possibly make this any better.  The only game I have ever rated 10/10 and now the only game on my hard drive!!!			"

												I understand this is a racing simulator, and yes the way the cars handle is better than anything you can buy on a console only game, but for this price (even the sale price) I was expecting a much prettier game. Not the graphics of the cars, but of the interface. It looks like something a highschooler threw together the night before it was due. It feels sluggish to the point where every interface just isn't natural. I found myself clicking things that weren't shortcuts but very much could have been. There are too many points missing in this game and until there is a massive overhaul in graphics and in layout, I will consider this a waste of money.			"

Very good graphics and sound, the driving is very physics-focused and is a perfect match to play with a steering wheel. The laser scanned tracks and cars look very real. Each car has its own driving capabilities, like grip, understeer and oversteer. Also it's a demanding game, the learning curve is steep, and there are many car settings to try out. My complains are about the few cars and tracks avaiable, and the fact that most cars can't use slick tires. Aside that, the game is near perfect! "

												I have played assetto corsa now for about a day and a bit, and i have to say that i do not recommend it. Why? Yes, the graphics may be really good, and the mods you can get are amazing, the reson that i have to thumb this game down is because of the AI. It is pretty bad. They seem to have magical powers of speed when they're in front of you, but, if somehow you manage to catch them up, they are the slowest thing ever, and not to say, at the start, they will take you out 9.5/10 times. This makes the game really aggravating for me and I can count on 2 hands how many times i have finished out of the at least 40 races i have started. Yes, everything else is pretty much spot on, but if you can't get one of the most important things right in a racing game, it becomes worthless. I really hope that the devs bring out an update for this, as I really like every other bit of the game.			"

												Reading many reviews complaining about the lack of cars or the worse career mode, I was motivated to write my point of view and because I really like the game. ;-)Assetto Corsa is a racing game or better a racing simulation. In nearly all its aspects which define a very good racing simulation its superb. If you expect this from a racing game you will possibly not disappointed from Assetto Corsa.Racing Game aspects:•	Very good physics and car handling•	Great sounds for me•	Detailed car graphics, wonderful cockpits with operating gauges for fuel, temperatures and so on•	Good amount of cars, even more with the moderately priced DLCs in sale and the often good mods for free. Nice aspect there are S1, S3 and Drift versions which change some cars, making them lighter, more powerful or better to drift.•	Extensive setup optionsWhere it has its downsides are what defines a good game with a motivation above “only racing and setuping a car”.•	Don’t expect a motivating career. There are many career events starting with slower cars like Abarth 500, BMW 1 M, faster ones (Ferrari 458, Mercedes SLS) and many GT3 events, but you can’t spend money on new cars. It’s simply racing and getting in touch with all the cars and tracks.•	The AI is sometimes annoying. To be correct, they drive fast, on higher difficulties they are really challenging, but they are rude. They often crash into your car, because they stupidly drive on their racing line. If they hit your car, mainly you crash, not them. Only tipp is: Stay away from them and only overtake them, if there is enough space.•	No tuning (except the S1, S3, Drift versions, read above), buying of new parts or decals. There’s only the big variety of modifying the setups which has great impact on the handling of your car.•	The nice graphics are mainly focused on the car and the track (tarmac). It really ends on the kerbs. The gravel pit, the grass or the trees are outdated, but ok, you are focused on the track anyhow. ;-)•	There is no weather system included. No rain, only a wide range from foggy to sunny. This point is even for simulation fans frustrating, but Kunos has promised they are working on it and will implement it with a new update.So my conclusion is:Every racing simulation fan should really have a closer look on it. If you expect a detailed career mode race game or even a Need for Speed clone, don’t buy it.Edit:Still waititing for some changes.			"

As I said, a wheel with FFB is almost a must to have as much fun as me. "

												Reading many reviews complaining about the lack of cars or the worse career mode, I was motivated to write my point of view and because I really like the game. ;-)Assetto Corsa is a racing game or better a racing simulation. In nearly all its aspects which define a very good racing simulation its superb. If you expect this from a racing game you will possibly not disappointed from Assetto Corsa.Racing Game aspects:•	Very good physics and car handling•	Great sounds for me•	Detailed car graphics, wonderful cockpits with operating gauges for fuel, temperatures and so on•	Good amount of cars, even more with the moderately priced DLCs in sale and the often good mods for free. Nice aspect there are S1, S3 and Drift versions which change some cars, making them lighter, more powerful or better to drift.•	Extensive setup optionsWhere it has its downsides are what defines a good game with a motivation above “only racing and setuping a car”.•	Don’t expect a motivating career. There are many career events starting with slower cars like Abarth 500, BMW 1 M, faster ones (Ferrari 458, Mercedes SLS) and many GT3 events, but you can’t spend money on new cars. It’s simply racing and getting in touch with all the cars and tracks.•	The AI is sometimes annoying. To be correct, they drive fast, on higher difficulties they are really challenging, but they are rude. They often crash into your car, because they stupidly drive on their racing line. If they hit your car, mainly you crash, not them. Only tipp is: Stay away from them and only overtake them, if there is enough space.•	No tuning (except the S1, S3, Drift versions, read above), buying of new parts or decals. There’s only the big variety of modifying the setups which has great impact on the handling of your car.•	The nice graphics are mainly focused on the car and the track (tarmac). It really ends on the kerbs. The gravel pit, the grass or the trees are outdated, but ok, you are focused on the track anyhow. ;-)•	There is no weather system included. No rain, only a wide range from foggy to sunny. This point is even for simulation fans frustrating, but Kunos has promised they are working on it and will implement it with a new update.So my conclusion is:Every racing simulation fan should really have a closer look on it. If you expect a detailed career mode race game or even a Need for Speed clone, don’t buy it.Edit:Still waititing for some changes.			"

												The most awesome racing game out there.  I love everything about it.  I have the T300 wheel, running a EVGA GTX970 on a triple monitor, full Ultra settings.  The graphics are amazing.  I like this game because you don't have to pay $10 a month for life for 1 game, like IRacing.  The only downfall to this game is it doesn't come with much.  You have to buy all the add on cars and tracks.			"

												Assetto Corsa is a great racing game to look into. Especially when going on sale. Although the content is a little light, you will be glad to know that this game is hugly supported by the modding community. So you can get many cars and tracks for free without needing DLC. which is great, because adding DLC and free modding content makes the game more enjoyable and freshSome of the negative is controller support and setting up driving settings can be a pain. The menu is boring and kind of off. Sometimes the sound is a little wierd. single player mode is a little dissapointing. the veritey of cars are pretty bad and moslty euro cars not many asain or american cars (from the base verison no dlc or mods)With all that said i still think its a great game and a must have for any racing fan. I would recommend this game espcially for wheel users as well.			"

												So i have owned this game since early access and felt that maybe its time for a review...In many ways racing games reflect their studio's location, Tursimo has always been very Japanese oriented, Forza is quite American oriented and things like ToCa/GRiD, Project Cars, Race 07 all have a very European style to them. Asseto Corsa is no different, it makes no secret of being Italian and from the cars to the tracks to its overall identity. It draws from it in all the best ways. Thankfully Italy has no shortage of both great cars and great tracks. From the Abarth 500 to the best from Ferrari, the cars are both diverse and perfectly represented in incredable detail. The tracks as well show the diversity of the country's selection as F1 locals like Monza and Imola are the marquee tracks, the lesser known tracks like Magione and Vallelunga, with even a delightful fantasy track through the desert mountians. Of course all of that is irrelevent if the game cant do it once you get out on the track and get driving. This is the area where AC really proves its chops to go against all the aformentioned racing genre classics. The assists make the game accessable but as you improve and start peeling them away to a more simulation experience is when the game comes alive and you feel like less of a passenger and more like a master pilot blasting through the forests of Monza or the Nurburgring. In all the time i have been playing this game the only thing i have ever had to complain about is among the most minor of issues, there is no pause button mapped to the controller by default and no way to assign it. That said, once i get racing, i honestly dont want to stop anyways, so i guess it doesnt matter much in the end.			"

Update: Full ReleaseI have changed my recommendation from yes to NO. This game was very promising in its Early Access stages, and I wrote my review thinking it would get better as time went on. However the game is now in full release and they are already charging paid DLC to get more content. This is absolutely unacceptable for the little amount of content in the game. This is stuff that should be added in the full release version. The car selection is 1/4 of games like Forza, GT, or Project Cars, and about half the cars in this game are various versions of Lotus, most of which are indistingushable from each other. The track selection is subpar as well. When I was writing my previous reviews I was under the impression that more content would be added as time went by. This is not the case, and I am not going to pay $15 for content that should come with the game. If you're thinking about buying this game, DON'T. Wait for Project Cars to come out in May and get that instead.Update: Early Access v1.0.0I haven't played this game for 2-3 months, about the time I wrote my original review. The original review still holds so I'm leaving it, but this game has gotten significantly better in the physics and feel department. You can actually feel what the car is doing A LOT better. More cars and tracks are continuing to be added. This game has a lot going for it and if its ever on sale again and you like racing games or have a g27, don't hesitate. No update on controller usage since I don't bother anymore now that I have a wheel, but I heard they've made good progress. Best racing game on PC and only continues to get better.Original:Unfortately there is no Forza or GT for PC, but this comes incredibly close. The core of this game is great. The physics are spot on and the cars are very well detailed to the point where shift indicators light up if the car has one. Very well done. There current car & track selection leaves much to be desired, but at the time of the review this is still an early alpha, so this is expected. This is hands down the best race sim you can get for PC due to1) proper sim physics2) nice, well-detailed cars and tracks3) probably the biggest reason this beats other PC race sims: NO microtransactions, NO subscriptionsThis is the only PC game that has all 3 of those in one package to my knowledge. The biggest downside is that the game is kind of unplayable with anything but a steering wheel at the moment, but apparently the devs are trying to get better controller support, which this game REALLY needs. However if you have a steering wheel like a G27, this will be a fantastic experience for you.			"

												An almost perfect Racing Simulator. Driving the digital Lotus Elise is as close as i've ever found a game to come to the real thing (which i've driven a bit, as i used to work for Lotus). Coupled with a Logitech G27 and a decent Rig, this game really does blur the lines of whats real and what isn't. If you're after a prettier version of Outrun 2, this isn't going to make you happy. If you want a gleaming, inch perfect laser scaned example of a truely ambitous and expertly crafted Racing game, I think you just found a game to make you glad you have a Steering Wheel.			"

								This sim has been a long time coming but has been woth the wait even in the current beta stage. Iracing is still the daddy of racing sims but Assetto Corsa is the new kid on the block and has already matched it on graphics and physics. Now they need to get the sim completed and add multiplayer and some more content. Then IRacing and Dave Kaemer will need to start looking over their shoulders at this puppy because they will soon be a major player in the sim world judging by this.			"

												  I bought AC planning to play it like a Forza/Gran Turismo kind of sim game, where you sit on the couch close to the screen, grab your high precision controller (DS4 in my case) and race like there's no tomorrow. Hopefully, there would even be a well designed, well paced career mode for me to get lost in.  I play it like that, and it´s absolutely brilliant. If it´s what you want, and you don´t mind not having hundreds of cars to choose from, then Assetto Corsa is the best there is (as judged against GT6, Forza 4, PCars, Grid Autosport and iRacing, which are the best recent ones I´ve played).

												This game was my replacement to Forza on the 360. Ive done away with console and my first experience on this game was tramatizing. I hated it and could't set up my xb1 controller to feel right and after much frustration I went on to other games and let it sit for almost a month. eventually I wanted to get into it and looked up other racers settings that play with a controller and then everything changed. Like a junkie I'm hooked on this game and the feeling of acomplishment is overwhealming once you find your settings and start winning races! You probably would prefer a wheel for this game but I don't have one, from grip race to drifting tandem it can be done with a controller. Laser scanned tracks are my absolute favorite part of this game, you need the ring or yours missing out.			"

												I don't know what to write so here it is about heel and toe:Drivers use the ""heel and toe"" method to smoothly combine braking and downshifting as they approach a corner. Good drivers know that blipping the throttle between gears in a downshift to speed up the engine to match the tire speed keeps the wheels from locking and stops the back end from getting loose. Heel-and-toeing simply combines blipping the throttle with braking. On early European sports and racing cars with a central throttle, the pedals were set up so the driver could use the ball of his right foot on the brake and the heel of the same foot on the gas. On modern cars, the driver uses the right side of his foot to blip the gas and the left side of the same foot to push the brake. Done correctly, your foot pivots quickly on its ball, giving a rapid blip to the throttle with the right side while the left provides steady pressure on the brake.			"

												So, I'm going to base this review on someone who grew up playing the Gran Turismo games, specifically GT3 and GT5, with that out of the way; I'll talk about Assetto Corsa now.I really love the quality control and time put into the game, what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality, rather than some racer games giving you 50+ cars and massive amounts of race tracks, Assetto Corsa doses you with small portions of cars and real-life race tracks. From what I hear, they take some sort of car with a scanner on it, drive it around the track and put it into the game, I like to imagine they put the same amount of time into the cars of this game as well. I recently got into this game after feeling nostalgic for drifting around the Tsukuba Circut in GT5 and I have to say it's the closest you can get to a proper Gran Turismo game on PC. I've tried many other racing games in an attempt to capture what made GT so great, and I think I've found it in Assetto Corsa. It has vast amounts of settings to play with, beautiful graphics, amazing sound design and a very flexible UI that lets you customize every little aspect of your racing experience. Don't like how you sit in a car? You can change that! Don't like your racer's arms? A little odd, but you can remove them! Want to create gigantic plumes of smoke when you drift? Too bad. (Even with the ambient temperature set to 36 Celsius I fail to make anything but little puffs of smoke)Now, some things that upset me!Unless you pick a legitimate race car, drift car, or step 1 car, there's really nothing you can do to fiddle with how it handles. Sure, you can toy with the brakes, and suspension, and sometimes the tires! But you don't get custom colours, you don't get to change the rims, nothing. I've tried for hours on getting the Nismo Tuned 370Z to slide, but no matter what I do, I just can't seem to get it right. I constantly find myself going back to the BMW M3 Drift tuned car to satisfy my angular needs. I previously talked about the minor problem I have about this game, and that's why I can overlook it. I'm wanting to do things in this game that the Developers don't intend you to do. This is a racing sim, not a simcade poop racer, so it makes sense that I can't have a bright pink Toyota Supra with flashy rims. The ""BMW Ferrari Porsche-to-everything-else"" ratio is crazy. If you add up all the praised Euroformancemobiles and stack them against the other cars, you'll be like ""Wow, someone's a little biased to BMW""All in all, Assetto Corsa does a great job being a competant racing game on PC, it's pretty much the only one I like. Just ask me what I think of The Crew, actually; Nevermind. Just read my review on that one. Get this game if you're interested in getting into some really great sim racing, if you're also coming from Gran Turismo, this will be a great transition to PC racing games. Only complaint I have is that it's not more like Gran Turismo. (You can't own cars or customize them with different performance parts) But then again, that's not even supposed to be an option, so I can't fault the Devs on that. I highly recommend this game, on a controller or on a racing wheel, you'll have tons of fun in this racing game. "

Great that's like 10 cars and it gets boring.I bought this game in beta and I know this game isn't even finished but yet you see it here with DLCsnot minutes after the ""Official"" release.If they took the time to write the code correctly the first time they wouldn't have to change the sound files with every update. Oh and let's say you like drifting like me, great no car really has enough power to have fun. Yes you can just throw it into the corner but not keep it without putting 10 degrees of camber. This game had so much potential but they threw it down the drain. "

Early Access Review
								This game. I've played just under 5 hours and am completely in love. Critically, I am proud to announce that this game DEMOLISHES both Forza 5 and Gran Turismo 6, from graphics to (ironically) the game's engine. Oh, and it's still early-access. To think that I considered buying an Xbox One for Forza 5... the thought makes me cringe every time I start up this game. Controversly, due to it's crippling state of early-access, there are alot of things missing from the experience; the AI are buggy, or ""untrained"", and begin to get rowdy on the track. There isn't a carreer mode to free yourself from the bordeom of ""Practice"" mode yet. There is no Multiplayer mode... yet. There aren't even that many cars- and the cars that ARE provided are solely European. Now, for an early-access game with a ""Drift"" mode, may I ask why there are no Japanese cars? However, just like any other early-access game, these are things to be fixed in the near future. For now, just get over yourself and buy the damn game.			"

												Right okay then, Assetto Corsa, its a must have in the sim racing world! Not convinced?This game probably has one of the best physics engines ever created, on par with or maybe even better than iRacing.. Yes it has it's bad parts but considering Kunos was no more than 10 employees at the start of development to come this far into a game is absolutely amazing. Some pros and cons:Pros:The Physics - as close, these days as you're gonna get to a real track day.The Accuracy - The laser scanned tracks and awesome looking car models are perfect in everyway, even if some of the sounds could use an overhaul.The Modability - This game has a fantastic, helpful, contributing community that release mods and setup guides every hour. Not enough content in the base game, don't worry! My AC folder is a big one ~HERE[puu.sh] [/b]The ConsThe Mulitplayer - At the moment this feature is on the con side however netcode fixes and menu tweaks could easily throw this in the pile of Pros. The racing itself onlineis really fun and competitive. There's always a quiet focused mood before those 5 red lights disappear.The Sounds - Slowly but surely the sounds are improving. If you compare the newly realeased Escort MK1 to a base game Lotus Exige you can tell a lot more work is now going into the sounds. The V10 sounds, of which there are now A LOT, in the base game sound amazing and I cannot wait for Kunos to revamp all the existing sound effects.I don't really want to list anything else as I just wanted to cover the main bases and try my hardest to persuade you that this game is an absolute gem. Just try the base game if you're not sure, but the DLCs are fantastic and add a lot more variation to it.			"

												With over 200 hours logged, I can honestly say this is the best race sim I've ever came across. Driving handling and physics model feel spot on and each car responds differently. Fmod is used as the sound engine and not every car sound that great (with the Countach being my favorite), it is easily fixed with mods. Not only the sound can be changed, but community made tracks, cars, apps, etc. are possible to add. At the time of writing, 3 DLC packs came which are totally worth the price, considering the effort they made in making the cars and tracks in each pack. I'm not a fan of DLC but this is the only game I've ever purchased DLC's for. Note that this is a racing sim and even though playing with a keyboard or controller is supported, I highly recommend to use a steeringwheel.			"

												This game was my replacement to Forza on the 360. Ive done away with console and my first experience on this game was tramatizing. I hated it and could't set up my xb1 controller to feel right and after much frustration I went on to other games and let it sit for almost a month. eventually I wanted to get into it and looked up other racers settings that play with a controller and then everything changed. Like a junkie I'm hooked on this game and the feeling of acomplishment is overwhealming once you find your settings and start winning races! You probably would prefer a wheel for this game but I don't have one, from grip race to drifting tandem it can be done with a controller. Laser scanned tracks are my absolute favorite part of this game, you need the ring or yours missing out.			"

												So, I'm going to base this review on someone who grew up playing the Gran Turismo games, specifically GT3 and GT5, with that out of the way; I'll talk about Assetto Corsa now.I really love the quality control and time put into the game, what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality, rather than some racer games giving you 50+ cars and massive amounts of race tracks, Assetto Corsa doses you with small portions of cars and real-life race tracks. From what I hear, they take some sort of car with a scanner on it, drive it around the track and put it into the game, I like to imagine they put the same amount of time into the cars of this game as well. I recently got into this game after feeling nostalgic for drifting around the Tsukuba Circut in GT5 and I have to say it's the closest you can get to a proper Gran Turismo game on PC. I've tried many other racing games in an attempt to capture what made GT so great, and I think I've found it in Assetto Corsa. It has vast amounts of settings to play with, beautiful graphics, amazing sound design and a very flexible UI that lets you customize every little aspect of your racing experience. Don't like how you sit in a car? You can change that! Don't like your racer's arms? A little odd, but you can remove them! Want to create gigantic plumes of smoke when you drift? Too bad. (Even with the ambient temperature set to 36 Celsius I fail to make anything but little puffs of smoke)Now, some things that upset me!Unless you pick a legitimate race car, drift car, or step 1 car, there's really nothing you can do to fiddle with how it handles. Sure, you can toy with the brakes, and suspension, and sometimes the tires! But you don't get custom colours, you don't get to change the rims, nothing. I've tried for hours on getting the Nismo Tuned 370Z to slide, but no matter what I do, I just can't seem to get it right. I constantly find myself going back to the BMW M3 Drift tuned car to satisfy my angular needs. I previously talked about the minor problem I have about this game, and that's why I can overlook it. I'm wanting to do things in this game that the Developers don't intend you to do. This is a racing sim, not a simcade poop racer, so it makes sense that I can't have a bright pink Toyota Supra with flashy rims. The ""BMW Ferrari Porsche-to-everything-else"" ratio is crazy. If you add up all the praised Euroformancemobiles and stack them against the other cars, you'll be like ""Wow, someone's a little biased to BMW""All in all, Assetto Corsa does a great job being a competant racing game on PC, it's pretty much the only one I like. Just ask me what I think of The Crew, actually; Nevermind. Just read my review on that one. Get this game if you're interested in getting into some really great sim racing, if you're also coming from Gran Turismo, this will be a great transition to PC racing games. Only complaint I have is that it's not more like Gran Turismo. (You can't own cars or customize them with different performance parts) But then again, that's not even supposed to be an option, so I can't fault the Devs on that. I highly recommend this game, on a controller or on a racing wheel, you'll have tons of fun in this racing game. "

								Oh man this is good stuff. I have spent countless hours playing many racing games and sims, and AC may well turn out to be the finest. Turn all the assists off, and this feels darn close to actual driving. The physics are so good it makes me want to cry just a little. I'll admit that the graphics aren't quite as good as the videos indicate, and I have a rather beefy machine running it, but seeing as it's early access I'm not going to judge that just yet. And, who cares? The meat of the game is so good that I can forgive just about anything, I've never played a game that felt this close to real driving, just awesome.If you must have a campaign, then wait for the full release I would say. If you are like me and can spend hours just hot lapping to find that perfect line, don't hesitate to buy this. Yeah, I only have a little time logged, but this is coming from well over a decade of racing game experience, and I am certain this one will be special.			"

												Racing games have been the only type of game that i've ever taken seriously. I've been through the lot, and this is the one game that actually had me concentrating so hard...that i had a tension headache afterwards. Its a game where you literally have to control every element of a car going into a corner, staying in the corner, and finally exiting. You have to control EVERYTHING between those three phases. Using the Lotus 98T as an example..with all driving aids turned off, there's understeer, oversteer, turbo lag, on boost, brake lockup, wheel spin and track surface grip ALL to deal with in every single corner. Most racing games deal with this on a very simple level. This game actually makes you think about your inputs before you do them.. which is awesome.The sounds compliment everything perfectly and add to the tension extremely well. The car engine sounds are second to none in my opinion. Graphics wise, Im running this game on reasonably high settings on a laptop with a GTX 850m and im getting really great framerates all round. Initially i had the option ""force 32-bit"" enabled, and i got really bad performance. not knowing what this option did, i disabled it and its been perfect since.I actually bought this game a day after the summer sale ended.. with all the DLC's and i feel i've gotten real value for the full prices that i paid. The cars all seem to have their own personalities in this game, and give you a realistic idea of the actual handling differences between a BMW M4 and a KTM X-Bow R. Other racing games like Project Cars just feel extremely bland after experiencing AC.Content might seem lacking, but i think its only going to get better with the recent DLC packs, and with Porsche cars being recently announced. Casual racing gamers might get frustrated with this game even with assists fully on, and the assists do take away alot of the unique experience offered here.In future, i'd like to see weather upgrades and night racing. that would make this the perfect racing game. Still highly recommended even in its current state "

												  I bought AC planning to play it like a Forza/Gran Turismo kind of sim game, where you sit on the couch close to the screen, grab your high precision controller (DS4 in my case) and race like there's no tomorrow. Hopefully, there would even be a well designed, well paced career mode for me to get lost in.  I play it like that, and it´s absolutely brilliant. If it´s what you want, and you don´t mind not having hundreds of cars to choose from, then Assetto Corsa is the best there is (as judged against GT6, Forza 4, PCars, Grid Autosport and iRacing, which are the best recent ones I´ve played).

Early Access Review
								AC is the best racing sim I've played in over 20 years of racing. The new RC1.0 update delivered a ton of content including a fairly basic career mode, adding to the existing special events, time attacks and multiplayer. The graphics and sound got a big overhaul and the game looks amazing (i7 4.6, GTX780) and is by far the best sounding racing game I've ever played.If you've got an Oculus Rift then plug it in because AC is amazing in VR. Apart from non-existent GUIs and car setups (and you can't race time attacks in the rift), it is a next-gen experience to race AC in VR. It is buttery smooth, very impressive due to the visuals pointing to some seriously optimised code.AC does have controller support (not full) but if you don't have a wheel then don't worry about buying, a wheel is essential to the experience.Lastly, this game has mod support so you can race F1 cars or go to your favourite tracks from other games and locations.

												Handling physics 10/10AI 6/10Cars 7/10Tracks 7/10Online 5 /10Track detail 7/10General 9/10Had this sim over a year and decided one day to actually play it after getting bored of project cars, my first impressions were it felt like the gameplay was slow and too easy but felt different and the menu was not pretty straight forward just to set a race up,However i did soon realise its not easy nor slow..if your barreling along a nurburgring straight at 160mph in a 26 year old audi quattro...... it actually feels like your barreling along a nurburgring straight at 160mph in a 26 year old audi quattro!!! the noise, the vibrations, the feeling of bouncing over the slightest bump and feeling the whole car lean and twist around corners really does make this sim one of the best. its only downfall would be the lack of good scenery, tracks and car selection and the Ai can be a but frustrating but these are all problems that are known to the developers and will hopefully see a change in before its a finished product			"

												Driving dynamics feel much better than Project Cars.There are lot of more ""realistic"" sims out there in PC, however they are very costy. Assetto seems to comes with very reasonable price. Updates are quite good, Assetto has some good understandings on tyre mechanisms, which affect driving dynamics, they keep updating their tyre model, and that is the goody for this game. However, even though multiplay expereience is generally not that bad, but to create own server is a little bit challanging comapared to easy system of Project Cars. Now I am used to with it, it is fine now.In my guess, because this game is from italy, Ferrari is the most balanced car among the others. I drove with my friend GT3 RS, versus with old 458, It showed 2 sec gap(of course 458 was slow), however gt3 rs showed troublesome understeer, but 458 however was very neutral every corner. If you are hesitating to buy Assetto, because of poor user interface, but still I can guaruntee driving experience. It is a bit challanging for get used to Assetto and takes time, but after that, it is good racing simulator.4stars out of 5.			"

												With over 200 hours logged, I can honestly say this is the best race sim I've ever came across. Driving handling and physics model feel spot on and each car responds differently. Fmod is used as the sound engine and not every car sound that great (with the Countach being my favorite), it is easily fixed with mods. Not only the sound can be changed, but community made tracks, cars, apps, etc. are possible to add. At the time of writing, 3 DLC packs came which are totally worth the price, considering the effort they made in making the cars and tracks in each pack. I'm not a fan of DLC but this is the only game I've ever purchased DLC's for. Note that this is a racing sim and even though playing with a keyboard or controller is supported, I highly recommend to use a steeringwheel.			"

												As a huge racing simulator fan I think this is definitely the best simulator on pc. The modding comunity is fairly active and there are some interesting, but limited amounts of cars available. That being said, the game is still very basic. The car choice in this game, as well as all sims on pc that I've seen are very limited. In the future I'd like to see more car choices, especially regular cars. I've always thought one of the best parts of a bigger game such as Forza was the ability to race real, everyday cars one might actually own against your friends. Overall the game is great and I've spent hours enjoying it but I'd like to see it become bigger and have more car options			"

												I really love this game. It is very in depth and extremely physics heavy. There are alot of physics in this game and you can do anything from carrer mode to just practice mode with a little multiplayer in between. PROS:-Physics-Sound-Models-Graphics-Detail-Very adaptable to all player types and bases from people who have never played before to people who have played every racing sim under the sun.CONS:Allmost need a wheel to play it but is still quite playable with a controller.Also if anyone wants to talk detail. If you run off the track into the gravel and dirt it will collect on your tires and it will effect your traction until it wears off by driving. You can also hear the gravvel hitting off of your wheel wells while driving till it wears off. Also if you are in a vehicle that has an electric engine in it (LaFerrari) and you either run out of gas or if you get into a wreck and your engine fails you can drive a little on the electric engine though not powerful enoufgh it can pull you through the last 1000 or more feet of the race.Thanks for reading my review.

												Before I start this review, I want to point out I am no stranger to racing games, or actual racing experienceUnless you have a top notch wheel, 144hz screen, and a sense of racing, this game can be considered a bummer.I first played this game with my friend's amazing setup of a dual motor Thrustmaster, custom bracket setup with a Bride Zeta II, 27"" G-Sync monitor, as well as a computer that allows for a constant 120FPS. The game was honestly a hundred times more fun than Gran Turismo 6, Forza, NFS Shift 2.I myself have a Logitech G27, my computer chair and a 27"" 120hz monitor, and a computer that allows for a constant 120 FPS, a far cry from what he has.The game is incredibly unfun unless you have a fantastic setup, I'm struggling to even finish one lap before I quit out of boredom/frustration. The game feels like it's still in it's beta phase with the mouse/keyboard menu, as well as the very lackluster ambient graphics.The potential is there, but the execution is definitely not.TL:DR: You MUST invest in a proper racing setup unless you want to play a game of struggles.

												Damn this game has cost me thousands.First I had to get a wheel. Then I had to get a simulator, then I had to get a proper shifter, then I had to get a handbrake, then I had to upgrade the pedals, then I had to upgrade the wheel, then I had to get triple screens, then I had to get a better GFX Card, then I had to get tactile feedback, then I had to get Oculus Rift.But that not even where I lost much money. Because I got addicted to motorsport, cars and drifting, so then I had to upgrade my economical small car to something that would go well on a track. Does anyone realise how expensive the consumables are for a track day? Probably not as most people on here are autistic or 13 or both but I can tell you its not cheap.Anyway, great game, great phisics, great content. Not interested in MP because as I said most people on here are ♥♥♥♥ing spastics, and AI for raceing games will most likely never work well. "

								Fantasic racer! Extremely lifelike handeling and very predictable which is good for the cars, no major discrepancies. Even runs well on lower end machines like mine which is nice. My only gripe that may come in the future is adding more cars, the current list is honestly rubbish, are there good cars hell yes but why not maybe a LP700-4? Or maybe a Focus ST? Who know's maybe someday. But for now it is a great play and highly reccomend it!			"

												Assetto Corsa is pure magic. It's by far the best Racing sim out there. Way ahead of anything else.The Dream Pack DLC is a must, or else there aren't that many tracks and cars to choose from. With the three Dream packs you have a solid  set of tracks and cars. Especially the various lazerscanned versions of the Nordschleife are spectacular.A steering wheel is a must. If you are reallly into sim racing and want to get as close to the real thing as you can, this is for you.			"

												Somehow I can't quite believe I've driven that many hours in this game - I feel like I must've left it running overnight by mistake. The car handling is best-in-class; seriously, this does the job brilliantly. Unfortunately, a racing game must present well and have competent AI. Assetto Corsa has a confusing and fragmented menu system and weak AI that bows to your every whim. This makes it a game for the budding time-trial enthusiasts, not one for the racers.			"

												This game plays great with an xbox 360 controller.  I really want to get this out there:  I hesitated from buying this game for a really really long time because I thought, from forum posts and youtube videos and other reviews, that I absolutely had to have a wheel and pedal setup before even attempting to play this game.  Boy was I wrong.  While I did buy a cheap wheel/pedal setup off of my local CL to ensure I wasn't making a mistake, I quickly realized the game plays beautifully with a controller.If you've played any other ""simulation"" console racer, it will be immediately obvious the developers spent a lot of time and attention getting the controller gameplay right.  It feels fantastic.  I didn't even have to tweak anything or load a custom profile and spend weeks trying to tune it.  I just picked up the controller and played and threw my car gracefully around the track.  You really feel weight transfer in this game and it's brilliant, even with a controller.  I was actually faster and more natural with my controller than I was with my wheel and pedal setup for a long while, and even now, depending on the day, I'll still end up faster with a controller than my W/P setup.If you have any simcade experience and consider yourself good at the simcades, i.e. you play Forza without any of the assists on (no abs, no traction control, no racing line, etc etc.,) and you fare well, then you'll have no gripes with Assetto Corsa.  If you're a newb, it still feels great because the devs really nailed it with the controller support and the noob features.  I tried it with the assists on, and I felt like a divine being.			"

												I wish i could give out stars out of 5 or 10, or even a ""neutral"" instead of just thumb up or thumb down.I bought the game when it was still in alpha and since then the game has come a long way. With fine tuning the car physics and adding new content and features along the way. Other then the important physics related improvements, the switch to fmod the and implementing of yebis2 post-processing engine was very nice. The attention to details in the cars is amazing, is it because Kunos is Italian?, the first time i drove the Lotus 49 and seeing the drive shafts spinning and following the suspension was cool. And of course the use of laser scanned content help the detail and quality.It's very nice to see a game come out in this day and age where games otherwise are heavily locked and DLC dependent to have such a big and talented modding community. In the beginning there were many rFactor converted tracks and cars but over time there were just more and more original content created for AC or the conversion were being worked on the AC standards. Sure there is a DLC for AC and there will be another one shortly, but with the first one containing a laser scanned nordshelife, i think it's worth every €.The game works really well with a steering wheel or even a controller, i use a Dualshock 3 when I don't play with a wheel. I would not recommend using the keyboard for this kind of game, it just doesn't work.My absolutely biggest problem with the game is setting things up, whether it be my inputs methods, racing offline or online. There just isn't enough options for me to be happy. For instance, input menu, i have 15 options that i can bind keys or buttons to. In GTR2 which are a 9 year old game, there are almost 70 of them. It feels like AC is a port from a console game where you can change almost nothing. Many buttons are even hard coded into the game or you have to find the right hex number for that key and insert it in the right CFG file which is a joke.The good: High quality content, most is laser scanned so it's accurate In my opinion really nice physics, it feels ""right"" if that makes sense The looks, this is highly personal and in a simulator it shouldn't matter to much, but AC looks very good Modding, a game, especially a simulator often dies quickly without modding, and judging by the quality and quantity of mods available AC will have a long lifeThe not so good: Multiplayer, i still think AC lacks in multiplayer, more options when setting up server would be nice Server browser, too few options when filtering servers Few setup options available in the game when doing offline racing compared to other games Hardcoded keyboard binds/few keybinding options No weather (i.e rain) other then changing the sky and fog No day-night time cycleTL;DR: The driving feels really nice and the graphics looks amazing and even more so with some tweaking to the ""post-processing effects"". But there isn't much more than that, it's kinda ""meh"" and sometimes after I've been driving other simulators this really do feel like ""Hotlap simulator 2015"".If you like me are out to find a true successor to the likes of GTR2 or rFactor, this is partially it, the driving feels nice, the modding community is there, but other then that it falls short.Don't get me wrong, i don't hate AC, i love just going around the nordschleife tourist online and doing laps offline, but as a whole package, it just isn't cutting it for me.

												Probably the best racing Sim on the market. In terms of physics, out of all the sims I have played, this is second to none. From the suspension, to tyre simulation. All cars feel unique to drive and handle as they should, the feedback from the road to the wheel is immense, realistic and completely immersive, it's as if you can feel every bump in the road. The base game however is very barebones and in my opinion a little lackluster when compared to games such as Gran Turismo and Forza. I understand that this is due to the game being developed with modding in mind. Yet I still feel a little underwhelmed with the lack official cars and tracks and addition of an incredibly simplistic Career. That being said the community behind this game is incredible as the amount of fan created vehicles and tracks are astounding. The forums are active with members eager to help other players with anything and that is a nice thing to have. Personally however I have not tried the online component of the game since that really isn't my thing, however after some research for this review I understand that it works well and is filled with freindly people who prefer to race fairly and clean. Overall I really like this game, it's fun to boot up every now and then and do a couple of laps. If you are looking for a sim to practice, with arguably the best physics currently out there in my opinion then I would definitely reccomend purchasing this.			"

												I review this game as single player as I do this most. I have most racing sims at the moment from everyone there’s something to enjoy, I have seen a lot of mixed reports about this game but I thought I would give it ago, I haven’t played this game from early when it was released. I also got the dream packs awell i started the game I have to say I love the graphics I think it’s about right for a racing sim and the reflections and effects I thought looked great, great detail on tracks, cars and cockpits. so graphics are great in this game.  The sounds are good in this game not as good as race experience.  The cars selection is ok not as many cars as I thought in terms of racing cars but it had a good selection of gt3 cars.   the track selection I thought was poor really not as many tracks as it should be for a game that has been about for a while. Really thought this was lacking.  When playing the game as a single player I suppose the ai has to be good for the experience and this is where the game for me goes down. They seem to be lifeless and stuck on rail, when beside them I had a lot of contact and damage. Even when I kept to my racing line.  They just don’t seem to be aware of you, when I compare this to rfactor2 ai there is such a difference in the experience had when racing.  They call this a simulator I wasn’t really getting this when driving I felt safe all the time I could put the car through the limits and never really crash and burn.  I think the driving has been simplified and that was disappointing takes the fun away from the experience of driving a high powered gt3 car.The damage model is terrible, I can crash into a wall at 100mph and yes obtain some damage but still able to race, if I did this in other racing sims I would be out of the race.  The visual damage is well a few scratches on the paint work.Overall I was disappointed in this game with the ai and the driving experience, I think this game has potential but it seems that it’s never going to have these things changed or the extra simulation to make this a worthy racing simulator  "

												You know, I have Dirt Rally and it is just impossible to stop playing. It is so challenging and so much fun. This game, Assetta Corsa, I am trying to like, but I don't. It is just not very fun or interesting. I was curious about driving the Nurburgring and trying out all of the differrent cars and tracks. That was ok while it lasted. I do like Brands Hatch a lot.I have all of the DLCs, so I have tried all of the cars and tracks so far. The graphics are stunning, the tracks are great, but really, the cars are just boring to drive. Why? I don't really know. To me there is a certain sterile feeling about the game. Except for the rear-engined Porsches, the cars all have massive understeer, which can be time consuming to tune out.I recommend passing on this one.			"

												A great game that runs extremely well on my low-end Athlon X4 BE that leans on a heavily overclocked Radeon 270X.Running a mix of ultra/high settings with vsync but without post processing.  I'm a bit sceptical about getting even more ""dreampack"" DLC's before they actually add more Le Mans and more Formula One. As it is right now there's no downfall and you can't drive at night. 8am to 6pm isn't nearly enough for someone looking for the complete experience (or in my case, someone who love Le Mans.)As a passtime I find Assetto Corsa great, but for someone who wants to sink a lot of time into just one title--this falls short. No amount of DLC cars and tracks can mask the fact that the game is inherently lacking content on a basic level.If you like sim racing and want something very specific (Lotus 98T on Imola was my reason) I recommend this title. Otherwise I would wait for content patching that doesn't assault your wallet.			"

												Assetto Corsa is setting a new Milestone in the Simulation Genre with good Graphics. For really enjoying it, you definitely need a Steering Wheel with Force Feedback.Pros:+ Open to Modding+ Laserscanned Tracks and great Detail on the cars+ Realism+ Good Support in the official Forums+ Good Setup Management for the Cars+ Constant Updates with free stuff and DLCCons:- Lacks some graphics details when it comes to environment - but that is not a huge problem because you dont have time to enjoy the view.- If you are a beginner, you may get frustrated til you get the hang on it.- Without a wheel or at least a gamepad, don't even think about buying this game because you will not have any fun with a keyboard.- Hard to find real flaws here :)Long-Term update:Constant patching of the physics-engine and other stuff. Thumbs up. You can have fun for hours without the optional DLCs. They mainly bring new Content for those who love specific cars or tracks or mastered all the other and need new stuff to handle :)			"

												Fantastic.I've been waiting for a driving / racing game like this for a long long time, it may not be perfect but for someone who loves to enjoy cars for the experience of driving them alone, this really ticks all the boxes for me.Spending hours just driving round tracks beating my own lap time, drifting or just messing about never gets old. I use a g25 logitech with full H shifter and pedal set, you'd be insane to try to use anything less then that setup. The FFB is very good, however on some tracks / cars it doesnt feel as good as others, not BAD but just not uber realistic, just a bit too stiff.Track and car selection, again, brilliant but you get a feeling that the Devs only included personal faves rather then thinking what the public would want (the odd muscle car here and there? no the Cobra doesnt count as it actually handles). But again, really cannot complain as the level of detail on each vehicle is fantastic.The audio is very very sweet and crisp, some argue its perfect and true to life, others say it sounds a bit fake and compare it to other popular games like NFS games and project cars, which are arguably enhanced for brownie points.Now, online racing as far as actual proper races go (not just time attacks) are left a bit to be desired, every race there will be at least one player who will just revert to trolling if they cant win and start ramming you off the track etc. I have literally not found a server where this has not happened, this is probably due to no real penalty other then being kicked.For racing alone I'd stick to Iracing, but for just driving and enjoying tracks, setting personal bests etc this game is my first choice.10/10/10/10.

												The so-called 'racing sims' all have their own characteristics by core physics engine and which is pretty natural actually. One that has a physics which runs properly with GT/Formula car, only goes well with the GT and Formula car, and likewise a physics engine which sucks with Formula or Road car by nature, has just been terrible at the Formula and Road car. The well known games, ISI of rFactor/Simbin, Papyrus games up to iRacing and Live for Speed are not an exception to this story. Typical sim engines up to date had a narrow spectrum about possibility so that could stand well for only 1~2 types of car as every type's car drives like one type's car.But Assetto Corsa is a whole new gen game when it comes to the possibility of physics engine and its deepness. High or no downforce from classic F1 to modern F1 and GT, vintage grove tyres up to hyper road tyres, grippy or drift thingy, every type's car drives its own specific rules, especially as for how/when you lose grip and get grip that are all about sports driving. That's purely epic in this genre because in racing sims so far released each game works just like insisting every car is the one after all. If a core engine is too conservative and just superficial to simulate various types of car, no matter how many updates implemented into the engine it's hard to imagine what it will manage to go far from itself that was first built. That's one of the best thing this game is offering, which the others have been lacking still. There's a bunch of types of car and each types car is so alive in their own way. This is why I feel so special every time I play this game.			"

												I was really on the fence whether to buy this game or not.  Let me tell you that buying this game was a great choice for me!  It has great graphics and the force feedback is awesome!  It does take some time to adjust the settings for graphics and your racing wheel but once you do it runs like a charm.  (visit racedepartment.com if you need help setting up your settings)  I can't recommend this game enough if you are looking for a racing simulator/game.  Definately add this to your collection, you won't be dissappointed!			"

												Assetto Corsa is setting a new Milestone in the Simulation Genre with good Graphics. For really enjoying it, you definitely need a Steering Wheel with Force Feedback.Pros:+ Open to Modding+ Laserscanned Tracks and great Detail on the cars+ Realism+ Good Support in the official Forums+ Good Setup Management for the Cars+ Constant Updates with free stuff and DLCCons:- Lacks some graphics details when it comes to environment - but that is not a huge problem because you dont have time to enjoy the view.- If you are a beginner, you may get frustrated til you get the hang on it.- Without a wheel or at least a gamepad, don't even think about buying this game because you will not have any fun with a keyboard.- Hard to find real flaws here :)Long-Term update:Constant patching of the physics-engine and other stuff. Thumbs up. You can have fun for hours without the optional DLCs. They mainly bring new Content for those who love specific cars or tracks or mastered all the other and need new stuff to handle :)			"

												Fantastic.I've been waiting for a driving / racing game like this for a long long time, it may not be perfect but for someone who loves to enjoy cars for the experience of driving them alone, this really ticks all the boxes for me.Spending hours just driving round tracks beating my own lap time, drifting or just messing about never gets old. I use a g25 logitech with full H shifter and pedal set, you'd be insane to try to use anything less then that setup. The FFB is very good, however on some tracks / cars it doesnt feel as good as others, not BAD but just not uber realistic, just a bit too stiff.Track and car selection, again, brilliant but you get a feeling that the Devs only included personal faves rather then thinking what the public would want (the odd muscle car here and there? no the Cobra doesnt count as it actually handles). But again, really cannot complain as the level of detail on each vehicle is fantastic.The audio is very very sweet and crisp, some argue its perfect and true to life, others say it sounds a bit fake and compare it to other popular games like NFS games and project cars, which are arguably enhanced for brownie points.Now, online racing as far as actual proper races go (not just time attacks) are left a bit to be desired, every race there will be at least one player who will just revert to trolling if they cant win and start ramming you off the track etc. I have literally not found a server where this has not happened, this is probably due to no real penalty other then being kicked.For racing alone I'd stick to Iracing, but for just driving and enjoying tracks, setting personal bests etc this game is my first choice.10/10/10/10.

												Was so disapointed with this game, Multiplayer is dead only two Aussie servers up and career mode is iffy and boring as anything, AI non stop rams you and doesn't look anything like the screen shots (R9 290 Reppin with 12GB of ram) Car customization is weird too, some car settings you change have little to no effect like camber adjustments ect, which in the real world make a whole load of difference, I'd love to recommend another game but iracing requies you to get a bank loan.

A few were special and unique (at their time): i mean Grand Prix 2, Grand Prix Legends / Nascar 4 among others.Assetto corsa is quite close to match them today.It features great physics, good FFB and an overall extremely rewarding driving experience.Sure AI has issues, it's weak and perfectible on some track / car combos. This should be improved.Hotlapping is great though. Despite some constraints and some problems with collisions Multiplayer is quite satisfying too.There's definetely room for improvements and added features (i'd like to see weather changes, night racing, custom championships and fully customizable events).Other that that i have to recommend Assetto Corsa already to anybody loving sim-driving.

												Probably the best racing Sim on the market. In terms of physics, out of all the sims I have played, this is second to none. From the suspension, to tyre simulation. All cars feel unique to drive and handle as they should, the feedback from the road to the wheel is immense, realistic and completely immersive, it's as if you can feel every bump in the road. The base game however is very barebones and in my opinion a little lackluster when compared to games such as Gran Turismo and Forza. I understand that this is due to the game being developed with modding in mind. Yet I still feel a little underwhelmed with the lack official cars and tracks and addition of an incredibly simplistic Career. That being said the community behind this game is incredible as the amount of fan created vehicles and tracks are astounding. The forums are active with members eager to help other players with anything and that is a nice thing to have. Personally however I have not tried the online component of the game since that really isn't my thing, however after some research for this review I understand that it works well and is filled with freindly people who prefer to race fairly and clean. Overall I really like this game, it's fun to boot up every now and then and do a couple of laps. If you are looking for a sim to practice, with arguably the best physics currently out there in my opinion then I would definitely reccomend purchasing this.			"

												An absolutely excellent simulation game, with full support for a range of racing wheels and pedals. The DLC is perhaps the best model I've seen for any game, you pay a fair price for different cars, each with fully modelled interiors and variants, and one huge track per pack which is always highly detailed and includes every little road curve and bump. The modding scene is alive and very easy as you simply drag and drop cars and tracks into the content game folder, and they appear in-game straight away with no hassle. Gameplay-enhancing mods are also available if you prefer having some different changes to your game.If you're looking for a great simulation racer and other games just aren't doing the trick, then look no futher than Assetto Corsa.

The physics and sounds of the cars are simply delightful and can keep you entertained for hours on end. Setting up a server was very easy and has a brilliant interface. Overall very enjoyable online and offline. I have to admit I would like to see more cars and tracks which I would imagine we will see in the near future.Overall a very remarkable racing simulator.

												This game is awsome because its the most realistic racing sim i have ever played. Hours and years have been poured into AS to make it what it is today. Please dont listen to the bad reviews from butt hurt fourm posters who gave a thumbs down, simply because of hurt feelings. I assure you that the quality of the game is not affected by the dude from Kunos Simulazioni who felt like being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to some phony racer on a web fourm.If your into cars for real and you play games this NEEDS to be in your wheelhouse.

												- Good maps.- Beautiful visuals- Solid variety of cars (but they're broken into far too many different pieces of DLC)- Controls are tedious to configure and not explained in-game. I had to resort to reading forum posts by users to understand the mechanics of some of the options.- I had to adjust many of these options to get the controls to be any good.- PS4 controller is not natively supported and requires extensive configuration on top of the controls editing.- Driver assist features are jarring and make it more difficult to drive.- I spent a lot of time looking through forum posts and the control menu figuring out how to disable very annoying features and also UI elements, such as the default-on position tracker that eats up about 10% of the game screen until you cycle it off (F9).- Even when configured properly, the controls are very unsatisfying. Everything feels extremely slow. All the excitement of racing is completely sucked out of this game. It's about as exciting as commuting to work. Very disappointed.			"

												Meh. Assetto Corsa was near the top of my list while in development. I thought the physics were top notch and the tracks were amazing. Sadly that's where AC's amazing features end. The game is great if you just like hot laps. Otherwise it's pretty meh. Clunky interface, limited cars, horrible AI, horrible multiplayer and pathetic career. Get Project Cars for a better PC racing experience.			"

												I have had some fun with AC, but the last twelve months have seen development slow to a crawl and the tyre model get worse and worse. It's clear that their efforts have gone into developing the console version which I have no interest in. All the while they keep pumping out premium DLC that only serves the splinter the community. I should be able to compete in a race against vehicles I don't own in a car that I have purchased instead I have to purchase that content just to get on a server even if I don't feel like buying the car. The AI in this game is also terrible, some of the worst out there, they can't get around a lot of the official tracks without having huge pile ups and will happily run you each other off the track. I much prefer rfactor2 as an online platform, not to mention it's far and away the best sim out there right now. I mean it rains and a dry line forms based on where cars actually drive and rubber builds up where cars actually drive. AC uses a script that just seems to make the whole track grip up x amount p/lap. I have got rfactor2 outside of steam although I will be converting it to steam soon. I would have thousands of hours in rf2 by now, in some ways I'm glad it hasn't been counting all that time.			"

												Strap yourself in for some hobby-grade sim racing adrenaline with Assetto Corsa. To fully understand how AC differs from something like a Forza or Gran Turismo, we have to breifly talk about the spectrum of arcade versus simulation racing. Arcade racing at its fullest extreme would be something like a Cruis'n USA: wildly unrealistic, zany, almost like a cartoon of racing. Forza and Gran Turismo are more realistic in their approach. The other end of the spectrum for simulators would be something like a Microsoft Flight Simulator: where the goal is to emulate as close as possible the experience of what you're doing instead of a balance of game mechanics or graphics.AC is much more of a simulator than it is an arcade racing game. One can enjoy a simulator with a controller to a good degree, but that would be like playing a flight simulator with a keyboard: it's just not the right tool for the job. The technical limitation is that there isn't any response in the joystick of the controller when turning. With a racing wheel in a simulator, you can *feel* the track through the steering. You can *feel* the individual personality of the car in how it accelerates through the pedals and how it shifts. So how does AC with a wheel compare to Forza with a wheel? In many sim-cade racing games, there's always-on settings like traction control or steering assist that alter the personality of the vehicle. AC gives you a fuller picture of the racing experience for a given vehicle all the way from how the tires evolve over the course of the race, to the hydrodynamics of the wind in a rival's slipstream. In a sim-cade game you might have your hand being held for a career mode or being forced to unlock cars and parts for tuning. That's perfectly fine for those games, but AC dumps you right in. If you want to try a F1 car race right off the bat, you're in for a rude awakening. Difficulty can be turned down to help with newer players, but there is a rewarding learning curve to the game. I've played AC almost exclusively with a controller, and it's plenty fun in and of itself. Yet, there's the extra mile of realism that I'm missing out on that I'll never be able to attain without a wheel.AC is a great game in and of itself, but the game really shines with the modding community. AC doesn't have a steam workshop, but with a little google-fu, one can easily double the roster of vehicles available to drive. If you want a totally different HUD setup, countless variations await on the web. Some freely available car mods built from the ground up for free for AC astound me with their quality. I've yet to see a racing game of any simulation level come to the quality I see from the mods in the AC community. Between being able to make custom career mods yourself, downloading 4K liveries from the net, or racing in weird experimental tricycle cars, AC really offers an unparalleled level of exploration.The DLC offered for AC is fantastic. Every one of them that I've purchased has been well worth the price of admission. The tracks and vehicles are all very high quality and come with new challenges to beat in the special events section. The only downside is that they are numerous, so getting a full package of cars will start running up the numbers. Additionally, a big limitation of the online multiplayer is that unless you have the same DLC the server is using, you can't race at all on it. Other racing games have solved this issue by simply not letting you select the car to use. There should be a solution for this that the devs should take some time to focus on, since the online gameplay is also quite good. Yet having the community fragment based on the DLC releases is never a good step for long-term player engagement.			"

												After putting a few hours into this (4atm) I can say this is a solid game, with some flaws that most ""sims"" seem to have. Some of the cars drive a little strange, others drive like cars from Forza (no grip), some have body roll way beyond their real life counter parts and quite often cars don't respond realistically to counter steer (though it's FAR better than Project cars on that front) but for the most part they are pretty fun to drive. AI isn't great, but isn't horrible, I'd say so far it's more enjoyable to race than that of Pcars AI, as it seems far more aware of the player than the AI in Pcars.Track list is weak without DLC, not so great with it but better. Car list is ok, nothing to call home over.My biggest annoyance so far is the penalty system, similar to Pcars you have to slow down if you manage to go off course in the wrong spot, and much like Pcars the loss of time from the penalty is 10-15x what you ever could have gained from 'cutting' the corner. What's worse this happens on the outside of corners in some places. But unlike Pcars 1990s arcade game style of slow down penalties, this game allows you to come off throttle and coast out the penalty where ever you like. Meaning it's far safer for the cars behind than Pcars (imo) stupid system of slow down penalties, in where it basically slams on your cars brakes for you and slows you to about 40 mph, which I've seen end in wrecks almost every time when it happens in a multiplayer race.If I had to buy one or the other, as much as I hate to say it, I'd buy Pcars. But, this plays differently enough, that even if you already own Pcars, it's worth a buy on sale at the least. (which I suggest waiting for, because the game is pretty light on content without the DLC, which is around 35 bucks for all of it when on sale for 50% off)			"

												(Disclaimer: this is sort of a Project Cars vs. Assetto Corsa review, for no other reason than I bought both games within a week of eachother and have a clear 'winner' in my mind which I think needs sharing. I had no knowledge of either games before I bought them as I wasn't into racing games all that much prior to the purchase of my racing wheel.)I got my first racing wheel a week or two ago and so I bought Project Cars to test it out. It's not a bad game, but it's not the best game out there. After some debate I decided to give Assetto Corsa a try, to which I was immediately hooked. Why, you might ask?The driving feels much more natural in AC, when you skid off the track you know it was your fault and you know how to avoid making that same mistake. Whereas in PC, sometimes it just feels wrong. You think or know you've probably made an error somewhere during the race, but you just can't put your finger on it. Was it a steering, braking or shifting error? It seems impossible for me to describe this feeling as a beginning sim racer, but the difference is palpable once you race with a force-feedback steering wheel. When you drive a car in AC you are ín the car. In PC, less so. This makes a lot of driving errors you tend to make in PC feel unjust and out of the blue. Supposedly there's a number of reasons why the driving experience in AC is better than the one in PC. I won't get into it now, you can probably google that for yourself. I am no expert on these matters whatsoever. All I can say for now is that AC feels better and therefore is much more immersive, enjoyable and addicting than PC.I must say that PC is more user friendly in the sense that the menu's and career mode are easier to navigate/get into. However, the perpetual event invites you get in the PC career mode annoy the hell out of me. I just want to progress with karts. Now I know you can start whereever you want in the career mode and figure things out from there. But where's the fun in a career mode where you can skip 90% of the levels? Granted, maybe I just don't 'get it'.Supposedly the AI in PC is smarter than the AI in AC. I find this to be true. However, this doesn't mean the AI in AC is completely daft. They just feel a bit more like an AI: a bit more rocky and predictable at times. It's not something that puts me off all that much. This is mostly due to the fact that you are so immersed in your driving that you aren't bothered by details like that. Whereas in PC I would get annoyed with the slightest AI error because I was already having unnecessarry trouble getting used to the car I was driving.The only real major positive PC has (over AC) are the graphics and especially the sounds. They are absolutely excellent. All of this leads to the conclusion that PC is shiny. It's an O.K. game. A game you could buy when it's on sale, to see whether it floats your boat without it costing you too much in the financial department. More fun with a steering wheel? Definitely, but at times it's infuriating because of its flaws. AC is a game that you MUST buy if you have a racing wheel, because right now it is the best racing simulation game on steam.If you have the money, buy AC first. If that doesn't win you over, possibly due to the fact that it is less user friendly (marginally so in my opinion, but still), give PC a try. Maybe the slick design and amazing sound and graphics of PC will win you over if AC doesn't. I must admit that AC is rather steeply priced compared to PC due to the DLC packs. On sale AC+dlc was about 41EUR, compared to about 18EUR for PC+dlc which I purchased through a third party.			"

												Hello, This review is for skeptics. Im currently playing AC @Ultra 60 w/ a Dualshock 4. So far i am AMAZED. The quality of this Software is beyond anything ive ever played on console. Coming from Playstation all my life and being a Gran Turismo Fan since i was a young child. This is up there with gran turismo in my book, sorry to say but i think this is a little better than GT's last iterations. The tracks and car models are beautiful, you can hear backfire when downshifting and can hear intake whine at high RPM's.. This game is Rediculous. I definately recommend to anyone who likes the genre. Not for Need For Speed kindof people. Game takes a lot of Patience & Practice especially on Pro. I Give this 5 Stars!! Triple Pack, Red Pack, and JDM Pack are a mustttttttt!			"

												Hi everyone, I finally got a feeling to share my opinion on this game on my birthday today. I have been on the simulation racing games all my life, and as years went by simulations got a better and better. But long story short - I am playing only this game now.I like the sounds, as they seem very authentic , as this is not the case with most simulations.The most realistic handling I've experienced, as well the right feel for speed flow.Point of view is superb, road bumps are correctly transferred to the chassis.Laser scanned tracks help this, I guess.Anyway - this game gives you the thrill that you're looking for.So, turn off the traction control and let it rip.Have fun!!!

												3 years ago, I had a firm beleif that if you wanted to play the most accurate racing game on the market, turn to Sony and their Grand Turismo. However, that has long since changed.This game, while not only one of the most beautiful I have ever played, is also one of the most accurate. It's rare that one can go from driving their car in real life, sit down behind a computer screen and actually FEEL the car they are driving in game behave like it does in real life. This game has one of the most advanced engines i've ever come across in terms of its car physics. Not to mention the mod support and addons available for this game as well, Kunos knocked it out of the galaxy with this one.			"

												Imagine you purchase an elaborate cake from a bakery for your wedding, your kid’s birthday, whatever. The bakery has lots of customers and examples of their cakes you see in the store are impressive. You bring the cake home, take it out of the box and it looks fantastic. Then you cut into the cake and find that it’s literally half baked.This is what it’s like buying Assetto Corsa.Pros:Looks good. I’m not usually an eye candy guy, but wow this is definitely pretty.The amount and variety of car content is commendable. Both official and mods.Cons:Automatic pit lane speed limiter.When a race weekend session ends, the screen just fades to black and places you back in the pits at the beginning of the next session.No apparent way to review your individual lap times after a race weekend session has ended.No way to do standing starts dumping the clutch with the car in gear (well known).No assignable control to place the car directly in neutral. Race cars have had this for over 20 years. Amazingly, there’s half a dozen assignable controls for MGU-K and MGU-H hybrid power, but nothing for the simple task of putting the car in neutral.Car will not roll downhill when in neutral. It doesn’t matter how steep the hill is or what the surface is. It can be off-track grass or the track surface itself. If the car is sitting pointed uphill, it will not roll backwards once you place it in neutral. Spin off uphill and you have to shift down through all the gears into reverse and power yourself backwards. You can’t just simply roll back.Different behavior entering/exiting instant replays. To enter a replay you hit Esc which pauses the action and brings up a small dialog with a menu. When you exit the replay, however, you’re returned directly to live action in the car. If the action is paused going into a replay, it should also be paused coming out of a replay. This could be placated with a simple assignable pause control but alas, like selecting neutral, there appears to be no assignable control for this basic game function.And the worst flaw...steering!The way this game handles steering is an immature and absurd mess. I'm not aware of any other racing game for the PC that makes dealing with the most fundamental vehicle control (steering) such an arduous and complex task. Maybe it actually is technically more accurate. I don’t know. But this is still a piece of entertainment software not a commercial engineering simulation. New owners of the game should not have to spend 2x-5x as much time researching steering and getting it configured than they do actually driving anything in the game. And that’s just to get to the point where it’s possible to physically complete a lap on a track.There is no steering lock adjustment as part of the car setup. None. You’re stuck with how you have your controller configured. Now couple this with the fact that cars have steering lock ranges from 360 to over 1,000 degrees. Which, by the way, are not visible anywhere from within the game. You have to find the values for each car online or activate a developer tool and measure it yourself while sitting in each car. Either way, you’ll probably need to keep a notebook or spreadsheet so that you know what values to configure your controller for before you select the car you want to drive. Had your controller configured for a car with a different steering lock value than what you’re driving now? Too bad. You’ll have to exit your session/race to either load a different controller preset or leave the game entirely to access your controller’s profiler software.It’s quite possible you’ll enjoy this game if you have a wheel controller with 700 – 900 degrees of rotation and profiler software to control it. If you don’t, however, be prepared to put in an extraordinary amount of effort just to make the game drivable.			"

												Even after a few years they still havent made this a real racing sim.It still misses features that other titles have that make it less sim and more of a game, or hot lap sim.This really was only ever used by me as a hot lapper. The physics do not feel very detailed, actually I just got in a spin and it felt like it was a canned effect.Dont get me wrong, the game looks great, though not as great as the fan boys will tell you. The track models look great until you realise its all post processing.The physics and forcefeedback are bland and simplistic at best.This used to be my goto sim when i didnt know better and was sucked in by the graphics, but now I feel they are taking it more in the game direction, which is good, for them and the type of people who play it, because they are not bothered about setting up real race weekends with weather and day and night cycle, with real penalty systems etc etc.As long as they can hot lap against their buddies (dont get me started on AC's AI, its the worst in the industry) then the fan base is happy.

												What a massive pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥this game really is.This game is constantly broken, and when i seem to fix it some how, it then breaks in a diferent way.After finaly givng up on trying to make the game START on Windows 10 (as well as other games not working and the whole 'Microsoft sees everything incase your a terrorist' thing) i went to 8.1 adn the game worked once, letting me drive the newley added GT86.Came to it today to hopefully finaly make a video on it, and i cant load any cars or tracks and it said some sort of .ini file was missing, after some digging around and finding ♥♥♥♥ all support and the forum being useless i decided to download a mod car to see if i could find the missing file in that. Guess what i found. The whole 'Data' folder in all of my default car folders is missing.ARE YOU KIDDINGEven better, in trying to fix it, i have verified the cache in steam, completely reinstalled the game, deleted all the tracks and cars, verified it again and let it redown the tracks and cars through that and the 'Data' folder still is not there.I would ask for a refund but due to the purchase date and how long steam thinks i have played i can't steam thinks i have played the game for 6.6 hours when in reality, its only about hour, maybe a little more, and the reason it took so long for me to play the game was because i spent so long trying to make the game start on windows 10!Dont buy this game, should still be early access, and it would be one of the poor ones at that.

Posted: March 14, 2015
												Bon, je vous donne un avis de début de jeu. Pour l'instant j'ai été jusqu'en AT1 en carrière.Déjà, jusqu'à ce que je comprenne comment il fonctionne....Parce que j'ai essayé au clavier, puis à la manette, puis avec mon Driving Force GT.Un pote a un G25 et il n'arrive pas à le paramétrer. Moi de mon coté je me dis que j'ai l'habitude, donc essayons.Au volant je ne sais pas encore car je me suis arrêté à la manette.Mais pourquoi s'embêter à créer un profil ""Razer Sabertooth 360"" pour qu'il ne fonctionne jamais? Pourquoi Mrs les Dévs????En N1 avec la Giulietta je n'arrivais même pas à dépasser le premier checkpoint.... après des heures de paramétrages infructueux, je me dis ""Et puis♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ je prend la config de base manette 360"".. Et là, miracle!! Ca marche!! La manette répond et j'enchaine les Checkpoint....Bon ensuite. Le jeu est beau. Tout au niveau du sol je trouve super, le bruit des voitures est superbe et la conduite (du moins avec cette manette, l'épreuve du feu sera mon volant) est fun.En revanche... en 1080P tout au max, ce n'est pas cette merveille tant promise et tant annoncée!Sur le circuit du Nurbugring, les textures bougent et saccadent ce qui donne une horrible sensation de vitesse. En plus quand je regarde au loin en ligne droite et que je vois tout bouger ça me fait pas vraiment du bien.Au niveau du jeu en lui même, quelques remarques.On peu choisir une tonne d'informations à placer sur l'écran, on peu bidouiller la voiture à souhaits, on peut tout faire!!!MAIS POURQUOI ON NE PEU PAS ALLER DANS LES OPTIONS DEPUIS UNE COURSE????????????????????????????????Pendant une course vous vous dites: ""hmm.. je baisserais bien un chouilla le volume ou je reglerais bien un petit peu mon volant"".Mais vous ne pouvez pas! Faut quitter la course, revenir dans le menu, faire ses paramétres et tout recommencer! BRAVO!Maintenant le mode carrière.Ce n'est que mon avis personnel, mais je m'ennuie!J'ai l'impression que ce jeu est fait pour les purs passionnés de voiture qui aiment conduire seulement avec le bruit du moteurJ'avoue c'est top, mais au bout de 10 min de course seul en tête avec rien d'autre!!! Franchement c'est horrible!Ils auraient au moins pu faire des gradins avec du monde qui crie quand tu passes, ou un commentateur sur le circuit je ne sais pas!Ca manque d'ambiance, c'est très très très dommage!!!Les circuits, toujours sur les mêmes circuits : imola, Nurbugring, Monza, Mugello, SPA, Silverstone, vallelunga. Vous voulez le mythique Nurbugring 20Km? 15€ tiens!Donc quand on commence un nouveau Tier et qu'on se tappe encore les mêmes circuits, 6 tours à chaque fois....Les penalités tiens!Si je coupe un virage et que je double quelqu'un je comprend que je puisses être pénalisé.Je joue à F1 2014 en conditions réelles et c'est moins relou que là.Sur AS, quand on loupe un virage on fini souvent sur les graviers ou avec la voiture qui perd complètement de l'adhérence. C'est déjà une pénalité! Mais quand il faut en plus ralentir exactement à moins de 35 Km/h sur la piste... sérieux quoi!!!Le pire c'est quand ils disent de freiner et que ça ne marche pas. J'ai complétement raté la première chicane à Monza en AT1. J'étais premier avec 8 secs d'avance sur le 2eme au dernier tour.On me dit ""ralentissez, penalité"".J'arrête carrément la voiture et je met la marche arrière. Le message ne part pas. On me double et quand je passe la ligne, disqualifié, 10eme !!! Délire !Pas de personnalisation de la voiture? Pas le moindre changement de couleur!? Pas une petite création d'écurie ou un sticker à mettre sur le casque du pilote? C'est juste incroyable qu'un jeu sorte en 2015 avec moins d'ptions de personnalisation qu'un Gran Turismo 2 sorti en 1999 (d'ailleurs, aucun jeu n'arrive aux pieds de GT2 en terme de personnalisation).Donc voilà. Le jeu coûte 45€ + 15€ de pack et Project Cars lui est à 50€ (pour l'instant).Project Cars a été repoussé à la mi-mai certes, mais si j'ai un conseil à vous donner: ATTENDEZ PROJECT CARSAttendez et regardez les vidéos de gameplay pour vous forger une idée.Car j'adore les jeux de course et je suis très deçu d'Assetto Corsa.Assetto Corsa pour moi c'est un GTR Evolution / Race 07, mais graphiquement amélioré, des voitures neuves et des très beaux bruitages. C'est tout.C'est triste à dire, mais je ne pense pas qu'il arrivera à me faire décrocher de F1 2014, Dirt 2 ou GRID.			"

												The perfect simulation to kill the time until Project Cars finally releases.The game feels very realistic but at some points still unfinished. The AI makes even at the highest levels certain mistakes what concerns the breaking points and the interaction with the player himself. But it makes a hell lot of fun and the little ""errors"" the game has dont decrease the game experience and enjoyment.Grab it!			"

												The little bit I've played has been amazing... but there is absolutely no reason a game that supports Xbox controller inputs won't let you use the controller in their menus...You literally have to walk to your computer to manually start races between races or even to scroll through the pause menu. The input's already there... just allow it to navigate menus!I do not recommend this for controller people for that reason. Given that they said they'd be working on this in 2013, I gave this a negative review:http://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/666825525106158137/... and then disregarded more complaints in 2015...https://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/492379159717320215/... and even more complaints...http://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/46476145623035468/https://steamcommunity.com/app/244210/discussions/0/598198356169749509/I'll change my review to recommended if they fix this issue.If you're a keyboard / mouse and Wheel guy, then this will work great for you.Game plays amazing.NOTE: Before you Flame me, I like OPTIONS. Sometimes I mouse / keyboard or Wheel at my computer... other times I use my controller on my couch... depending on the mood I'm in.			"

												Assetto CorsaI expected a lot about this game, the sheer number of positive reviews is astonishing, the high ratings from magazines, so much positivity, but I was kind of sad when I bought the game + the dream pack DLC and I booted it up to get my own impression. There is a lot to say about this game and I have a lot of negativity to report. First of all, the launcher. As my desktop runs in the 4K resolution, it starts in 4K as well. There is no way I can lower it for the launcher at all, it just keeps running in 4K. Thats okay, it kind of adapts to the resolution, but a small portion of the screen is used, a lot of wasted space. Also, I cant seem to get it running windowed, it just MUST stay in the desktop resolution. Okay, I can look beyond that, although the launcher runs very sluggish. And when I witnessed the first launcher crash, I thought 'oh dear, I hope its just a one-time only crash.'. Unfortunately I was wrong there, the launcher crashes often.So I'm gonna do a practice round, with any car, I want to see the enviroments, testing it out, getting a taste of the in-game atmosphere. Monza '66. Sounds good, lets see what its all about. I'm taking the old alfa romeo out for a spin. It loads up, ofcourse not windowed and in 4K. I specifically said that it had to run windowed, but it doesnt. Okay fine, lets see what you got then. I'm happy to report that the game itself runs smoothly in high settings on 4K resolution. Its running between 50 and 60 fps on my rig. Thats very smooth in my opinion, well done, thats a good start. The car handles well, the sound is great and the Xbox 360 controller does its work well.So far so good! Now for a lower speed lap and look around a bit. Well what can I say .. Everything looks very static. The cardboard crowd, theres no breeze through grass and/or trees. Nothing lives in the game, except for the pit guy .. well he just keep standing there with his sign in his hand. It feels as lively as Race 07, an old SimBin racing/simulation game, but with slightly upgraded graphics (not much!). Also somewhere on the track, the road splits up, which makes me think 'Oh, the next round I try the other road, this can be fun!'. So I do that, at high speed I enter the other road and my car slams into an invisible wall. Yeah .. very realistic. Then dont give me the frikkin' option to enter that road!Okay nevermind, lets play the Nordschleife touristenfahrt, my buddy was all excited about it, yeah its laser scanned! Whatever that means. I thought .. oh its scanned, it must be VERY accurate and the graphics must be top notch then. I'm disappointed to say, it doesnt gets me woo'ed and excited. Again, nothing lives in the game, okay that ofcourse does the framerate very well, but the enviroment is all stiff and dead. First thing I try, is taking a blocked off entry gate to the green hell. Theres a wooden barrier blocking my way. No match for my sportscar! So I run into it .. BAM! The car is damaged, bounces off, the barrier stays up. Wow. Amazing physics, yeah in the real world, that would happen too huh ? Surely, they would see you like a prick in the real world, taking the wrong gate thats blocked off, but I'm very sure the barrier would break or fall over. Again the car and controls handle very well, but thats where the good stuff ends. The rest of the game is mediocre and feels old. Real world physics are non-existent. Theres no change in weather. There isnt a single breeze. Its like the nuclear holocaust has happened and everybody and everything was frozen in time. Theres a railway track next to the drag race enviroment. I havent seen a single train there. Its dead as anywhere else in the game. I have no idea how this game got past version 1.0. It surely still feels like a beta. Running into the end of the track does 'BOINK' again, no bits fly off the car, everything stays on, there is no damage model, I ran into the wall with 250+ km/h, nothing broke off the car, except for the textures that look dirty and wrickled a bit.Fine fine, its all fine, lets do an online game with my friend. Lets start a custom game! Just us on the Nordschleife touristenfahrt, good idea, lets do that. Its impossible to start your own session. You must  have a dedicated server for it, and you cant start your own online session. Okay, whatever, lets join a server then. Ofcourse we both picked a car thats not on the servers car list. Sorry, doesnt work. You have to use one of the listed cars or you cant enter. Really .. this game .. it doesnt make me happy. In the end, racing together was fun however, you just have fun anyhow when you're on voice and chatting about it. Just those launcher crashes .. So the conclusion .. I dont understand any of all the exciting positive reviews. This game feels mediocre. Definately NOT worth the amount of money they ask for it. You still have to have a gaming console for the best simulation game, like an Xbox with Forza, even that lives more in-game. It must be the lack of good, decent, racing simulation games on the PC that makes everyone so super excited about it. I'm disappointed. It doesnt add up to my expectations. Try again and back to the designing board.Pros:+ Runs smooth+ Good car handling+ Good car soundsCons:- Lack of number of cars to choose from- Enviroment is static and dead, no physics there- Multiplayer custom online games are a huge hassle- Launcher crashes on and on- No weather changes or windMy PC:Intel Core i7 @ 4 Ghz, 12GB DDR3-1600 RAM, 256GB SSD, 2TB Hybrid disk, GeForce GTX970 OC 4GB, Iiyama Ultra-HD monitor @ 4K 60Hz.

I only see greater improvements and greater introductions of epic supercars. 9/10. A must buy.Online Multiplayer system is good compared to other racing games.

Then 1.0 came and went, no nordschlief full course, no integrated skin customization, still feels like my tires start two inches in the ground, extreme audio glitches, and minor physics glitches.       Then Dream Pack DLC comes out... theres all the stuff we teased you with that was ""coming soon"".  Turns out they would like $15 more of my money...     All this coupled with cars that have no... i don't know what to call it... feel i guess.  I can't feel the road change under my car, i can't feel the g forces in the corners, none of the visual effects in this game give me any sensation that i'm driving a car, in any of the views.        I really wanted to like this game, but unfortunately I cannot recommend buying it for all the flawsAfter some more updates, they're at 1.6.1 or something like that, this game has become completely unplayable.  I cannot load any car on any track, it just crashes to the front ui, and many of the cars that came with the game have no preview thumbnail.  Hopefully it at least uninstalls okay and I won't have to look at this garbage title at the top of my steam library.			"

Short review: Best Hot Lap Simulator with Mod Support!Long review: best hot lap simulator with mod support, awesome physics and great sounds, with lots of potential to be the best racing simulator with MOD support that would includes: doing Hot Laps in laser-scanned tracks or hill climbs, special challenges, racing against decent A.I. in custom races and decent career mode, and also decent online multiplayer.Sadly, the game mentioned in the long review started it's development in year 2010, and is still far from actually existing.However, the version mentioned in the short review is at version 1.1.5 at the time of the writing of this review, and is almost flawless. But If graphics doesn't matter, buy Trackmania² instead.			"

												Worst AI in any racing game everI literally have a video of an AI pit maneuvering me because it wouldn't alter its preset line because the AI in this game just has like 3 preset lines for each track that aren't even interchangable they just ram you if you are in their way (which you should be because their preset lines are racing lines)tl;dr if you take the correct line you get thrown into the wall by an AI with a better car than you and if you take the incorrect line you loose because the AI have better cars than you.Apart from that great simulator just♥♥♥♥♥♥everything else besides the physics and cars, glad I got it on sale ♥♥♥♥ paying full price			"

												I love the graphics, physics and force feedback in this game. But I hate that there is no real single player component. No real career mode (yes, there's one in there but it is not good, just a bunch of unrelated races with no real sense of progression). And the AI, though improved over the last few updates, is not good enough to race offline with. There are also issues with multiplayer and this sim, in general, just is not a good ""racing"" sim, as it has been advertised. It's a ""driving"" sim, not a racing sim and for me, that is a huge disappointment.While I don't necessarily regret buying this (I bought it through early access, so at a reduced cost) I can not give it a recommendation. At the very least, I would only recommend buying it while on sale ($25-$30).			"

												Looking for an easy to learn racing game? Look elsewhere. This game is deep into pro car techies territory.I swear i tried to enjoy it, but in the end i had to give up. And i dont give up easy.I mean, the graphics are truly great, the tracks seem exact copies of the real deal. But for me, a not pro driver, thats all theres is to see in the game. Most of the time, no matter what car or track i choose, i have to fine tune car settings for a pretty long time until it becomes an OK experience for an actual race. By OK experience i mean not sliding away at every turn or even when going straight. Frustrating, to say the least. Maybe if i were a pro. But im not.One worrying thing i noticed is the lack of professionalism of a staff member, namely, Stefano Casillo. I was checking some posts and saw how extremely rude he was when there simply was no call for it. That and other forum controversies. I mean, if i were a pro or semipro driver and somehow my post was slightly incorrect, i fear that guy would throw a tantrum at me like he did to other people before. Mind you, that guy wasnt rude to me; dam i didnt even post in the forums. I just find this staff member's behavior unacceptable.TLDR: If youre a fan of car techie pro drivers stuff, enjoy fine tuning car stuff until its perfect for a specific track, and dont care about forum drama, sure, go ahead. But for most mortals, with no pro driver skills, i say stay away from this one.			"

												This review has been heavily edited. If you found it useful or unuseful before, your opinion may have changed. I haven't re-written this review to say that, now that i have a slightly higher amount of game time, i fell in love with this game and i'm ready to recommend it. My overall opinion on Assetto Corsa hasn't changed: i do not recommend this game for a whole series of reasons. I just wanted to change the tone of the review and some of my pros and cons. Let's see.PROS-The driving model is probably the most convincing out there right now. It is not 100% perfect, but it sure manages to give the player the feel and thrill of driving a fast (or VERY fast, depending on the model) car. Without any TCS, ABS and stuff, the cars react to every imput in a very plausible way, blocking the wheels when you brake too hard, losing traction if you try to go pedal to the metal at the wrong moment, and generally making a mess if you're not capable of handling them. Learning to drive decently in Assetto Corsa can be a tasking challenge, and it's very fun and satisfying, though sometimes frustrating. There are some slight flaws, pointed out in the cons, but globally it's awesome.-The magic triangle dampers-tires-track is depicted extremely well. The vehicle is realistically influenced by every bump (and with Laser Scan, you can only blame the track for being like it is), the grip is extremely realistic and you can select various asphalt setups (i.e. perfect, dirty, old etc.) that influence the behavior of your car. Very nice.-Online is taken very seriously by the community, and has nice races with qualifications and so.-Career mode is vast enough and as varied as the small car amount can allow it to be.-Adjustment to your car's components is extremely precise and well-crafted.-There aren't many circuits, but it's a rather good selection: iconic raceways (Silverstone, Monza, Spa), modern raceways (the Nurburgring GP), some italian tracks (Magione, Vallelunga, Mugello) and a curiosity (the challenging 17 km mountain climb from Trento to Bondone, also good for relaxing). Few but good ones, i'd say. And the Green Hell is coming.-The sound effects are excellent. Full stop. People say this or that racing game has realistic sounds, then play Assetto Corsa and drop their jaws to the ground 10 seconds after the car accelerates.-The game is very open to modding, to a certain degree (read: it has to be GOOD quality modding, otherwise go away. Kinda classy, but assures a high average quality).CONS-The current lack of value for money. As i've basically said in the pros, the core game is there and works magnifically, but there are few cars (43, a large part of which are variants of the same car, like GT2, GT3 or such racing modifications) that don't quite represent what sport cars are today and/or were yesterday and few tracks. I understand buying licenses and scanning tracks is all but for free, but the game isn't for free as well. Its price is rather high. More cars and the notorious Nurburgring Nordschleife track will come, and DLCs are said to be planned up to 2018. But...-...they will be payed DLCs. No surprise, after all. The willing to cash in on a game through downloadable extra content is common. Kunos is somewhat justified because what they'll offer isn't already finished and ready to ship but is being actively developed, but i'm ready to bet these packs will be excessively expensive. The only hope is a lifetime season pass or the fact that i'm wrong and these packs are cheap.-I am forced to hit this nail a little harder. Stop being such elitist a-holes, please: not everybody can afford a steering wheel and/or is willing to buy it just for you. I have a different kind of problem, for example: it doesn't fit in my current room layout. Assetto Corsa can be as better as it can get with a good wheel, a full pedal set and maybe a gear lever/paddles layout, but you can't just shoot in the legs the users that don't have a steering wheel. Joystick controls are broken: accelerator and brake can't be remapped, thus forcing the player to revolve around the frontal triggers while the right analogic lever is also a good choice (i prefer it, for instance). Steering sensitivity is also way too obviously steer-like even while playing with a joystick (read: way too histerycal to allow the needed precision, because levers are way less accurate than a dedicated peripheral). So please please please, take 15 minutes of your developing time to improve those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls.-The racing UI is highly customizable, and that's good, but it has some flaws. The rankings can't be moved from the bottom of the screen, an uncomfortable location, and all the adjustments can only be done while in the middle of an actual event, a very annoying and inexplicable fact.-Now a quick summary of minor cons, not very serious but still annoying:1)Having an automatic clutch, which even many steering wheel users have no choice but to accept, makes the car start in a very unrealistic way, unless you start revving the engine in neutral then insert first gear suddenly. Kinda annoying, sometimes.2)Some technical issues (questionable optimization, anisotropic filtering having an inexplicable as severe performance impact, some out-of-the maps clipping bugs in Trento-Bondone and a generally last-gen quality in background and scenarios, needing some improvement).3)Incomplete localization. The game is made in italy, but the default english text isn't fully translated (cars descriptions are still in this language). For an italian, that's quite a ♥♥♥♥♥slap.Summarizing, i like how this game handles (though i'm limited by the controller i can still ""feel it"") and i find it fun, but lack of content can be a problem on the long run and the very likely DLC spam feels depressing already. The game has quite a high price now, and though it has been officially released (current version is 1.0.4 when i write this review) it feels unfinished on some sides (dynamic weather will arrive in a future update, and don't come and tell me that's not a feature worth being inserted at launch, in a Driveclub fashion). So do i recommend this game? There isn't a ""meh, it depends"" button, so i'll go for the no. But my judgment isn't negative. If you find it at around 20-25 euros, then spend them: you'll have fun, if you like the genre.			"

I caught myself only listening engine sound in neutral for 10 minutes without touching anything. It also has consistent servers for multiplayer and great support for driving wheels.Highly recommended! 9.5/10			"

Blog Post[uberswe.com] | YouTube VideoI love that there are finally some games for the PC that are starting to rival my favorite racing game, Forza. Assetto corsa feels real when driving and is rumored to be amazing with a steering wheel. The developers have put a lot of work into the physics of the game and force feedback for steering wheels in order to make the game as good as possible.I start my career with one of the slowest and most basic cars where you go through different champoinships and races in order to earn money to start a career in racing. The better you do the easier it will be to progress to the next championship and purchase better cars. The cars look really good, very realistic even on the inside.For my first race I do a time trial, the controls feel a bit sensitive as I am using my xbox controller but this is good, this is the way the game should be. I had to take my turns carefully, turning the steering wheel will definitely lead to understeer as expected. This is not an arcade game, this is a realistic racing simulator.My only complaint is the UI and believe me, it is not a big complaint, but it does feel a bit unfinished when I am in the service depot for example, the red/black/gray layout is fine but it feels like something that was made for the early access version of the game. I think that this is something that can be improved.I definitely recommend buying this game, however the $50 price tag may be a bit high for some and I do recommend getting it while it is on sale as I did.

												Definitely one of the best race games / sims in my collection, which is pretty large. It does have it's faults though. Firstly, it will push your hardware to it's limits, especially if you want to run the graphics maxed-out. It does look stunning, but mix Kunos cars with downloaded mods and you'll take a massive framerate hit. However, if your rig meets the recommended specs and you're prepared to turn the 'polish', like the PP filters off and maybe run the world detail on high rather than ultra you should be ok. Secondly, the AI (as of 10/03/15 - might change with the dream pack patch) is pretty crappy. If you spin or take a corner too slow for them, they will just plough into you. They don't seem to realise that the idea of racing is to overtake your opponents, they'd be great in a demolition derby game though. Kunos PLEASE, PLEASE fix this.  Other than that I don't really have many complaints. Kunos have provided some really well made tracks and some beautiful cars. It could do with just a little bit more though, more tracks from outside Italy and just a few more cars, but these are coming and I'm just impatient. The physics are great and when you get your wheel's FFB dialled in right the sim provides a great driving experience. If you want to race, go online. The community is friendly and there are servers out there for all levels of drivers running races and track day events.  It's great fun!There are also some very high quality mods out there and some not so good ones, but don't worry, they're easy to install and remove. This is a game/sim that hasn't quite reached it's full potential yet, but it's getting there and it has bags and bags of potential. A 9.5/10 from me on this one. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.Come on 5 o'clock and the Dream Pack release, I want to drive the ring!!!Ok, so after the release of 1.1 the AI is slightly improved, but not much though.			"

												Wish I be more younger and have more time to play this fantastic and well developed simulator. This is truly a gem, a masterpiece of the genre, created with passion by the genius Stefano Casilla.As a hardcore sim racer in the past and a car enthusiast, this simulator can achieve a good mix between a friendly interface, good graphics, realistic cars including dream cars like the Bmw E30 M3, beast machines like the McLaren P1 or unique touring cars legends like the MB 190 Evo, realistic tracks with lot of detail and avoiding too much complexity in the configuration department and maybe the most relevant aspect: wonderful physics. Of course you can go deep and add mods, change whatever setting you want and finally destroy the simulator (joking). In the past i have a great time messing with my games but now i just wanna have fun and a good sensation with my humble computer and my logitech steering controller.What is very welcome is that Kunos keep the game updated, with many DLC and also there's a great community behind if you want to makes things more interesting. My computer is not so powerful but i'm impressed with the performance achieved (Samsung Laptop, Intel i5, Nvidia Gt 630 and 6 gb RAM). Totally recommended for harcore sim racers!Arcade racing fans beware: this is not Need or Speed or Forza, real driving skill required!			"

												Still the best sim BUTKunos have just decided that many of the features you need to set up a reasonable server with all the cars you want and a track rotation. is not needed..They also just decided That if you want anything even resembeling a working multiplayer system You pretty much have to write it your self.. This has renderd the game pretty useless, because single player is terrible. and now Multiplayer is basically drive arround 1 track all day in a selection of 4 or so cars... Do your selfs a favour and buy project cars.No project cars is not a sim like AC is. It really isnt, But aslong as you dont play asetto corsa you wont know the difference so you will be happy with project cars.. ME??I cant play project cars because the feel of AC was a million times better so i cant go playing it as it just does not feel right or feed the information back to you that you need. And i cant play Asetto corsa any more because 1.2 just killed it..  "

												I am running an FX8350 and r290, but the performance in the game is terrible for me, just juddering and laggy and unplayable, and the graphics are quite dated to be honest despite an evening trying to tweak it. I spent half an hour trying to setup my Fanatec wheel with it, but as soon as I restarted the game it forgot all my settings.  The convoluted menus are far too mouse centric, I have to jump put of my cockpit just to load and start and race, and then try and jump back in before the green light. Why it doesn't have some basic wheel support for the menus escapes me...I understand this is supposed to be a hardcore sim, but lacking those basic player focused elements just killed any desire to play with this sim any further, at least until another patch comes out. I've been obsessed with Dirt Rally instead...plug and play works fantastic.			"

												The best driving simulator I played in ages. Being italian, having this game from Kunos is a big pride! I honestly can't enjoy other racing games after playing Assetto. Sure the weather conditions are still not there but you can get it damn cheap, the DLC's are top quality and often goes on sale and - on top of all - the devs ENCOURAGE modding and even allow it on official servers! If you download a track and there's someone hosting it you can just go in and play. and this alone should make it worth it to help out rare developers like them still doing it like it used to be back in the golden age of pc gaming.This is opposed to nowaday's trends where devs release broken games, hide essential stuff behind stupid paywalls and when they release DLC's they're often cash grabs.I'm enjoying this game with a G29 + H Shifter and it's a blast, you have tons of hours of gameplay with the carreer only, let alone playing every car on every circuit and downloading the mods to have even more...if you love cars and want to have a realistic simulator just buy it - you'll love it! :)			"

								Great next-gen racing game, forums are fairly active, seen a lot of W.I.P car models (great ones - some old-school from the 90s era, etc).For Keyboard/Mouse users, its a bit hard trying to control oversteering and for low-end PC's might have FPS issues, but overall its well made for a currently what has been a 3 year project and still is in early access and at 0.8 version.

												After prelaunch testing and many many attempts to like the game even past 1.0 I've failed. I don't like the physics, there's much to be desired from the car and track selection, the career felt uninteresting, the suggestion line appears to be static and brakes feel really inconsistant so it's really hard to go a whole race without accidentally understeering straight off the track. And of course it doesn't work with my racing wheel, and configuring a controller may give a lot of options it seems to give too much chance to ruin everything over actual functionality (like letting me configure my race wheel).I know I'm not the best at racing sims but I've spent a lot of time with GT2 as a kid, and Forza 1-4, ontop of many unsatisfying hours of EA's various racing sims. So I'm no noob but I'm nothing special either. I could see this game really being enjoyable for some, the level of customizability on many levels is appealing but for someone like me who wants to play something close to Forza 4 on a PC (seriously Microsoft?) this game just can't fill the void.

As i said game didnt initilize when you went to start race common problem loads of diff things it could be tried em all nothing the games menu and actual game are seperate exe aparently. went to original forums and told rudly they wouldnt help and banned for slandering graphic quality of the game. all in all tried it on my friends pc not even worth it with all the bugs if they dont apeal to community they have now the game will fail good luck.

												This game is a masterpiece considering the dev team size. I won`t lie, I had no idea who Kunos was before buying this game, and I was much more hyped for pCars than for AC. I initially bought AC because I wanted a racing sim to play while pCars was in development. At the moment, I play AC quite more than pCars, even though pCars has some nice features, such as the weather system, night driving, more track options, and stuff like go-karts. I just find that AC does the driving part better, and, in the end, that's what really matters for me. And the replay and photo editor... it blew my mind the first time I tried it. That functionality itself is so complex and well made that it warrants the price of the game. I never write Steam reviews, so I don't know if this'll work, but I'll link a youtube vid that a guy made of a Nordschleife run vs real life using the replay editor. I will keep throwing money at it as long as they produce new content, as it is always top quality. I really suggest the DLC, especially Dreampack 1 as Nordschleife alone will provide you an experience worth the price of the whole DLC package. I bought Dreampack 2 mainly for the cars, and I am satisfied with it. The sound of the BMW M4 makes me want to pick that car over and over again, the attention to details is crazy.Update 1.3 was huge engine-wise, and guess what? It is free. You might think: Well duh, it's an update of ♥♥♥♥ing course it's free! My point is that instead of putting resources into creating DLC which sells for mad dough yo, they invested in the game to add value to it for the players. That convinced me that Kunos is in this for the long run and cares about giving the best experience possible to the players.That's a business model I appreciate, and that's why I will keep buying the freaking DLC.Here are the things I would like to see added to the game:Menu controls on the steering wheel. I didn't investigate far, but it is not customizable through the controller settings.Night driving. You can turn your lights on, but it just looks pretty, it offers nothing else at the moment.Here is my opinion on having a weather system. Rain is cool, it looks good and can be fun to try, but it makes it so hard that I wouldn't use it really often. There is already a lot of combinations of tracks/track conditions/cars that adding rain would not add that much to the game.If you like racing sims or want to try a quality one to see if you enjoy the genre, just buy the damn game, you can't go wrong.9.5/10			"

												This game was a fantastic nightmare at launch. I had a constant stream of problems right from the start it only got worse. Not even being able to launch the game was the least of my problems. Huge framerate and CPU occupancy issues lead to me losing interest in the game. However. Since it's release it has been drasticly improved. The physics, tyre model, sounds and the god forsaken CPU occupancy problems. It has very strong physics and decent force feedback. My only issue is its futureproofness. It doesn't (to me atleast) seem like it's going to last long. Very restricted car selection andnot enough base tracks to make it worth £35. However this is helped a little with mods but most mods aren't worth your time as the physics and sounds won't be woth it. If this was £20 it would be a no brainer. If you are needing a sim game with very good graphics, sounds and solid physics then this would be the one to get but only on a steam sale. 7/10 Recommeneded - as of writing this review but it may go up the further this gets into its life cycle.

												I prefer Assetto Corsa over RaceRoom, very quality content and mod support. Perfect Force Feedback effects compared to many other race-sims. Works very good with G25/G27. Be sure to buy the DLC bundle, it does cost only 5€ / $ more and adds 6 different versions of the Nürburgring Nordschleife + many awesome cars.			"

												I chose this game over Project Cars and many other racing sims. Here's why;Pros:+Graphics are optimized well, you won't have a overheating gpu.+Physics feel great, not so unforgiving like Project Cars but still feels realistic enough.+Mods, this game has a good modding community on it's back.+Price of the game itself and dlcs are fairly low. (If you still don't wanna buy them you can just use mods)+Variety of gameplay style to choose, you can drift, you can do time attacks etc.+Fairly good amount of cars, nothing uninteresting.+Por(N)sches.Cons:-Limited modifications on the cars, you can choose from only 2-3 presets.-Limited tuning, you have limited amount of tuning to do on cars. You can't lock the diff as you like, you can change the tire pressure or some dampening on suspension but that's all. You sometimes want to do those little tweaks. (Only real setback for me)-Low amount of active servers/players compared to console sims. (This might depend where you live)Overall, for me this game is well made. Deserves bit more attention.			"

												March 11th Dream pack and New Review:These Last 2 hours are gonna be agonizing. The anticipation of doing a laser scanned green hell with the rift dk2 is a small dream come true next to really being there. But a dream come true none the less. If you do not own A/C yet then you truly do not know what your missing out on. It's a one of a kind ""True Driver's Sim"" Physics wise it's right up there with iRacing if not better. (Based on opinion) Graphics are to die for as long as the tracks are built correctly. (Some mod tracks do not look the greatest due to sloppy finishing) And the only real downside to the mod community is no way to sort the quality of the mods. So you do have to spend some times searhing for those ""gems"" but completely worth it in the end. And seems the game is still in extremely early release, development will be undergoing for years to come I'm sure, As from what Kunos Simulations has shown us thus far, they are no slouches when it comes to the term ""sim"", they are not afraid to keep the community in the loop, and they are more then willing to keep developing masterpieces of artwork like this pack you see before you as long as we the sim racers keep supporting them. They listen to keedback, always open to suggestion's, and over all the team seem's to be really down to earth and easy to relay problems/ suggestions to. My kind of dev team. And most def my kind of race sim. This has pretty much taken over my iRacing career. And as a 4.70 A class, it would have to be one hell of a sim to pull me away. And it indeed the best driving/racing sim I have played to date. The future Assetto Corsa looks bright and could free at this rate. Would highly reccomend this to anyone who truly enjoy's driving. But be warned. This is not need for speed. This is a sim. Much frustration awaits you, as does much glory and amazment. If the sound or sight of a sports car gets your heart going, or you hear something all lumpy coming around the corner and your guessing what it is before its seen. Often find yourself guessing vehicle makes by headlight's at night? Then this sim is for you. A true enthusiasts sim. Best way to sum it up. I would give it an easy 9.2/10. And once the full version is released and we have all the updfates im sure 10/10 will be no big feat as it's only a few minor issues away.Hope this has been helpful. It's helped kill a half hour here. So that's my review of AC and the dream pack. See you on Green Hell :) Just keep an eye out for the sun glinting off my teeth as there seems to be a perma grin as I await the release :)Keep er shiny side up, Catch you on the track ;-)Doc----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***ORIGINAL POST: Great Game, Highly reccomend it once multiplayer is released. But the AI is absolutly Horrible. Great lines. But they twitch all over the place and dont even recognize that your beside them. They will straight up drive into you like your not even there.***Well now that 1.3 is released it seems flawless and a no brainer. The game is brilliant in every way. By far one of the most if not the most realistic sim yet. The feel of the FFB is absolutly amazing. The track's are flawless right down to the bump. The exterior of the tracks leave something to be desired, but it's purely cosmetic. This Sim mixed with the Oculus Rift DK2 is stunning, the sense of speed is truly insanely accurate. Overall it's a must have for any race fan.The only thing I would have liked to see was customization option's other then paint. Eg. Wheel's, Performance Part's such as turbo's, intake's, injector's, really Full customization would be nice. Including engine swap's. This may not be impossible though, with the open community modding made available by the dev's anything is possible. Litterally.			"

The DLC is almost mandatory, however, modding is well supported and you can download a variety of additional cars and tracks.Overall, this is a great sim, and challenges if not beats many out there in driving realism.

												I guess a person or two doesn't feel the xbox 360 gamepad isn't good for this game.  I disagree.  Plug&Play versus my Logitech Dual Action's tedious & depressing setup/support.  Of course, I didn't really search for any profiles.  But the 360 pad works and plays just like any other driving/racing game for the console, itself.  Fine-tuning only makes it better.  A wheel, such as a Logitech g25/7 is the epitome of connection between reality and virtual reality with this game.I love Assetto Corsa.  May be a bit difficult, seems lacking in content and some will have a harder time achieving visuals close to the screenshots (due to their own lack of technical know-how)...  .      .    .  . ..but this is a true driving SIM.  I have played some online games, but for me, I get all giddy like a kid on xmas, once I have downloaded + added new tracks to play with.  And I just usually play in Practice mode.  Just the simple, pure 'FEEL' of the game and trying to simply, ""drive better"" is an extremely rewarding challenge contained within an exhilierating experience.$50 is a bit steep... but the included mod+map tools, PLUS the massive modding community & purists make up for it.  I have a feeling this sim will have longevity.			"

												Only enjoyable without AI racers. Career mode is not enjoyable at all. I was having trouble winning a race, went online and one of the strategies is to start off slow and gradually speed up your laps so the AI won't be tuned to run so fast. That's a strategy? It actually works too. Pathetic. I guess the multiplayer is good and the tracks and driving models are impressive. I just can't enjoy any sort of story, only driving. It's racing for no reason. I'm not upset that I bought it, but I can't say I would recommend it unless you just want to try some car or track it offers. Maybe some mod or later update will make it better.			"

												Excelent physical simulation and good graphics.However, it lacks content (even with mods, there aren't that many).Sound, while detailed, is a bit of hit and miss (some cars sound really loud while others really muffled).AI is competitive but they just can't handle properly around you. I'm being constantly tail-whipped or rear-slammed as I brake into turns. It's downright frustrating.Unfortunately I cannot recommend it in current state and definitely not for this price tag. Unless you're a hardcore racing sim player and don't mind paying more for less you're better off with Project Cars.			"

												Am i the only one sick of seeing boring track after track after track? What's up with this trend in car games recently...Anywaaaaay...-I bought it to try the oculus with it. Baaad experience, menus require you to constantly take off the VR set, check the weird interface, from inside the car there's this ""glare burn"" effect that makes it awful if the car has a windshield, and overall the experience sucks. It has sooome support, compared to other games, but it's hardly close to fun or good.-Menus are god awful, from the flow of them, the extra clicks that get you nowhere, to how they are setup, it's like they were made by someone who never seen a good UI in their life. I'm sorry if that's harsh, but it's clunky as f**k-Boring selection of cars. Some are great, but they get old really fast. I'll give them credit for having my all time favourite car, the AC Cobra. Didn't have fun with it, but it's ok it's there.....i guess.-Graphics....hmmm. OK. I mean game looks good, but it's the same thing you would expect from this type of game. Put all the detail and shaders in the cars, ignore the background. Flat cardboard trees, and throw some specular on the road so the player is tricked into thinking my gosh, road is shinny at some angle...amaaaaaaaazing.  No it's not guys, so come on, put some personality in these games, i'm not here to really pretend i'm working as a race track pilot, i'm here to enjoy some cars in cool places that i can't pay to rent for the weekend with friends. Remember the good old days of need for speed? Put me on a volcano island man, and let me pretend i'm Jamiroquai for a bit after work.			"

												This ""game"" takes the cake home. If you are a car enthusiast you absolutely have to try this. Don't go in expecting to be a driving god.YOu will spin out, then you will spin out again. Then you will have the most perfect lap of your life. And then you will spend hours trying to recreate that lap and do a few milliseconds faster. It's better played with friends. Set a lap time and let them try to beat it. I haven't played multiplayer, I can't comment on how it works with a mouse and keyboard setup as I only played using a wheel with pedals and gear stick.Let me tell you driving the Mercedes evo DTM around silverstone and miss a gear because you let theclutch a bit too soon will have you cursing at gods and demons in no time. My only gripe with the game is the Carreer AI. It is beyond horrible. you will cry when you are in the last lap and the AI just nudges you a bit sending you spinning at the wall.TL:DR Buy the game if you enjoy driving around a track on your own trying to beat your personal best time. HANDLING IS SOOOOO realistic.			"

												This game is just absolutely amazing! The sheer realism this game brings is immense and for a racing fan like me, this is a dream come true for a game on the PC platform which actually works. The team who made this game only has 30 or so members and they managed to get official licensed manufacturers such as Ferrari, Mclaren and many many more. The past updates such as 1.2 brought a few free cars for the vanilla game including the 2014 Nissan GTR Nismo edition which might I add, is a diamond.The game is quite pricey, but it often goes on sale and even if it doesn't it's worth every penny, (cent if you're in America). The effort this team puts into the game is amazing, I've played it for hours and wanted more so I purchased the Dream Pack 1 DLC which includes the official Nürburgring and of course the Touristenfahrten edition, which is awesome because if you were to go visit the Nürburgring in real life, you'll be driving on the Touristenfahrten version. I've spent countless hours driving on that one track and I've had endless fun. Thank you Kunos for creating such an awesome piece of art.			"

Baaad experience, menus require you to constantly take off the VR set, check the weird interface, from inside the car there's this ""glare burn"" effect that makes it awful if the car has a windshield, and overall the experience sucks. It has sooome support, compared to other games, but it's hardly close to fun or good.-Menus are god awful, from the flow of them, the extra clicks that get you nowhere, to how they are setup, it's like they were made by someone who never seen a good UI in their life. I'm sorry if that's harsh, but it's clunky as f**k-Boring selection of cars. Some are great, but they get old really fast. I'll give them credit for having my all time favourite car, the AC Cobra. Didn't have fun with it, but it's ok it's there.....i guess.-Graphics....hmmm. OK. I mean game looks good, but it's the same thing you would expect from this type of game. Put all the detail and shaders in the cars, ignore the background. Flat cardboard trees, and throw some specular on the road so the player is tricked into thinking my gosh, road is shinny at some angle...amaaaaaaaazing.  No it's not guys, so come on, put some personality in these games, i'm not here to really pretend i'm working as a race track pilot, i'm here to enjoy some cars in cool places that i can't pay to rent for the weekend with friends. Remember the good old days of need for speed? Put me on a volcano island man, and let me pretend i'm Jamiroquai for a bit after work.			"

												Currently I have to not reccomend it. I loved this game when it first came out but currently it fails to load the game, I press start engine and it begins to load in the cars and the track but then right when it looks as if its about to load into the race windows pops up and says that a problem has caused Assetto Corsa to stop working properly and that if they find a solution they will notify me etc etc.... However this is one of the most prestigious in its category and who knows my problem might only be in the unlucky %5			"

												I’ve had this simulator (it’s not a game its so much more) for nearly two years now, having been through majority of its development I can say the Sim has come on leaps and bounds, to an extent that its twice the Sim it was two years ago.Content:The official content is sufficient with not a lot in car selection terms, but they make up with this with the mod support. I will put it this way, at this current stage 3 of the official content cars are mods that were bought, the modding community is dedicated to creating content to the highest quality!Physics:The Sims physics are to the point of ultimate realism, forget project cars etc. there arcade compared to this. from the tires model, to the suspension model everything is down to a T, with perfect torque curves in cars. it’s the best in current market and is constantly being improved.Graphics:This is Assetto's only minor downfall, the game graphics although good, are nothing on par with other games that focus on the graphics engine, but that’s the sacrifice you have to make with an amazing physics engine, albeit the community filters can make the game look better than most other games in my opinion. but with no weather at this current stage it lacks the rain and spray that can make a game look off the wall.Conclusion:In conclusion I love this game, it's almost become my life. I play it at every moment I can and recommend it to everyone I know. if your into anything cars or motorsport. this Sim is worth buying instantly "

												Finally a racing simulator that is both a good simulator with decent racing feel and a functional UI. Now I can stop complaining about racing sims being worse than ages-old Grand Prix Legends. CPU requirements are absurd, though.UPDATE:I didn't play the game for a while because my computer did not have quite enough CPU performance for  it to be smooth to play. Tried it again and updates have done marvels, now the CPU load on the same computer is around 40% so no more problems with CPU requirements either.			"

												This ""game"" takes the cake home. If you are a car enthusiast you absolutely have to try this. Don't go in expecting to be a driving god.YOu will spin out, then you will spin out again. Then you will have the most perfect lap of your life. And then you will spend hours trying to recreate that lap and do a few milliseconds faster. It's better played with friends. Set a lap time and let them try to beat it. I haven't played multiplayer, I can't comment on how it works with a mouse and keyboard setup as I only played using a wheel with pedals and gear stick.Let me tell you driving the Mercedes evo DTM around silverstone and miss a gear because you let theclutch a bit too soon will have you cursing at gods and demons in no time. My only gripe with the game is the Carreer AI. It is beyond horrible. you will cry when you are in the last lap and the AI just nudges you a bit sending you spinning at the wall.TL:DR Buy the game if you enjoy driving around a track on your own trying to beat your personal best time. HANDLING IS SOOOOO realistic.			"

												This game is just absolutely amazing! The sheer realism this game brings is immense and for a racing fan like me, this is a dream come true for a game on the PC platform which actually works. The team who made this game only has 30 or so members and they managed to get official licensed manufacturers such as Ferrari, Mclaren and many many more. The past updates such as 1.2 brought a few free cars for the vanilla game including the 2014 Nissan GTR Nismo edition which might I add, is a diamond.The game is quite pricey, but it often goes on sale and even if it doesn't it's worth every penny, (cent if you're in America). The effort this team puts into the game is amazing, I've played it for hours and wanted more so I purchased the Dream Pack 1 DLC which includes the official Nürburgring and of course the Touristenfahrten edition, which is awesome because if you were to go visit the Nürburgring in real life, you'll be driving on the Touristenfahrten version. I've spent countless hours driving on that one track and I've had endless fun. Thank you Kunos for creating such an awesome piece of art.			"

												      Not bad...not blow your mind amazing but it has its moments. I have a slighty bad experience, I use a controller (cant afford a wheel) and it is hell for the first hour trying to hone your skill but after that I was pretty impressed. I've played forza, gran turismo, dirt...etc you get the point so maybe i put it on a higher pedistal then I should have. After all it is sold and advertised as a raceing sim. I bring this up because there isnt much in the way of objectives or a story of any kind. I mean I wasnt expecting much but you litteraly start out driving a fiat...and thats it, no tutorial of the menu or start out objective...you basicly just manuver around the menu and start your career.       Other then the lack of a game feel, wonky controler feedback, and honestly a little more mediocre graphics then I'd like its not bad. Now beggs the question is it worth the 55 bucks (cuz trust me your gunna want the dlc). No....not really, like i said its not a bad game really its just not really worth the money...it has a pretty empty feeling. 30 bucks I would feel comfortable but right now I feel like I over paid honestly.

												I have been playing Race 07 and all its expansions for years, always looking for a worthy successor. Many challengers have come and go (NFS Shift, the dissaster called GRID Motorsports, and even Simbin's own Raceroom) and Race 07 still remained the best. This is where until Assetto Corsa steps in. I have finally found (after 7+ years!!) a game that consistently surpasses Race 07 as the best racing simulator ever created.Pros:- LAN capable (played on 2 pc's with a ping = 2ms, with each connected to Steam, have not tried offline mode yet)- Road feel and physics- Variety of car types (Ferrari F40 my favorite)- Wheel force-feedback (using a G27)- Track & surface details- Graphics & sound- Eyefinity implementation that includes angle correction- Automatically sets wheel rotation degrees and shifter type (H or paddle) for each car- Modding comunity already adding contentAverage:- AI- LAN server is an external program (easy to use though)Cons:- Only a few tracks- No online leaderboards- Carrer is too simplistic, feels like merely a placeholder- No weather or night- Potential to become a modding mess with additions of varying quality and consistencyMy rig:i5 4670k, R9-290, G27, eyefinity on 3x32inch 1360x768 TV's. Getting 90+ FPS solid with max detail (except for static reflections setting).			"

												I went in hoping this game would be a viable alternative to the likes of Gran Turismo and Forza that I could enjoy on my PC. It wasn't.Yes, the physics is superior to those games, that's what most people say is the main selling point of Assetto Corsa. And as a keen petrol head, I can appreciate that.My beef with the game lies primarily in two places. The first is the disingenuity of the developer, in that this should, in my opinion, be an Early Access title; The game is obviously not finished. Apart from the poor presentation both in terms of graphics and menu layout, on my particular system one cannot alter the game settings, as attempting to do so results in the game crashing everytime, without fail. And considering how stupidly sensitive the steering is on the default settings, that basically makes the game unplayable. The other issue I have with the game is the sheer lack of content compared to GT and Forza. Once you have bought all the DLC for the game which effectively doubles the price of the game, you still only have about fifty or so cars to choose from. I could go down to my local EB Games, pick up a preowned copy of Gran Turismo 6 for ten bucks, dust off my PS3 and have over a thousand cars to play with, and way more tracks to drive them on. Boy, am I happy about Steam's refund policy.			"

								This is no arcade racer, it's a hardcore sim, but thankfully there are plenty of options/assists to help the beginners out there become comfortable with this game. The game has come a long way since first released. The current version as of today is 1.06RC, and is amazing. When I first got the game, I wasn't really into it because of how rough everything was, and lack of gamepad support. The game has become quite polished and easier to navigate and play and now supports a variety of gamepads. I play the game in cockpit view, and frankly is the only way this game should be played. While the game still needs some work(early access after all), it's on the top of my list for racing games.			"

												Firstly if you like arcade racers then turn around there's nothing to see here xDSo many racing games, so many demo's, so what makes this so special??Well I had been wanting a great upto date racing game, and since upgrading to 3 screens it really got me looking, one which could rekindle my racing passions.  After looking at the current racing games available and reading comments i decided Assetto Corsa was the one to try, and thanks to steam summer sales i just have ;)After playing just a short while this game reminds me of some golden moments in my own racing gaming history.The joy i used to get from making it round the track fast playing Ferrari challenge on the dreamcast.Smashing out super fast laps on F1.Playing TOCA on playstation and hearing mates swear & moan just because they thought at high speed the game was wrong, (just after spining out and crashing), the kind of which were boy racers irl and crashed their cars at high speed ! haha! Myself however loved and embraced the steps in some racing games verging towards simultation more than the ""any idiot can drive"" full on arcade feel, some of which are great fun don't get me wrong, but just dont push my button for that connection between man, car, road and realism :(So far Assetto Corsa, even using only an xbox controller seems to deliver and tick those most needed box's :)It has a good amount of feel and feedback, i can only dream of how great it feels if using a decent force feedback wheel.The options and settings seem quite comprehensive and there are some gorgeous graphics to boot.The graphics are so good that at times i'm having to tell myself it's not real ! especially on the replay.The only thing lacking to me is choice of tracks and cars.(which may change in the future)This looks like it just could be the game i was wanting....Obviously I cannot comment yet on changing car setups, or on the feel of wheel force feedback, as not yet in possesion of a T500 rs :DThis will be rectified asap after more game time and when the wife lets me spend £400 on a wheel ^^ , hee hee!Even with the bad taste of lacking tracks and cars to choose from, and using only a controller (very carefully) i can happily recommend this game to anyone looking for a more realistic racer.Get it now, you will enjoy !10/10 will be passed by again !

								Amazing Game, if you are looking for a realistic Driving simulator you won't do better than Assetto Corsa. Although still in development there are plenty of cars and tracks already available, and with the modding community able to create content there will be no shortage of new additions in the future. The cars feel great to drive, very realistic, and using mouse steering with keyboard for acceleration/Brake and gear shift I found that you can drive very accurately even with no driving aids. Its no substitute for a driving wheel but it certainly means a wheel is not 'essential'. The future is bright for Assetto Corsa.Buy it....You will not be disappointed!!			"

												9/14/2015This is a great car and track simulator, the handling feels right, you can feel the road with a wheel (Driving Force GT is what I use) and the graphics on high are amazing. The on-line racing is a blast and you can create some pretty good single player races but the race experience is not there like another game I have reviewed. I love Assetto Corsa and can't wait for the Dreampack 2 to come out and I will buy it.If you want what many consider to be the most realistic simulator out there and you have or intend to get a wheel and pedals then buy this and you will love it for what it is. If you want a good racing simulation with mandatory pits and refuels then look elsewhere but if you just want a real good driving experience and some good races then yes get this.			"

								This is no arcade racer, it's a hardcore sim, but thankfully there are plenty of options/assists to help the beginners out there become comfortable with this game. The game has come a long way since first released. The current version as of today is 1.06RC, and is amazing. When I first got the game, I wasn't really into it because of how rough everything was, and lack of gamepad support. The game has become quite polished and easier to navigate and play and now supports a variety of gamepads. I play the game in cockpit view, and frankly is the only way this game should be played. While the game still needs some work(early access after all), it's on the top of my list for racing games.			"

												I played almost 100 hours and have not even started the career, with a wheel the game feels very realistic and is just a awesome experience. Very fun just doing laps over and over. The multiplayer is a bit buggy and I wasn't too happy that the DLC was $15 so soon but it did contain of the the worlds best tracks and a very long one, that took them quite a bit to make. If you like driving and want a experience that's as close to real life as any game has gotten, this is the one hands down.			"

												Das Spiel ist der letzte rotz. Sicher sieht es gut aus und vielleicht macht es mit Lenkrad auch spaß ABER mit Pad einfach nur beschissenes Fahrverhalten. Insert Coin ist praktisch garnicht vorhanden. Karriere ist ohne einsatz und liebe fürs Spiel entstadnen.  Zuviele Fehler im spiel. Nicht ladende previews der Fahrzeuge im Menu, bei manchen Perspektiven sieht man in den seitenspiegeln nur irgendeine graue Texturwand die einem nicht weiterhilft usw.Zu wenig communitys die das Spiel supporten. Wer darauf steht ne langweilige Karriere oder nur training zu fahren dem kann ich das spiel echt ans Herz legen. Online ist das spiel in Random lobbys nur dann erträglich, wenn man nach dem start die erste Kurve überlebt(Viel Glück). Die erst Kurve ist zu 100% Autoscooter, da die Fahrzeuge nicht rchtg berechnet werden. Wie seiner zeit bei Forza Motorsport3 z.b. fühlt man sich im gerdänge wie der Ball in einem Flipperautomaten. bingbingbing...........pong...bingbingbing Kunoz Simulazizlblablabla hat sich einfach mit so einem projekt übernommen. Das Spiel läuft immernoch auf 32bit was echt ein NoGO in 2015 ist. Das Spiel ist einfach abzocke. Es ist immernoch nicht fertig und trotz versionsnummer 1.1.xxxx und einem bereits erschienen DLC. Ja sicher -_-Also insgesamt keine kaufempfehlung. Egal wie man es dreht das spiel hat euer Geld nicht verdient. Early Access solte man nicht unterstützen. wenn das Spiel doch ernsthaft fertig sein soll dann ist einfach zu wenig content im Spiel.Kunoz Simulazioni EAT MY♥♥♥♥♥♥br> "

												The game, technically, is pretty good. But if you want to play a sim racer online avoid this title...unless of course you enjoy being punted off the road, at turn one, at every race, by people who qualified poorly and dont know what a brake pedal is for. Seriously, once or twice, you don't mind...it's online racing after all. But with Assetto Corsa it's all the time. Seriously ALL THE TIME. It""s rubbish, honestly.			"

												I was so excited about this game until I progressed to N-1 in career. Never before have I needed to play a racing game with stability control enabled. The KTM ( or whatever) still cant make it around the track without oversteering. If you really want a laugh, look at some of the default vehicle setups. I have set up cup cars, road course cars, and I am also ASE certified. I have played every single big name racing sim, and I think by now I should be able to get a baseline setup on a vehicle on an Xbox controller. Not so with this game. Maybe I will come back after I get a real steering wheel, and edit this review.  I can't suggest this game as a racing wheel only game, seeing as I have no experience in that area.6/10Gives me the Rageuninstalled			"

								Amazing Game, if you are looking for a realistic Driving simulator you won't do better than Assetto Corsa. Although still in development there are plenty of cars and tracks already available, and with the modding community able to create content there will be no shortage of new additions in the future. The cars feel great to drive, very realistic, and using mouse steering with keyboard for acceleration/Brake and gear shift I found that you can drive very accurately even with no driving aids. Its no substitute for a driving wheel but it certainly means a wheel is not 'essential'. The future is bright for Assetto Corsa.Buy it....You will not be disappointed!!			"

								Well,I recommend this game only to those who have a wheel, pedals, shifter and a passion for racing simulators.I only have one of the above, and that's the passion for racing simulators... This game is really annoying to try to use a controller with, but luckily the developers have taken a survey from the controller users and are working on improvements, which I am greatly looking forward to. This is a great game and I predict that this will be a must-have for hardcore simulator fans in the future. Considering it is an early access game, the graphics are good but not great, the sounds are very good, the physics are very realistic, and there is a great deal of options and vehicle and track selection.

												Assetto Corsa is currently one of the best racing ""simulations"" available on Steam (PC). It´s realism is not that intense like in iRacing but it also not too easy. It´s different in it´s own way. The car selection is good but a little bit small in comparison to Forza or Gran Turismo. The track selection contains most of the important international racing tracks. By buying the DLC you get also excess to the legendary Nürburgring Nordschleife which I´m driving most of the time in Assetto Corsa. Overall a great experience with a great singleplayer and multiplayer mode. The developers are currently working on more content for the game. So hopefully the selection of cars and tracks grows in future.			"

												Firstly if you like arcade racers then turn around there's nothing to see here xDSo many racing games, so many demo's, so what makes this so special??Well I had been wanting a great upto date racing game, and since upgrading to 3 screens it really got me looking, one which could rekindle my racing passions.  After looking at the current racing games available and reading comments i decided Assetto Corsa was the one to try, and thanks to steam summer sales i just have ;)After playing just a short while this game reminds me of some golden moments in my own racing gaming history.The joy i used to get from making it round the track fast playing Ferrari challenge on the dreamcast.Smashing out super fast laps on F1.Playing TOCA on playstation and hearing mates swear & moan just because they thought at high speed the game was wrong, (just after spining out and crashing), the kind of which were boy racers irl and crashed their cars at high speed ! haha! Myself however loved and embraced the steps in some racing games verging towards simultation more than the ""any idiot can drive"" full on arcade feel, some of which are great fun don't get me wrong, but just dont push my button for that connection between man, car, road and realism :(So far Assetto Corsa, even using only an xbox controller seems to deliver and tick those most needed box's :)It has a good amount of feel and feedback, i can only dream of how great it feels if using a decent force feedback wheel.The options and settings seem quite comprehensive and there are some gorgeous graphics to boot.The graphics are so good that at times i'm having to tell myself it's not real ! especially on the replay.The only thing lacking to me is choice of tracks and cars.(which may change in the future)This looks like it just could be the game i was wanting....Obviously I cannot comment yet on changing car setups, or on the feel of wheel force feedback, as not yet in possesion of a T500 rs :DThis will be rectified asap after more game time and when the wife lets me spend £400 on a wheel ^^ , hee hee!Even with the bad taste of lacking tracks and cars to choose from, and using only a controller (very carefully) i can happily recommend this game to anyone looking for a more realistic racer.Get it now, you will enjoy !10/10 will be passed by again !

AI have a bit of spatial-awareness issues and the online community is still filled with people who think it's funny to neglect proper racing etiqutte and go full speed into the back of everyone in the first corner. The penalty system is also terrible, and causes more problems than it fixes (Follow someone up Eau Rouge and have them go 1mm over the track limits and then have to slow down in front of you. Enjoy the massive pileup that occurs).  Despite these issues, it's a good sim.			"

												This game is a serious sim.If you don't own a streering wheel pass awayIf you are not ok with crashing to the slighest mistake pass awayOn the other hand:If you love sims and nomatter the cost are determined to master the cars in this game in the legendary Nordschleife get itIf you love competitive multiplayer racing with a grown up & serious racers community again get itWtf if you love driving... well I guess you already got it!!!A comparison to the latest big hit Project CARS:- worse graphics- quite few tracks, consider getting the dream pack dlc in order to get access to Nordschleife- less cars but still a few- no realtime weather- no night conditions- some performance issues when many cars are visible (juddering, laggy)+ better multiplayer (pings, servers), pCars does not have dedicated servers, if the host leaves you get a nice application crash (at least I do...)+ quite stable, no crashes whatsoever (pCars has quite a few, hopefully they'll sort them out)-/+ more strict car handling model (depends if you like it or not), you will lose the car by commiting the slightest mistake, when it starts going round there's no turing back!-/+ both games suport T500RS pretty well, no issues so far-/+ I suppose the list above is pointless since you'll get both games anyhow (I've done at least and love them both!)Check out the videos bellow for some hotlaps and races (don't full yourselves, it might seem easy but know that it is the result of ""countless"" failures, crashes and frustration!):

												I was so excited about this game until I progressed to N-1 in career. Never before have I needed to play a racing game with stability control enabled. The KTM ( or whatever) still cant make it around the track without oversteering. If you really want a laugh, look at some of the default vehicle setups. I have set up cup cars, road course cars, and I am also ASE certified. I have played every single big name racing sim, and I think by now I should be able to get a baseline setup on a vehicle on an Xbox controller. Not so with this game. Maybe I will come back after I get a real steering wheel, and edit this review.  I can't suggest this game as a racing wheel only game, seeing as I have no experience in that area.6/10Gives me the Rageuninstalled			"

												I've been playing it for a few hours now. First its more of car simulation compared to other racing games I've played such as for example the CodeMaster F1 and Microsoft Grid series, and so is much more fun & challenging in that respect. I've mostly been driving the old Jim Clarke Type 49 racing car on Mugello which is a nice twisty circuit requiring lots of gear changes. There are many unusual circuits like this as well as Spa with its steep hill and Silverstone circuits, note plural, for example. There are a range of cars to choose from, from old classics and the new generation of supercars. I'm a casual player and  play it in short spurts which I like in trying to improve my track times. I use the pro default settings mostly. One positive for people who don't want a bulky driving wheel the game works very well with the old Xbox 360 controller which can be picked up cheap for the PC. There are lots of settings discussions on the intricate control setup options, and KuBr0 did a nice setup guide for the 360 and X1 controllers. I'd definately recommend it for the hardcore and casual player like me. I bought it in the sale and I regret not picking up the car options pack as well. I'll pick it up in the next sale.			"

												What can I say about this game, from launch it's had amazing car handling physics, I play with a G25 and find the FFB is great straight out of the box, however after tweeking it a little it feels even better, the response you get back through the wheel from the car, what its doing at the front and the rear you can feel it all. The car models and textures are top notch, Kunos show their passion for this game and motor racing in general with the amount of detail they capture with each vehicle, and are constantly updating even the smallest details to ensure authenticity.The graphics are amazing with great performance, and just for example, I'm not running this on a beast of a PC by any means, I have an AMD FX 8350 @ 4.5Ghz and an MSI R9 290 Gaming 4G and I have everything on ultra with smoke on normal and get a solid 60 fps with vsynch turned on, without it I average around the 120fps mark, you're results may vary.The car sounds are so addictive in a way that it should be made illegal, with accurate engine and transmission sounds and exhaust pops and burbling it just adds to the immersion even moreso, and with the most recent Japanese pack and addtion of some iconic turbo charged cars the sounds get even more impressive, take the GT-R Nismo for a spin around the Nordschleife and you'll know what I mean!That brings me to the tracks, they are simply stunning, with laser scanning technology you feel all the bumps and dips, they are all in the right places and they look great even with little time to take in the views, but the offer great opportunities for some lovely screenshots.As for gameplay in general, I've had a few races on single player mode but not for quite a while so I can't really comment on the current state of the AI as I've not tested it.For me this game is all about racing online which is amazing.Now I'm sure many of you know the issues that plague online public lobbies, the 1st corner pile ups, the rearenders, the rammers who knock you off just becuase they can't pass you, and those who just generally want to ruin it for everyone else, well there are a few tools which combat that.Firstly there are servers which run a player minorating system to help combat this, simply if you race on one of these servers and race inappropriately your rating will decrease resulting in you being denied entry to servers running this system, great stuff..!Secondly there is system currently in beta testing but live for public use which arranges races every hour or so which you can register for via an ingame app, attend the race and then afterwards you get a rating and points issued to your profile based on your performance, very similar to another major online only racing simulator, I'm sure you know which one I mean, a quick google and you'll find the details.Lastly that brings me onto what is possibly the best bit about Assetto Corsa, the community.It is amazing and in different areas, now just going back to public online racing.I've been playing racing games on the PC since the mid 90's and I know all too well from when I first ventured online just how bad public online races can be, but within Assetto Corsa even on servers without tools to combat this I've had MANY close clean races with other people, they just simply seem to want to race which is good enough for me.Mods, mods, mods, there are so many quality mods out there it is amazing what the community continually bring forward for this game, cars, tracks, skins, textures and apps and most of these are of a very high quality with some standouts which are a must have, it adds to the game in so many ways, it is amazing.I'll also just add a few comments about the DLC, and this is simply going to be that all Dream Packs and the most recent Japanese Pack are amazing value for money, when compared to what other racing game developers are charging for their add on content, what Kunos offer is such great value for money and in my opinion a must have for anyone who is a sim racer and owns Assetto Corsa.Overall rating for this game 10/10, this is, in my opinion, the best current racing simulator out there..!

												Early Access Review:I crash, nothing happened to my cars. But I crash with styleAfter Release Review:10/10 the best racing sim to date[TL:DR] Jump to the conclusion if you're too lazy to read. At some point I'm brave enough to compare it to its competitor because I have both the game.Seriously, if you guys like to hop in a real racing feel, you wouldn't want to miss this game. Not only does it have the best physics, but the important thing is that the devs who's making this game is very commitment to fix any issue and deliver it at the announced date. The devs deserves more that 40$, so when the DLC is coming, I'll buy it right away. Don't mention about a good range of controller support, good physics, nice drift experience, good modding support, good community, and a nice realistic feedback.This is the first reason why I start buying legit games (not to mention that I was a badass pirate back then :P). Since the very beginning stage of development (I start buying this game in July 2014), they've been dedicated themselves to address the issues, to add new features, and everything they state each 2 weeks. And also on that 2 weeks they had successfully achieved the target. When they needed to add more time to get the target they always announce it to the community that they'll need to extend the development time to implement their target in a good way. Seriously, you won't find easily any devs like this in this era.Maybe the cons is that for some people the graphics aren't really that good. Yes I admit it, but don't compare this game's graphics with pCARS. In terms of graphics, pCARS triumphs over this game, but in terms of replayability, gameplay, feel, and fun, this game is so great that I just♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants. Really. Well maybe not really fun for some people, since it is a simulator, but I can say that the game feel absolutely wins over the competitor.Oh yeah, the other things you might consider that there isn't weather system (like rain. Besides rain, they implemented weather like fog, and clear, that affects the way the track temperature changes) in this game, compared to the competitor, but as a change you'll still get a good gameplay. And there isn't night racing for you. But as I can say again, you'll still get a good gameplay. And the career mode is, well, all I can say is a meh. Then again, you'll still get a good gameplay. And the pit stop, which can only be used in MP. Again, you'll still get a good gameplay. The AI? Not good yet not bad either. At least you can still race against them, unlike its competitor.Conclusion: Grab it as fast as you can. Furthermore if it's on sale. You won't easily find any devs again that is in a real commitment to fix the issue, mend the game, and REALLY care about their community. All I can say is that this is such a masterpiece of next-gen gaming. Some of the racing company have used this game. I don't know exactly which companies, but you can check it on AC FB page. So what are you waiting for?10/10 the best racing simulator to date			"

												Be aware the AI in the game has some issues. AI cars have a set driving line and crash into you with catistraphic results to you but with no harm done to them. They will do pit menuvers and run you off the track just to stay within thier line. There are many other great things about this game but the AI nees some work.There are limeted cars and tracks as well, however this may be resolved in future patchs. I would recommend this game if the AI worked well and there were more cars and tracks. Until those issues are resolved, buyer beware.			"
