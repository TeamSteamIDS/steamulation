What is Baseball Mogul Diamond?Baseball Mogul Diamond is the eighteenth iteration of their baseball simulation game. The first game was released back in the late 1990’s making it one of the oldest commonly available sports simulation management franchises. The game’s focus is squarely on America’s MLB.My Own History with Baseball MogulThere was a time not so long ago where Baseball Mogul was my go to baseball simulation management game. In fact, it was one of the games that I played religiously. Throughout its almost twenty years of existence I have likely spent over several thousand hours playing the various versions. However, there was one time that will make me eternally thankful to Sports Mogul for developing this franchise.Back in the American summer of 2006 I suffered what the doctors classify as a mild stroke. I was living and working in Oregon at the time. My job was super stressful and had me on the road around the clock. By the time of my stroke I had been living out of a suitcase for well over a year. I would work 12-18 hour days and because I was unfamiliar with the area and did not have any family there my job became my life. It came to a point where the only time I would sleep is if I would go out with acquaintances and drink and dance and party. Otherwise I would be working. Given the brain injury – which I ultimately recovered from – I was forced into a position where I had to retrain my brain to think.I’ve always been a person who has been obsessed with the statistics that can be poured with and learned in professional sports. There are few games that are more statistics-based than baseball. There is literally a statistic for absolutely everything. Many of them are highly important and most of them need to be considered in order to ascertain a statistical level of performance by a player. When resting at home following my injury I returned to Baseball Mogul. Again I played the game for hour upon hour, day upon day, for several months. The game was a significant reason why I was able to regain much of my cognitive abilities. The game enabled me to focus on statistics, numbers and the like. These are the things that I had trouble with following my stroke.Baseball Mogul’s Steam DilemmaThe biggest issue that I have with the game on Steam is that this is the latest version on the platform. It is a full season behind. The 2016 edition of the game is not available on Steam. This may be because Valve gets a percentage of every sale through Steam. Sports Mogul, Inc. may want to make as many sales independent of Steam as possible before releasing on the platform. Although this may make sense I don’t believe that they are seeing the bigger picture. Steam players demand the latest and greatest version. OOTP release onto Steam upon release. This places Sports Mogul behind the eightball.  It would be a much wiser decision to eat the percentage that Valve takes and get the dramatic increase in the number of sales from releasing onto Steam.Therefore, I urge Sports Mogul to consider releasing their new games onto Steam as they release. I believe that they will get significantly more overall sales this way and therefore will see an increase in total revenue.A Comparison to Out of the Park BaseballOut of the Park Baseball has become the best-selling baseball simulation management game on the market. It is incredibly in depth and one of the more mentally taxing sim management games on the market. If you get involved with this franchise it can prove to be a complete time sink. To get maximum value you almost have to make a proper commitment to playing it. Everything within the game is designed to be as realistic as humanly possible. This can be of detriment. It is the equivalent of Football Manager for soccer/football. It is because of its depth that I stand by the comments that I made earlier in the year when I stated that this year’s OOTP is the single greatest baseball game that I have ever played. This does not mean that Baseball Mogul is not a quality game or not a viable alternative.Baseball Mogul offers everything that an armchair fan would want in a baseball management sim. It doesn’t go over the top and it isn’t nearly as complex as OOTP. However, offers is a game where trading and formulating the best baseball team that you can matters. It offers history buffs the opportunity to go back to the beginnings of the MLB and to create a dynasty. Therefore, it gives you an opportunity to see what players such as Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, etc. were like throughout their careers.  You’ll also get to experience today’s greats like Mike Trout and Bryce Harper and see where their careers could possibly go. The amount of strategy that the game forces you to make is almost entirely dependent upon the level of difficulty that you choose and that you can easily play entire seasons without changing these settings.Do note, however, that Baseball Mogul Diamond does lack some of the features of real baseball. For example, it does not support a 40-man roster for each team nor does it feature the Rule 5 Draft.Is it Steamified?Unfortunately, this is an area where Baseball Mogul Diamond is lacking. There are no Steam achievements nor are there any trading cards. These are two vital areas that need to be addressed as they can and will spike purchase numbers for the game.VerdictIf Out of the Park Baseball is too complex and you’re looking for a baseball management game that is much more casual and relaxing but no less addictive, then Baseball Mogul may be the game for you. I’d argue that you are better off purchasing the latest game through their website. However, this version of the game is cheaper and may be a good way to get your feet wet in the franchise.For similar reviews and your chance to win great giveaways visit Steamified[www.steamified.com] "

												Fun at first. Kinda has a cheating feel to it. A.I gets double plays 90% of the time while user controlled teams might get 1 double play every 1-2 games regardless of how well you play the stradegy. Not to mention teams feel over/underpowered. I can recommend this game overall but it doesn't feel like it's well layed out.			"
