								be assured this is only local multiplayer, regardless of the misleading tags.  it also seems as if the developers have abandoned it, for there are never updates and all comments seem to go unanswered			"

								This game is awful. The AI literally does nothing. There is no multiplayer, although the game is called ""AI"", a game like this needs multiplayer. Do not buy this game, despite the good reviews. I can only hope this game gets better in the future, it has some potential.			"

								Where are updates ? Game is funny but playable for 10 minutes only. I remember when Gang Beast started, they make update often until the game were playable. Here ? Nothing since almost 9 months until now.			"

								I am a big fan of these silly clumsy beat 'em up party games like Bomb Squad and Gang Beasts. So I have high hopes for Aiball. It's an open market with a lot of interesting opportunities.Right now if you get the game you get what you pay for. The developers make no false promises here, they say that only basic content is accessible. It is even noted as early access. I actually really appreciate that they would price the game reasonably, for $1.99 I have no ill feelings about not being able to do much.In Aiball you control a cute little claymation figure and clumsily try to play soccer. Everything is moveable from the ball, to the flags, to the seats, to even the goals. It was pretty funny dragging goals around. There are three modes with one map each. There is the soccer mode with the map in the screenshots, a king of the hill mode and a sandbox mode.The king of the hill map is a bland (read: everything is grey) mountainside with boxes falling down. I have no idea what to do and it is pretty hard to get up the mountain. The sandbox mode is even more lame with an empty black space with two boxes that can be moved around with crappy physics. Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating. I totally get the game is in early access and I'm sure more will be added later. Just want the users to be aware that the soccer mode is really the only interesting mode at present.There seems to be some keymapping and joystick support which is cool but I cannot figure out how to get additional players to move. So while I recommend the game and its potential I would probably tell users to wait to buy it until additional player controls are sorted out. It was amusing to play alone but would be way more with friends. If I could get the controls working this would be really funny for a group of four friends and definitely worth the $1.99 fee (and maybe more).@Devs, feel free to comment on this review if y'all get the additional character support figured out and I'd be happy to amend this review.

			This game is in Alpha and really there is nothing to do at this stage. This is a short video but shows you all there is to to this game. Steam Link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/490990/		

I dont know where to start. Really.....really...wtf. How are there any positive reviews.My video goes through all that I can see is on offer right now.Graphics are not even close to the stop motion look of the video and screens.Other players do nothing and I can see no AI at work.Gang beats football it certainly is not and I cannot recommend this in its current state "
