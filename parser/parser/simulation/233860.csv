Early Access Review
								I remember when I first got this game, back in summer of '13. I had started out with nothing but the clothes on my back, some cash, and a rusty sword. First thing to do was to find some buddies to help, and so I went to the nearest town. In a tavern I met a short bald man (though we were all bald back then). His name was Dirt, and this was my new best friend. Dirt and I did some pretty bad things then, luring guards to get killed by starving bandits, and then stealing all of the gear. This changed when we both got a little close one fight, and got chased by bandits all the way into the entrance of town. There weren't enough men to hold them all back, so I went into a tavern to see if anyone could help. I found a huge man, named Vedi. Vedi was willing to help for a price, and after paying him he went out there with a rusty sword and killed 3 of the bandits before he passed out from blood loss, effectively saving the town.It was the three of us for a good, long time. We killed many a cannibal and a bandit, and soon enough came upon the idea to make our own outpost, a safe haven to keep us secure and resupply when the going got tough. There was a town nearby, so all we had to do was get a few materials here and there and after a week maybe it would be set. By this time all three of us were pretty decked out, myself having a good long coat, Vedi with a huge cleaver, and Dirt with a tricorn hat. Most cannibals were either afraid of us by this point, or dead, there wasn't much worry of our safety by now. We had almost finished the small base, with Vedi and I working on some some construction, so it was Dirt's turn to go get the materials. We had both finished our construction, and so had waited for Dirt to come back. A day had gone by, we were starting to get worried. By noon the next day, Vedi and I had decided to risk it and leave the base, to go see where Dirt had gone. The next town over must surely know where he went?We didn't even make it halfway across when we found him, laying on the ground. His hat and sword weren't far from him, and there were two dead bandits next to him. Incisions and cuts were all across his body, bones broken and blood everywhere. Vedi cried, I stared for a good long time, before getting his hat and sword. I walked to the nearest bandit encampment, which some members looked wounded, and slaughtered them all with Vedi, after he finally caught up.Time has passed since that day, and the small base we had thought of originally is now a bustling town, with nearly eight residents there, all dressed and ready to defend their home. These people are the best I could have asked for, and I still keep the tricorn hat as a symbol of office, with Vedi forgoeing his cleaver for that sword, as his symbol of guard captain. But as much as I love these people, and would die for them, they will never be that man whom Vedi and I came to know as our best friend.R.I.P. Dirt.10/10			"

								Hour 1: Ugh.. man... this one might be a refundHour 2: Yah... this is silly, running around in a low res desert, wierd glitches, just ain't a good game....Hour 3: I mean.. this is silly, running from more bandits, scrapping stuff...Hour 5: I've got to keep this unit together while they mine, I'll have my auxillaries patrolling,Hour 10: Jeez? It's been a whole RL day of this? This.. wierdly horrible game... wierdly.. amazing...Hour 20: My outpost lives on the edge of the sands and death, traders come now and then, but overall we maintain neutral relationsHour 25: I hope nobody visits me RL today, so that I don't get interrupted as my settlement flourishes in the wastlands.There you go. It's a tough start. It's an ugly start. It's a painful start. But every inch after that is pure glory.  If you ever loved squad based rpg, tactical fighting, (think semi-baldergate-esque) well this takes it and throws in crafting, slavery, factions, squads, crafting, and it looks like a whole lot more in the future. I understand that development has been slow on this game, so if you are not okay with Bugs / Early Access, then hold on for now. There are definitely bugs. Some of them F stuff up. None of them have stopped my constantly growing love/enjoyment of this game.AFAIK there is no story of any sort yet, it's left completely open world, open ended, create your own story.6/10 - Graphics6/10 - Sounds6/10 - UI9/10 - Gameplay10/10 - Replayability			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi is a game where you start off feeling small, incapable, and alone. From the get go, you are basically a nobody; just another face in the crowd, another cog in the machine, another meatbag for the grinder - but it's not what you are, but what you would rather be, and how you get there that makes this game enjoyable. The journey to the ultimate destination of your own choosing is where the fun lies. Will you be a lone trader, looking to accrue the greatest mountain of wealth the post apocalyptic world has ever seen? Or a wandering swordsman who hides their true strength to dispatch armies with relative ease? Perhaps a general at the head of your own personal body guard? Or the mayor of a little tiny village just beyond the next dune? Regardless of what your goal is, it is exactly that - yours.When I started playing Kenshi, the one thing that first struck me was the graphics. Relatively blocky, and a bit funny to look at in some cases, i.e.: buildings clipping in a sand dune, or walls built at unreasonable angles. But, I don't play a game for graphics; to me that's just a secondary benefit. What I'm after is the gameplay, and what I was in store for really put a smile on my face.My character started out in a small town on top of a mountain range. I could see another down off in the distance, and figured that I'd walk there after exploring this little fortress in the sky. Did I mention that the towns are more like fortresses? I didn't? Well, imagine a town surrounded by walls taller that the highest in-game building, with a group of 20 or so very heavily armed and skilled guards for it's protection. That's what constitutes a town in Kenshi. 'Relative' safety, but I'll get to that in a minute.Heading towards the other town, I noticed that a group of bandits had started charging up the hill at me. I thought, ""A group of bandits? Looks like fun, let's try out the combat!"" and to my astonishment, I was obliterated. Beaten to within an inch of death, bleeding out in the beating sun, unconscious. My stomach had taken massive damage, and one of my arms was pretty much useless. I had been surrounded, beaten up, and left for dead. And my assailants? Took off to raid the town. Luckily, the city guard switfly dispatched them, but I was left on the hill. So, fast forward about half an in-game day, and I limp back to town (of course, I looted those bandits that attacked me and left them for dead; take that!). After patching myself up sufficiently, I take to luring bandits to town to enjoy the fighting with the guards and levelling myself up.Now, speaking of levelling up, skills are sorted into multiple sections: dexterity, strength, the various weapon skills, just to name a few. You gain proficiency by performing the tasks. You get stronger by carrying heavy objects around, not by killing a few rats like some other games, but not like there's anything wrong with them. You develop your character through hard work and dedication. Want to become better at running? Take off your heavy equipment and do a few laps. Don't know how to swing your weapon? Engage a training dummy or another person for all that matters. Even your ability to widthstand pain can be increased. How? By losing. That's right, you are rewarded for losing. Those bandits didn't kill you when they had the chance? Sucks to be them, because now not only are you angry, but you're also more accustomed to the pain. The next time you see them, they may well be on the losing side of the fighting. Kenshi rewards you for survival and practice, much like the saying: whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.So back to my little tale to attempt to capture the game a bit more - After fighting a couple of fights with the city guard as backup, I tried luring a group of bandits back to the town only to my surprise - the guards at the gate weren't there. Either they left on a patrol, or were fighting another battle elsewhere, I had no time to check. The bandits were hot on my tail, and the only chance I had of survival was to either lead them away from town, or take refuge and hope to escape while they killed all the civilians. And in that moment, I saw a few brave men - shop guards - rush from the protection of their walls, and stop the bandits in their tracks. A bandit or two slipped by, and I gave chase. Unfortunately while I spent a good while fighting one, the other slayed an innocent civilian, and I was happy to see that the population count in the town had actually dropped. Protecting the towns actually has an incentive - no population = no trading. The bandits dispatched, the guards returned, and I resigned to head off towards that other town in the distance.Now, as I could see the town, it didn't seem far. Plus, I had enough gold to recruit a new person to my little gang of righteous corpse theives. With some new equipment, a little bit of extra knowledge of how the world works and a new companion, I set out for the town. I travelled for at least two in game days. Two. I saw the sun rise, and set, then rise and set again. Such is the scale of Kenshi - the world is an open sandbox (quite literally at this point - no grass, just sand and rocks), and things that look far off in the distance are far off. And as I mentioned before, zooming out - I became a speck in the desert. The only that that kept my position known was the damn name tag floating above my head.Kenshi may not be a game for everybody, but if you enjoy a bit of realism, and quite a bit of freedom, it may be worth it. It's still early access, which means that there are quite a lot of glitches, issues, bugs and crashes (I haven't encountered anything severe however), you may want to pass the game until it's more stable and developed decendant comes about. What appeals to me the most is actually two things: one, you are rewarded for winning, and are rewarded for trying. So long as you aren't dead, the game isn't over. It makes for one heck of a story if you keep little notes about what happens to your character when you play. The second thing is the scale and immersion of the game. Beyond the glitches sometimes breaking the immersion, I actually felt like a lone survivor in a desolate world, where people preyed upon the weak, and civilization may take days to reach on foot. Since I just recently bought the game, I can't say much about the developer, except that from reading what their vision is, it really is a grand one and has a lot of potential. Kenshi has lots of potential, but it also has lots of work left to be done. So pass it if you're looking for a more fleshed out game, but definitely get it if anything in this review has a major appeal to you. As for me, I'll be wandering the desert with my small group of companions trying to make a living in a world where death can come from even a small group of ill-trained, ill-equipped people. Afterall, you may know how to fight, but if a knife cuts you, you'll still bleed.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi. Where do I start. It's about how the game feels when you start it for the first time. This is a game in development and somehow I just love it. When it's done, how I interpret it and see it, it is the ultimate RPG game. In a rich and huge (can't underline, but I would) world, filled with cities in biodomes and people, trees, water, dirt... In this world you can become a trader, a looter, a scavanger, but you can also found your own town, find new people for the party (very large parties) and become a power of your own. This sandbox RPG does sound a little too good to be true, but I don't know, it already delivers a lot and I recommend you come and see for yourself. Me and a lot of others are already enjoying Kenshi. I can recommend this game to people who also like traditional RPG's, but also RPG's like Fable for instance (there are characters, they grow, and there are factions, you are one), people who liked building the village in Assassins Creed 3, people who like minecraft (the playthrough is what you make of it), even people who like Settlers or even Age of Empires! I recommend this game basicly to everyone who plays other games then Call of Duty, as long as you can live with early-access situations in which you play a bêta or even alpha of the end result though. But getting it now if you're interested does save you money in the (very) long run.There are factions that all have their own diplomatic stances towards you and eachother, there are bandits raiding unprotected people. You can do whatever you want. So if you want your faction (you are your own faction) to become powerfull, train your party and have an army. If you want to become a trader, train them strong so they can pack a lot of stuff, if you want your own city... start building! The characters do not level up as is tradition, you train each skill by training that skill specifically by doing things that require the skill. Which according to me works. The game is really hard, especially at the start. You start with almost nothing and you have to struggle for survival. I usually start with luring bandits to patrols and towns to get them to fight (and die) to then pick their bodies clean like a damned vulture. Sell their stuff at a merchant, buy new equipment, repeat, get a teammate or two and start to choose a place to settle down.I played the game for the last time at version 0.62 and I have to say: it was an improvement over 0.50. It still feels the same (unpolished, cheap), but with the added notifications of approaching bandits, audio signals when under attack, female characters and at least some means of negociating with bandits I can only say: good work the last few months! Hair looks great, bodies look good, the rack on one of my partymembers is really too big, but looks good (not trying to be a sexist here, pointing out a detail) even beneath armor. I just wish someone would come to my stores to buy my goods, I don't want to walk to towns to sell them anymore ;)I again had a good time, so I'm sticking with the good review.The thing is though that you do have to create your own adventures and the world isn't alive enough yet to fully appreciate this. However, after playing with the same guys for over 30hrs, having built a town, having been in quite some sticky situations... my party did kind of grow on me. With the latest patches I did miss some of the buildings to build, but it was a step forward and I enjoyed myself.Kenshi began for me when I read about it in March 2013 (who knows how long development will take), and read about a game about a man with a sword (the title translates into the swordsman, I believe) in a world. And he can do whatever he wants. The world is still empty, but it's more of a playable techdemo. In the end it will be a beautifull world, the graphics already are worth showing. So I tried it, lost a few hours immediatly. Later I found it again on Steam and decided to buy it.A part of the experience now is that you are able to see a game being developed by a very small team. As I learned through the fora it was being made by one man. Just one man, this sounded like the late 80's and early 90's and I loved it. And by being able to sell this on Steam he made enough money to hire people and it is becoming very nice. The money is really being put to good use!!! I have checked out the roadmap and the website and trust me, this game is good and will be better sooner then I might have expected.Besides this curious development by first one man, I have never seen this much fan-made artwork for any game of this magnitude, and the game hasn't even been finished yet! There already is a lot of content available ingame, some maybe replaced and a lot more will come, but I wouldn't worry about the amount of game you're buying. Especially if you find this game on a sale and you're into sandbox games, I would go for it! I'm not even an RPG fan, but I did go for it and I'm happy I did.Usually with playtesting a game, there is room for feedback. There is no room for that here, the developer is too small to answer. The fora are spread over several locations and the information freely available may be confusing. But the price goes up as it's being patched towards a release candidate so spend the little the game costs now and join the ride. It's going to pick up speed very soon, everything looks promissing. With every patch the game is one step further, and you can actually feel it. There is a demo available on the website of the game, or you can download the torrent (you'll get the demo, nothing illegal herI've seen the development go slowly at first, many patches but all small ones. Then after the steam-release the hiring of people and the patching slowed down a bit. Now there are 6 people working on this game and I'm all psyched again!!! I can't wait to start another playthrough! But I'm waiting for the next patch, it has been due for a while now and they promissed a big one. I will amend this review when I've picked it up again. My last play was in februari and a lot has improved. Also a new gameworld is announced, ingame animals and more. Even though they may still take a while to implement, these implementations would require a amendment to the review as well.			"

								I just would like to make a few changes to my old review: -So this is my review for Kenshi. I have played 74 hours(57 hours before) and I can say that right now, there is a lot of new content (and old content improved) that really cheered me up to keep playing, such as new races, new mechanics & skils (assassination, martial arts, dodge, swimming), new interactions with factions and creatures, new weapons and some VERY OP BEAKY CREATURES OMG SO BROKEN DKLGIAHOJKRHIDWGCHF. The point of this update in my review is to reinstate that Kenshi is a really good game worth buying, as it moves away from the boring and plain view and tries to be something unique. These updates also prove that Kenshi is alive and going just fine.-Slow development CAN'T be used as a negative trait, because Kenshi producers are not a big company like Ubisoft or EA, in fact they're only 6 ! (here's proof http://lofigames.com/about/about-us/ )Also, if you think that a game this creative and complex can be easily made, programming is not as easy as you think.TL;DR-If you want to buy Kenshi now: You'll have a lot of well spent hours after you get the hang of it, for that you could look on the game's wiki or/and watch some videos on youtube.-If you want to buy a full game: Wait patiently. They are working really hard and I'm sure that it will have enough content for you in the next updatesOh, I almost forgot, you can download a demo on kenshi's website. I don't know how much content is there, but it's probably enough to convince you into buying (or not).			"

Early Access Review
								So after playing Kenshi for about 50 hours with a few playthroughs I thought it would be time to write a review.  Kenshi is mainly a openworld RPG with a bit of base building and strategy, as listed in the tags for the game.  The character customizations go way in depth.  Everything from eyes to hair, to the length of you arms and legs.  I've seen some messed up people on the screenshots and just about laughed myself off my chair.  The fighting is amazing.  It's realistic.  You try taking on a group of raiders 1v7 and you WILL lose if you haven't trained your person to be a great fighter.  You can hire others, or go at it alone.  The amount of things you can do now, is awesome.  Anything from wandering around from city to city or building a home for you and your allies.  Keep in mind, the game is in Early Access so there are plenty of bugs and random glitches.  Things like out of this world rag-doll, people being stuck inside of each other (kinda funny at first, but can be a pain) and raiders spawning inside of your base.  I have a little list I made that I write down everything and with this last update, a few of the things were fixed.  I'm glad to see this game still being worked on and I can't wait to see this game fully built.  I will keep playing this for a long time to come and I'll keep updating the review.As always,  keep on gaming!EDIT:  I forgot to say anything about crashes.  This game does crash with me.  I do also get the ""Super Crash"" every 5 hours or so.  Playing the game for long amounts does trigger this and I hear that a number of things can also cause it to crash.  Save everytime you do something that is major like buliding a town, buying a bit of really good armor, or even when you're on the move.   I also have read a few reviews and I have noticed something.  The game starts you out as a normal person.  You are not all powerful, Dragonborn, The Arison, or somone else who matters.  You start out with almost nothing.  You pick a fight early on, and will be killed.NEWEST EDIT:  I wrote that review at about 50 hours into the game, several months ago.  I figure its time to update it after no having 200+.  The dev have been pushing updates and fixes out at a nice rate. So in other words, this game isn't dead.  A lot has changed since I first played this game.  There's a new race to play as, more starting stories, animals.   The list goes on.  That's the plus side of this new edit.  Downside includes coming across new glitches and crashing games.  Kenshi isn't as stable as it was a few months ago.  In fact, I've had the game crash about 3 times in a little over an hour.  The Devs are working on this, and I'm hopeful for this game and it's future.  OVERALL RATING AS OF 1/2/2016Still a good game, with it's problems.  Research the game before you buy, But keep an eye on this one if you don't get it now.   7.5/10			"

Early Access Review
								I'm going to state my opinion straight out so you understand where my reviews coming from before reading it... I already love this game. I find it challenging, immersive and immensely satisfying. I can't wait for more content even though I think what's currently there makes it a worthwhile experience for the price tag, any game that can have me put 45 hours in without even realizing it is going to be worth twenty-ish dollars in my book. Also, this game is absolutely not for everyone. That can not be stressed enough, if you don't like struggling in the beginning of a game you probably won't make it very far, it can be tough as nails if you aren't careful and even if you are you'll probably end up suffering through a few coma's in the early section while you're trying to make your character not useless. There, now that that's out of the way let's talk about the actual game.The gameplay is kind of a mix between a diablo-style dungeon crawler and an RTS. Every character has their own stats that can be levelled up through using them, every character can be as strong if not stronger than your starting character. In fact the only real difference between them and your starting character is that you didn't start with them. The movement and combat are fairly basic, there's not much in the form of tactics yet. Other than ganging up on specific units and some limited flanking ability you can't control much more than who attacks who. The path finding can sometimes trip up in the more hectic battles (more on that later) but it is early access and that stuff is being ironed out.The RTS elements shine through a bit more in the base building aspects, you build preset layouts for houses and fill them with various different things like work benches, beds or storage for materials. So far there's farming and resource mining as well as some crafting for weapons, armour and clothing. This will be a lot more balanced when things like hunger get implemented, right now there's not much to point to a farm other than making money and there isn't much to spend the money on other than materials and blueprints for items. You can also build defensive walls with gates and mounted crossbows for defense (and you'll need them, believe me) but these things can trip up the pathfinding again (still more on that later). Considering how unbalanced the economy currently is it still took me a while to get a base I was satisfied with and I enjoyed building it. It's only getting better as well.The world is both great and not so great all at once. I found myself heavily immersed in the world, I love the style and the sense that you're picking through the bones of an advanced civilization that's been long ruined, the atmosphere is just fantastic. The aesthetic is my kind of thing with obvious asian influences and you can really feel isolated and threatened in the early goings until you have a decent squad, then you feel like you're a match for the world and that's a really satisfying moment. However... as much as I love the feeling of the world, sometimes it can feel really empty. Yes, it's a wasteland and it's meant to feel that way, but if that's not your kind of thing it will really turn you off. I feel like the addition of small bandit camps to go along with the roaving bands and some oasis-like areas where more plants grow would really do a lot to help that. There's also some work happening on adding creatures to the world and I think that will do wonders for this particular problem. My bar for a well done isolated setting is set really high to be fair, once you play S.T.A.L.K.E.R: shadows of chernobyl it's hard to settle for anything less. The fact I'm even willing to compare the two is very telling about just how great the atmosphere is here.Now, on to the bugs (disclaimer: I haven't played for a while so some of these may have been fixed since my last session, I'll explain in a bit). You get to hear about the pathfinding which is my main issue. It's kind of broken. It's serviceable for the most part, they can manage to traverse long distances and only rarely do they get stuck, however they still get stuck and that's pretty annoying. I use the ""bodyguard"" command to make sure my squad moves at the same speed (an option to just make them do that would be nice) but the pathfinding for that is far worse than the regular stuff, they match speed and stay at the same relative position to the character they're guarding and don't realize if they're about to walk into a wall, this is where they most often get stuck because for some strange reason edges like to grab hold of characters and they get stuck in the ground. Also, I've never had them defend anything while under the bodyguard command. Frequent quick-saves make this a mild irritation at worst and if you ever get really stuck and haven't saved for a while there's an option in the menu to pick up and drop all your characters on the center of your camera to unstick them, but it's still a bug and it needs to be mentioned. The other issues with it are also minor, in a big fight sometimes units can get confused about what they should do and end up standing around with their finger in their nose while their buddy is fighting three bad guys at once but they eventually get it together. The last issue I have is that closing the gates breaks the pathfinding when your units are outside, if you close the gate no matter how far away they are or where you tell them to move they will turn around about half the time and walk back to the gate to maually open it. It can be really frustrating but the only time you need the gate closed is when bandits are attacking and they give you advance warning so it can be pretty easily circumvented.Aside from the pathfinding there's an odd (yet hilarious) bug with picking up and putting down characters, if you do it on the ground they pop up into the sky and get sent flying. They only stop if they hit a mountain or you use taht un-sticking method I previously mentioned. Again, it's just a minor annoyance and it doesn't happen if you put them in a bed or jail cell which is where you should be taking them anyway, but if you get attacked you can't put down whoever you're carrying and you run the risk of getting knocked out yourself.This is less a bug and more of a flaw with the system itself, and it's also the main reason I haven't played in a while. There's a serious memory issue, the game runs on a 32-bit engine and it doesn't have a high enough memory limit for extended play. I'm not sure if everyone has this problem but I can only play for about ten minutes at a time now, it's progressively gotten worse the bigger my base got and the more people I had control of. It used to take a number of hours to crash on me. This could be my fault, I haven't exhausted every troubleshooting option yet, but all the same it's an issue that needs to be addressed. There's also talk of transferring to a 64-bit system which would probably eliminate the issue, but as of my last play session it wasn't implemented and I can only talk about my experience.TL;DR, this game is an extremely rewarding and challenging experience if you're willing to stick through it and are a fan of post-apocalyptic worlds or deserts in general. If not, there's very little in it for you. The early game is pretty slow and it relies on you enjoying the world around you more than the gameplay, afterwards they both work together and that's when the game shines. If you can't handle crashes or potenitally broken AI then hold off on your purchase but definitely keep an eye on this, when all the issues are ironed out this game will be phenomenal. If you don't mind crashes or other early access problems then this game is worth the money as-is and will only get better with time.			"

Early Access Review
								Not many games get this type of attention from me. even in Alpha ( when i wrote this review ) this game is awesome. it has quickly taken over as my favorite game right now besides Civ V, KSP and Planet Explorers.Kenshi will be awesome once its done. wait even not finished its still awesome.two paws up for this game.Edit 2/13/2014Females are in the game at last! New factions, Gameplay, diplomacy, bandit raids, Cannibals or as also known ""Bacon Cultists"" With more coming soon. and a new AI being worked on for those pesky super crashes and pathing issues.The game music is moving an wonderful, first game ever where i did not mute the music while playing the game. or kill sound effects along with it. It adds just the right amount of mood to the game.Why buy the game? Well for one its not like any other game you have played before. its a original and still developing and after each core update it gets better with more items added to expand your gaming experience. A original RTS, sandbox game. If your tired of starting a game where you can go out and kill people in one hit from the start! Then this is your game. It will challenge you, you have to fight to survive, living long enough to train yourself from a nobody whom everyone could beat up, to a legendary Hero or Heroine depending on your Gender. It is not a quick game, there is no ending, It is moddable even in its current state.Why not to buy this game?It is Alpha Stage Development game. If you don't like dealing with bugs, core game play content thats not added yet, then this game is not for you. The game is not complete, so do not buy the game thinking it is. Some bugs (depending on the computer) can render the game unplayable for a short while. If you're still interested in the game, then wait and watch. Come back in a year ( From this rewrite posting  2-13-2014 ) then give it a try. Until then pass it up and leave it on your wish listEdit 6/11/2014Would like to add a useful page to visit for those reading reviews.Useful Information and links For KenshiIncluded is a link to the Demo.A report on the super crash thats in the game. it is being worked on to be corrected, that update should be out in 2 weeks or less ( from when i edited this post ) barring any problems. The prospecting thats now in the game is  very good, with a high science skill you can easily find hotspots to build your bases. no more turtling up in one spot. The NPC squad slider was adjusted down, ( From 4x to 2x ) for everyone put it at max then complained their FPS went to He** double hockey stick.Total time the Dev has said it would take to complete the game. he is shooting for the end of 2014, but its possible it will actually be some time late in 2015. personally i think it will be late 2015 mostly because there is still a lot more to be added. but we will see once the 64bit Conversion and new pathing Engine are added.Edit 12/25/2014Version 0.70.x is now in the beta testing stage before public release. it was released early and full of game killing bugs, which have been ironed out to a point. so should be ready for public release soon.We now have animals, Leviathans, Pack Gar's, Dog things, and beak things. new factions though the actual people in them are not in yet.Prisoner Cages are back in police stations, though been having issues with those.The Memory Leak is gone. though the game is running rather rough at the moment due to it being released too early. but things should smooth out soon and look much better once Directx 11 is added.We still have the 1 biom but that won't change anytime soon.Bandits no longer attack you on sight but now chase after you tossing insults and if you just keep running they eventually stop, leaving you to your own shenanigans.Multi levels to buildings has been added, and looks like the GUI will be redone soon. no more badly fitting text or buttons will be coming with that, plus the squad sizes are supposed to be increased in a couple updates from now.At the time of this edit, v0.70.x is only open to beta testing opt in. so things will change once its released to the general public.General Info.I am one of the Admin for the Kenshi Forums, the other is Gmat.I write this review based on me being a regular gamer like everyone else. I personally think this is a great game and just getting better, but i also know its not for everyone.There is a lot of links and information in the forums, including a link to a Demo ( link added on 6/11/2014 )I can not stress enough to try the demo first before buying.

								If you wanted to be a samurai or something else, kenshi is your thing. You can create your own story, manage your squad, build your city and so fort. Kenshi is an open world sandbox game the map/world will grow with next updates but even now, it's still ""big"". It's of course currently in alpha stage so you have to wait for updates but, you can still enjoy the whole game until it's grow up. There are people with over 700+ hours gameplay currently so you can spend many times in it.I highly recommend this game those who also enjoyed games like Mount&Blade. But you should consider it's still alpha and there are bugs in this game. And please watch some gameplay videos before so you can see how is it.			"

								edit: this review is very out of dateBought this during the summer sale not really knowing what to expect and was totally taken by surprise. Even though the game is in an Alpha state, it feels very well put together with features such as mining, farming, and research. It took me a couple hours to get the basics down, and a couple more to get over the fact that my puny characters could be bested by even the lowliest bandit, but one I got a feel for the gameplay I haven't looked back. Definitely one of the more interesting games I have played in a while. It was developed by ONE dude. That is damn impressive.Some tips for starters:- Research mining before farming (trust me, mining pays for itself)- Make sure you have a guy or two living in town in case your group gets ambushed and overwhelmed.- Lead bandits to a city, let guards kill bandits, loot corpses, profit			"

								I wish I hadn't spent $20 on this. Months ago, before I uninstalled this game, the developer was only putting out new content patches instead of fixing bugs which have been present since I purchased the game in Jan. 2013 (according to the forums there's still pathing problems with buildings, it's not getting fixed any time soon). Dare to bring this up in the forums, or any other criticizm for that matter, and a legion of fanboys will troll and drown your complaints out regardless of how you present them. The excuse that the game is in the alpha stage is used quite liberally, as these bugs go unaddressed most updates. And even when bugs are addressed the game developer takes a tone announcing it as though it's a waste of his time and he doesn't really want to do it. In fact, the new content and features updates seem to compound bugs which go unaddressed. I could maybe forgive this, if  the game were entertaining. But it's not, it's just miserably tedious and boring. The combat is slow and pointless, as you watch twenty men surround one for each to take turns swinging one weapon at a time at the target. Once you tire of that, spend hours on end standing around, researching new technologies to craft buildings and weapons and armor and other stuff all to... go out and watch twenty men surround one for each to take turns swining one weapon at a time. I highly recommend this game - to be removed and for everyone who purchased it to get a refund. Side Note:Oh, and the forum moderator is either a paid troll for the game developer or a rabid dweeb trying to get in on the ground floor of what he percieves to be another game sensation like WoW. Either way, eventually anyone who speaks ill of the game gets their thread locked and buried. To me, that's the most frustrating part of the game; you can't even bring up a reasonable grievance against it, let alone warn others away. I hope this review gets around that hurdle.			"

 This game is in Early Access.  It is NOT finished.  Anything I say may, and most likely will, be changed as development continues. MANY OF THE BUGS I LISTED WITHIN THE CONS HAVE BEEN PATCHED.  DO NOT LET THE ONES I LISTED RUIN THIS GAME FOR YOU, THEY TEND TO BE QUITE RARE.  EVEN WITH THEM THIS GAME IS STILL AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND WAS VERY ENJOYABLE.*TL;DR at the bottom of this review* Kenshi.  This game is brutal.  I seriously had more moments in this game where I wanted to yell at it for being so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard, yet if you look on my profile it's currently marked as my favorite game.  The reasoning behind that is simple, this game offers 0 in the way of hand holding.  If you want a good, long, tutorial that explains every single detail to you in a nice format then Kenshi is not your game.  Wiki?  Don't bother, honestly it kinda ruins the fun of this game.  Kenshi is one of the few games where I can say that I never watched a single tutorial, and yet I felt like by 40 hours I knew some pretty advance things in the way of base building and combat tatics.  This game will suck you in, it'll FORCE you to learn the game.  You'll change your tatics, your starting locations, your ordering in what you need, the way you simply play the game will evolve as you learn, as the game makes you learn.  I loved it.  Every second of it.  Even when I wanted to scream at my computer, I still couldn't help but love this game for what it is.  With that said, pro's and con's time.Pros- The devs care.  If you EVER run into an issue within the game, you can post in the discussions and I bet you $100 that atleast one of the admins or mods will respond.- Many different playstyles.  This game can be an RTS, a squad based rp, a city builder, it can be so, so much.- Landscape is amazing, and the next update will overhaul this.  The biomes, textures, and pretty much everything about the look of this game is pretty amazing.- Combat system is nice, isn't perfect, but it's very nice none the less.- Medical system is also really cool.  Got hit in the leg?  You're limping your way back to town now, bud.- Base building is some of the best i've seen.  The job system and resouce refining is overall very good for its current state.  It has some issues, but that'll be seen in the cons.- Trading system is simple and works, though I found a few exploits- Farming system is simple but very effective, some bugs will be disscussed in cons- Factions are pretty diverse in armor, items, etc.  Cannibals are really fun, some issues with factions in the cons.- Smithing and crafting are really simple but work pretty well.  Could be more complex or diffucult, but it's still fun.- Training system, once again, very simple.  Not much could be improved here, it works very well and theres not a whole bunch you can do to change it.Cons- Medical system is lacking.  It's way more simple than I think it should be.- Combat can get boring very quickly as it's more stat based than anything else.- There are items within the game that are simply better than any other item.  I remember at one point samuri armor or whatever it was called was simply the best you could get.  For me this kinda ruined the feel of being able to have so many different build paths, each to their own.  Be super slow but super tanky, be super fast with TONS of damage, but super squishy, etc.- Floating trees, enemies not spawning, falling through world.  These are somewhat rare bugs, but they do happen.  Remember, it's an early access game.- Combat system is buggy in some cases.  Weapons can hit or miss when they don't appear they did, sometimes your character appears to have his/her weapon equiped but...doesn't use it?... It's like the models there but the hitboxes arn't?  Wierd.- Base building.  99% of my bugs are here. I'll be making a list for this one. 1.- Sometimes you can place a wall down, and even though it allowed you to place it your units simply cannot reach it to build.  2.- There was an old bug where building the tier 3 walls would crash you game if you placed many of them at once. 3.- Some gates, when placed, would never lock/unlock.  You could never open them or close them. 4.- Some buildings can be built on slight hills, and yet it'll let you build it while your units cannot get into them 5.- Some buildings, once built, would be unable to open or go up the stairs.THERE ARE MANY BUGS, I AM SIMPLY LISTING THE MAJOR ONES THAT KINDA RUINED THE GAME FOR ME DURING BASE BUILDING.  REMEMBER, MOST OF THE GAMEBREAKING BUGS ARE RARE AND WILL MOST LIKELY ONLY HAPPEN TO YOU ONCE OR TWICE, NOTHING A QUICK LOAD BACK TO A CHECKPOINT FROM 5 MINUTES AGO WON'T FIX.TL;DRThis game is great.  It's hard as steel to learn, but amazingly fun once you do.  You will not suceed on your first try, nor your second or third.  It'll take time, but once you do it is AMAZING.  I reccommend this game to anyone who is willing to put up with a few bugs for an RTS, Squad-based RP, City Builder game, all meshed into one.For an Early Access game, I would recommend you pick it up.  You will not be dissappointed. "

Early Access Review
								This is the game I’ve been looking for!The following is coming from a total noob, that hasn’t researched the game whatsoever. This is 5 hours of gameplay.Day 1. I create a female wanderer, and I run around town, in and out of buildings looking for something to do. (20 minutes later I’m thinking, what’s the point in this?) Day 2. It’s time to leave this town, and venture out across the wasteland, this town sucks. I travel at night, with 900 credits (cats) and a loaf of dry bread, and bare feet. I decide to erect a small shack in the desert, and after doing so, I realise I’ve build a useless unfinished concrete structure, with steel reinforcing jutting out all over the place. I move on towards the next town, leaving the unfinished building to ruin.Day 3. I arrive early morning to a group of people killing dogs, just outside the town’s entrance. I avoid the people, and try looting a dog’s corpse. I get nothing. Once again, I move from building to building, finding nothing other than a few people offering their services for 700 cats. I decide to hang onto my 900 for now. I find a dummy in one building and decide to hit it, soon realising this is the way to raise my attack points. I do this until I’m at level 5.Day 4. I’m a hard ♥♥♥, now I’m level 5. It’s time to venture out into the wilderness again to kick a group of dude’s brains in! I run out into the desert and soon see a gang in the distance. They spot me and shout “get the prick”. I decide to run instead. They’re faster than me, and soon catch up. They kick my ♥♥♥ bad. Breaking my left leg, stabbing me in the stomach and putting me in a coma, they leave me for dead face down in the sand, in my underwear. Day 5. Is spent in a comaDay 6. I drag my broken leg, limping back to the town.Day 7. I can’t do this alone, and decided to spend 700 cats on hiring a girl in the local bar, to join me. She heals me, but I’m still limping bad, so I find a bed nearby and pay 100 cats to bed down for a while and heal.Day 8. An outside gang try entering the town, and the fighting kicks off! I’m recovering in bed, but the girl runs outside, looting as many corpses as possible. She puts some of the armour on, gets instantly attacked and hobbles to the bed next to me, to recover.Day 8. The fighting is still going on outside, and it’s escalated into gang warfare. Both fully recovered, we ditch the gangs’ outfits (so we don’t get our heads kicked in again!) and begin looting and selling. We decide to hire another member to our gang, and turn him into a tank of a man, (with a hunchback). Together we loot every corpse and finally raise around 15k cats. Day 9. After some serious dummy training and some more members, it’ll be time to head out of this town again, and back to the shack I began on day 1. We’ll try and get the building completed with a working generator, build a few mines and see what happens next. To summarise:Yeah it’s in development still, and it’s got bugs, but it’s totally playable and worth every penny.The developers seem to working hard on updates and deserve  support & money on this great little gem.

								UPDATE:I did not realize this review would get so many votes. This review as of now is quite outdated, but I have not redownloaded this game to test the new contents. The devs seem to be updating the game quite frequently, so take it as you will.HOWEVER, DO KEEP IN MIND THIS GAME WAS INITIALLY RELEASED ON EARLY ACCESS OUTSIDE OF STEAM ON SEPTEMBER 2009. This game does not play like an old school RPG game that was made in 2015. It feels like a 2009 game with some graphical updates. You will probably never see this game released in your lifetime. At least, not with the complete functionalities that were promised.-----------------I can't believe how many positive reviews there are for this game. Yes, the game has potential. Yes, the game is in alpha, and therefore can be judged based on the potential, but this is a game that has been in development for an incredibly long amount of time without significant updates. I even retried the game today to see if there were updates added. Sure, the game is an open world, but there is still not much to do in the game. Dialogues are sparse and uselss at best, Combat is clunky, the UI is horrendous, pathing is bizarre and unexpected. Even building a city and grabbing a squad of your own feels tedious rather than fun. Character models are ugly, and though the devs are going to be coming out with a new GUI soon according to their announcements, it does not appear to be a significant upgrade from the current system. Landscapes and cities look great at times, but not enough to actually immerse you into the game.The game itself is challenging, but not in a particularly fun way. Yes, everyone is stronger than you, yes, the game makes you work your way up in the game, but by the time you do, you've inevitably lost interest in the game, or it has crashed on you about a dozen times. It's a game that I really want to like as I enjoy open-world, sandbox RPGs, but there is simply nothing to do other than wander around, get pummeled, wait to be rescued or recover, and repeat process. Avoid this game until it leaves Early Access, if it ever leaves early access. The game does have a strong (almost fanatic) fan-base, and the devs do listen to their fans, but the development is so slow, it makes almost no difference whether they do or not. And most negative reviews, whether warranted or not, will get torn apart by this crazed fan base.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi is a game of overcoming failure. Mainly, failure that you seek out; in the game I am presently playing, my group has been destroyed and left for dead bar one lone survivor. Not bad for fighting over one hundred battles. Unlike most grinders, losing makes the character better. Each blow suffered, each failed defense helps each character grow stronger. On the same hand, each use of an attack does the same for one’s melee attack. Strength requires either using a heavier weapon in combat, or dragging heavy gear and materials across the sandy wastelands to become stronger.My character started out with a group, fed up with stifled city life and taxes. We gathered together to head out and found our own homes and lives. After days of preparing our small mining camp, the group is capable of carrying out a full scale mining company, selling goods and creating a faction to be reckoned with. The grind is rewarding, since the humble beginning of this rag tag group.All of this is earned through hours, upon hours of grinding. Kenshi is not a game for the light of heart; the grinding will try your patience, and the music, while atmospheric, is ambient and tends to get grating after a while. Blood will spill. Arms will be broken. The crafting system, powered by choice of end product and the speed of production depends on the skill of the creator. Quality has no bearing on the skill, thankfully, considering the hours necessary to craft simple weapons and armor.There are presently only five styles of attack available to train in as well as craft. Hackers, Cleavers, heavy weapons, and a variety of katana, and wakizashi. Thankfully, this is all mitigated, in part, by a speed up function that speeds up the world to further reduce real crafting time.Enemies in the current version are made up of Starving Bandits, Dust Bandits, Sand Ninja, and Cannibals. You will end up fighting these enemies over and over, until your skills are good enough to defend yourself and your allies. Depending on start, the other notable factions (United Cities Samurai, Mercenaries, and Holy Nation) will be your enemies as well, presenting a higher difficulty for your characters as they are highly armed and dangerous.The wound system is one of survival, with the game tracking wounds to different parts of the body. Head, stomach or chest area, are required to stay conscious . The other limbs if injured come in the form of inability to use the limb or slowed movement, which may make fleeing difficult. Kenshi is unforgiving in this respect.Base creation is RTS style, requiring building materials, time, and a builder. The overall process is the same as weapon and item crafting, with a number of buildings available for crafting or research.The game’s research and science is also time based; Purchasing blueprints is a matter of heading to stores that sell similar products. Researching requires leaving a team member behind a workshop table to learn new construction.Now, considering the game is in alpha, it’s unsurprising that the models start off simple. With recent updates you are given the ability to manipulate and change the character’s features, with the ability to manipulate even height and weight. This all comes with a warning; at present, many of the combat animations do not work with some of the more extreme body shapes, with super small or super tall, or super wide characters having difficulty meshing with the animations. This presents mostly when using female models, which were recently added.Graphics are the other issue; the game’s atmosphere is post apocalyptic, this makes the the surrounding environments tame continuous desert. The occasional greenery pops up now and then helping to bring some colour.There have been many updates since Kenshi was released an Early Access Game, with changes and updates coming roughly every month or so. With new updates come new clothing, changes to models, landscape changes and many more. Game saves are not compatible between versions; however, there is an option to Import characters from earlier saves.There are also quite a number of bugs, mostly to do with path-finding and other commands. As this is an alpha, expect to see them.SO WE COME TO THE ENDAfter unfathomable hours of game play, Kenshi drawn me back again and again to it’s blood soaked desert. The game offers an huge amount of freedom. It’s a game of growing numbers and seeing their impact in a world that is filled with danger. It is a game that is hard to get into but once you have the basics say goodbye to real life. It thrives off of swift and brutal combat with only the best surviving to the end, and the weak being cut down dead; the lucky laying unconscious. It is unforgiving, and at the same time, for those who are willing to put in the time, rewarding.It is a vicious and simple game, that has a full save/loading system. The grind is punishing; enemies constantly challenge you to grow and adapt, to survive, and eventually conquer those around you. Yet it is just lenient enough for your characters to survive.The game is still in development and is missing many features. Expect crashes and bugs at this stage. But remember in development games receive regular ongoing updates and improvements, by purchasing at an early stage you get the game for a reduced price and can watch it gradually grow and improve!

								At its best an amazing game that's only gotten better with each update. At its worst it's hard, ugly and if you're stupid it will beat you until you cry.But if you're smart? And maybe a little bit creative... you'll not only survive, you'll thrive.Kudos to the designers, they could have upped sticks a long time ago through all the difficulty and bugs but nope.

								To counter the negetive reviews. Most large companies don't even attempt to make a game such as this because it takes a lot of money and time to develop. Now remember this isn't a large company with 1000 people that own 10 studios around the world. Time is essential to fix bugs and add new content to an open world sandbox so many things can break.  Just sit back and wait for the updates to get released, The wait for this amazing game to be completed is well worth it!I give Lo-Fi Games massive credit for this game,Keep going.			"

								great game! followed it for over 2 years i think now way before sound and construction was ever implemented! the only way i can describe it is think fallout 1/2 but in a map size of elder scrolls: daggerfall along with construction from c & c except a little more controled and less ""1 click to build then wait"" the combat is fun the controls are fluid the a.i can be very derpy somtimes which is freaking funny but this game is still only in alpha. if i had to rate it out of 10 easily an 7.5 but only because it has still some stuff to add but i give it a 10 for what it is trying to do in terms of bringing back sandbox squad based tactical rpg's except squad can range from 2 to 300! (or 22 is the current maximum as of 25/11/2013) keep an eye on this one it will go very far! give it love and support it deserves!			"

								So, this is probably going to be one of my favourite games of all time. Despite the game being not having half the features that are planned for it, I'm hooked, because what it does contain is fantastic, and the potential of it excites me beyond belief. Quality:As it is currently, there are some minor annoyances bug/glitch wise (I.e wall/gate placement in base building, items dissapearing when dropped, and people being launched into the sky when put down) but with a pinch of salt and frequent quick-saving, it's nothing that will spoil your experience and the game is very playable as it is. Value: (I paid £12.99)For your money, you get to support the development of a game that will hopefully set the standard for future RPG's, as well as many, many, hours of what is currently very enjoyable Alpha gameplay. And if you're like me, and are really excited about where this game is going, you get to feverishly await the addition of future content!I've clocked just over 60 hours on this playthrough and feel like I've more-or-less plumbed the depths of it by exploring most of the map, filling up my sqaud with people, doing 99% of the research and getting my main guys to be pretty good at what they do. However I could probably wring another 10-15 hours out of this playthrough easily, and the game has the potential to be infinitely replayable. I'd happily start over right now.Brief Overview:Until you can build your first outpost, you'll spend most of your time roaming around a vast and empty desert. I s**t you not. But trust me, you'll love it, because it's so atmospheric. Also, you will be very, very, very, cautious, hopping between the safety of city walls until you can toughen your guy(s) up. or you WILL get destroyed by ne'er-do-wells in the desert.The thing I love most about Kenshi, is that it doesn't need quests or missions (although these may be implemented later), because it's an epic story that tells itself, and you make it up as you go along and become immersed in the story that you create. Conclusion:If you love RPG's, katanas, epic journeys, and immersive, open-ended, gameplay, then Kenshi is a no-brainer. The vast amount of potential this game has is a bonus. I wish all Early Access titles were this promising.For a forcast of Kenshi's future development, check out this handy-dandy Roadmap: http://www.lofigames.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=295:roadmap&Itemid=71 "

Early Access Review
								Whatever ""it"" is...this game has it: the ""it"" that I've all but given up looking for the past 15+ years. I originally bought this game purely on the basis of a vaguely promised potential stemmed from the fact that a single person had so fully and passionately invested in her/his singular dream. I admired that and felt it was worth my acknowledgement as a born-and-raised gamer-at-heart. Admittedly, I was not impressed at first.  It was bare on all levels. Yet, I felt something; something trying to be realized; a seed trying to find ground. So, I let it be without judgement. For whatever reason the cosmos deem fit to define, I recently felt it was time to test the presumably deeper waters that have been forged since I first endulged to witness the extent of that ""something"" that had or had not been realized. Much to my not-so-dubious pleasure, my hope was revived to spark another true flame of that ""it"" I've so patiently searched for. Granted, I found it beneath hours upon hours of fumbling and keyboard-shattering crashes; but, honestly, at this point, the game's faults have become part of its charm. Which is really what adds that extra spice to give it that ""it"" flavor. Despite all of its admittedly glaring short-falls, it prevails with the potential for which it strives. Like every truly meaningful vision, its success is in its unrelenting ambition. And it only reveals this to you if you are willing to see it; willing to want it; willing to give it more than a glance of your attention. If you are, and if you do, this game will abide. It defies the shallow, heartless, financially-infused delusion that is the instant-gratification platform of gaming today. It is an uncut, unpollished, diamond-in-the-rough, poised to rise beyond one's incredulity into the veritable heart of imagination that so desperately seeks that ellusive sense of perpetual satisfaction afforded only by the so-called immersive gaming. No doubt, it is not for everyone. It is only for those willing to see what it wants to be; willing to see where it is headed and how far it has come at the hands of someone who seems to truly understand, if only on some unintelligible level of consciousness, what is starving the hearts of the angst-filled cynics that are today's gaming community. TL;DR : This game is for those who appreciate gaming as a form of art. It is indeed a work in progress; but a glorious one. In my opinion, it is worth the purchase on merit alone. The more people willing to see the potential, the greater the potential that will ultimately be realized. I am a believer. Are you?Either way, happy gaming.			"

								Although it's not finished Kenshi is a unique and interesting game which offers quite a challenge and requires players to really think about what they do and don't purchase, where to start your own outpost, what to build, and whether to run from a group of bandits (9 times out of 10) or stay and fight with a chance of walking away with some valuable loot.Kenshi does have its fair share of bugs, multiple times i have found my soldiers merging and teleporting from one point in my outpost to another, and having men on both sides freeze during combat, these usually sort themselves out in the end.Overall i believe Kenshi is a great game for all people to pick up and waste time with, just don't be surprised when a massive bandit group just waltzes into your shack and slaughters everyone.

								This game... I don't know if it will ever be finished but it is soooo addictive. It's my dream game for so many things. I always wanted a game where your character would evolve and xp according to his actions. Fable had that promise but it was fake. Morrowind and the elder scrolls saga pretended to be that but it was fake as well (still these level and point attribution thingy)Here, getting hurt makes you stronger. Literally.Being overburdened will develop your muscle, but will you make you run slower, and running faster can mean survival.Don't know how to describe this game properly, but there is so much potential here... I play several hours every 6 month, to see what is new and everything, and always get sucked back in.			"

								I chose the ""Holy Sword"" start for my character. I started out in a little village, but I wanted to leave and explore the land. A little way's away from the village I spotted a goat, and thought it was the perfect target to test out just how good this sword I spawned with was.Turns out the stuff I thought was grass around it was actually ten other goats. Long story short, I got brutally pummeled by a mob of goats and laid there unconscious for the next two days.10/10			"

								As many people have stated there are plenty of bugs and the development is incredibly slow.  I still love this game.  I have, I think, 110 hours of playtime and a majority of that is on one playthrough.  The combination of survival, builiding, combat, squad play, and an intricate stat system keeps me coming back (even if a lot of that list doesn't work properly).  If this game is ever completed, it will be one of those games that sticks around my library forever.			"

								This game is a beauty.GAMEPLAY :The default start is a RPG with the classic inventory and stats (old-fashioned stats).But with some time, you end up getting ingame currency and you can recruit a new character, which also has its own inventory and stats.By the time you get to understand the game, you can end up with 50+ characters (form up diferent squads), and then it can become an RTS kinda game. Yes, you can build stuff, and all the cities you will see in the game, you are able to create by yourself. You can prospect the land to see if it is good to grow stuff, make bread, and open a baker shop; or if it's better to mine, make a weaponsmith and open an armory.  Each character can be an Engineer, Merchant, Medic, Swordsman, Gunman (turrets and Xbows) etc.....There are mutiple factions which have unique laws and goals in the world. Of course, it is a dynamic world, and if you place your city well enough, you will get more and more travelers stopping by, renting beds or buying stuff; or you can get known by the closest bandits faction and they will start bullying you to pay taxes.To wrap it up, this game is absolutely incredible for the possibilities you get. BUT, it is not for everyone. Actually, the guy (GENIUS) behind this game wanted to create a game where you are not special. You ain't the last dragonborn, nor a mighty knight that will demolish every ennemies. You are a simple wanderer, so at the beginning of the game, literally ANYONE can kill you. + the health system is very complex. Each part of your body has a healthbar, which affects your total blood bar.Obviously, if you suffer heavy injuries, your character will go to Coma state, and eventually die.. forever (permadeath).So again, it is for gamers that are looking for challenge. I myself was quite horrified by this game at the beginning, but now I understand most of its content, I can make really decent games where I am able to create an outpost with a production and shops, and a little army to defend myself. Finally, this game is in alpha state. It is a project that is made by one person to begin with, but now it is a team.It has a slow progress, but has never been abandonned. Plus the price is really fair.Recently they worked with amazing musicians that play crazy instruments to make a unique and amazing OST,And the game is getting a major update soon enough since the map will  change for a randomly generated map with diferent biomes and wildlife. Sorry if this comment is too long, but I almost never comment games, and this one really deserved my thumbs up.18/10.  "

 Actual Review Down Below! Update 5/25/2015I got sidetracked with lots of review, the preview is gonna wait till i get that performance patch they were saying.Update 5/17/2015 Experimental UpdateHo boy this is.... this is awesome! The old GUI is gone and for the first time ever it looks neat! holy crap. holy holy crap. You should have seen the character creation menu. It looks so clean! And gosh from the last time i played this the game looks a bit better now. I did freeze up here and there but it is the experimental build after all. Will update once i actually starts killing sand ninja. Game Detail Name: KenshiDeveloper: Lo- Fi GamesGenre: RPG, Simulation, Trading, Strategy, Squad Management KENSHI *Sigh*. I'll be straight with you, this game once consume me for a while. Therefor when I was chosen to do a review on KENSHI, i was rather taken aback and did everything i could to avoid doing it. But the time has come. And now i ask you the question, do you know what is KENSHI? Most likely not, it's not a mainstream game nor a very well known indie for that one but those people who had the chance to try it will usually exclaim that it is better than most of the RPG on the maker and yet here i must make my statement regarding this game: It's not for everyone. Certainly not for me after i tried it. Ok so what is KENSHI? RPG game, with a dash of realism. That is to say it is still in early access and i had tried years ago the alpha build before it went on steam and i have to say improvements have been made after all this years. It's an eastern style RPG set in a apocalyptic world where sands rule the land and law and order are determined by might with roaming bands of brigands out for your blood everywhere you go.It's a very atmospheric world. You can be beset by cannibals, saved by the Holy Empire Patrol, loot dead bodies and equip yourself and after months of training and war you started killing settlements. The tables have turn. And that my dear reader is what KENSHI embodies, symbolizes and make you experience. You are a human being, in a world where other people are often times better than you. You will bleed in the middle of the desert before using your last medkit to bandage your arm and hobble slowly back to the city. At the end of the day, life goes on. Why the bravado? Simply because reviewing this game is subjectively hard. That and because i liked it. On with the review i suppose. Many parts of KENSHI will be miss however simply due to the scope. Gameplay You can choose to start with several preset such as having a good weapon, having trade goods [the goods are cheap, the bag however is not.] having a good weapon, having good combat skill [recommended for beginner.] or having several dudes in your party at start. Which i do not recommend. Anyways customize your appearances, choose a name, gender [Race is coming. Not very soon however since the updates are slow but big.] and then *BOOM* You are drop into the magnificent world of KENSHI. With only a very brief tooltip to get you started on your journey.The game is an open ended RPG meaning you can do pretty much what you want without any objective save for those you set yourself. Therefor people who enjoy reading story instead of making it should probably not find it very enjoyable. Anyways you can do a lot of things in the game but lemme just use the very rarely used bullet point instead of typing it out. Start your own town. Become a master of arms. Become a bounty hunter. Become an anarchist. A blacksmith even! with upgrades and blueprints! Or my personal favourite: Wandering the waste, getting into fights randomly healing people or breaking their bones. Then you become a warlord and do all of the above. Nothing really stopping you to be honest.And here is where the gameplay gets fun. You see KENSHI utilizes a unique RPG system where instead of skill points you actually perform the action to upgrade your corresponding skill. System like Carrying extra weight to train your strength, running without any loads to increase your running speed. And actually fighting to increase your fighting skills because you truly suck at the beginning where even a small bandit can make you into coma.Speaking of coma this game HP system should be utilize into more game. For example your limbs have individual health bar and each of them can bleed out individually reducing their effectiveness and preventing you from using two handed weapons and sword for examples. But that is not all! Wound your opponent enough on the head and they will faint, on the leg and they will hobble, on the arm and well.... have fun. Meanwhile you also have a blood meter! Lost too much and get coma and die. Subject to everyone. So everyone has an equal chances of dying with only their martial art skill being the tie breaker.There is also the element of trading, by buying trading bag which reduces your speed and make you more susceptible to bandits you can buy trading goods and trade stuff from town to town. Then all those training carrying sacks of metal made you stronger so you can then beat up bandits!The game is hilariously open is what i am saying. That is not even accounting for squad formation, squad order. create-a-town mechanic function and all the other things in this world. It's the tip of the iceberg. Graphics Compare to years ago the graphics have improve substantially although in 2015 its not really something to write home about. You can even sometimes see graphical glitches from time to time although seeing as this is a rather massively scope game such a thing are understandable. Sound While atmospheric the ambient sound is best turned off, the game set to windowed mode and you play supplied with your own music. Trust me the lonely landscape takes time to transverse even at top speed so having your tune would supplement it quite well. Conclusion My review will never do KENSHI justice, it is a game of such openness and it provides you with the mean to experience that everybody will play it differently. For me it is the ever path of the wanderer [And the warlord once I figure out how to actually kill someone with this metal rod i call a sword.] Scoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict: S-Rank [So long as the update is stable otherwise it's an A-Rank.]Protip: Try the demo floating around the internet before you commit. The demo is rather old though with many new features have been implemented into the game. Still a long way before release though.  Early Access Hiccups? Plenty. Many features are experimented on all the time on this game. And as such it breaks easily during update. Does not stop you from enjoying it though.EDIT 4/20/2015: I should really clarify something, i wont ssay this game has potential but it does [hypocrite] but the thing is about this game is that i got my enjoyment out of whatever update it already has so further progress is merely bonus at this point. So dont wait for the potential, just enjoy the now. Check out the Original Network Groups. Win free games, make new friends on Steam, & more!

								A warning to a potential buyer: the game is still very much early access, crashes are frequent (thankfully an autosave is already implemented) and many of the features are incomplete. If you don't enjoy seeing a game through development, this is not the game to buy.Preamble warning aside, Kenshi has a lot of interesting features, not the least of which for me is the crafting system, especially being able to gear your party with hand made items. That said, while some aspects of the game aren't as intuitive as you could hope, the scope of the game and shear number of features is exciting, and reminds me of of a scaleably third person team based Morrowind.If the developers continue to work on this game steadily, I could very easily see myself going back and continuing to play. With as much potential as this game has, I really hope they complete it, because they will have produced a very unique and enjoyable game.			"

								I give this game an 8.5/10.Be warned, this game will not be for everyone. It is still in Early Access, so a there are missing features, bugs and glitches (but that's to be expected). If these things strike a nerve, wait until the full game is released. Most of the glitches and bugs are easily avoided though; just use the F5 (quicksave key) often. Then when something does go wrong, you can automagically timewarp back and do it all again :)How I would sum up the world: Think Tatooine landscape filled with sword-wielding samurai and ninjas. No magic, no fantasy. It feels like it could be real (assuming it's on another planet :P).I love this game because of the grind. Sure, you have to sink in a lot of hours to get anywhere, but nothing matches the feeling of sheer satisfaction when you've built up a strong party, a well defended base and little stands in your way as a threat. The game was tough to learn, so you'll need to lean on the wiki for support for the first few hours at least. But once you've found your way it's all smooth sailing.My only real dislikes about the game are the bugs. The one that annoyed me the most was the teleporting 'dead' bandits. Watch out for these bad boys because despite being 'dead', they will teleport closer and closer to your storage buildings then loot your stuff. And no matter how many times you go to loot the stuff back off them, they will always win. F5 is the only way to save the day.Yet some of the bugs are more amusing than annoying... Like men sleeping like bats, hanging upside down off the sides of beds. Or shopkeepers within shopkeepers so they look like they have two faces, four eyes, two noses and four ears :PAll in all, if you like games that require a grind and can put up with weird stuff happening, dive right on in. It's worth more than you pay for it. If you like a grind but don't like glitches or blank buttons, wait for the full release. And if you don't like a grind, then this game is definitely not for you.			"

								ALPHA PREVIEW REVIEWAside from some crashes I had playing this title, This is a great concept in the work mainly done by one person so the updates can be a little slow but the game is awsome.Its basically a free roam survival rts with samurais and desert. I started off as a lone wonderer in this world before I was able to construct an entire squad each character named after the people who watched my stream, I had to be careful not to kill off my members as I work on them to become stronger so we can take on the cannibal village. In order to keep myself going the first thing I had to do was lure people to thier death and use town guards as my shield, eventually i built a mine, did some recruitment, and assigned people jobs, soon I had a full functioning village selling items from and creating weapons with close to 20 people. Training for our attack on the cannibals.With more work this game will be more and more amazing but it will not be done anytime soon. Its slowly getting better and better as time progress and is worth the value, I hope with support the author can focus on this game 100% full time and get things going because this is a real gem of an idea he has here+Samurai Squad base survival+recruit players, customize em and name them+awsome music+This game is plain fun watching your squad roll out in army+create your own town, start selling from your town, start a business from your town (still in the works but works really well)+the world is quite big and it all takes place in the desert+The animations during the combat is pretty sweet-Theres no real story to the game yet-Could use alot more buildings and thing sto do-Cant wait for more factions. need moar!-Bugs and crashes atm which causes me not to be able to progress too far when I have huge samurai battles-The graphics isnt the best thing in the world but he fun makes up for it.-Sometimes graphic and ai glitches out, like buildings halfway in sand etc+- This is a working title, my review and opinion will change as the game progresses but this is basically my ALPHA PREVIEW REVIEW "

								As a child, I improved rudementery reading skills with classic RPGs like Dragon Warrior 3, Shining Force, and Fire Emblem. These games were amazing, because in adition to cementing a sense of justice in a 5 year old, they presented a memorable plot, different forms of character development (DW3 with the personalities, where the personality determined stat increases, and was determined by initial stats. Shining Force with the stories told by your squadmates in the various bases found over the 8 chapters, as well as themes of amnesia. Fire Emblem for being, well, Fire Emblem.) None of that is in this game. Which makes it perfect.""Why would you tell that story to point out what it doesn't have?"" Simple: Kenshi has everything else that made those games personally iconic. From Dragon Warrior 3, you have each squad member being completely unique from creation, with nearly endless possibilities for customization, with an open world. From Fire Emblem, you have that strategic element, same with Shining Force. But with no 'level' or 'class' system, there are no restraints. I'll admit, I plan after writing this to re-create Shining Force in game, by creating each of the characters in order of appearance. That'll be fun!But it doesn't stop there. The combat is fluid, and the AI is great. Giving each limb, and core parts it's own hit points, and changing gameplay according to damage (and changing DAMAGE based on how you choose to heal it) is something more in-depth than most heavy LARP systems I've seen. You can build a base and be a group of peaceful farmers/traders (not that you need to eat). You can start a war with one faction (though I wouldn't reccomend it... ever), or become a group of mercenaries. The sandbox element is strong in this game.While the game is still in alpha, the groundwork has been set for so much more than is already released (as a player, I'd be fine if I had to deal with what i've got.) The few bugs that are in the game are minute and are easily bypassed with frequent quicksaves and game imports. The dev, while a little slow in getting the game out, is very careful to minimize bugs. A perfectionist, if you will.And this brings me back to that 5 year old playing those games for the first time, because while I can't play through those stories again, every click is another element that goes into a script playing in my head. While the characters may not interract on screen, they can be in the player's mind. As an adult, I've been a DM for a few years now, but Kenshi gives even more creative freedom to the player, which is the ultimate goal of an RPG. The only thing you can't do multiplayer, and i'm sure that by the time it gets to full release, it will have addressed that.This game can only be catagorised as a Sandbox/RPG/RTS/Simulation/Open World/Base Building Awesomeness. This is better than most games released today, and for the price, you'd be a fool NOT to pick it up. The true brilliance of this game is that there is a start point, but it is infinite. The end is wherever you choose to stop.			"

								""Toughness Stat - How to train:-Not wearing armor; armor is for wimps.-Getting hit for high amounts of damage, like a man.-Get up and fight when you should be playing dead.""Sold.You probably shouldn't play Kenshi. It is going to suck you in. Just walk away.JK... but not reallly.The thing crashes semi-frequently, and there are bugs such as the path-finding and character edge-sticking which reviews have mentioned, but these don't ruin it by far and are still in development (if your character is stuck in a wall, just tell another character to pick them up). Gameplay took some getting used to, as did the interface. Kenshi has a very balanced mechanic between RPG and RTS without feeling like either. More specifically, it somehow manages to combine the feel of Mount & Blade and Dwarf Fortress, with a little influence from Bioware-style party-management, into one intelligent video-game-gasm with some serious yet subtle attitude and atmosphere.The new content being talked about is going to expand upon what is already hours of playability. Apparently there are going to be new maps, beasts, quests, and I could even see more Mount & Blade-like politics with faction leaders (you listening, devs?), and mounts, or vehicles, and other characters, and maybe even a storyline, and then there's the modding community, and... and... let me stop.Enter the desert.

Solid dev team, great game concept, regular community updates.>pros-gigantic open sandbox-RPG elements for each memeber in squad-hundreds of weapons and variations-economy and base building-regularly updated-scalable enemy encounters to manipulate difficulty>cons-performance drops at times (actively being worked on)-currently one biome environment (actively being worked on)-not too much explanation for the building mechanics8/10 tremendously fun and different gameplay. would beat cannibals to death again.

								This game has serious potential..  I've been playing it for a while now, and it's just gotten better.. great soundtrack and sounds have been introduced, more creatures and factions, excellent armor and clothing additions..  The creator seems genuinely passionate about his game..  I think this could be the real deal as far as early access goes.. (unlike MANY games out there just to make a buck and bail.)The game updates tend to take a while, but they're pretty keen on the news updates and where they are in development.The ""new"" map is HUGE(and it's less than half finished!).  Much larger than the original they came out with which was a bit overwhelming in itself, but they've included tons of stuff to keep your exploration bug at bay.If you're patient enough and up to the challenge and don't mind antiquated graphics, The real fun of this game is working yourself up from a nothing weakling loser getting your ♥♥♥ kicked at every turn into a decked out, rich badass with one or several towns or cities to your name and an army to back you up.It still needs work of course.  I have a mental laundry list of stuff that could improve it, but if you're into this sort of thing, it's well worth checking out.			"

								It is buggy and occastionaly hard to use. But it is just so much **** fun.////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////3/13/15Still hard to use, but I'm enjoying the packs of Demonic hellhounds that kill your whole party in a heartbeat. You walk 5 feet, hellhound, you die. You walk the other direction, bandits, you die. 7/10 Harder then Darksouls.//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////1/14/2016 The game is creeping along in development but still (in my mind) it has at least 3 more years before it can be relesased as a compelte game. Only Buy it if you wanna help the developers. As it stands you might get 4-6 hours of gameplay out of it before getting bored. I wait with my fingers crossed for more updates and nice tidbits of info.			"

								TL:DR, 10/10 well worth playing.. and playing again... and again.If Mount and Blade and Shogun: Total War had a baby, and that baby grew up to have a baby with Age of Empires 2... it would be close to this. Kenshi is gripping, it feels slow at the start but it's an amazing game once you crack the egg. Updates are coming thick and fast (at the time of writing) and it is a promising framework.			"

I would give this game a fat 8,3 It's still in Early Alpha though. However. This game is really rough and you need to put a good time in it to become a fine combatmaster.			"

								This game is for RPG-Players. This game is for those who love Strategy games and building their own town. This game is for people who like freedom and a sandbox to live in. It's special, but if you really are a fan of all the above, you should get this game! First of all, in my opinion the graphics are pretty decent, especially for this type of a game. I know it's far beyond those knock off titles upcoming like Witcher 3 and Inquisition, but keep in mind it's not a pure RPG, you build your own cities and there can be way more NPC onscreen at the same time than you would imagine( I had a realy big battle with like 50+ NPC's, all fighting at the same time). The Audio is well...improvable to say the least, but hey it's still early access. Story: there is none! Or to explain it better: think of your own story, why are your characters here? What do they want to accomplish? And the most important question: why are they doing, what they are doing? Right now there are no quests, but they will be implemented, just like several guilds/parties/groups you will most likely be able to join(if I am not mistaken). The landscape of Kenshi is...monotous right now. You're traveling a pure desert, with many high mountains, but also some dunes. There are many cities controlled by NPC factions, most of them small, some are bigger.But for me the most interesting part is the sandbox part. You can litteraly build everywhere! I am not kidding. Only restrictions are terrain such as really high mountains and you're not allowed to build too close to an NPC city. So ever wanted to write your own story? Build your own little kingdom? Craft your own gear to quip your fighters? To send them on a conquest to foreign lands or people you do not like? Or do you just desire to trade peacefully? Or maybe, maybe you're the type of guy who wants to stay alone and take on a huge challenge by fighting all on your lonesome against hordes of bandits? Get it!			"

								This game is one of the most addicting games ive ever played. I got home from work and played for 7 hours straight without even realizing it. At first its weird and confusing with the whole ""No man character"" thing. But it grows on you an eventually it becomes normal. This game plays like no other game ive ever had. It mixes real time strategy with building, advancing characters, free roaming, trading, pretty much anything you imagine. Capture slaves and force them to work or sell them off, Create a legendary samarui squad, create a steel fortress, get eaten by cannable, anything you want to do is probably going to be in this game. Absolutely get it.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has a LOT of people either in love with it, or not understanding how anyone could enjoy it.  Both ends of the scale have pretty good reasons for their decision.  The word potential gets thrown around quite a bit with this game, that's because it does have absurd potential for being massively awesome, but let's just focus on fixing the crashes first (they are much less frequent than they used to be, but still).  Crashing out of the game isnt that bad, the game autosaves already fairly frequently, and you can even increase how often it autosaves.  The combat is quite unique in that you dont directly control your squad while they fight, but their skills dictate how well they do.  Once you see a couple of well trained soldiers quickly work through an army of low skill bandits, you understand how awesome fighting can get.  But I do mean ""can get"", as you have to work your ♥♥♥ off trying to not get the crap kicked out of your guys until they can hold your own even against a few other enemies.  The game also has a basebuilding mechanic, with research and crafting, but in all honesty I haven't attempted it beyond ""I'm gonna build a house on this lovely mouintain"", so I don't really know how it all plays out or if it's even working.  The game has a cool trading method, go from town to town buying things for cheap and reselling them at the next town over where they don't have those items so you can sell 'em for a higher markup.  There are multiple starts in Kenshi, from being a naked man with a roughed up arm in the middle of the desert to 5 guys wanting to start a town, there are multiple fun ways to start the game off.  Character creation in Kenshi is interesting to say the least, it's not awful, but a lot of the sliders you just don't want to touch for risk of making your character very disproportionate so the armours and weapons dont look quite right.  I once made a midget named Hugo who wielded the biggest blade I could find, it always hovered near his hands and not in them.  Out of 352 games I can honestly say this game is one of my favourites, Kenshi is quite the experience and I feel like I didn't do the game justice with this review, because its either a game that you will love, or you'll disregard it forever.

								Ok this is my first ever review. Normally i just let others do this for me but i like this game to much not to voice my opinion.I'm totally hooked on this game, it is very addicting. I like the whole explore and survive aspect of the first few hours as your building your squad. Than picking a spot to build your town and building and crafting it up is also very fun. There is a definate progression to all your skills that is satisfiying. I find the game in its current state to be completely playable for hours and am very excited for all the future game features to be added.  I've had minor problems with crashes and bugs and have found the import function on the load screen to be a very useful tool for resetting and eliminating most bugs.  All in all cant recommend this game highly enough.			"

								I discovered Kenshi five days ago. I have only been playing Kenshi for five days now.First and foremost: the game has many flaws. It's in beta and the bugs are numerous. You'll need to restart the game to alleviate some of these bugs, while others will need to be remedied by verifying the game cache.But it's all worth it.Kenshi draws me in and tickles a nostalgic part of my brain that is still in love with Star Wars Galaxies (pre combat revamp of course). The combat seems clunky at first but really just takes time to appreciate. You are not spoon fed. Your characters will be wounded, ensalved, imprisoned and killed. And you'll continually become stronger and smarter because of it.Building your own camp is fun. Turning that into a village is great. Becoming the architect of your own city that can be seen from the alien horizon is what it's all about.Buy this game at full price. Have some patience and allow Kenshi to grow on you. This is a special title. Don't miss out on it.			"

								This is THE game for a gamer who is seriously into strategy/simulation.  I bought Kenshi on the steam sale, and instantly became hooked.  There is no friendly, happy, bunny mode.  You begin in one of the scenarios you choose. i.e. your starting squad and loadout, and instantly begin in an unforgiving world of sand ninjas, samurai, and desert drifters.  How you choose to proceed is up to you, and if you choose unwisely, you will die/fail.  No one to blame but your past.  If you don't rush into the desert wastes, put some thought into you development, and plan, there is a great chance you will succeed ... or at least not be bludgeoned too bad by hungry bandits.  Wait and admass a squad and income before trying to form your own town and you will be okay; if not you will have to fight like clint eastwood in an old western, but without the guys.  Great game for those with the patience to play it and overlook the occasional bug.  On this issue, updates are constantly coming out, and fixes come out even faster.  The Dev is doing a great job for it's small operation, and if you can handle the occasional stress of dealing with a bug and at the worst having to revert to the newest save or auto save, there is nothing too flawed about the game.I highly recommend it for any serious gamer.  If you can handle anything but immediate gratification, don't buy it; plain and simple. Just call downstairs to your mom for some more soda and pizza bites ... everything will be okay snookums’.

								Wow, that guy has a 5000 cat bounty? Alright, I just recruited 2 people from a nearby bar and outfitted them with armor from that group of desperate, starving bandits. Its time to make some money!It's just one dude, we can take him.""Retreat! Retreat!"" as I fall with a katana buried in my back, blood staining the sand.Hours later, I awake. It's dusk. One of my companions lies merely a dozen yards from me, barely breathing. The other is no where to be found. I grit my teeth as I throw Brigand over my back and silently pace towards the city with as many samurai as citizens. The city lights are guiding me. I'm nearly there. I can see the light glint off of the helmets of the samurai warriors. Behind me, I hear footsteps. Many footsteps. As I turn, fifteen screaming bandits are taking positions around me. I drop Brigand to the sand and unsheath my rusty sword. In a moment, I feel a myriad of blades tear into my flesh. My vision started to swim and I could feel death creeping upon me, slowly yet surely. Another moment later, the bandits are routing as the Samurai crash into their ranks. With my last breaths, I carried my companion to the inn, and placed him on a bed. I didn't make it more than five feet before I feel to the ground. There just wasn't enough blood to keep me standing. May Brigand find better fortune than I in this world.			"

								Why should you get this game? 84 hours in six days is not enough reason?Then let me tell you my Kenshi story:I never buy games which are not as special somewhere.So when I wanted to try Kenshi - again like some months or years ago - I got the demo from the website of the developer.When a demo exists it normally means that the developer thinks peoplewill like his product even after trying it. Self confidence.I tried the demo and played it for - I don't know - two or three days.Then I realized, I want the whole game, the actual update, I got the game,even if there was no special. I don't do that. Never. Normally.Demo play:I already know that I am not the hero in this game. So I know I have to take it slowly.I start in rags in a large desert. I run around until I get to a small village in the mountains.With all my money I hire a guy to follow me.Now we hang around town and whenever the town gets attacked we loot the bodies and sell the stuff.With the money I get more guys and some backpacks.During one of attacks one of the police officers dies.I take one look at his armor and weapon and decide: MINE!When I bring back the loot, walking proud in my new shiny armor a police officer yells at me:""Where did you get that armor?""Then he attacks me.My friends of course try to help me, but we are no match for the police officers of the village who regularly defend the village against large groups of villains.We lie there unconscious and bleeding with many wound to different parts of our bodies.After a while one of us becomes conscious again and treates himself and all of us until we are not bleeding anymore.Then he takes one of us on his shoulders, carries him to the next inn and puts him into a bed.Then he does it for the rest of us and at last puts himself to sleep too.The beds are kind of costly for me at this point so I decide I want my own house with some beds.The next days we just loot and save the money until we can buy a small house and put there some sleeping bags.Now we can use the accelerated healing rate of sleeping in a bag without having to pay for it.It is time to expand. We are so arrogant, we have no idea what we are going to get into.We take the best loot of some days as armor and weapons and some med kits and venture towards another city.Some time into the desert a horde of bandits comes running towards us.Ha, small game, we think. We saw them slaughtered on a daily basis at the village gates.They slaughter us. We lie there unconscious and bleeding with many wound to different parts of our bodies.Again.So, again the first of us who can move again starts healing the others.Then the bandits come back.They hit all walking guys again until they walk no more and start looting us.They take nearly everything.Then they march away.One comes running back and takes some more stuff from us before he follows his friends.We nearly don't make it back to the village. Some have to be carried, some can only hobble because they have serious wounds at their legs, some can not carry others because they have wounds at their arms.We were defeated but we are better in some areas like fighting and toughness.When we are able to move again I decide to go back to looting but I will send one guy without armor or weapons to run as fast as possible to the next city to start a second base there.While he is running down the next mountain some dogs start to chase him for a while and I am thinking I'll lose him.But he gets to the next city.I decide, I need the full game....The real game.Grass! Trees! Animals!Man, the difference is stunning.I start in a very small settlement of the Holy Nation, just two houses, some fields and a well.I have nothing and can't do a lot here but steal or attack and I want to be nice.So I decide to go to the next village.I wander the street when I encounter a patrol of the Holy Nation. Looks nice and powerfull that patrol.They approach me: ""What god do you worship?""Me: ""none"".Wrong answer. They beat me senseless and continue their patrol. At least they did not try to loot me.Even if I have nothing, I don't like to get looted.Now I am angry. I limp parallel to the path back to the settlement.When I get near the settlement, I start to sneak and check for guys with weapons.I get back into the settlement, always ready to run, aehm limp, away.Everything is allowed now. I steal everything I can. I see one guy with a backpack. I want it. So I can steal more!Hitting people when I am sneaking gives me a chance to knock them out.That is the skill assassination. I am very bad at it.But the peasants of this evil religion will be the first receivers of my wrath.I train knocking people out until I am very good at it.Then I get my backpack. My first backpack. All mine.I gather (steal) some more things and again decide it is time to move to another location.This time I stay away from the street and move carefully through the wilderness.When I get to a village it is not a village but a city. Large walls around lots of large buildings and many heavily armed and armored guards at the entry.I approach them, fearing the worst. This time no questioning and no attacks.I move into the city and sell my stuff at the first vendor I find.Big mistake.He recognizes the stuff as stolen from his own empire and calls the guards.They beat me senseless AGAIN and put me into prison.A cage inside one of their military buildings.I pick the lock and run away.I hide from the guards until I am no longer ""escaped"" but just someone with a bounty.Not everyone reacts to bounties every time.For some money a guy will join me.Silly me. The first guy I hire is not a human so the whole ""Holy Nation"" hates him.Very often we get insulted, traders don't trade with him and sometimes he will just get attacked and imprisoned for not wanting to be rebirthed. No idea what it is, but it does not sound good.I started to live in this city but the racist religion here got on my nerves, I decided to get to another race which was supposed to live in the south.So I ran south, swam in the river, outrun bandits and animals.When I was out of food and my swimming skill had reached level 30 I reached the border of the currently reachable area. No other race. Via forum I found I had to go west. So to the west I went.Hills, deserts, bandits. The bandits got me. I survived and hobbled towards the area where I thought the other race to be.On the map I got a marker for a village of the other race. I was nearly there. Then I got attacked by a group of animals which ate me....New life.I am this time near a even smaller settlement.Nearby is some iron, so I decide to start a small settlement here.First I will need building materials.So I create a stone mine and start to build a machine which creates construction material from stone.Not enough construction material for the machine.I need money. I mine the ore mine and sell the ore to elder of the nearby settlement.The settlement is attacked very often by dogs and bandits, I just loot the bandits and dogs and cook the dog meat so I don't get hungry and everything is kind of right.While mining some ore I get attacked by two dogs, they make me bleed so bad, my status changes from ""bleeding"" to ""dying"", all the while being unconscious.A patrol of the Holy Nation marches on the nearby street, but I am out of sight for them. They march on.I die....New life.Because of the size of the story I have to link to a post, so if you wish to continue reading, go there:http://steamcommunity.com/app/233860/discussions/4/343788552533488306/ "

								My first adventure in this game was one with lots of questions and involved a lot of reading on my part. Though the mechanics of  this game seem cruel I feel greatly rewarded when I survive an attack against bandits or get my characters' skills up.I had started as a survivor, looking at my war buddy as I woke from a losing battle. Though he looked to be healing alright he was still unconcious and we where a long ways from any city. It took some time for me to manag(figure out) how to carry the larger man but I had managed and began walking my way towards a city. I had noticed two bandit groups skirmishing just a little distance away from me.After getting to the city I was able to buy a mercenary to help me go and pick up some salvagable equipment from the battle that I had seen on the way over. WIth the money from that equipment I hired a medic and we waited for my friend to wake up. Two days later he wakes up and we set out for another town. Two more people joined up and we moved on to another town. After fending off some badits and sand ninjas he limped out way into the Holy City of Sharks where four more people joined up. We had a large group now so we thought it would be  smart idea to build our own city. Two days later in the middle of the desert we where lost to the sands.Though my group met a tragic end at the hands of cannibals I was still able to enjoy the hours long playthrough. I learned alot abou thta tfirst one and am going to put that to good use in my next playthrough. I would deffinately recommend this game to hardcore RPG and stategy game fans.Edit:PLaying this game on and off and loving every minute of it. The game gets better and better each time it's updated. Though I will say that I wish they would bring back certain scenarios such as the survivor one where you and an ally survive a fight. I found that one to be the most fun but I still enjoy the new content to a great deal. Keep up the good work and listening to the players!			"

								Disclaimer: as soon as the devs have finished this product, I will most likely change this recommendation to a whole-hearted ""Yes.""Kenshi is a game that contains much of what I've been wanting to see combined in open world rpgs for years: a totally open world, completely freeform squads, strategic gameplay with limb-damage, character progression, and the ability to easily break up or become seperated from your units. Actually, that last one was something I didn't even know I wanted until I played this game. In a game like Mount & Blade, failure means capture and the loss of most of your equipment and probably all of your units, and you are tied to the unit that captured you without options or variation. When my characters were knocked out by cannibals in Kenshi, my main character was left behind while the two units I had aquired by that point were taken to the cannibal's camp. Eventually, my character recovered enough to limp towards the nearest town, while my units were forced to despirately try to pick the locks of thier cages. One unit escaped, one didn't. The world of Kenshi allows for variation in losing, including the possibility of death for your main character if too much damage is taken. The result is strangly thrilling, and as I watched my unit desperately flee the cannibal camp with enemies running after her, I knew I had stumbled upon a game of great possibility.Unfortunitly, Kenshi remains too unfinished a possibility. The event I just described was the highlight of my several hours of playtime. At the moment there are no quests in Kenshi. You can build buildings, but there is no guarentee that the buildings will carry over to new versions of the game. My only goal is to build up the strength to get revenge for the unit that was killed by the cannibals. After that's done, I'll simply have no reason to keep playing.Buy only if you want to support the developers.Gameplay:

								From what I've consistently seen from early access games, as soon as they go on special, the creators lose any financial motivation to continue development. I rarely give bad reviews, but there's no way in hell I'm letting them get away with this.Conceptually, this game is amazing and full of potential. It's the closest thing we have to a Mount and Blade clone. However, with so many years in development and such trivial updates, I've come to realize this will never be a finished, quality product, ESPECIALLY now that it's on special, and it's nothing more than a buggy sandbox with few ways to interact with the world around you. I haven't seen such terrible development constipation since Cortex Command.Please do NOT encourage such dishonest business practices.			"

								Amazing Game! i got this game in build 0.39 and enjoyed all of the content, and since then they have added Cannibals, Female Characters, and tons of other stuff! The best part is where you can build up a settlement and hopefully they will add onto that aspect, which im sure they will. For me Kenshi is a all-around fun game to dive into adventures, base building, trading, and anything you can think of doing!			"

								They just did a fairly decent update, but after many months i'm not impressed.  Now if they ever fix it so npcs spawn in towns so you can hire more squad members instead of having to import to a new game everytime and then bugging your town such as the walls allowing npcs to walk through them after you import for example, would be a great first start. Until then, however....NO.  They said they plan to polish it and work on stabilizing soon someday, so maybe when they start doing that i can change my review back to yes as I had it when i first got the game and ignorant of how long this game has been in development, thinking it was just a couple weeks old and not 2 or 3 years at the time. So now we are heading into year 5?  I do like the game concept,gameplay and the genre of this kind. I believe this game is more likely to become abandoneware than a finished game as slow as its getting developed.  That is why I say NO.6/3/16. The last month included a lot of fixes and such, you still have to import your game to new game if you want to hire more squad members.  Prisoner cages are still bugged, you can pick lock them with prisoners, and they still ask to be set free even though its unlocked. Most of them don't even talk to you.  I just crashed the game by dismantling a small shack.  So although they keep adding new content, which is a plus for any game, except when they ignore fixing what they already have. So I must keep a no recommendation, until they show development that counts.6/15/16 New map, hurray! Now if you only play the game without it crashing. I can't say much for this update, since the game crashes soon after you start playing it. Maybe in a month or two or this fall they will have a fix for it.			"

								When I first saw this game, thought it was gonna be a M&B: Warband clone, only in a Asian setting, and that sounded great. But what this game is, is so much more, or at least potentially.You create a character in a post apocalyptic feudal Japan-ish world, and from there your on your own. You can be a merchant, thief, shop owner, start your own town/outpost, craft your own weapons and armor, build different kind of functional buildings, research technology to build/craft even better stuff. You can train in fighting, stealth, repairing etc. by doing what ever you want to train in. Recruit squad members as bodyguards or as part of your personal mercenary group/army and control and train each person individually.At first the game had sub-par GFX (It still not great, but aesthetically pleasing) and no sound, but bear in mind it was still in pre-alpha (currently in alpha), the graphics have improved since, and there is sound now. On top of that new major features keep being added every few months.I bought the game when it was still $10, and it feels like an investment. I play it for a couple of months, when I come back after, say six months, more features are in and feels more polished every time. A few new major features (64bit engine, dialogue, overhauled pathfinding, animals/beasts and a new larger map with biomes) are planned for the near future. They already mentioned the beta in their latest progress update, price will probably go up again. In its current state (28/09/2014) the game is already very enjoyable, so buy it now while it's still in it's alpha pricing $20.PSI only started to play the game on Steam recently, my actual playtime should be more than 100 hours, maybe way more, I don't keep track realy :)			"

								As of the writing of this review, I have about 49 hours in the game, and it's not finished. Forty-nine hours and it's not finished! They started with the sandbox (which is where they could have stopped as far as I'm concerned) and then started adding stuff! Grow a farm, mine for ore, learn how to make stuff, wander around and kill bandits, do whatever you want! Lo-Fi games is very good about updating fans, and they listen to comments. So check it out! Get in on the ground floor! Enjoy!			"

There aren't any spiders in the current map, I just wanted to mention it.			"

								Kenshi is pretty fun, once you get into it. There is plenty of RPG-like qualities to Kenshi. A number of startup scenarios/ character equipment loadout, can push you towards certain playstyles:   Wanderer is the basic default character.   Settlers begin with a group of different characters together, along with building materials to start your own town.  My personal favorite has to be the Ninja/Thief: the game starts you off as a ""Hungover"", pantless Thief, who has been sold into slavery while you were passed out from a night of binge drinking. In essence you need to breakout of the labor camp and steal stuff to pay off the slavers to become a free man/woman.			"

								Man I hate this game, It's soo good I can't stop playing... there is so much depth to Kenshi that no video or review will ever do this game justice.If you are on the fence about buying Kenshi and consider yourself to have a medium level of patience, just go ahead and do it.. you won't be sorry.Make no mistake... Kenshi is a hard mistress, she will beat and enslave you... a lot, She will starve you and steel all your ♥♥♥♥ when you're laying there dying... a lot, She will surround your small outpost with religeous fanatics who will call all your females harlots and require them to perform ""special"" services in their temples... a lot.But hey, what doesn't kill you can only make you stronger right? - and that's where this game shines for me, knowing that while all this crap is raining down on you that your revenge is going to be ah so glorious... if you survive.Lastly, I have to mention the Devs at Lo-Fi are amazing and the support they offer the (also amazing) Moding community here is exceptional "

								Within the cesspool of Early access rubbish we get over the recent years, the ugly cash-ins and depressing situations whereby a game is never fully released ever.. Comes this little gem in a desert of emptiness that is Kenshi.Honestly I don't even know where to start. So I shall just wing this. Been playing it for awhile now, a long while and I honestly feel this deserves my personal recommendations to anyone who loves this genre. Let us get down to it, firstly with the cons of the game.1. There's barely any story.Over time, more and more things are added, dialogue bits and now little things here and there, but in a story perspective, it's still very little. Things are getting more fleshed out overtime so we will see things get better in that regard.2. Can still be a bit buggy.It's still early access, things are being added, things get glitchy after being added, balancing still needs some tuning but all is to be expected. Stable version is as expected more stable. (The trespassing of property still needs some work!)2. No multiplayer.This is a single player game, I'm only putting this here for two reasons. One, multiplayer would be quite awesome. Two, I'm lacking of cons to write!Now for the pros of this game.1. Very well done sandbox.It is a sandbox through and through.. You can do almost anything within the game mechanics limitations. You can kill anyone, you can steal from anyone, you can just be a trader, you can essentially be many things or nothing at all! Hell you can even build your own city!2. Combat is straight forward and fun too.Straight forward in the sense you click, and you attack, kind of like diablo without any skills. But your attacks are all sweeps and it's range is dependant on weapon of choice. big ♥♥♥ weapon slows you down, slows down your attacks but you hit more people with each swing! Your defense/offense/dodge all grow as you fight more! Your strength grows if you keep carrying heavy stuff! 3. Skills!All your skills grow with more usage! The more you do the same thing the better you are at it in most cases. Though contribuiting factors come into play. Your speed is slowed down by weight, your strength grows by carrying heavy things.. Your offense gets better the more you attack, the defense gets better the more you defend, ectera!4. Choices.A plethora of choices for you to pick, all of which comes around. Do you want to be purely a trader and rely on hired guards? By all means! Do you wanna be a warrior of the lands, heroically killing bandits!? Or become a bandit yourself! All of which requires some kind of sacrifice. A trader sacrifices the money to hire in trade for their safety through the lands. A warrior needs to go through a lot of training to get anywhere decent! And an army of bandits = bad news anyway. In the end you can sort out your group of folks for some to be good at something and others to be good at other things!5. Survival.It is hard, the world is harsh. Wild animals will kill you, bandits will kill you, all of that adds up. But you may not die when you get defeated! You have a blood pool, and every limb has an amount of damage you can take. If you were completely healthy, 90% of the time you don't die, you just pass out. To which you can play dead, or wake up and make a run for it! Just becareful of animals, slavers or cannibals. Animals will nom on you like cannibals. Slavers will enslave you! Training is crucial, so is running! But you can check out the guides for more details! 6. Mods and modding kit!I'm always supportive of mods and modding communities, they make the game different with mods and you can pick whatever mods to suit your game! :DAll in all it's an amazing game that proves there's hope in the industry for something cool to come out! :D "

								One of the best sandbox Squad Based RPG's ever made. I've put over 200+ hours into this game so far and I feel like I'm just getting started!In Kenshi, you start out by yourself or with a few others (depending on your game start), hungry, and alone in one of the largest hand crafted game worlds I've ever seen. Your first priority is to find food. Steal it, hunt for it, or trade for it. Encounter a vast population of creatures some of which are docile, and others who are aggressive and will eat you! With currently over 30 factions some larger than others, all who have their own personalities and goals. The Holy Nation hates any non-human race. Be prepared to fight their enslavement if you are of another race in their territory. Travel to the swamplands, and find yourself battling Swamp Ninjas, and other factions fighting to control the area. Travel to the far south, and encounter mercenaries that will rough you up if you don't pay them.Hire new companions, equip them with weapons and armor, and train their fighting skills to survive in this world.Become a slaver. Capture enemies, and sell them as slaves. Slavers will slave you if they find you knocked out, and you are forced into slavery until you escape.Become a warrior/ninja, conquer all who oppose you or die in the attempt.Become a bounty hunter, and find bounties worth a lot of money and bring them to justice.Become a thief, and steal from everyone. Get caught stealing, and get thrown in prison. Escape prison, and become wanted. Fight off bounty hunters that will eventually hunt for you.Become a farmer, and sell produce, or illegal goods to other factions. Get caught smuggling into a city and you'll go to jail.Build multiple bases anywhere! Choose from a large amount of buildings, do research to build new buildings and items. Craft your own weapons and armor. Create high walls with turrets to protect your base from attacks from rival factions.Or:You can do all of the things I listed in the same game. You can do whatever you want, but be prepared for the consequences!Kenshi is truely a unique, and remarkable game that deserves your money.			"

								I'm writing this for the beta version 0.91.4Now that a small part of the new world map is out I can say that this game is starting to be very fleshed out and there is more land and features to be added (diplomacy being a big one) that will make this even greater game.In the beginning you are weak, unskilled and most often alone. You will be caught stealing or end up pummeled by even lowliest of bandits or beasts. You can even starve to death or be kidnapped by slave traders if you get unlucky. In the worst case you may even end up being eaten alive.If you or whats left of your squad survive you may eventually develop to become strong adventurers, skilled thieves or rich enought traders to hire mercenary squad to protect youself. Eventually you may be able to set up a base of your own where you can farm your own food (if animals don't eat it and you're able to kill them), build walls around it and craft your weapons and armor.I recommend this for anyone interested in a survival game in a fantasy world with added RPG elements.

								Kenshi is a massivly open world RTS/RPG hybrid that brings to the RTS genre what I've always wanted to have.  I have been following the progress of this game for a long time now and I can tell you the developer is not giving up on this game.  In fact, the game has grown from beiing produced by a one man team for the first 6 or more years (Chris The Great A.K.A. Captian Deathbeard) to a full fledged indie studio.  Progress has picked up a lot recently with the new AI, Creatures, and a new World Map 4X bigger than the current one (which is massive already) with much much  more than just the desert and mountains biomes we have now.  Each character in your crew levels up differently, has their own inventory and skill levels and can be fully controlled seprately.  You can fight stuff, start a village, mine things, research new buildings and things to put in buildings, keep training your men (or an awesome team of Charlie's Angle style girls with a mysterious leader who they've never seen like I did).  Your village can grow into a massive city through tons and tons and tons and tons and tons and tons of work, but it's all worth it in the end.  Have a lone solider or command an army of unstoppable awesomeness (or sexiness).  Don't let the low number of hours fool you, I must have had over 100 hours on the pre-steam alpha release.  I haven't been playing it too much lately mostly because I'm going to do a brand new start when the new massivly updated map comes into beta in the summer, and the fact that there is currently an annoying random crash bug that happens when wandering far distances, so keep hitting F5 to autosave every few minutes.  Those things aside, this game is definately worth $20 and I suggest you get it now because I have a feeling when the new map comes out this summer, the price might raise to $25-$30.  I got it when it was $10 and it was the best 10 bucks I've ever spent online.   Just remember to have patience, and death is permanent.			"

								Great for those that enjoy a true sandbox RPG with plenty of swordfighting and a large amount of city-building available.Updating this review now that I have more time dedicated to write it.This is going to be a very patchwork comparison of Kenshi to other games that a potential buyer may, or may not, already own, and I will detail my personal experiences for you all to read, or not. :DSo, Kenshi is a squad-based RPG (think of Dawn of War 2, but each individual character in the squad has their own D&D-style character sheet) with some RTS elements (specifically the capability of building structures and researching technologies to unlock new structures, items, and upgrades) that puts a strong emphasis on open-ended gameplay (many puns to be had playing a sandbox game set in the desert).The Kenshi-verse (name of the world chosen by several members of the community, including myself) is an original creation with influences from the Edo Period in Japan (weapons and armor models are influenced by the samurai of that time, and it has been confirmed there will be no weapons relying on gunpowder or later technologies, just pure swordplay with some ranged combat and unarmed combat to come in the future).You, as a new player, get to choose from one of multiple starting points (i.e. a trader, retired soldier, etc.), and each starting point essentially grants the player a specific character(s) that have certain advantages and disadvantages.Keep in mind that there is a very strong emphasis on open-ended gameplay, so any of these starting points can be molded and shaped to create the character(s) that you will enjoy most.Regardless of the starting point chosen, your character will start at, or close to, rock bottom with little more than a rusty blade and the clothes on your back.The point of this is that your character(s) will grow and gain experience in the numerous skills and attributes (the # of skills and attributes currently available (17) appear to be about half of what is planned for the final release) by performing activities that are related to that skill.Things such as carrying a heavy load or swinging a heavy weapon in combat will improve your Strength, whereas wielding a lighter weapon will increase Dexterity.Even at the farm, crafting weapons/armor, picking locks, or simply running laps around town will increase their corresponding skills (btw, each of these actions I listed apply to unique skills).Once your starting point is chosen, you are then introduced to a rather in-depth character creation screen.This character creation screen allows you to choose either gender as well as modify hair, eyes, skin, muscle tone, height, weight, girth, bust, and most importantly, facial hair.After creating your character, it is possible to find an NPC called the Plastic Sugeon (should be at least 1 in every NPC town) that will allow you to modify any character in your squad using this character creation screen (it goes without saying this emphasizes the sandbox part even more).After you're satisfied with your character, then explore the Kenshi-verse to your heart's content!I say this because the current world (which is nothing but desert) has been confirmed to be less than 1/4 of the actual Kenshi-verse, AND this new world map is currently in the works as I am typing this.Some basic control shortcuts to help new players get started:Shift+LMB stack of multiple items = Allows player to pick up whole stacks of itemsHold RMB over any character = Brings up a list of all the actions that can be performed on this character (NPC or PC)The rest of the basic controls are either given to you at the start of gameplay or can be found, and rebound, in the Options -> Controls menu.Another HUGE part of Kenshi that I haven't even touched yet is modding.Kenshi has been developed from its core to allow extensive modding so that each player can have an even more unique experience.To my knowledge, there are mods available that:Add new weapons/armor to the Kenshi-verseAdd dialogue, and dialogue trees, to NPCs (which bring a large variety of things from quests to mercenaries, and I think its also possible to edit existing dialogue to read in other languages)Add structures to Kenshi and modify their functional components (things such as a structure's capability to receive an item to Input and produce an Output from it or to allow the mass Storage of a certain item)Modify components of NPCs in various ways (things such as # of bandits in each squad, add entire NPC towns, change ownership of an existing town from one faction to another)Among many, many other mods that have already been produced by the Kenshi community.There are also numerous, well-detailed tutorials available for any user to learn how to mod Kenshi in less than a day's worth of time.Anyone that has read this far should go to:www.lofigames.comand check out all of the information available there.Be sure to click on the Roadmap tab at the top to see everything that is planned and when it will be implemented.Oh, and you should totally join in the conversations on the Forums (I'm on there a lot ;D).Chris, THE dev and programmer of Kenshi, also posts regular updates to his twitter page as well as screenshots at:www.twitter.com/lofigames "

								Look, you either like open-ended, experimental sandbox games or you don't. If you do, you'll be able to look past this game's bugs and its current lack of content. If you don't, stop reading and go back to COD. Contrary to what some other reviewers are saying, this game is updated regularly, but you might have to opt in to the unstable build to see it. They've also been working on an entirely new world map which is due out soon. Over the past year they've added animals, slavery, formations, a new race, and many other systems and features, not to mention improving the pathfinding dramatically. The game is very different from when I purchased it a couple years ago and I think it shows a ton of promise.			"

								I've been following this game since before it was even on Desura, and I was excited for the longest time. I waited and waited and waited for significant changes to the playability of the game and have had a lot of fun in Kenshi. Sadly, after so many years I have to say that I do NOT recommend this game. Until the creator decides that fixing longlasting bugs and upgrading the animations, graphics, and UI are more important than adding broken features like slavery and thievery, I will continue to not recommend this game. The fact that he has made so much less progress on this game than others I have followed for the longest time is honestly depressing.I don't know if this game will ever reach the potential I hoped it would. Stay away.			"

								So.. Kenshi.I've been following this game for a while now that I completely forgot that it existed and also forgot how long I've been waiting on this game.I remember a time when the game was bugged when your desert turned into grass for some odd reason, weirdly deformed bodies using the character editor, green American football-looking gear as armor and even using building blueprints as walls because walls didn't exist.So how is it now? Amazing. This game now looks bloody amazing when I had a look, the desert looks a lot like a proper desert now. There's better buildings to construct, its got better stability and less bugs. You can steal, build proper fortresses, hire many more squad members into your empire. Heck, there are even animals in the game added in.The gameplay itself is.. A little bit repetitive(Note: only a little). You charge a bandit down, watch the fight, get absolutely smashed, get back up again, then charge a different bandit until you get strong enough to beat them down. However, this is not the whole game. In Kenshi, there are quests to do, stuff to loot, civilians to save from cannibals, cities to pillage, robbing dying people in the desert then patching them up etc. There's plenty of things to do, you just have to decide which ones you want to do. It's free-roam after all.Now this game isn't complete yet and even if it is has less bugs that doesn't mean it doesn't exist but it at least means there's still progress within the game. The developers take their time in this and I admire them for taking it slow, albeit a bit too slow. But the fact that I still see progress in 4? 6 years? is simply a testament to the love they have for the game and developing a game itself.Seriously, thank you, for being one of the Early access games that I've bought and still not abandoned after all this time.P.S. I voted this for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award' award on this. Partly, the reason why I made a review just now. :P			"

Early Access Review
								This is probably one of the most unique games on steam because of the endless choices given to the player and the amount of reward and punishment that come with each choice, I'll give a few examples:-If you decide to hone your combat skills choose carefully who you pick your fights with, the stronger your oponent is the faster you will gain on skill, infact losing the fight will make you tougher and stronger than winning it, but this is not always the smarter choice since the world is filled with cannibals, slavers and monsters that prey on laying bodies, so getting knocked out sometimes means you will lose more than the fight (kidnapped,chained,sold off, eaten alive, etc).-If you decide to settle down and build a base learn who and what roams around the territory where you build, you might get harassed by racist/sexist factions who want to take your non-human and female workers as slaves and will raid you if you don't cooperate, or you might have bandits and monsters trashing your gates and slaughtering your workers and farms constantly. (this made me rage quit a few times, but it is so rewarding when you finally get to stand on your own and hunt down all these mother***ers.)-If you become a trader and make enough cats(ingame currency name) you can hire really powerful mercenaries to act as bodyguards to keep your business clean, and have a slave serve you some homemade sake and rum at the commodity of your tower while someone else run your bar, shop, armory or whatever business you own.-If you just want to live as an adventurer and explore the world you might find hidden ruins with unique treasures and weapons that sell for insane prices or an outpost at the ends of the world owned by some most wanted criminal that has an outrageous bounty on his head.The list goes on but is hard to describe everything you can do in this game because it is almost up to your imagination, mechanic-wise it has few limitations. I started the game in 2013-14ish but it became unplayable because of the constant crashes, now that the crashing and most of the bugs are gone the game it's starting to show it's true potential,  if you are a fan of this type of game you are missing on a lot even though it's still on beta. The game has a steep learning curve, I recommed watching some of the recent tutorials and gameplay videos on youtube because those on steam are outdated and don't even show half of the things you can do in the game mechanic-wise.

								Incredible game. Open world sandbox in the vein of Mount and Blade but with RTS style squads, I can't recommend it enough.			"

								0.92 version patched ---the current versionKenshi is a different kind of game. It's a a squad based survival type game in a different land. Players can start in different game options but the main idea is to aquire other squad mates ( 30 Max. More with mods ), train is skills, research new technologies, build bases, farms, ore processors *er* processers, make weapons, armor, clothing....etc. You can even build booths for NPC's to buy your stuff. And of course new technologies mean new buildings and things to make. All the while, their are various factions that are either neutral to you or are trying to kill you. Combat is realtime with small battles up to huge armies (well like hundreds * w/ mods*). Various body parts can become injured and it will have a real effect ie. leg badly damaged? your character limps..arm nearly cut off? it dangles on your body. Your characters will lose conciousness before dying and depending on the severity of the wounds may just bleed out. However someone may heal you or pick up your unconcious body. This may be a bad thing. See, there are slavers and cannibals. If slavers capture you, you'll be hauled off to the nearest city and put in a cage, or forced to join another groups faction (as a slave). If cannibals capture, you will also be put in a cage...but they plan on eating you. Its not game over here in either scenario as you may be able to pick the lock and sneak out of the cage and make a run for it. Better find some food though, your characters can and will starve. A neat graphic here is if your character starts to starve...you will start to see the physical effects on them...ie ribs start showing, arms and legs start to get skinny...Now keep in mind you may have many characters, so if one gets hauled off to a slave camp, your other characters can go free him. Also characters can be assigned jobs, which the AI handles quite Nicely. A farmer may plow a field put the farmed material (there are several things you can grow) in a container, obtain water from a well, water the crops, and resume farming if there are still plants to be reaped. And thats just one job. Impressed? Thats not even close to all you can do in Kenshi.As read my review I realize I sound like a DEV of the game. I can assure you I most certainly am not. I am not exaggerating one iota about the tons of stuff you can do.Note: Kenshi has been in development for a long, long time. I have had this game for over 2 years. Things didn't always work right. Because of this there are some bad reviews. But I encourage anyone who played in the past to pick up on it again. Gone is that slow laggy game, replaced with a smooth as silk gaming experience. Still lags when changing regions though.The one negative comment I have is there is no verbal dialogue. It's not terrible or anything but it makes the world kinda flat. Now I'm 50 years old so of course I've played tons of great games with no dialogue. It's just a wish of mine to enhance the world. Also quest would be nice, but I LOVE sandbox games.I STRONGLY reccomend this game. It's really fun and different and coming together nicely now. For me 9/10.So thats it. I'm going back to the land of Kenshi now.....Cheers all			"

								Where to start. I can honestly say Kenshi is an addiction for me. It just keeps pulling me back in. The devs have taken the effort to keep this game user firendly all through the development and updates by providing an import feature. Even with the addition of the new world I was able to import and to this day I am still running the same squad I started with countless moons ago.Yes, it is early access.Yes there have been times where It has been very frustrating because I need my Kenshi fix but the latest patch crashes on game start. ( usually fixed very quickly and often even on weekends)Yes the optimization is pretty poor depeneding on the in game viewpoint. (Top down view runs fairly smooth on my rig while traveling across the map)Yes there are issues that come and go regarding AI pathing and implementation of the crafting tasks.BUTIs there anything I just mentioned that you wouldn't expect from an Early Access game?The devs always keep a stable branch available that you can play if the experimental branch is too annoying for your tastes.The modders have done a fantastic job of filling in with content that that hasn't been implemented or has changed, sometimes not for the better during  development.it IS difficult and testing of your faith in the beginning. There is no hand holding and your character is no born hero. Just a lowly Joe and everyone will hurt you. But that's the hook. As your character begins to grow and learn there is great satisfaction when you take down the first bully and take all his s**t for your personal use.Satisfaction building your first outpost building.Satisfaction when your researcher discovers a new technology.Satisfaction when your armorsmith or weaponsmith finally creates a noteworthy item.Satisfaction when you complete the last wall and lock your base gate feelling you have created a secure home for your squad.I say this because none of it will come easy and after all of the hours invested you begin to care for your squad. They have worked to become something possibly great and when they get hurt there is a real feeling of anxiety when a member is on the verge of death, laying unconcious and being eaten alive by cannibals or local wildlife.It has been a long drawn out process and the development still continues. There is no story, you become what you choose. Befriend factions, make enemies with entire factions, your choice.If you like long term gameplay (like Eve online) where there is no quick win and you  take pride in what you can achieve over many, many hours then I say by all means it's worth every penny.  If you have no patience and are easily pushed to rage quit, then please purchase to support the devs for ME! and play something else. hahaGood Luck in the world of Kenshi "

								EDIT: I've recently purchased this for my grandma for Thanksgiving and she loves it. Now it's all she talks about at family get togethers!Kenshi will push your boundaries. This is a great item that I enjoy thoroughly, sensually designed and providing the super detailed realistic feel you are looking for. It works so good that my wife gets too loud when we used it and she's worried about waking the kids. Now I'm saving up for two pairs of noise cancelling head phones.			"

								As much as I want to like this game, after so many years in development and the current state it's in I'm done hoping. The idea is great and the style is there, but that's where it's ended and stayed practically from the get-go.Let's face it - Kenshi has been in development for about 10 years now and it's still riddled with issues. Crashes, poor UI, lack of versatility (can't even change font size), and instead of working on these basic issues the devs re-design the entire map, which is arguably no better than the original. I know the dev team is tiny, if not just one person, and they are consistently working on the game, but after such a long time in development I was hoping to see some polish. Instead it feels just like when I first bought it.Suggestion to the dev(s) - I'm sure the money must be drying up now and this suggestion is probably very late, but money makes money and you have to invest to do business. Hire someone else that's good at what you're not, or you are never going to finish this game.			"

								I've been waiting on this game to become playable for like 4 years now. The developer obviously has never had any clear direction in mind for this game. It's just a case of throwing random ♥♥♥♥ together into one hideous abomination. There is no consistency to anything in this game. None of the features feel like they work well together. You start the game and immediately ask yourself ""Okay, what is there to do?"" I still don't have an answer for that. Build a house I guess? But why bother? Get money maybe? Oh that way I can get that one expensive sword at the shop. To do what with? Oh, kill the same old bandits you've been seeing right from the start that use the same old rusty pieces of ♥♥♥♥ swords.Kenshi never progressed from feeling like a tech demo into feeling like an actual game. There is no feeling of progression in this game. There are no goals that feel worth working towards. None of it is satisfying. There's no point to anything. This is not a sandbox game, it is a tech demo at best.			"

								Not a full review just a few words.IF and when this game leaves development I will give a solid review.I have played Kenshi for nearly 130 hrs.. The game has a great foundation, several mechanics that could become inovative in their form and a nack for me to continue to check the developers progress. Unfortunatly, the progress is far and quite few between. I will have to no longer recommend this product to anyone who would be interested until the game reaches something beyond an alpha state.My personal message to the developer: I tip my hat to you and want to thank you for your work on putting this project together. If I am not mistaken, I belive you were the only dev for the game for the greater part of the game coming to life and that in itself is a feat. Keep it up man and show us a major benchmark!-EDIT- 20160120Beta... Soon (TM)... Seriously, this sounds interesting and I am very interested to see the deployment of Kenshi Beta!			"

								Allow me to say this: If you do NOT have a large amount of patience, this game is not for you, at least not yet.Kenshi is a wonderful game, I've sunk days and days of my time into this Early Access, and I love it. The feeling of being horribly puny in a world that seeks to better itself , and then becoming strong enough to crush the world is a feeling only comparable to doing the same thing in your everyday life. That is Kenshi. You write your story, you act it out. Crush your opposition, or bankrupt their pocketbooks? Annihalate the bandits, or help them take over cities? You are, or will, be asked these questions over and over.Another of the great things about Kenshi is that it takes the motto of Urbanprophet; Unfair, Random, Brutality; and takes it to the next level. The game is exceedingly Unfair. You will probably lose men. That one-man army you really want to be? Well, he's lying on the ground, dying slowly after being attacked by 30 bandits. It's a painfully wonderful experience. It is Brutal, the enemies do not go easy on you- You just killed those Samurai's buddies? The entire faction wants you dead now, and you have armies of some of the strongest people in the game after you. Oh, now you can watch your 12 man squad rot slowly on the dusty desert. It is Random. No two people are the same unless they're twins or you made them that way. Every combat experience is utterly random. Yes, there's SOME consistency, as a soldier with 40 combat skill and 40 Defense skill probably won't get taken out by a couple of hungry bandits, but lucky hits DO happen. It can be frustrating to see that up-armored beast get KO'd by some thugs with sticks, but even SAS Operatives get shot by untrained Guerillas. You almost have to be a masochist to play Kenshi. Almost.Unfortunately, the game is consistently buggy, whether it be from minor graphics glitches caused by saving/loading, upto pathing issues that can be game-breaking. It's painful to be forced to watch your men die on the sands, and the fact that the game can't recognize your men are all pretty much dead and allow you to start a new game is a little offensive. The lack of a ""Return to Main Menu"" button is a little disconcerting in itself.In addition to that, it lacks a lot of diversity in its content. The ""Music"" is virtually nonexistent. It almost makes it difficult to want to play the game. Almost. Weaponry and Armor for your characters has a distinctly Asian flair, but doesn't deviate far from that. Combat animations are virtually the same for all people and weapons, and Melee combat is currently all there is. You buy Mercenaries. You kill things. You might even build a base. It's easy to become disillusioned if you aren't patient, or a good role-player.At the moment, the one game I can compare this to is a 3D Version of Caravaneer, without guns, and that is a very good thing. What the developer here tries to pull off is an extensive trade network with fluctuating prices; towns that have surplus stocks and will pay desperately with whatever they can to get what they're on a shortage of. That doesn't happen.Despite all of its flaws, Kenshi is a masterpiece. While dated in its mission, lacking in content, and occasionally utterly monotonous, Kenshi delivers the ultimate RPG experience that even real life cannot give you: The chance to write your own story, completely unfettered by society. The only problem you have left to figure out is: Do you cut your path into the ground, do you line it with the ruins of empires, do you gild it with coin, or do you merely walk it? It's upto you to write the story; it's upto you to buy and play Kenshi.			"

								Kenshi is a refreshing, challenging, and unique sandbox game where there is no main story, no main character, and certainly no friends. That is, unless you make those things happen. But to create that story blood, sweat, and tears must be shed for the bustling town that you build from the ground up or the greatest warriors the land has ever seen to be created. The first few hours of this game are hard, very, very hard. You typically start off with rough spun pants, a medkit, a few hundred Cats (the currency), and a stick in a city within the wasteland. And off you go. No tutorial, no hand holding, no direction as to what you should or can do. There are certainly in-game Help menus you could look through, but you yourself have to discover how to make money for food, where you should avoid going, and how best to survive in a wasteland where you're nothing more than another grain of sand in the dessert, just as easily treaded over, discarded, and forgotten. You can't even kill a lone animal, much less another person, for survival. At least initially. Kenshi is a game where stories, your stories, are made. There are no scripted events, no unkillable NPC's, and plenty of random events that you encounter travelling the wasteland for adventures to happen. I left my base once to explore, found a ruin, almost got killed in it, half my squad limping away carrying the other half of my unconscious, but alive, team. Limping home through a forest before Bam! I got attacked by twenty or so cannibals and somehow, by some miracle, held them off with my wounded, conscious members. The moment when the walls of my base rendered on my screen was filled with so much joy, relief, and amazement that everyone somehow made it back alive still makes me shake my head in disbelief that a game made me experience that.This game is all about growth and development, discovery and adventure, survival and death. It does a remarkable job of invoking the doubts involved with exploring the unknown. Everytime I send out an expedition with enough food and supplies to last a week or more to bring back new trade items or rare treasure I worry whether or not everyone, or anyone at all for that matter, will make it back alive. I don't know what I'll find, what I'll encounter, and if the journey will be worth it. And that's an incredible feeling.This game is still being developed and still has tons of things to improve, but what they have now is a fun, albeit challenging and buggy, squad based, sandbox game where it's you and the world. Is Kenshi, an Eary Access game, worth the $20? Having played almost 52 fun, stressful, amazing hours at the moment of writing I'm very much inclined to say yes, absolutely. A good chunk of time has to be invested to actually experience everything Kenshi currently has to offer and considering that the game isn't even complete yet pleases me, knowing that there's that much more for me to discover.

I do have that game since a few years, but I keep coming back to it, unlike 98% of the games I own. It does keep evolving and keeps getting better, slowly but surely.I definitly recommand this, but this is my personnal favorite.

								I bought this game in 2014. I played it for a little bit, but I couldn't really get into it, and it seemed that the devs had gone awol so I stopped.last weekend I was feeling really burnt out on my go to games and wanted something new, and I spotted Kenshi in my game library. Kenshi was that game that I really regretted buying, but I held on to a hope that I would one day get my money's worth out of it. With this in mind I decided to see if such a day has come, and started her up. I no longer regret getting this game. The devs are updating it, a community has gathered behind it, and it's gameplay is absolutley golden. I've gotten used to the graphics, and even kinda like em now(objectively they are crappy though) and the interface could use some improvement. Once you get used to the controls, and begin to see how things work in this unique world the devs have created, the rough edges start to fall away.I've never been one to write reviews, but I felt that I needed to share because there are definitely alot of people like me who picked this up in the earlier days and abandoned it to what we thought was going to be a silent death. If you are one of those fellows I recommend you give the game another try.			"

								If Mad Max, Samurai Champloo, and The Dark Tower had a weird kid that ran around shirtless with nothing but a rusty katana and an empty stomach, then it would be this game.The setting is unique, taking place in a varied post-apocalyptic enviroment that's soon to be expanded with a shiny new map. Combat is dangerous and every encounter has the potential to be your last. Numerous factions have their wars and alliances, and you can participate if you want, or just loot the corpses like a gross human vulture that has no honor.The problem with the games are thus: The engine isn't the best in the world, so graphically it's rather unimpressive, however the artists have done a great job with worldbuilding and locations look unique enough that graphical limitations don't hinder the game at all. Another possible gripe is that the early game's combat is very, very hard. You will be knocked out for most of your time with Kenshi without proper preperation. It's stupid to brave the wasteland alone, you aren't the Dragonborn; you're Jeff from accounting who's decided to become a vagrant warrior with little to know chance of survival. That being said, a larger party and training vis a vie the practice dummies can make combat easier.All in all Kenshi has been developed slowly over a long period of time, and it's clear the developers have put love into their game. Updates are progressing steadily and adding in new content and features. Kenshi's a good game now, but it'll be a great game when it gets released.			"

								As an owner of this game for nearly two years I can say that it has come a LONG WAY from when I purchased it. I rarely write reviews but after reading the negitive ones below I felt compelled to add my two cents. While development has been slow, it has been consistent. For me I purchased this game because I liked the concept and I wanted to support its development, not because I wanted to play it (yet!). I would say that while buggy, the game is fully playable now, and really stands apart from any other game I have played. If you enjoy a CHALLENGING RPG/Open world steam punk sim, and you want to support the developers who tackled this very ambitious project, then BUY IT!			"

I've had this game for almost a year I think but it seems like out of all the other games I play, I would rather play those. This game need a few minor bugs fixed and needs to have a few more additions to it that capture players into playing it more. Other than this I don't really have anything bad to say about it.

								I don't write reviews, infact this is the only one i've done or probably will do because this is my favorite game on steam.Pros:-The ability to customize units is what sold me on this. I've always loved being able to make my own stories and characters within a game and it works well in this.-There is always a new story to tell with your character(s). Example: Getting kidnapped by cannibals and barely escaping(if at all), then building/training an army and taking your revenge on them.-You can mod the game, however it isn't the most straight foward and there are not too many made for it yet. You can find some on the nexus, if you know what you are doing.-Updates. The makers of this game DO release updates and patches even if they do take a while, adding new content that stack layers of gameplay. If you do some research you can see the guy who made this game loves it and truely wants to see it finished (even hired more people to help build it).Cons:-Like I said, the updates can take a long time to come out but they do.-Some people experience bugs and crashes while others do not.-Once you get your characters up to a certain level in combat it may become a little too easy. However, they are adding new stuff to keep it challenging.If you enjoy these games you may enjoy this one:X-com, Age of Empires, Mount and bladeOver-all I give this game a 8.5/10 in the experimental beta build. Like a fine wine, it gets better with time.			"

								It was "" 29 Oct, 2013 @ 12:07pm "" when I created my review on the game, I praised it with such adoration but times change and thanks to the sales it has been brought to my attention. My first question is; why hasn't this game been completed yet? I shall now answer my own question with: it is because of you, the loyal customer, only you the ones who have been active in the forum have interfered with this game being completed the way it was intended. How? You ask? People like to demand that the developers include everything under the sun they desire, pointless trivial things such as 'race' and I recall someone mentioned 'hot-air balloons' and so on and so forth. Let us all remind ourselves that this is a post-apocalyptic world that thrives because of its realism, now then, I've had this game since it came out and I am certain this game was never supposed to go down the road of 'races' and the mystical such. If you are angry that this game is not complete like I am, it is because of said developers not having a clear focus and an active forum. Now I am not saying it is a bad thing that the developers are allowing their customers to influence the game I mean, we paid for it, we should be allowed to have a say, yes that is good practice but what annoys me is when the game starts to spin off into a half complete spiral of forever being at 50% because people keep asking for 'cool' stuff and as a result unforseen bugs occur that require manhours to fix which all builds up and here we are. Now they have added cannibals, and I think great, something to keep the player focused on their...well, squad I guess, this might have been a player-suggested idea although from the general feel of the game when I had first made my review I could have predicted a group as such existing. My only main issue, is that the game often finds itself struggling to balance the micro-management aspect and the combat aspect of the game, for example, at the beginning of the game, you are by your own (assuming you picked either the merchant or the default spawn), you have to survive and learn, you lure some bandits into a city they get violently murdered and you sell their stuff, get some more squad members, rinse and repeat, it's great fun, I'm sure each player would agree. THEN we are tempted into creating our own city.The city building is a fun aspect but it simply becomes a process of just sitting on your ♥♥♥♥ staring into nothing watching your members work away for hours on end until you travel back to sell your wares, remember that there are bandits, end up having to sacrifice a slower member for the 'greater good' and then get back into the combat aspect, bored of base building. All-in-all I'd still actually suggest that you buy this game but just don't expect too much clarity in where this game will end up.  "

								This game is so original it is teeming with potential - I mean it is like a clash of Samurais in an apocalyptic setting and - SOON TO BE - Deus Ex kind of ♥♥♥♥ going on (Robotic Limbs). Though if you dislike a game with a medium learning curve you'd have to dump that habit and have patience with this game, because this game, Kenshi, is a game worth playing.			"

								Well Ive been playing this for a few days and I love the game, as long as it works. It bugs out 70% of the time.I understand its an alpha game. Its been six years, so I figured Id try it out.The experimental mode is very unstable and game over before you can get too far in your quests.I don't recommend getting this game until they do more work on it. Not playable in my opinion.Lots of hoping and wishing here because this game has a lot of potential.			"

								In 2016 I can safely say that abandoned games get updated at a faster rate. You know those games that sound very, very good? Kenshi is one of those games. Unfortunately, Kenshi has sounded very good for a long time now and hasn't actually had much added to it. You'll spend most of your time watching a character walk from place to place while keeping the game on fast forward. But perhaps the combat is redeeming, you say? Nope, you fast forward that too. In fact, there's very little reason to not just play this game on fast forward the entire time. It's basically a watching simulator. But the fun doesn't end there. The forums are rather heavily censored and anything that isn't praise toward the developers is deleted and followed by a ban. As of now, I don't think people who don't own kenshi can even post there. This is clearly just an attempt to censor the forum more heavily.So, why should you consider kenshi? Well, if you like games that have been in development for years with minimal progress it's right up your alley! If you like games where you hit an endgame with almost nothing to do it's perfect as well!And if you go to the forum for tips you'll be told to ""make your own game(Within kenshi)."" Yup, the consistent suggestion on the forum is to make your own little game, with your own rules and a load of artificial difficulty that you impose on yourself.  The reason for this is, of course, that there's absolutely nothing else to do. You make a little base, get a few guys, and that is it. That is completion of the game. It's not even a matter of ignoring a bunch of features. That is all the features right now(and has been for a very long time).			"

								This is roughly how it went for me. The first 10 hours I was just running away from things and reloading, cursing at the game and wondering how you were supposed to play this if you just got jumped all the time. The next 10 hours was spent discovering things, some on my own and some from searching. I got a small group of people together and saved up several thousand working resource nodes outside the cities. Whenever I had to travel though I was just running away from things and reloading, cursing at the game and wondering how you were supposed to play this if you just got jumped all the time.Then I started to get my bearings in the game. I learned that losing is part of the experience, literally part of the experience. If you pick an even fight and don't come out on top, you've still gained big defensive stats on anyone that didn't die. At that point, about 30 hours deep into the experience, I realized I just started. Game mechanics start springing up and spider-webbing outward. Character advancement, technology research, crafting, settlement management, supply runs, training, assaults, battles, wars. Now every time I assemble my elite crew of four to the gate, I get excited that I have so many options to choose from. We go to a city, make some money, recruit more people for the town, work their strength up a little to make some more money nearby, buy some supplies and sneak them back up.The game creeps up on you and owns you with complex, interesting things to do. The mechanics, dialog, options and behavior of npcs are deep and seem very well thought out. I often find myself doing something I fully expect to result in losing something and figure out the game already thought of it and provided an option. And if you're worried there may not be enough RPG in it for you, each and every character you recruit is playable, equippable and trainable independently. The vanilla cap is I think 30 right now total recruitable, but there is a mod already that increases it to 256. Give it some time and you'll be hooked.			"

								So with the latest 20 hours added to the timer, i think i get the main idea of what the game is so far, please do pay attention to the date of this review as this is to the corrisponding version, now to give a short summary, the game has bugs, it has memory leaks, so expect to restart it a few times a day if you're limited to 4 gigs of ram like me, it looks okay in graphics department, nothing amazing, but i would rather have this then games that pose the best thing in it is the graphic's, because Beautiful looking Crap is still just crap... this game poses as a Sandbox Survival RTS that i suggest you only play if you're ready for some depressing notions of racism in it's own sense... the rest will explain but for those who just want the short review, i DO suggest this game, but to a rather... certain audience...Pros:-Customization, Most RTS games just give you a set number of looks and style and that's just it, while this game HAS that, you can make ""Your"" characters look however you want, 4 races, plenty of attributes from facial to physical body, this game let's you make your team as unique as you desire.-No levels, Just skill and survival, and this can be an issue in some cases, the game has added a hunger meter (and also a mod to remove it for beginners, just look through the workshop.) and note, most things you fight one on one, WILL kill you, now note, this game has factions, and there far, other people will join the fight, if it's against you however, you may be rather... dead, in the next few seconds, you're NOT the chosen one, you're a new person in this harsh world, and you have to EARN your power the obvious ways, running around will make you run faster, carrying heavy stuff will make you stronger, taking hits will make you more durable... if you survive.-The whole world is free to Roam... Granted if it's Not Owned... i say this because this game goes on common sense in that, if it's there, you should be able to go there, BUT it also knows that, if it's someone's home... well you're not link are you? this is'nt hyrule, this is a game that makes common sense REAL common real fast, and the open world outside towns is open for more then just combat...-Base Building, want to build a town? Have the recourses, go ahead, but make sure you know this location is ideal for what your setting up, because this game won't hold your gand in this, it's either you get ahead, just get by, or get dead... and this does have it's pros, but don't think just having a place to call your own makes you safe, if fact... it can attract some... unwanted attention-Time, and Pause, this i feel is a requirement, if a game as relentless as this DIDN'T have this? well... it's a small note, but deffinitely still worth noting, it atleast let's you think about what you're gonna do next...-No Story, Exept Your's, this game has no story mode, it's you, the world, and whatever you do in it, or don't do, and quite frankly, i feel for a game like this, is a good thing.-Multiple ways to start, start with a group, or alone, start with a dog, or as a slave, or a prisoner, it give's many ways to play, most however, WILL be a challenge...-Character Value, a jack of all trades is a master of none, not to say you can't train all character's in everything, but you'll be spending a few months to try with just a couple characters... overall, this game makes you pick and choose of your own will what person will do what, by this i mean, you can have everyone fight with no healer's or anyone building a bse, BUT you will die very fast, there's also permadeath... so yeah, once they die, they're gone...And now the notes i'm affriad count against this peice...Cons:-Memory Leaks, as said before, this game has issues with even the 5required specs, after 3-4 hours, 4 gigs will be lookin... bare... and the game will lag to the point it'll be getting difficult, but then again, any game that tries this WILL run into this, so this is really more of a given...-Almost Depressing, this game can be rather... Depressing, so anyone with the idea that they can feel better from playing this game when you're in a bad mood, unless you're a masochist and even then... the game has a nation, known as the ""Holy Nation"" that hates anything and anyone who is NOT human, and will either demand you die by them on site while sparring those who are human, or just downright kill you and the other's, it gives that sense that ""Are you different? Die For it!"" that makes it kinda feel difficult to...well yeah... i'm not gonna ask them to change it by any means, i just can't recommend this for a certain audience or two...And now things that are both or neither good and/or bad that are still worth noting,Nuetrals:-Early Acess, this means the game still has a way to go before saying it's finished, so if you buy this expecting a finished game, then don't buy it until the early access catagory disappears from the named tags on this game, it's still subjected to change, be updated in major ways, and over all, it's NOT a finished game...-Bugs, i place this in nuetral because, YES it's bad, BUT they WILL be fixed, and as such as of the current time, there is a bug that annoys me a bit but i beleive it can be player fixed by rebuilding nav mesh in game, in the notion that if you put your character's in a closed space, they will stop moving and if you try to move they will go to the gate you just close and open it before moving to the designated spot...Overall, yes i recomend this game, but i would like to note, Not for it's ""Fun"" factor, because it CAN be fun, once you find a correct way to do thing's your way, there is not a ""set in Stone"" correct way to do things because this is a sandbox game in it's fullest extent, but positive and negitive are in this, if you want a challenge in sandbox survival RTS, this is the best one Iv'e found, just be ready to die if you are'nt ready to fight...

								I've had this game before it even came out on steam, it has come such a long way since then. A lot of people complain that the dev team isn't working on the game enough but the dev team is a long list of roughly 3 people last I checked, it began as a one man project so updates are slow to come out but thats because there's such a small team. The big draw to the game is seeing how far you came. When you start you are the suckiest person in the game, and there is no better feeling than seeing the character you start with be able to take on 4 guys at the same time because you know how much work you put into that character's growth. If you don't like games that require a huge amount of investment this is not for you because it takes hours to understand why the game is great. 5/7 perfect score "

								Why you should buy this game?I actually bought this game many years ago off the lofi website as i really liked the concept of what he was trying to achieve. The game had no sound. Was totally empty, but somehow seemed really cool still.Many years down the line we now have this beauty of a game! Its not what i would call a mainstream game. Kenshi is hard and if you mess up it punishes you for it. It still has some bugs yes, but there is enough content and a big enough world map to really get stuck in and explore and do what you want. There are frequent updates, usually once or twice a month that add significant content. Only half the actualy map is currently in play. Its huge, so dont worry about ever running out of things to do.Buy this game. For me, its the only early access game i have not been dissapointed in.			"

								TL;DR: Yes.As of this current day (2nd of March, 2017), I can honestly say Kenshi is worth it, after a long period of ""not quite there yet"". But for the love of everything that is good and decent, INSTALL THIS GAME TO AN SSD! Seriously! The loading times and the general performance are still awful!I've been game since the 0.2x alpha, can't exactly remember which exact version, but it was the one before the first foliage update. Back then, the game was pretty barebones. All you could do was to wander around beating bandits or the members of bigger factions up, until your character became a god of war. The game had so much potential, but little to do in terms of diversity. The game also crashed constantly, the pathfinding was abysmal and everything was generally clunky and frustrating, so I couldn't really recommend the game.Now, the performance is still crap, the pathfinding is still occasionally annoying (although much more tolerable than what it used to be) and everything is still quite clunky. But the game has so much to offer, it packs in so many great details, and it's all-around a completely unique experience!Kenshi is an RTS sandbox, with relatively heavy emphasis on RPG elements, one which absolutely doesn't hold your hand with pillow-padded tutorials and scaling levels of enemies. It drops you to a cold, incredibly merciless and unforgiving world, where your survival, a pathetic little weakling that you are, is tough! You need food, you need weapons, you need armor, you need a MUCH higher skills to do anything, you need allies... even the lowliest of bandits will beat your starting character with ease, and don't except any kind of one-on-one action, as these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s will outnumber you ten-to-one! And when they beat you senseless, they take loot your body and take your precious food - and that's the best case scenario! If your opponent happens to be a fogman, a cannibal or a wild animal, it will probably eat you as well!But the beauty of Kenshi isn't just the magnificently cruel, beautifully crafted game world with tons of places to explore and millions of incredible little details that no other game offers, it's when you FINALLY make it! When you finally recover from the beatdown, when you finally rebuild yourself stronger, when you finally get back to those #¤%&/! bandits and shove their rusty sticks down their throats, when you finally save your tortured comrades from slavery, when you finally have a place of your own, when you finally make your base self-sufficient... that's when the game feels like an accomplishment! This trick is hard to pull off by a game, but Kenshi absolutely nails it.Unfortunately, the game isn't without its flaws. The unforgiving nature of the game can be a turn-off to some people, so if you expect a relaxing base-building game, look elsewhere. As mentioned before, the game absolutely requires an SSD at its current state, or else you can expect hideously long loading times ALL THE TIME. Some UI elements, as the game mechanisms in general, are incredibly clunky and probably will always be. But if you can look past its flaws, Kenshi is an incredible experience, one which I can definitely recommend! :)			"

								Kenshi, Kenshi, Kenshi you are like a mistress on the side of real life. I wish I could put more time into you but things (work, child, fiance) keep getting in our way of eternal love. I know I keep promising that I can just leave them and we could spend the rest of our days frollicking in meadows of beautiful flowers, desert landscapes and the occasional cannibal lair. I know we could be happy together taking on adversary and even build a place we can call home from nothing but the goods we traded from our previous lives. I feel like I am at war with some holy group telling me my feelings are false and us being together serves a dark purpose. I shall enter you and end up leaving just before we get to the fun stuff while I am seen by prying eyes behind my back and whispering voices telling me this is not real and I shouldnt be spending my spare time with you. I hope you can understand that I am torn in every direction but yours as I know you do not judge me for letting you sit idle while I create false memories with people who will never understand me like you do. Maybe someone else will pick you up and have the wonderful times we have had, I would be sad to see you with someone else but happy that you get to have the adventures we have spent those dark nights dreaming of together. Kenshi if this is our last moments, I would like you to know that I rate you a solid 8/10 although I know you are currently just a bud on a bush about to blossom into a beautiful flower and will only increase in enjoyability.

								The game I've always wanted. Kenshi is a genre-defying game that's quarter RPG, quarter City-Building, and half Action. You can start anywhere from a group of settlers to injured, starving, and penniless and work your way upwards from there. Unlike most games, Kenshi sees no difference between the player and NPCsYou are not The HeroEvery action has consequencesDefinetly the most underrated game in Steam.			"

								TL;DR:It's a true to the word Alpha so it crashes and there are clearly parts of the game that do not work yet. However, the greater vision for what the game will be is clear and it clearly is going to be a game of epic proportions with plenty of replayability.Full Review:The game lets you play as you wish. Want to be a BA swordsman with an elite squad of goons? Done. Want to be tader making your way through the waste lands? Done. Want to settle your own town and be the greatest blacksmith in the land? Done. Want to by a sleezy tief in the night? Done.The game has a fantastic engine that allows you level your character based on the actions he takes. If you fight a lot, he will become better at fighting. If you run around a lot he becomes a faster runner. Carry heavy things - builds strength. Unit growth is very organic, though you can also setup tasks to help power level guys as well.The main game, which is not completed yet, will allow you to effectively build your own clan. You will be able to raid other towns and even take them over. If you do not want to run your own clan with towns then you can try your hand at being a merchinary in one of the many conflicts that will going on around the map.The game is also introducing multiple races and ambient creatures that will kick your butt!!All the fun stuff aside there are some drawbacks. At the time of the post this is still very much in Alpha. The game crashes regularly, your save files become outdated or unable to be retrieved often, and your are constantly tantilzed by the features you can see but not use. For an Alpha it is pretty playable though and the dev makes balancing changes every so often so that the game remains fun to play.If you cannot handle losing your entire saved game or getting randomly kicked this is not the time to buy, wait for the proper release. If you can't wait to be a steampunk samuri in a desert wasteland then by all means get it!			"

								Kenshi, holy ♥♥♥♥, where do I start with this one? Hmmm, how about my experience on my first proper playthrough(s).....I started with a new playthrough after re-installing this game yesterday, as the default wanderer. All was well, at first. I spawned in Blister Hill. I mined some iron, sold the iron to a trader in Blister Hill and got a fair amount of money doing so. I built a small outpost with a shack, farm and a well down near the river, just outside of Blsiter Hill. My crops were growing fine, I had a fair bit of money but I needed some materials, so I mined more iron and made more money in the easiest way I knew how, MINING!!! After I arrived back from Blister Hill I noticed all my crops had dissappeared, ""what?"" I thought to myself, ""How?"" I originally thought the starving bandits had knocked me over, so I replanted my crops, mined more iron, sold more iron in Blister Hill and after arriving back for the second time....my crops where missing, again. So I re-replanted them, headed to the Holy Farm to get some stuff, come back and my crops had gone AGAIN. At this point I was just baffled, ""a glitch maybe?"" I re-re-replanted my crops, waited in my shack and nothing.....then I see my character yell out ""BY OKRANS HAIRY NIPPLES"" he draws out his sword and sprints out of the shack, I pan the camera and a dozen of these rat creatures with 2 legs are eating my ♥♥♥♥ing crops. ""No match for me"" I thought, wow how I was wrong. I get completley destroyed and killed by these creatures. RIP Zan.Second playthrough, this time as a trader with a pack bull, seems fun! I spawn in some remote area with a few buildings dotted around the place, I decide to head to Blister Hill and sell my luxury goods that I spwaned with. Less than 5 minutes in, I get ambushed by cannibals, my bull gets killed and I get kidnapped. Then, the cannibal just stops walking, glitches and I am stuck like this for around 10 minutes, dying on this skinny cannibals shoulder. ""♥♥♥♥ sake, new game it is...again""RIP Bill.Third playthrough, this time as the retired army captain, ♥♥♥♥ yeah dude. I chose him due to my 2 previous characters being absolutley dreadful when it comes to combat. I spawn in The Hub, a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ full of low-lives and outlaws, I find an iron vein, so I repeat the mining method in order to get some money. I have 5 raw iron ore, I see a building just outside of The Hub, I walk in, sell my iron and buy a nice sword to go with my other one, I step out of the building and BAM, badnits do me over and loot my weapons......""This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke"" I shout out loud. Fortunatley, I recover and the traders kill the bandits, unfortuntaley the one who robbed me, took off with my swords. I loot an iron club off one of the bandits, buy some food and set off. I approach a hive village, BAM. Ambushed by cannibals and kidnapped again.....""Wow, what the ♥♥♥♥!?!!?"" I exclaim, fortunatley I am saved by these bug looking ant men, who are actually rather nice! I set up camp outside of the hive village, mine some copper, sell to the trader, make some more money and set off to greener pastures. BAM, ambushed by fogmen, kidnapped and hauled around the fog islands for about 20 minutes until cannibals attack and kill my kidnappers. I play dead, then immediatley run for the hills. I run into a cannibal, who is not attacking me. ""Talking meat?"" he says, I ask him not to eat me due to my body being diseased with plague ""STILL HAVE TO EAT"" he yells back at me, BAM, his posse attack me, kidnap me and again I am hauled around the map, knocked out cold, then, starving bandits save me! ""OMG Saved again, thank ♥♥♥♥"" I say to myself......no, the bandits then knock me out, steal my food and take off. I wake up from a recovery coma, heal myself then limp off toward Mongrel, A town located in the fog islands. I arrive, and to make more money, I mine a nearby iron source. I go to the weapons trader with my recently aqquired iron, ""OHHH a smithing machine, I'll make armour plates and get ♥♥♥♥ loads of money"" I work on the armour plates in the shop, then I take my armour plate, a message pops up ""Caught stealing"" I get attacked by 20+ guards and arrested for taking an armour plate that I MADE.....""♥♥♥♥. THIS. GAME.""Kenshi is a nightmare, its harder than life, harder than dark souls, but it's actually fun to play. You arent a god, you are a weak, feeble character looking to make a name for themselves, and man it is hard. The graphics are bad, the performance is awful at times due to poor omptimization but the gameplay and replayability of this game is outstanding. The world, that seems to be a mix of Japanese culture mixed in with some steam/cyber-punk aspects, has an interesting story with weird characters inhabiting it, what a strange yet good game Kenshi is.I hated this game at first, which is why I ultimatley uninstalled it a few months back. The game just needs time for you to grow attatched to it, which bizzarely, will happen. "

								loads of reviews as well as you tube videos tend to share player stories about their game. That's because Kenshi leaves the story up to you in a way many games fail to do these days.You could lead the life of a simple farmer, or rise up to warlord and face the holy nation, be a trader, slave, a bounty hunter or just a scum bag scavenger making a living off loot from the dead. It's a game you put away and come back to later on again, and for that reason alone it's worth the money.			"

								9/10! I love this game! I am not usually one that enjoys really difficult games, but there is something about the brutal difficulty of this game that actually keeps me around. It's not like ""Oh I'm not good enough..."" kinda hard, it's more ""I need patience and dedication to prevail"" kinda hard. Basically, you start as a nobody. There are different backgrounds and starts, which I love, but I also love that the game is unforgiving. You can't just kill a group of raiders, hell, you probably can't even kill one at the start. The difficulty of this game is appropriate, and lends to the brutality of the harsh reality in which your characters live. With time, one can really succeed and have fun with this game. The challenges along the way, those are really the best part. I am a self-professed save-scummer when it comes to many games, but despite saving very often, I find myself reverting to old loads less often in this game than others. Devastating things occur to my party, but the way it happens... most of the time I just roll with it!This game features multiple ways to play, perhaps one of it's coolest features. You can get by as a lone wolf, stealing and killing while living on the run. Perhaps you yourself wish to organize a group to raid cities and farms. Maybe you wish to raise an army to do with what you please as you traverse the wastelands... in any case, you have a great deal of freedom. Basically, you can play it like a single player RPG, or more like an RTS, city builder, merchant goods management, etc. There are a few bugs, but nothing really gamebreaking. Another feature I love is that they allow you to import your old characters/buildings and so on into new versions of the game as it approaches release. There are factions in the game, and it is particularly interesting when you get involved with any of them. The factions are all unique and have interesting relationships with one another. Luring that band of bandits up to that Holy Nations City you visited may be the perfect distraction you need to rob them blind.As I mentioned before, this game is BRUTAL! My beloved characters have been enslaved, tortured/forcefully starved to death, murdered in cold blood and even eaten alive... that's right, I said EATEN ALIVE!!! Normally in games when my characters get, let's say, eaten alive, I save-scum to the save before that happened. This game encourages me to go along with the brutality though. I had a party of 17 characters or so, while running to a certain city, we were attacked. We fended off the Fog Men at first... but they kept coming... hoardes of them! All but two of my characters were left standing, carrying the wounded bodies of two other characters to safety (which in itself had my blood rushing!). As 4 of my characters got to safety, rested up and healed up, 3 were EATEN ALIVE by the Fog Men. I used what little money I had and sold everything to hire 2 more characters to join the party. We went out and managed to pick off the Fog Men that escorted our friends by setting up ambushes at tactical points. Thus far I have saved all but 1 of the captured members of my party (minus the 3 that were EATEN ALIVE), doing tactical stealth missions, solo runs and distraction assaults.Overall this game is outstanding! The aesthetic feel of it is perfect, mixing the feel of like a sumurai feudal system in the post-apocalypse. The difficulty of the game can make it a tough pill to initially swallow, but it is well worth it. The characters and races are unique (I love the Hive characters and the robotic mechanid ones, sooo cool!) Everything is fitting for the environment, nothing stands out as too high tech or too low tech. You can tell that this is the remnance of a world that once had tech, but that technology is long forgotten. There is electricity to some extent, but only what windmills and such can generate. Think Mad Max and/or Waterworld tech. Despite the brutal difficulty and the patience/sacrifice needed to succeed, I would give this game a 9/10 (as of patch 0.93 or so). I anticipate my score my go up when the game reaches full release.			"

								great game. constantly being updated with new features and huge bug fixes. you can build up a huge army or keep a small party of warriors, builders, doctors, etc and build your own city where NPC's will come and visit and buy items that you manufacture. Great game and get a lot of time out of it. I recommend looking up other reviews as well as youtube videos because it is a unique type of game, not everyone will love it.I can not recall any games being anything like this, and for that reason it offers great releif from the average game genres that can eventually get old, no matter how fun the game is. I am very much looking forward to see what new features will be added on when it reaches it's complete state, as I'm sure everything that will be added will be very new concepts and things you just don't see or do much of in other games.

								This is seriously one of the coolest games I have played.  The whole game is based around you and your sqaud, wait...  Scratch that...  This game hates you...  You aren't the biggest baddest guy in the world, you aren't going to be able to defeat an army by yourself, you can't do shiznit in this game...  Unless you work for it...The only way to get anywhere in this game is to work for it.  If you want to be the strongest man in the game, you have to train long and hard.  If you want a giant city, you have to get the resources, and build it by hand.One of the coolest parts about this game is the work mechanics.  Say you want one guy to be your engineer and build all the buildings and such.  Well, you aren't always going to be building things, are you?  No, so you set engineering as your permanent job, which means that if there is a building job going on, then he will do it.  And then his second job may be researching, so when there is no building going on, he is researching more buildings.This game may be an alpha, but I have played 25 hours and it seems like there is still more to research and build.  There is no sound, but the Torchlight 1 soundtrack sounds pretty good in the background!  So yeah, if you want a game where you aren't the biggest baddest guy in existence, get this game...			"

								I found Kenshi to be quite the enjoyable game that you can use to immerse yourself for hours in without realising that time has actually passed. even though it is still in the alpha stages it provides the player with with challenges right from the get go no matter the starting that you choose it never fails to force the player to resort to obtaining help from the city guards in quite a number of larger scale engagements. it allows the player to travel a quite literal sandbox world finding their own goals and objectives from the singular large time bounty hunter to the creation of new settlements and factions that can be used to take over the entire world, and with it still in alpha stages the developers (Lo-Fi games) are still releasing bits and pieces of the game as they slowly make their way to obtaining their finished version, I for one am excited to see the end result from this ambitious company just knowing how good the game currently is and the possible amazing outcome that awaits it in the end. 9.5/10			"

								TL:DR? Buy it, would lay unconcious being robbed by bandits again.As I write this I lay unconcious with my face in the desert sands after being mobbed on a lone trade run by hungry desert bandits.  They taught me not to run over burdened.Kenshi is Warband+1.It will take time to get to grips with the UI - which is improved from some of the youtube videos I watched before buying it.I'm playing it on an i5 1.8mHz laptop with nvidia 710M, and it insits on using the cruddy inel graphics card.  But this doesn;t affect gameplay for me.Returning to the desert to wait out my survival coma.  On the plus side I am not bleeding.  Though the bandits took all my inventory - including a sword which I aqquired from a samarai who was erm, sleeping face down in the desert!Love the game, give it some time.If you like warband you'll love this.  RPG/business/hack/slash.Though all I've done so far is get beat up and turn in a dying man for a bounty :)			"

								Kenshi took me by surprise i thought it was going to just be okay but man i love this game and have put 26 hours into it over 3 days The game has a lot of content for an Alpha like farming crafting cooking weapon and armor  smiting and a lot more to come. it is an open world squad RPG where you can build you own towns and bases. it has a cool  skill system where you person gets stronger just by walking around carrying a lot and gets faster by running more.  the game forces you to do nothing, don't want a squad you don't need one, don't want a base you don't need one!In the begging i was horrible and it took me around 3 tries to start a game where I didn't die in the first 30mins and even now i have close calls  This is by far the best Early Access game i have played!! highly recommended!!!!The developers are in touch with the community and have a clear road map, that this game will follow and its posted in the forms now Go!! look up some videos and read some more my fellow gamersI hope you will one day be wondering the sand covered dunes of Kenshi very soon			"

								Kenshi is a fun game, but there are a few deal-breakers that I hope get future attention:-No way to recruit new guys (in the latest version) without forking over thousands at a time. There is maybe one character I've encountered that is willing to join you, and he costs 6000 in game currency.-And you're gonna need some help, because the game is irritatingly difficult when beginning. I know it is supposed to be a challenge, but the only way to level your guy is to follow around a patrol which may or may not encounter hostile groups. Even then, expect to get only a few hits in before the patrol wipes out the enemy.-Getting your character to attack is a hassle. Right clicking works some of the time. Other times you have to hold right click over an enemy and tell your character to attack him.-The staggering animation after being hit often leaves you open to another attack, which can stagger you again. Kinda lame considering that...-The punishment for losing a fight is way too severe. When you get KO'd you can be waiting upwards of 300+ seconds to have your guy wake up. After bandaging yourself, you must limp/walk to the nearest city to sleep if you don't have the materials to make a camp bed. Getting to the nearest city can take long enough, but sleeping till recovery takes waaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy too long considering how the rest of this recovery process goes...-If you do make a camp bed, because limping to the nearst town takes too long, I hope you don't mind spending the night with bandits or dogs, who will stand over you until you wake up. And then kill you. And if it was dogs instead of bandits, then you might as well make a new game, because they're not going anywhere after you get KO'd.-Poor optimization in its current state.A lot of people enjoy the game, and for good reason. Just be warned that you might find this game to be pretty tedious, frustrating, and possibly unplayable. I'd say to wait a while before buying.			"

								Actual Review after the first chunk of Text.I've been reading quite a few Negative Reviews about this game complaining about how it's bugged and how slow the development on this is, though I do not find this negative, especially since this game Is in Early Access and in it's Alpha Stage. People complain about games not being Bugfree while they are still in Early Access, which is meant to help the developers to improve the game by finding said bugs and reporting them to them. About the development being slow though, yes i have to agree the development is quite slow, with the game being in Early Access / Alpha for over 5 years now, though they do release updates quite regularly most of the time. well now that this rant is over on to the Actual Review.Kenshi is a Squad Based Open World Role playing Game that is currently in it's Alpha (for over 5 years now).The Game in it's current version has already quite a lot to offer, especially with some of the bigger updates still coming up. The Development on this game can be quite slow since it is being produced by a small Team consisting of 6 Actual members and a few Volunteers and Freelancers.Positives about the Game:+ You currently have quite a Huge map that you can explore and build your base on with more and different Land to be released in a future update.+ You aren't god in this game, you are a basic human (or group of humans) that has to survive in the desert (maybe other places in later updates), not more, not less.+ The game is actively being Developed even if it may be slow, the game has been receiving updates for over 5 years now so I'll doubt that the studio has any plans on abandoning it.+ Has great music (not too much different music but great music)Negatives:- You won't get a full on Role Playing feel yet as the game is still in development.- A bit hard to get into at first- Kinda slow development though i don't blame them, I have enough respect for them for even trying to make a game like this.- Obviously, you will experience Bugs since it's in Early Access.Final Verdict:This Game is already great and shows potential to become one of my favorite Squad Based RPGs. If you are a fan of games like these go ahead and buy it, but be aware that the Game is still in Early Access / Alpha which means you won't get a full on ""Finished Game"" experience. Early Access is here to help Developers find bugs and help them find ideas not for actually playing the game early. So if you want to help the Development (even if it is quite slow sometimes) go ahead and get it. But if you want a full game experience wait until the Game gets out of Early Access somewhen.			"

								Not to bad for a little EA. Seems my library is filling with those. Not a whole lot to do at this time except roam the waste and find new members, and sadly they dont respawn, so once you empty a bar out of potentials thats it. Otherwise its about build your base / manufacturing facility and then set out to make money. The combat is rough at first, your so overclassed, but just because your team is beaten down does not mean its over, sometimes some wake up or are just playing dead and will get up after the bad guys leave and you can save your team with them. Its also persistent in damage, if a guy has a bum leg, he will limp, and slow the party down. Having the best weapons and armor wont save you either, you can have it but if you dont know how to use it then its just a burden and for show. Lots of fun though. I dont feel like I wasted anything on this one.			"

Early Access Review
								Used to be my favorite game of all time.  Now I find the map & content to be cluttered.  It used to be about samurai, and now it's about something I don't understand yet.  The game expanded too much on too many different things & themes at once, which took away its main appeal to me.  If you're looking for a samurai game, then this isn't it unfortunately.  I bought it when it was a game about swordsman traveling the land making a name for their self.  Now there's monsters, the map is too big, overpowered NPC's in large massive groups and despawning NPC's.  I feel like every single update for the past year or so, has not made the game any better, if anything.. all of it feels random to me.  Why are there monsters?  How do they make the game any better?  What's the point in the map being so large when the game insists that you build a base and just turtle your entire playthrough.  Things like being a merchant is really dumb now with how large the map is and so on.  Seems like the only ideal way to play this game is to turtle at a base, and bait enemies into your harpoon nest.  Game used to be more of a ""do whatever you want"" now it's just a RTS survival game.  Having enemies in a massive group (like 20+) teaches you that you should be prioritizing getting the largest squad, not attacking anyone, and baiting bandits into them for the first 20+ hours.  NPC's need to be more scattered, not only are these NPC's capable of soloing 10 of your dudes, but they also have to be in a large group?  There's nothing you can do other than cheese it with harpoon nests, play it like a base building simulator and hope you don't get bored by the time you get strong enough to engage in the content.  All the other NPC's are turtling also, some of the races have like 50+ or something NPC's all cluttered in a single town.  So attacking a single one will get you mobbed quickly.			"

								After searching for a game that even resembled Mount & Blade. I was able to find this gem of a game. I have played way more hours then what is currently said on steam, I had the game before they even put it on steam but I don't recall how long ago that was. Anyway this game is amazing and I love how unique it is from every game. The game first will first ask what gameplay do you want to start was and the option was wanderer and something else. Then you got thrown into game and had your character customize screen show up to change the way your character looked and name him as well. Then it would make you feel that you could not fight alone in the game and that you were just weaker then everyone since they've been through experiences that you haven't even experienced yourself like fighting. Since then they've added tons of new features like farming, mining, and crafting, as well as a lot of new defensive weapons at our disposal. They haven't done an update in a long time though since the next one is supposedley the 64-bit build, new pathfinding engine, and the map too. So i'll update this review when it comes out.			"

								A great sand box game, with a promising future. An interesting progresion of your characters, they dont start as powerfull as is the nowadays norm, infact they are really weak and have to be really carefull and lucky. But suriving long enough in this game brings great joy. The only game i can compare with Kenshi would be dark souls series. They are both really hard, and involve a lot of deaths. Althrought the game is still in alpha/beta stage, I believe that if your searching something new and refreshing, you should try this game. I dont think that everyone will love it or like it but nevertheless its quite a good game with dedicated creators who try to improve the game as fast as they possibly can and give it a lot of love.

								As it stands now in Early Access, Kenshi shows a lot of promise as a hit game.  I play with experimental patches enabled, and I get to see the latest additions to the game- bugs included.  If you're a fan of participating in the course of a game's development, your input can- and will greatly impact- the course of the game's development.  This is one everyone should get onboard for!For starters, I'd like to thank members of the development team and their forum moderators for being so involved in discussion.  Many of the threads created in both the Steam forums and the Lo-Fi Game forums end up with answers from members of the team, and what you say can and will make an impact.  To be able to get in touch with someone heading up the game and recieve a personal response is both uplifting and noteworthy.  For me, this game gets high marks for this level of involvement in the community, as for many other development teams, such close coordination has been too much to ask for!On to gameplay; Kenshi is an interesting mesh of Real Time Strategy, base-building, caravaneer mechanics, where you have many choices of how to make your living.In terms of RTS, you can choose from or mod your own Game Start that allows you to pick a set of characters or character, and enter the game world to begin an adventure.  Mechanics are simple:  Using the Numpad or your mouse, you select your character and order them with a click to move.  You can do this to adjust your active navigation, taking detours where you need to, or you can rely upon the surprisingly competent pathfinding AI, which can take you from one side of the map to the other appropriately if you let it, though sometimes patches make this feature a bit fragile.  There is no first person or third person play, it's really a game of watching and hoping you've trained your guys enough that they can handle themselves in a combat situation.Your life revolves around your squad, and what you choose to do with them.  You will, at some point, be attacked, and you will have to fight back, so it's best to train up your brave men and women any way you can to keep yourself above the frey.  At lower levels, combat can be hard, if not embarassing.  You can be slaughtered and not even see a rational reason why (other than your guys just suck at swinging a weapon).  Currently, swordsmanship is the big deal going around, granted the namesake of Mortal Kombat character Kenshi (literally; swordsman), though turrets have been added to the game and ranged weapons are expected in the future (no muskets or revolvers, though modding will make that quite easy to do once ranged mechanics are in, so look forward to it!).The real fun in Kenshi is in what you decide to do with yourself once you're in.  Bounty Hunting, Raiding, Murder and Looting are all part of the possibilities, but more than that, you have the option to become the target of such things.One of the lifestyles you can fall into is a sort of wandering trader, or caravaneer.  Basically, you throw backpacks on a few of your squad members, put the best weapons in the hands of your best muscle, and send your people from town to town crating goods for sale.  Each town hosts a unique set of prices for certain goods; Chainmail can be worth 76% of it's base value one place, and 130% of that value in another, allowing you to invest a lot of money that makes a good return.  All that matters is that you don't oversell to the extent that it breaks their bank.  Being a traveling merchant grants many benefits, and it's a good way to get a leg up in a new game, as running builds strength and athletics, which aid in fighting, running and hauling later on in your lifecycle.Alternatively, the player can create their own town and have the merchants come to them.  Now, this is a fantastic feature, the construction mechanics of the game are pretty solid, even in it's current state.  If you see a man-made structure in the game, chances are that you'll be able to build it.  You start with a decent shack or house, build a research table, set up a farm, and start work on learning new things and stockpiling new resources.  It takes a while for a town to become self-sustaining, but when it does, you can feel free to hermit it up.  You basically have the same tools at your disposal as the developers do when it comes to construction, and you can make the same quality of layout if your talent allows.  Setting up shops and resource centers allows trade and storage, and building walls and turrets keeps out any unsavory individuals that you might find in the wasteland.  Yes, sometimes a world without borders can be a dangerous one.If being a nice guy minding his own business doesn't suit you, or if the Holy Nation stumbles upon your town of peaceful Shek peoples, becoming a more hostile force is also an option.  You even get the option to be a little creative...  Building cages and holding areas for the people you knock out on the battlefield gives you the option to take prisoners, and there'll certainly be more that you can do with this mechanic as the game progresses.  The Role Playing options offered in this game exceed those offered in many others, and the style of gameplay isn't just fun, but addictive.With this said, there are a few downsides to the game that you would probably want to know about before buying.For one, Kenshi seems to be set-in-stone in terms of what lore it will follow.  This is no problem to most people, but to some, it's pretty concentrated on one Apocalyptic Eastern theme.  I've found that the concept the game follows is a bit rigid, as it celebrates the way of Eastern warriors, yet, leaves out the opportunity to equip shields for added defense, neglects any Western-style weaponry (no Claymore, Gladius, Spear, or Cutlass styles), and the story behind it all can be a bit confusing, at times, with regard to finding a point in it all.What bugs me about the weapon variety is partly explained by the fact that I'm more familiar with Western swordsmanship than Eastern, and I feel that these arts are something that the game is missing out on in a great opportunity.  As it stands, there are a limited number of weapon classes and they're pretty much wide-spread, though manufactured by different ""companies"" and distributed across the world.  There's a lot of room for far more variety, and it'd help a lot to convey the differences in design between factions if these weapons weren't just different shaders and colors, or cousins basically (different but the same).  Don't get me wrong, there's like 12 separate weapon types in the game, but they're all pretty closely related.  If more varieties were included, you could see a stronger divide between each faction, and one sword from Holy Nation could convey an entirely different culture than a sword from the United Cities.  That's the biggest thing about this metal craftsmanship; it makes unique combat styles for unique cultures.  More weight should be placed in this category of diversity.The next thing is definitely the lack of shields.  Blocking is done by swords, and if you've studied metal, you know at some point it'll give out.  Eastern warfare did involve the usage of shields in battle at times, and they really do deserve a place in the combat dossier.  Additionally, including shields would open up a new realm of possibilies for modders possessing the talent to model new designs for inclusion in the game.  Imagine having an entire Roman Legion patrolling the game world, the possibilities are endless.When it comes to the background of Kenshi, I feel that it might be set in stone, and since I don't know what's written on that stone, it leaves me unsure of how the development will play out.  I am confident in the team's ability to carry out their mission and bring this game to completion, but I do worry that some ideas might not see the light of day.All said, this game is well worth buying!

Early Access Review
								Brilliant game. When I bought this game quite a long time ago I had originally thought the developers had bitten off more than they could chew as the sandbox feel, and being able to do almost anything you want with AI reacting accordingly seemed ambitious, but its coming together now and they are pulling it off as promised. There are still a lot of things that need to be fixed but so far I am having a blast and am glad I re-installed the game to give it another go.Build a massive town, recruit people to help you run it efficiently and have them setup for certain tasks so you dont have to micro manage them. Steal, kill, kidnap, do whatever you like to get ahead. Just be cautios of the reprocutions of your actions. There isn't to much of a story line that I have found, but that doesn't really matter as you are essentially creating your own story. It seems as if only a 1/4 of the world is done and can be explored, but its big enough to keep you busy for quite some time. Once the other 3/4 are done it will take you quite some time to thouroughly explore all that the world has to offer. Setup your town almost anywhere, just can't set it up to close to another town. It seems like there are well over 100 different things you can build in your town, and that is not including the massive amount of things you can craft. Setup a shop and sell your wares to passers by even. If you are into well thought out sandbox RPG style games, you wont be dissapointed unless you are not someone who can get over little quirks.The Devs seem to be throwing in updates way more often than I remember and I think that had something to do with them changing engines or re-writting things back in the day which held them up. I am hoping they can get to more content and features soon, but am satisfied at the pace they are going as of now.Right now my character has a $23,000 bounty on his head, is hated by half the map, and I am loving it. It makes it challenging and then doesn't make me feel bad when I sneak up, knock someone out stealthy, take their stuff and throw them in a cage.I must say this game is a buy, and once it has been completed I would pay at least 2.5 as much as what the game is selling at now. Nice Job Devs!			"

								This game is a doozy. It's hard and unforgiving. However, once you become used to the interface and the mechanics behind it, this game becomes a rich and rewarding rpg experience. As the development time goes on, this game only gets more and more fleshed out. I can't wait to see where this game is in a year.			"

								After waking up in the desert with nothing besides a stick and some pants I decide to wander to look for someone who can help. I come across a small fort that was well off and had slaves gathering materials. When I approached them they did not seem to mind me. Knowing this, I enter one of their buildings and try to steal some Sake. A guard quickly knocks me unconscious, puts me in a cage and strips me of my belongings, which were already next to nothing. After weeks of trying to pick the lock and attempted escapes I manage to sneak out close to 3am in the morning when the guards were asleep. I swiftly and silently steal some clothes and a sword, and when the time was right I legged it out the compound. After a good hour of fleeing the compound and its many guards, a group of bandits attack the guards, allowing me to escape into the distance. I am now a free ex-slave that is trading items to try to make enough money to survive.Edit1 (hours later irl);I have now established a thieves den hidden near a lake in the desert. I frequently travel to cities to collect ""pre owned"" merchandise and resell this to another village deeper into the forest. Good game/yes			"

								This is a rare and beautiful game. It's  very playable, is different and entertaining. The developer is not going fast, but there is development. I have payed lots more for games that delivered a lot less. watch some gameplay on youtube and start playing. yes there are bugs. did i mention it's only 15 euro? yes there are glitches. did i mention it's only 15 euro?graphics are decent, sound is decent. the world is great. did i mention its actually not expensive?if you are into this kind of games (watch youtube. its free) then this is a good investment. in time and money.

								Kenshi is a squad based open world post apocolyptic RPG, but you probably knew that already. When I forst bought this game like maybe one odd years ago it was rough, but I could see the potential and managed to enjoy almost 50 hours of it. I was coutious to recommend at the time because I wasnt sure if development would be dropped or not seeing as it was slow and economically unstable. Recently I checked back and was thrilled to see development is continuing and significant progress is being made. With these doubts out of the picture I am confident in recommending this game. It has alot of charm and is well thought out, A truly free RPG.			"

Early Access Review
								Well..................I bought this at the end of Crimbo 2016 as the writeups were quite good and seemed like a challenge from what I was reading. + I was bored to tears.And.............in the space of 3 weeks I have racked up 146 hours!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-O I got over 300 on Fallout 4 for over 3 months playing it on and off, so this has been a real developer achievement to me!!!!Okay, so yes, it's ard! It's bloody ard to begin with but once you start realising that being beaten the s*it out of is actually good for you and that selling iron to shops for supplies until you can buy your first companions to speed up that process then go on to building a base and farms and producing weapons you can sell for huge profits instead of lumps of iron.........everything develops really fast and the exploring can commence!Pros: Base building including trading for food or developing your own farms and power systemsMicro management from the ground up (But not TOO much and can get 1 person taking up several jobs simultaneously)Fair and realistic levelling system for your troopsLive how you want to live: Be a thief, be a farming community, be a bandit community, be weapon/clothing/armour smiths or be all of that in one go as long as you dont pee too many people off as they dont forget (I was friendly with Holy Nation only until I knew my peeps were geting ard and could rip them new a** holes when demanding I follow their ridiculous religion every single time I went near their camps.....better not say much more......)Enjoy exploring a relatively huge map which is overwhelming to begin with, but feels small after sploring every corner looking for artifacts. < There is a shaded out part that is to come in the future and it's HUGE!!!!!Cons:Not optimised enough for anything under the ""recommended"" system requirements in my opinion and my rig is slightly better than those specs and still have to run this in low settings. (It's still beautiful though!)Annoying saving timesAnnoying loading timesSome infuriating glitches exist such as people becoming stuck and brainless but a long save and load cures this.It's got me hooked and I have a fully self sufficient town with 10 ""Homesteads"" (Farmers, smithys creating 6k garments and weapons, water collectors, miners etc etc) 10 ""Warriors"" who are only defeated in this game by Leviathans (You will see, but if you do manage to kill a ""Baby"" you get a very pricey artifact :-/) and finally, the ""Legends""......erm....Hercules, Iolus, Xena, Gabriel and Maximus.....and they are still sh*te, ha ha ha ha. Oh and a massive ""Elder"" Mountain Dog I started with that tears everything apart like a rabid rhino, 3 bulls for trade caravanning which also ram attackers flying into the air or many meters away which is amusing, and a seriously leary Bonedog. Yeah.......this game is a great world to escape to.......and even cancelled a couple of real world adventures because of it in December.Highly recommended, and it's still under development with continuous and steady updates!Be aware though, if you are like me, you may start off and think OMG this is terrible and request a refund, but I followed the advice of other reviewers and gave it a couple of hours.....than BAM, glued like a ladys six toy to the clat.

								Of course trhere need a lot to be done.. On the other side: this is a realy great game with a lot more potential for the future! Worth to buy and play it now allready; in my opinion YES !!! With the start as 'wanderer' you have to do it all the way, and this is very nice to play. My first money i spend on good boots and an extra backpack, with a bit luck i found 2 dead body's and take there cloths & weapons.. so good enough to equip at the moment.. Then i found a group of bandids, i run back towards the city i started and let them killed by the guards there.. did enjoy the battle myself also, and making progress in attack & defend that way. With all those loot i found on there body's ik make nice money and could hire the first 2 members of my group..Did this a couple times and could hire 2 more (already trained) other members + better gear. Start to get building on my self.. started with my 1st settlement with a little barack and a stone mine.. Now after +- 30 hrs playing time i have 8 members (3 last recruited in the second city i visite), upgrade the stone mine, build also 2 power-generators, a stone working machine, build the 1st house with 4 beds and training body + first city walls build to protect my 1st settlement a bit and.. All members well equiped for there level. Some little inside story's.. : After several fights with smaller bandit-groups (i can take them down) and bigger groups of sand-bandits (witch i take after me to the city-guards, to fight them together and take there loots.. + selling the gang-boss for good money to the head guards).. ..then there came a group of 'cannibals'.. to my little settlement.. they take 2 of my members down, picked them up and running away with them.. omg.. lol.. bud, they run into the arms of a walking patrouille from guild guards.. they take the cannibals down and my members could struggeled back to our settlement... pffftttt.. end good :P In all the time i played till now, i only have 2 crashes (saving regulary is always the better thing to do), so that's not so bad for a starting game i suppose. There is a well done balance between the attacks from the (4 differend types) of bandids walking around and the time you can spend on selling, buying, training, building).. That's very satisfied to play like this in a game like this!Conclusion: Like i say at the beginning, there is still a lot to do.. but for sure it's worth to buy and play! For now allready nice playing and we hope it will be more and more in the future.. All by all; Thanks to the maker(s) : nice & good work allready, hope a lot more to come.. Have fun by playing this xD  "

								This game is not for the faint of heart. If you like modern hand holding RPGs or on rails games like fallout 4 this is not for you. This hearkens back to early RPGs like Fallout 2, Balder's Gate etc. You are the story, you make the story. It's similar to mount and blade warband in that respect. You can choose to do anything however its a time sink.You can play it like the lone wanderer, group of adventurers, or you can play it like age of empires.The choice is yours			"

								Kenshi Is a fantastic idea but is one of those gruesomely Beta/Alpha games that we all know steam to be a hub for. There is still alot of work to be done on stability (The experimental version is very prone to crashing) and aspects of the game are still in progress of being developed. So if you have a short temperament you may wish to wait till it's finished.That being said it's very difficult drawing yourself away for it. Creating your charaters from hair to feet then training them up in whatever respected fields you wish them to delve into from farming to swordplay to thievery . Beautifully thought out landscapes and structures to explore and the abusive bandits that wander there. Once you make enough of a living from selling your scraps to traders in towns, you can even build your own settlement from scrach and make a town of your own.Hopefully if and when the game is finished being fiddled with, this can be an amazing game giving players the full freedom every RPG deserves.

								I love this game!I'd say Kenshi is a one of a kind, a bit of a niche game.. there are very few you can compare it to.The learning curve is steep, but the mountain top is not too high!Because it is a open world sandbox game you can play Kenshi in so many different waysEverything from being just a handful of very highly trained ninjas to a big warband of mercenaries, or perhaps you want to be a merchant, set up shop inside a city ? or build your very own city and bring trade to you!I have 140 hours on record all played with the same savegame and i consider myself having reached 'end game' if that term even applies to a game such as this :P and what I will say is there are end game features missing, such as proper diplomacy, ways of making your own actual faction/kingdom, waging war + the fact that only half the map is playable. So I feel like I am out of things to do on my current savegame because I am strong enough to assult cities and wiping them out, but it doesnt lead to alot currently..but trust me when I say the journey there was SO enjoyable I can't even.. and the devs do work on it and update it frequently adding in all these things that are missing!Very much reccomend this game!

								Kenshi Is one of my favorite games of all time. The free roam combined with the ability to play however you please is great. The sword fighting is smooth and feels like a action movie. Your always determined to get more powerful and in depth base building so your rarely left wandering around with nothing to do next. The game has multiple starting back storys to choose from and after you spend a good bit of time completing those you can mod the game quite easily. The ability to create and mod the entire world of kenshi after watching a 10 minute youtube video is amazing. Ive spent close to a hundred hours just modding kenshi the way I please. Anything in kenshi I think is to hard or easy I can fix. You can also create custom armor,weapons and pretty much change the entire world in anyway you want. I only wish more games would give there community the ability to do this so easily. Kenshi gets a 10 out of 10 in my book.			"

								Firstly, my 'hours played' isn't accurate, I've played more than it shows. I had a weird stint where Steam Overlay didn't work for a couple weeks and blah blah.Anyway, this game is great.It's one major feature, one that people either love or hate, is that it's a true sandbox. At this point, there is no objective, no beginning - middle - or end.You choose a specific start (the starts that you choose from are kind of a template of the type of role play you're looking for) then.... well, whatever you want.Want to go over there? Do it. Want to start a base up and make it into a city sim? Have at it. Want to slaughter everyone in a town? Knock yourself out. There's a lot of stuff to do, but some people can't find enjoyment in doing it if they don't have something the game is telling them to work forward to - which isn't a bad thing, people can like whatever they want.There's a lot to be had in this game;- Party Based RPG- Squad Management (multiple squads)- Buy/Sell Merchant sim- City Builder & Management- Pickup and play for fifteen minutes or hours- It's... Just a giant sandbox, you can do damn-near anything.Something that I wont add to the list of it's features is its modibility, it's ridiculously easy - but there's only like, ten mods made for it, which is for the best anyways since the next planned update to the game is an entirely new map.If you like games that blend fifty different genre's together and don't mind there not being a point, you'll most likely enjoy this game as much as I have.There's a wierd 'either love it or hate it' review battle with this game, people claiming that if you say something bad about the game then you're an idiot and if you say somehting good about it you're a ravenous fanboy - the old ""Everyone's opinion matter as long as it is in full support of mine"" rhetoric seen in all games/movies.Honestly, it's a great game that has come a long, loooong way, and it gets exponentionally more fun with each update.TL:DR -- A ton of genre's slapped together very well.- Almost out of Alpha; soon to be fully featured.- Has no end goal - you make you're own up (in true roleplay fashion)- Can be played as little or as often as you want, there's currently (may not ever be) actual missions, so there's no ""Let me just finish this part""- I like it, you might like it, try the demo (yeah, it has a demo, for some reason video game companies refuse to make demos anymore) it's available on the Lo-Fi website (steam too?)

								This game is a very interesting concept, hence why I bought it, its even fun to play for a while untill the content quickly runs out. This is fine as its an alpha, however, updates come verrrrry slowly on this, its taken more than a year to get to this point. I appreciate that this is a small dev team (1 guy?) but people should know that it will (based on current trends) take years for this game to finish, if ever, by which point you will most likely be playing something else as you will have done this to death.

It is more of a collections of musings and my thoughts on the game as well as whether I think the game is worth the purchase. In the video I say 15 dollars when the actual price is 20.

								I played this game for over a year on Desura before it came to Steam and let me just say, if you're looking for a fun tactical-strategy-rpg-citybuilding extravaganza, look no further. Kenshi has the most open playability of any game I've played since Ultima Online. If you want to develop a trading outpost into a bustling town, you can. If you just want to be a bunch of nomad bandits, have at it!Pros-Such Depth! Much Fun!-Deep Character Progression-Develop your faction into whatever you want from honored to infamous and enjoy the faction effects it has toward every other group in the game.-Awesome Music, but it gets a little repetitive after hours.-Fun Crafting and Construction System!Cons-There's a bit of a learning curve and -Unrealistic combat. The best way to grind skills is to walk fights and just kite the enemies to a town to level up your fighting which gets monotonous and doesn't make any sense. Were I a bandit, I doubt I would chase some nobodies to my doom, but that's just me.			"

								Good concept, has potential to be a very good game.  Still a bit buggy which has forced me to back burner it again.  I will leave it installed in hopes the dev continues to debug and bring this game out of the darkness and let people see what fun really is.			"

								This game provides all the elements I look for in a game if any of the following apply to you, you will enjoy this.1. Micromanagement; As your group grows the functions for each grow and multi tasking stays fresh, you wont go long before a bandit attack. There's always work to do, training to be done the tasks never end. Making your party run laps in their precious down time, training your combat skills on captured prisoners, producing gear or buildind/researching the list goes on.2.RPG; Each character has its own stats, the time it takes to get anything to level 20+ is abit time consuming, but it gives a sense of satisfaction as you make another character a mighty warrior in the wasteland.3.City Building; Build your own city! it takes time, but building your own utopia complete with shops, workshops, homes, outposts, defense walls, mounted crossbows, the only limit is how long your willing to spend preparing your characters for the coming construction.4.Crafting; At first its more about gathering gear from fallen foe's outside the city gates, but once you begin teching and producing your own gear, a high quality katana compared to a rusty one is a beautiful sight, you can also produce all the raw materials needed for self preservation which is tougher, but for some more rewarding.5.Diplomacy; Want to be friends with a certain group of bandits? Heal some of their fallen kin, eventually they will stop attacking you and come to your aide. (This takes time, I also assume in the future there will be many diplomatic aspects, but have yet to be added).6.Permanent Death; Think your starter character is a badass? wrong. Each unit becomes precious, you grow attatched as they become valueable, and then at the worst moment a critical strike leaves them stranded far from a safe location, too far to carry safely without a character with strength above 30... you keep watching hoping the bleeding stops and he'll enter a recovery coma but no his status switches to ""dying"" and you panic, time to decide if your capable enough to make the rescue, because even if you are, a large enough band of bandits/cannibals could strike you all down, and end your game. (Also note, the cannibals will take your people prisoner and amount of time you have to wait for a distraction is FOREVER, but its great).7.Travel/Relocation; Making it town to town in the begining is thrilling, as your group grows and you safely reach each destination, perhaps traveling with a caravan or a squad of UC/HO troops for safety, or braving the journey alone it's deadly every time. Also, the town you're in could be overrun. (I've seen it happen twice lol)8.Huge Replay Value; Start in a new town, new conditions, different starting squad, death at the start, who knows? The randomness is astounding, you could find ""wingman"" at the start, walk out near ""Shark"" and get hacked to piece by roaming sand ninja. You've read enough. Buy it, before it gets better and you feel like an idiot for not have gotten it sooner.			"

Early Access Review
								GOD I want to love this game. I really want to. I've played over 40 hours in an absurdly short amount of time trying to love it and make it work. I know it just went Beta, but this is one of the least playabe Betas (or even Alphas) I have ever taken part in.Pathfinding is absolutely terrible. The worst of any RTS I've ever played. If you build a wall, plan on randomly getting stuck on terrain and having to deconstruct part of the wall so your resources are *poof* gone. Oh it's not over there - good luck trying to get the two parts of the walls to attach again, because there is random wall collision detection that prevents you from attaching the two pieces of the wall, so there's a good chance you'll have to start over on a huge section of wall. There have been modest improvements to pathfinding, not least of which is your squad tries its best to use the road rather than going offroad. This seems to be a hasty workaround, because going offroad seems to get you stuck for no apparent reason a lot of the time. Also plan on reversing your path and straightening out an approach on one squad member when going through gates into cities. The devs have the best intentions by attempting the following:- Auto-hauling- Priority queues- Clicking on a point on the map and having the squad automatically go thereThe problem with these is the execution. Auto-hauling works alright, but you have to have a specific box for the item. For example, autohauling stone has to go to a stone box. So you're taking up a ton of space with storage boxes. This leads into priority queues, which only show 5 of the tasks you have lined up even though you can have more. So if you have 10 resources you want to haul to 10 different boxes for efficiency's sake, you won't see the 5 tasks in the bottom of the queue so you have no idea if you actually have them queued or not. So you might have to deleted and restart your entire queue if you forget.When going to a city by selecting a point on the map, there's a good chance your squad will randomly stop and just stand there because it doesn't know where to go, even though you selected a point on the map. This map feature is very new, so I'll give it a pass. It just needs some polish. It works a lot of the time.Whoamygod crashes. Pre .90, crashes used to be once every 5-10 minutes (so lower your Autosave threshold unless you want to constantly lose progress). Patch .90.11 made the game literally unplayable (crash shortly after load every time, regardless of whether you start a new game or not).  However, since then the crashes have gotten LOADS better. I just hope this continues.The devs try hard (it seems) but it feels like they're playing a game of whack-a-mole. They squash a bug, another bug (or two, or three) appears in its place. I just hope to god it gets a lot more polish in the automation and pathfinding departments. Micromanaging to this degree and especially with this much frustration is not fun. If these key areas improve, this will turn a messy, bug-ridden game into a GREAT game.All that ugliness aside... I will continue to support the game (because it's the only one of its kind really right?) and will likely change my review if there's a lot of polish. Right now it's not lookin good though.			"

								Interesting game mechanics, but quickly falls short the moment you start building or you progress in the game. Cities get empty and your own lacks of purpose. Too much micromanagement with lack of rewards. The game is still far from complete, so I would advise to wait until a future, more complete game.			"

I can't wait to see what all the final game is going to allow us to do.  I can easily see spending 100+ hours playing this before it's even completed.  Definitely worth the money if you like RPGs, base building and any kind of strategy games.  This game mixes so many elements and does such a great job at it.  Keep up the good work!			"

								Kenshi is a very good and fun game, Kenshi is the kind of game I love because it has some features that big games don't. First thing I'll say is: ""don't buy this game if you have no patiance"" This game is a little bit hard in the beggining because you're not special... in the begging almost everyone is stronger than you so be careful, to BE special you have to work for it, you gotta pursue it, and that's what I love about kenshi. I can't describe with words, what I can say is: download the demo in their website and you'll feel/know what I mean, I haven't played much but I loved what I played of it. It's buggy, it crashes a lot, sometimes you'll rage in front of your computer and stop playing it for a week but Kenshi is amazing and you know you'll play it again. the developers always keep updating with bugs fixes and add some minor content, and from time to time there's a ""big content update"" wich adds a lot of new stuff.

								I found this game about 2 years ago, which at the time seemed very promising; glad to say it has more than fullfilled that expectation.Without describing anything much about the game's universe, it basically does what it says on the proverbial tin. As it is now, you've got several scenario's to start with. Each has it's pros and cons, but in the end, no one is gonna take care off you. Starving? Deal with it. Bleeding out? Shouldn't have messed with those 'lowly' hungry bandits, dogs, ... Being eaten by cannibals? Oh yes, the game has those as well. Without divulging too much, this game simply will not hold your hand. It'll provide some tutorials which explain the basics behind some game mechanics, but that is it. How you go about your business, whether it be surviving, building your own outpost, making a name for yourself (Really??!! In this game??!!), ... It's all up to you.Now I know this game won't be for just anyone, but if you do get this game? Stick with it. In the beginning you'll get your ♥♥♥ kicked perhaps more than you'd like, your dudes and dudettes can actually die ... Anyways, after a while, the game will grow on you. Once you start figuring things out, sky's the limit, as long as the game allows it, that is.			"

Early Access Review
								One of the hidden gems of steam, this rare greenlight success story stands as proof that amongs the sea of greenlit garbage, there still exist some quality titles.I would urge anyone who has been scarred by the early-access system not to be afraid. I've owned this game since 2013 back when there were only ~three types of armor with similar graphics and few features of note. It somehow managed to be surprisingly fun then, and it has only gotten better since. The dev('s) put out updates often and the game has undergone fundamental changes since 2013. The squad system, the new worldmap, the new factions, the overhaul of equiptment (eg. the armour I mentioned earlier) - all these things have changed since then and every one of these changes, though I often initially missed the old ways, were for the better.Some will say a sandbox game which has been in early access alpha for two years is neccesarily a lost hope. This game proves otherwise.The game is still a little laggy and may run slow on older rigs, it also occasionally crashes, though the rate of these has fallen drastically since '13.I strongly reccomend this game to anyone interested in a vast, open-world survival RPG where it is the player who creates his/her own story.

								It was a loooong time ago that I bough kenshi, when all characters we hairless, and the world was one big desert. There have been times when the game has been completely unplayable, bugs, glitches, crashes and low frame rates. Happily the game moves ever forward and gets better and better. That's not to to say there aren't still bugs and gliches, there are (I'm writing this review right after the game crashed to desktop), but honestly those problems don't stop this from being one of my favorite games of all time. The main hook for me is how you can create so many different stories with your character, a soldier, trader, thief, lord of your own settlement all starting from a nobody who gets beaten up and left for dead by everybody. I have a real emotional attachment to my characters, we have been through a lot in the 135 hours together. Honestly, I recomend this game to anyone who likes creating their own stories, RPG sandbox world and really some of the most entertaining fights ever.			"

Early Access Review
								Where to begin ?I've bought kenshi loving the kind of universe it offers (samurai, desert and post apocalypse, count me in just for the heck of it), and the promises it makes.Even though it still is in beta and is expected not to deliver on all aspects a game this ambitious takes into account, Kenshi does a fantastic job so far.I will go through a somewhat thorough description, so if you want all my pros and cons, just skip ahead to the pros and cons at the end of my review1) It is absolutely gorgeous, all in all, environments and biomes are fantastic to wander in and discover. Also your characters can be created beautiful or ugly, straight or broken, and all the same believable. You can also zoom in or out insanely, pause your game, rotate your camera around at any time, and watching your character paused while delivering a huge knee hit at any view angle, kicking asses and taking names is somewhat exilarating considering how hard the game is whe you begin with the ""rock bottom"" background.2) The game is also very challenging even when you know its mecanics. It doesn't hold your hand, lets you be taken into slavery,  and I discovered to my great demise the hardship of having women squad members in the holy nation territory  . For once (save for the demon souls / dark souls series) a game is truly unforgiving, and at the same time really rewarding. The areas you couldn't get to before because of their inherent hardship hold many secrets and loots, the first one being the discovery of the world itself (yes, it is that beautiful and engaging) , trying to make the history of the world out of the lore, the stories you hear or read, or even a faction name.3) The map (as far as version 0.95.11 goes) is HUMONGOUS, and it is even not half of the final intended map. I can't wait to get my mitts on the next piece of it. Con for a map this size so far is that it feels a bit empty for now, but if you go to the kenshi trello, you can see that there are still many improvements to come, (which I won't cover here, go check it for yourself) and that this game is destined to get fuller and fuller as updates come to be.4) Squad management is rewarding, as well, and you can easily specialize squads in all the different gameplays the game can offer, from brutal combats with consequences to day-to-day hunger, items creation, trading management. The downside is that you also feel sometimes a bit limited in this ""lite strategy game"" mecanic (and as a caesar 3 or AoE 2 fan, I easily want more of it, even though it is not this game's objective) .5) You can create anything, as long as you get your hands on the recipe or blueprint.  So Hell Yeah Edge Type Weapons . Con not all blueprints available, and the artifact system feels sometimes restraining. For now. 'Cuz the map is not yet complete The artifact system : each playthrough you get to have with each new update you decide to play and import a previous play onto lets you have a different experience than the previous one : you get all the same locations, but not all the same items. 6) consequences of your acts are true, and I feel somewhat happy when I break the previous bounty record on one of my characters head  including the Bugmaster's .PROS : - So far so good, it has taken me more than a hundred hours (and many more to come with each upcoming updates)- Total Freedom of action- HUGE map- Many factions- you create your own story- continuous open world- The Squad system and its management- Impressive and complex gameplay mecanics and intense close combat system- A world with consequences (to a certain extent, the world itself is a consequence of a previous catastrophe)- Gorgeous and sexy- You make your own story- many items- there is always a solution to your problem- unforgiving- Early access (it is so complete so far that you still feel you're playing a complete game with free DLCs coming up every now and then)CONS:- Early access (you feel sometimes frustrated with the absence of things yet to come)- The map is so huge it feels sometimes empty (yet to hell with that, it is supposed to be a sarce wasteland and a freaking desert)- You can't truly choose a faction, or become its boss, safe for your own, and opposite faction are not enough of a threat past a certain point.- Still a lack of lore, quests, and multiple Choices story scripts (but I guess in a game this complete, it will come last)- no claustrophobic dungeons with ancient freakin' horrors and freakin' loot inside- No (or not yet) freakin' large army and combat system- there is always a solution to your problem- not enough items considered it is a world with a past rich enough to have robots roaming the wastes- not unforgiving enough past a certain point (at some point every character becomes a bit overkill, can take down complete ennemy squads, and the lack of diplomacy makes the consequences less of a challenge since the factions get so weak)			"

								I have been following Kenshi for around three years now. It has grown from very basic mechanics and framework, to this very ambitious and well deserving piece of RPG interpretation. The sky is limited on what you can do now. However, the creator has been able to utilize a team to help him create the game he wants. Key features include free roaming, base building, character development and many more mechanics that make Kenshi great but also set it apart from the rest of the crowd. It has the environment and finesse that allows you to craft your own story in a very unique and different setting than a traditional RPG. It's easily the embodiment of everything a die-hard RPG fan would want to play. It's probably the Sienfeld of RPG's.			"

								(MAY BE A SPOILER) I love this game, especially because of the very large battles that can take place in one area. Excluding the lag that can occur in those battles, a income that can be obtained is the loot after the battle: off of the NPCs killed. The best thing about this game is the vastness of the map! I love how there can be, say Bandits, Holy Men, and then Cannibals all fighting outside of a village. Big problem, or maybe a little confusing/disappointing feature in this game is the money shown on NPCs that you kill around the map (what I mean is how it'll say that they have,for example, 6000 cats or money on them when you loot that character - but those 6000 cats are only pointed among their whole team put together; main problem is that the only money that you can obtain is the bounty on the leader which can be about 1000 cats). All in all, this game is HIGHLY recommended to those who like to play strategy games in an open world, build anywhere game. ~15/10			"

Early Access Review
								Saw this game featured in recommendations for several of my favorite games and some i have been following the development of for a while. I decided to give it a shot after reading comments on the atmosphere and music. Once installed i was quickly transported to a world of desperation and brutality. The learning curve is a bit intense, but the freedom granted by getting the gist of the smallest game functions grants enough reward that i think it could appeal to a fairly large portion of the gaming community.  As mentioned in other reviews, there is no story, there is no goal, and there is no point to survival other than those goals that you set for yourself. There is a potentially high true roleplay factor generated by the simple fact that each sect has its own set of rules and laws, You can either conform or reject, you can fight or flee, you can walk a fine line or separate yourself from ""society"" completely. Any play style can reap its own set of rewards and the replayability factor is very high.The negatives seem to all be the typical early access flaws, mainly in fine tuning a few lag issues, some buggy behavior in the town generation every so often (two builds of mine so far produced nothing but destroyed/abandoned towns and farms).

								One of the hidden gems of steam, this rare greenlight success story stands as proof that amongs the sea of greenlit garbage, there still exist some quality titles.I would urge anyone who has been scarred by the early-access system not to be afraid. I've owned this game since 2013 back when there were only ~three types of armor with similar graphics and few features of note. It somehow managed to be surprisingly fun then, and it has only gotten better since. The dev('s) put out updates often and the game has undergone fundamental changes since 2013. The squad system, the new worldmap, the new factions, the overhaul of equiptment (eg. the armour I mentioned earlier) - all these things have changed since then and every one of these changes, though I often initially missed the old ways, were for the better.Some will say a sandbox game which has been in early access alpha for two years is neccesarily a lost hope. This game proves otherwise.The game is still a little laggy and may run slow on older rigs, it also occasionally crashes, though the rate of these has fallen drastically since '13.I strongly reccomend this game to anyone interested in a vast, open-world survival RPG where it is the player who creates his/her own story.

								This game will not only beat you with a stick but will make you beat yourself with that stick. It has a steep learning curve but that is probley its best feature. No making you the chosen one or some world saving hero. If you can survive the stick beating then maybe just maybe you can be the one beating others with that stick.Unless you fight the Samurai.....One doesn't just fight the Samurai and win.Either way 10/10 for a good beating.

								Saw this game featured in recommendations for several of my favorite games and some i have been following the development of for a while. I decided to give it a shot after reading comments on the atmosphere and music. Once installed i was quickly transported to a world of desperation and brutality. The learning curve is a bit intense, but the freedom granted by getting the gist of the smallest game functions grants enough reward that i think it could appeal to a fairly large portion of the gaming community.  As mentioned in other reviews, there is no story, there is no goal, and there is no point to survival other than those goals that you set for yourself. There is a potentially high true roleplay factor generated by the simple fact that each sect has its own set of rules and laws, You can either conform or reject, you can fight or flee, you can walk a fine line or separate yourself from ""society"" completely. Any play style can reap its own set of rewards and the replayability factor is very high.The negatives seem to all be the typical early access flaws, mainly in fine tuning a few lag issues, some buggy behavior in the town generation every so often (two builds of mine so far produced nothing but destroyed/abandoned towns and farms). There have been a few strange bugs involving theft and whatnot but nothing unmanageable or repeating on reload. If you are a fan of open world games, and NWN style squad based games, Use based skill leveling, base building etc... give this a shot. I don't have any regrets with the current price and am looking forward to being done with this review so i can play some more.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is great if you have a big imagination.  There is no story, and there never will be.  Quests do not exist, but the developers are working on a job system which will give your characters some short-term direction; these ""non-quests"" will not advance a plot.  The map is large, some complain that it is too large, and there is enough explore.  The game is close to release and they've scrapped about 1/2 of the features that were listed back in 2013-2014 when I added this game to my wishlist.  The current experimental version is 95.14, full release is at 1.0.  I'm not sure what else they will drop before they release the ""final version,"" they have scrapped so much that the developers have stated that they ""may"" release a post final version patch which will add some of the cancelled features; but it seems more like they are eager to put this project behind them.Despite my concerns, I really like this game as it stands.  The premise is this right now: you start out with a character.  The character is weak.  Over time they develop their skills (combat, crafting, labor).  Eventually they're not weak anymore.  You can have up to 30 of these characters.  You can built a base, craft, trade, etc.  Since the game has no goals, the thought behind play ends up being.  It would be cool if I ..., or I want to have the best .... There are several factions scattered throughout the map with their own culture.  On final release you should be allowed to ally, and war with whoever you choose.As with any early access game: only time will tell what makes it into the final version.			"

								The game is still in Alpha state. That being said, it is still an amazing game.Its an open-world sandbox game with no main character. No leveling up, no overpowered bosses, no magical ""Hero"" character. You start off as a regular Joe and can either join a major Faction to help you hone your combat skills or trek off into the wastes and ATTEMPT to make your own life in this harsh world with no mercy.I highly recommend this game. If your not too sure about purchasing it straight out, go to Desura and download the Demo. Its the same as the main game except with a 2 member squad limit I believe.			"

								Kenshi is a well thought out RPG and RTS that is still in development but I think with my playtime a review is granted and anyone looking for a good game that still has a lot more to come to it this would be one to look into. I bought this game early on in its development because i saw what they were putting together and its exactly what I look for in a game. The developer who started this wanted to make the game out of wanting to put together a game he wanted to play himself but couldn't find out there. This game when finished will be a high point in early access even with seriously long development it has shown what the potential of early release games should be and it will be a benchmark hopefully for other developers out there to stick with it and truly finish ones vision. Without early access I doubt this game would be where its at now as the development team grew as people purchased the game early which helped this games progress tremendously. Its at beta now with a few bugs but well worth it to see the progress being made to bring this epic scale game together. I enjoy playing it and spend hours on it when I do which shows signs of being an interesting game and its not even finished yet an people play it like it is. Out of the many games I have this one definitely stands out in the crowd and hopefully for you it will too.			"

								The world of Kenshi is slowly coming to life and what a beautiful, fun and angry world it is. The makers of Kenshi have set their sights higher than I originally expected when I first seen this game a few years ago and I'm just loving every single detail that gets added. Rrecently I've been slaughtering the strange fogmen and getting eaten alive by beak things while looking for a great place to set up my base. Not easy when some of the best spots are filled with things that want you dead.If you like post apocolyptic worlds and samuari style combat wraped around a squad based rpg and crafting system take a closer look. If you also have an imagination some patience to enjoy watching a wonderful game develop download now.It's also a bit like the movie Steel Dawn. Anyone old enough to remember that?			"

								Hi everyone, I don't have many experience with early access games but if only games supposed to be fully developped could be as complete as this one, I don't think I have ever been that satisfied with a game for a very long time, Kenshi is the perfect game if you like micro-management, personnalized gaming, and non-linear evolution. To me it feels like the Elders Scrolls, Age of Empire or Jagged Alliance were mixed into one big sand-box, The game itself is tough, which makes the building of your outpost or even a short trip with your weak team a challenging process but also gives the player a feeling of achievement, every move is at-risk, which explains why succeeding in creating an autonomic settlement is so gratifying.If you're tired of RPGs following a linear narration with predetermined characters reproducing repetetive actions over the same dungeons, then this game is made for you: personnalize every of your recruits (up to 256 with the current mods), their daily functioning (farming, working the mines, building, hunting, using cross-bows to guard your town, crafting, sneaking....), your settlements (many and many possibilities that will evolve through research), your equipements,  changing relationships with other factions according to your actions and background, random and various bands roaming , a large map with different landscapes and populations (already huge and half the map is still in development and will be hopefully accessible soon) including hidden places and several towns with racial specificities, ruins to visit and loot, a varying weather and its related effects on the gameplay, day and night shifts, numerous mods and recurrent updates, it would take a much longer review to explain every possibilities and factors included in that game, it's only my opinion but to me everything's here. Being a trader, a bandit, a slave (a slaver?), a ninja, a cannibal, a peaceful farmer, a lone scavenger, a tribal leader... it's up to you to do whatever you want with all this content, Sincerely, I would like to thank the developers for this amazing work, please keep going			"

								If you liked the challenge of dark souls; the strategy elements of an RTS, and the sandbox open world of minecraft, then this is for you...Though still in  Early Access, This is perhaps one of the best games I have ever played.Cast into a post-apocolyptic  world with no explanation, you quickly find yourself outnumbered and overpowered...by every enemy you encounter.You will quickly realise that you are not privilaged, you don't miraculously have ""1337 5KI11Z"". You earn every bit of what you accomplish; through blood, sweat, and tears.But then, the day that you finally stand up for yourself and beat those bandits, all by yourself, you feel the most overpowering sense of accomplishmentYou will travel mostly aimlessly through the huge desert (And I mean HUGE, it takes ages to get to the other side of the map even on 4x speed), picking up a few followers here and there.Eventually you will build a town, and learn to defend it, as you research more and more technologies, the game completely sucking you in.after several IRL days,(or weeks, depending how often you play),you will eventually find yourself with amazing custom forged weapons and armour, an undefeatable army, and automated mining systems. and your still only halfway through the game....However the game IS still in early gameplay, and as such features a few humerous (and annoying) errors that will leave you grinding your teeth in frustration; but if you are prepared to deal with a little annoyance for a lot of reward, this game is for you.

Wanderer I think.I wake up in a village.After looking around trying to figure out wtf is happening and getting a feel for how to walk around, I mustered enough courage to leave my little village and try building a shelter down by the river. Built my shelterAdded lights and ♥♥♥♥ Man, I'm going to have a huge kingdom in no time.This is easy, I don't know what all these reviewers are talking about.Got hungry, ... damn I need to build a farm or someething. I need Greenfood to build a farm? Looked around saw a big city out in the distance, I'll just go there and get some. Ran to the city in the middle of the night and got lost. Where the fk is the store?Found myself soon in a room full of soldiers sleeping in beds Saw some practice dummies so I took my sword and started beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Then the soldiers started yelling at me telling me I can't use that!These guys seem really tough so I decided to get my ♥♥♥ out of there before I got myself into trouble.Finally found a guy in a bar that was willing to sell me some greenfruit and was starting my journey home, thinkin' what a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ runnung around. Too easy, right?I started to get cocky and ran up to one of them and asked him for a joint.He said that wasn't tolerated here and basically knocked my ♥♥♥ out. Watched my limp body get dragged into a dark castleLaying in a bird cage, unconscious. Apparently Marijuana is illegal here! I thought we legalized that ♥♥♥♥! Gained consciousnesswaited for the guard to walk awaybroke out Ran my ♥♥♥ around the valley with 20 dudes chasing meThey finally give up and I walk home all traumatizedBuilt my farm and welldamn son I'm a badass nobody can stop me. wait... where is my backpack I left it hereStolen, wtf?? Who stole my backpack?!Building materials were all gone. Went back to the city after my bounty expired to look for supplies.Got lost againEnded up in a woman's house and she told me the Inn was a great place to stay the night.wtf?! ok? I walk out and I hear a soldier yell ""TRESSPASSER!!"" I get chased down by an army of soldiersThey tackle me and knock me the fk out!

								I love this game so much. Even in it's current pre-release status there is a lot to explore and do.Here are some of the main features of the game:- It's a sandbox game; Apart from the literal sense where most of the map is desert, you are also given a character and let loose into the world to do as you please.- It's challenging; Especially at the start of the game it will difficult as it will feel as if everything is stacked against you. This feeling is actually pretty accurate. Just about everything IS against you. But as you play, you will become more powerful and given enough time, you will eventually be in a position where you will gain the upper hand. Don't expect this to happen overnight though.- You can recruit followers; Most of them are just random nobodies who aren't good at anything. Just like you when you start a fresh game. Certain followers will sometimes have unique dialogue as you travel with them, giving the world a but more colour and the factions some background lore  as they tell you about the areas you visit. This is still a work in progress though.- You can build outposts; Buy a house in one of the cities or build a comletely new outpost from scratch. You can have your followers farm and mine for resources and food, so your outpost can become completely self sufficient.- You will get your ♥♥♥ kicked; Yes, you will. But that's okay. Usually after being beaten into a bloody pulp by some angry bandits, one of your unconscious characters will wake up and you can have him heal the others. Consider it a learning experience. You will have time to reflect on what happened as your squad limps back to town. Unless the slavers find you first that is... Or the cannibals... or the giant, blind carnivorous beak things eat you alive...- It's hilarious;The npc in the game will occasionally tell you the most ridiculous stories. The people in kenshi usually have very few sensible things to say. And they lie. And they swear. A lot. There is a lot of very dry humor in this game.** This game is not for everyone!!! **If the above mentioned features sound appealing, I really suggest you try the demo first.Kenshi is a very difficult game, especially at the start. Some people WILL get frustrated and quit and if that's you, then that would be a waste of your money. Defeat is a big part of this game.Also realise that this game is still very much in development. Not all features have been implemented yet and those that have been might be changed or removed. If you want to get an idea of where the game is headed and what features are likely to be added then head over to the official lo-fi forum and have a look at the road map. There are however, frequent updates and stuff gets added, fixed and broken and then fixed again (usually).			"

								Kenshi is An amazing Open-World game! ive been up to date on it sense it began early access, and it has come a long way. I love to start a new game and create my own story, I honestly think ~ with how in-depth this game is ~ that one could write an interesting story from their gameplay. i may not have but 50- hours on this game, but that is due to the fact that my pc can no longer play the game smoothly enough for enjoyment. I hope more graphic options are added in the near future, but it would be more simpler for me to get a new system rather than them redoing their program for users. they have already done so much to make this game as fun and as in-depth as possible. Thumbs up, and Post your own recommendations to let others know of Kenshi!			"

								-IMPORTANT - > The first thing you should know about this game, is that the Devs care. I first realized this when the updates came not with speed, but with good, quality content. The Devs do not rush updates to make people happy, they are not filled with fluff and pointless things, but instead are filled with bug fixes and content that truly help advance the game state. In fact in a recent news post about an upcoming update the devs said ""•Entirely new world map.  More detailed and polished, new factions, new content, things to explore.  Its' like Kenshi 2.  Crazy.  I should have called it Kenshi 2 and charged for it again, but I didn't.  Damn."" That comment right there just shows you that these devs understand what other Early Access developers do, and that they are not like those other early access developers.Now for how I feel about the actual game. This game takes time to get a lot of enjoyment out of it, but you do get just that. In most starting scenarios you choose from, you are dirt poor, and you are nothing close to a hero. Kenshi is not easy, you'll most likely die quite a few times at the start. As time progressive you gain more members to your squad and your existing members become more experienced. There is a really great feeling that comes when your squad finally becomes strong enough to destroy a group of bandits without any outside help. Eventually you will be able to build an outpost, which if you do not build incorrectly can be quite difficult (and by incorrectly I mean not building a stone mine and building materials producer first thing). Eventually you will be able to build research stations which allow you to learn how to farm and create your own items such as armour and weapons. Even balistas and walls can be build eventually. If you put in the time this game can be vary rewarding, and best of all, a huge update is coming out quite soon, which will greatly improve the game. I 100% recommend giving this game a try, you will not be sorry.			"

								A great build of a game, why build? because is still in alpha but you can already see it has plenty of potential and it showing more and more with each update, mixes a couple of genders which might be unusual, but stands out great, and the feeling of the world is just amazing, might get buggy now and then, but the dev seem to pay atention to us, especially more than ever, definitly going to be something huge in the future.By the way, i have much more time played than what is registered on steam, i played a lot offline.

								As it stands, this game too unpolished and has a long way to go until it is running as you would expect. If the developer(s) can deliver what this game sets out to be however, i will probably be spending as much free time as possible playing it as the potential is amazing. Just too many limitations as it stands, for example i spawn in some area and the map shows a town nearby, i go to visit this town and am greeted with a 'beta limitation prevents you from going any further' or something along the way. Head back the way i went to see if can discover another town somewhere and get killed by a boar or something, lol. There seem to be regular updates but at the moment when something gets fixed and several new issues arise. Saying that, if you enjoy Mount & Blade then you should enjoy this as it is a similar sort of game just in a different setting. With all that said this game is a tremendous amount of fun and i for one am willing the developers to get it completed as even with the content thats currently available, once its all working and running as it should then this game would be worth double the asking price.

								This is my first game review, where to start with kenshi... I have played this game sense early access being force to take breaks due to lack of stability. This game is everything I have always wanted, the roles you can take the openness and freedom you feel durning the game from start till death or Supreme Rule. The depth is perfect, I am always talking and look for more lore on the races and on the old ans new empires, I have played sense .40 or earlier I bought it right around when steam greenlight launched, I am iffy on time frames. I have tried my hardest to sell my friends on this game, few gave it a chance but those that did understand my love for it. I want to thank the developers for their constant patches and updates for this 11/10 game that ill for and always love. Stay alive!			"

								I bought this game a long time ago. Installed it. Played it. Not impressed, buggy as hell, low fps, bah.Tried it again a few weeks ago.Started the game in ""Rock Bottom"" mode, because I liket the idea of starting from scratch. The following happened:Appeared on a barren rocky wasteland wearing rags, with no food, and a stick in my hand. No idea what to do. Found a place called Holy MInes on the map. Went there, hoping for charity from preists or something.No, religious fanatics. Enslaved me after I tried to steal some food. Beaten, worked as a slave, tried to escape, got caugth, brought back to slavery. I repeatedly esacped, and repteadly got beaten and brought back to slavery.Until one time, they just stabbed me in the stomach, and left me to die.I didn't die. I survied, started mining ore and sold them to the Holy Outlaws, hired more people, eanred some money, and now we're travelling the world, and recruiting warriors to rebel agains the HOly Empire. I'm obsessed with vengeance over the Holy Nation. :DThis game is waaaay too much fun, can't stop playing.			"

Early Access Review
								When I first found Kenshi it was but a poorly formed early stage physics game set in the deserted land of God know where, I fought to create my kingdom and would eventually stick around long enough to see my squad grow large, slavers invade the land and cannibals rampage recklessly.Then things got stale, as progress was slow at best, I left for probably a little over a year, checking back here and there to see what's up.Thing's have really changed around here, the landscape is majestic and diverse(v90.X), the engine can still be slow at times but I am also running it on as high quality as the settings allow, which aren't too bad.My story starts in Western hive, I awake with my new found sword, a hefty bounty on my head of 10000 cats and basically nothing to my name, as I spend the early time exploring I quickly come to realize that while I can buy raw meat to cook I can't actually cook it around the hive or they will think I am stealing from them, and let me tell you having the entire hives personal army after you can be a scary sight.Once out of the immersive jungle atmosphere I found a familar sight of mountains followed by long flat sands. I made my way East.  Stumbling upon a large city, which I avoided once I realized the holy knights of whomever didn't like me so much, I turned North, towards a small mining community, there I learned the basics of sneak and thieving before eventually being chased out by the guards.  They didn't have much to offer anyway.Through the crashes as I tried to head into a misty valley I quickly turned back East and made my way to some small farming houses, here I learned the basics of Assassination, spending my time quickly smacking some basic farmers across the head and waiting for them to regain conciousness so I could do it again, it was a good chunk of fun watching my failures turn to *Thunk*s, but the holy paladins would eventually find my shenanigans and chase me out.From here I would venture further North, then East into the mountains, I had stolen just enough food from the farmers to get myself over the mountains.  It wouldn't be long before I would eventually find another mining community, here I truly refined my skills and smacking people over the head, and when I was all done and good I jailed the guards and freed the prisoners, who would for some ungodly reason choose to stand inside their unlocked cells permanently.  Whatever.After my skills in sneaking, thieving, and Assassination where at an all time high (and after battling through some crashes) I found myself back on the road and heading south, I needed food pretty bad, even if I had enough to tide me over for the next day or two.  Heading South in the mountains I ran into a strange man from the Adventurers guild, Paste was his name.  He never saw me, he was unconsious in seconds and before long I was trading my shirt and pants for his ninja garb, leather shirt and hat.  All of course of high grade quality.  I needed not for his weapons and left him to fight his way out wearing the trash I had just discarded.From his dreamland body I made my way up the nearby mountain where I ran into some ninjas, none of which seemed to rule the roost and all seemed quite pleased to simply sleep and smack the training dummies all day.  I joined in on this fun and boosted my otherwise pitiful swordplay to a reputable level.  Before long I tired of their boring game, and made my way back on the road.It was from here that I faced my true challenge, running farther south through the mountains I noticed a tower on the hill, hoping for more fun like the ninjas (but better) I made my way towards it.  As I reached the main gate I realized I had come across the main hideout for the Dust Bandits.  Oh how those buggers had long been a thorn in my side in patches previous.  It was time to see what they were hiding.Inside all but an unobservant sentinel were asleep on their bed mats, even the king of the bandits himself.  From this dangerous ground floor I made my way up and up to the prisoners floor, where I met poor old stupid Cat.  What an idiot, getting himself captured under the false pretense of being a noble.  Annoying to talk to as well.  I knew the king had to  be carying something worthwhile as his bounty nearly tripelled my own, 30k cats.So after talking to the buffoon cat, I waited and ambused one dust boss after another, until all 9 cages and 2 chain spikes had a prisoner attached, and there is poor old cat, unlocked chains and he's lost his mind, unable to leave from the shackles he has spent the past few seasons attached to.Not my problem though, I knock out the king and loot myself a beautiful new shirt, better than the last.  I proceed upstairs so I can unlock a nearby chest, looting all the bandits food supplies + a new small backpack to carry it in.Made off like a bandit in black, just before crashing again.Anyway,TL;DR immersive game, multiple play styles, okay graphics, choppy at times, loading can be annoying, map isn't full sized yet but speaks volumes for what it will be.  Talking to NPC's is sub par, sneaking system very easy to manipulate and break, same with assassination skill.  Thieveing a bit harder to bump up but seemingly good system.Great game if you can work around the current crashes and stability issues, very excited for the vision this game is headed for 7/10 currently, potential for 10/10 in the future.

								Great game, I have owned this game since alpha, and now that the new Beta release has come out with great improvements i must say, while trying to maintain a healthy hunger level for the squad while braving the wilderness to strike it rich and build a settlement is truly a challenging and fun adventure. The beta has much more of a sense of immersion into the games rustic and barren wasteland, you can feel your fear running from town to town as you don't know if you have enough to bribe the bandits walking past, get eaten by cannibals or even stumble across a hive of cancerous BEAKED THINGS. Great game if you love the micro management , very difficult and time consuming game. However also very rewarding.8.5/10			"

								This is one of the best games I've played in a long time. If a tactical sandbox rpg combined with city building and crafting etc sounds interesting, this is the game for you.It has a few glitches, mostly with the pathing at times but just saving and reloading usually helps.Also I captured a bandit, put him in a bed in one of my houses and then locked the door. When he woke up and tried to get out the game crashed.. verfied this happening 3 times in a row lol, eventually I just reloaded and carried him to a cage instead.Atm using 10+ captured bandits to train my recruits. They get their asses beaten all day long by the bandits, but some are starting to man up lol. When they are all unconscious on the floor my main character moves in to clean up and put them back in their cages. 9/10Can't wait to see what this game will become, one of the most enjoyable early access games I know. With some polish, optimization and a few more features I could see this game becoming a masterpiece.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi is a very ambitious, low budget game. Unfortunately this usally results in a very undirected, dull experience and Kenshi is no exception to this rule. My experience progressing through this game was very unsatisfying. For a good portion of the game none of your characters will ever be strong enough to kill any of the animals or humans you encounter in the world. The most feasible way to progress I found, was to game the system by stealing valuable items from settlements that should have been defended were it not for bugs, or by leading enemy packs into guards then selling their equipment back to the people who killed them. If there were any legitimate ways to make a living in this game I was not able to find them. The world of Kenshi may be huge but there is so little to do other than run from stronger enemies while scrounging for abandoned loot to sell.What's rather impressive is the party system which allows you to split your tribe into smaller groups who are then able to travel all around the world in real time. However, loading between areas isn't instant, so while you'll want to constantly switch between groups to ensure that none are in danger, generally this will mean most of your time will be spent waiting for terrain to load.I don't believe the party system scales well either. For every group it takes nearly all your concentration to spot and avoid enemies. If you are split between two groups this becomes impossible so that the best strategy by far is to strip down all your survivors in order to outrun any enemy rather risk fighting some of them. This game would greatly benefit from some kind of spotting skill to empower the ai to avoid groups that are too strong, or at the very least it should include some kind of warning system.In short if this game had a team twice as large they might have been able to fill this world with interesting content but as it stands there's not much to do other than running around, hiding from enemies.

Early Access Review
								This game is absolutely great for generating your own personal stories. Better so than most games of its ilk. It starts off at a grindingly slow pace, but once it gets going you'll have developed a deeply personal attachment to your first four or five guys in your party. Let me tell you one that I am very glad I experienced.Roud, A weak, hot headed man half starved and an injured arm has just barely escaped with his life from his sacked hamlet. The lone surviver and least respected of his people, is now thrusted into an unforgiving world with nothing but a pair of torn pants and a lead pipe. On his first week he attacks a small group of starving bandits, quickly learning just how easily outmatched he is by even the most ill equipped of raiders. He only survives thanks to wandering band of merchants who tended to his wounds while he was passed out. Thankful for his saviors, he decides to follow them. The merchants tolerate him, despite his almost complete uselessness. Roud acted as one of their bodyguards, slowly building up his strength and being able to suffer a few hits from a rusty sabre. Always reassured in the knowledge that should be begin to fail, the other bodyguards would be willing to lend a hand. He had his share of the loot since the merchants didn't take any interest on what the bandits where carrying, only focusing on running goods from town to town. This didn't last long for Roud however, for after two weeks they encounterd a large, organized group of bandits.He fought hard as did his allies, even managing to down bandit or two on his own, but merchants steadily began dropping one by one, followed by the guards. The main culprit? The bandit leader, adorned in heavy armor and sword far larger and more thick than any man should be able to wield effectively. eventually Roud met the end of the hulking nightmare of a man and was struck down.Miraculously, he woke up to a pile of eviscerated corpses and nothing but a minor cuts on himself. He had merely passed out from bloodloss, a massive relief to him. Even more miraculously he found the corpses five bandits including their leader, the very one who had slaughtered guards and merchants alike with ease. A band of Samurai can be seen from the distance, no doubt the perpetrators of such an act. Roud ignored the small fry and immediately pilfered the massive man's body, adorning his armor and plucking his sword from his cold hands, only stopping to grab a helmet from the one of the other dead bandits. His face now hidden behind a metal mask, his torso protected by iron platemail, and massive sword so heavy he must drag it along the sand, he heads west towards the nearest town, the one he had left only a few days ago following the merchants. After such a defeat, only one thing rested on his mind: ""I must become the strongest fighter in the sands"". He exhausted, he's injured, he's carrying valuable loot, and more importantly he's alone. When he arrives in town, the first thing he does is rent a bed and collapse.When he awakes, his mouth is dry. He heads to the local pub and trades all but his most valuable loot to the barkeep in exchange for a decent sum of cash and a stiff drink. Out corner of his eye, an absolutely gigantic dark skinned man stands in the corner of the bar with his arms folded. In dire need of an extra sword, he saunters over to the giant and drops a sack of coins in front of the man. ""Five hundred catts straight up if you join me"" The dark skinned man only nods and steps forward, only uttering what can be presumed to be his name ""De-Zerka"" The two left town that evening to wander the desert. They had very few victories, but each fight left them stronger, more experienced, and more dangerous. The two became close friends, and eventually made it to the point they could cleave through half a gang of bandits before going unconscious. This was a blessing, as they proved too risky to risk staying in the same viscinity, unconscious or not; not to mention having to tend to the wounded, if not outright abandoning them.Eventually, the two realized the necesity for a third sword, more importantly one who can sow and bandage wounds. The next town they greeted a friendly, short and nimble woman, ""Tuner"". When asked if she knew her way with a medkit, she nodded and hired her on the spot. She proved skillful with a katana, and very effective at not getting hit.The three travelled for a long while, long enough to be feared by many wandering parties across the desert. Even the Holy Nation, very organized, and heavily armored knights with fanatical beliefs, felt threatened by them, though their patrols only served as fodder for the party's quest for becoming the best fighters in the land. Along the way even allowing a Fourth member, ""Hanbu"", an man of average size, stout legs, and a firm back. He served mainly as the pack mule, carrying a large backpack for most of their loot to be stored. Even he became a formidable foe to fight against.By now, Roud had become a very skilled in his own right. His own hot headedness made him very aggressive, often charging straight into the enemy and going berserk. Not even a broken arm, cracked skull, and a knife in his gullet could stop his rampage. De-Zerka as well, wielding the looted armor from Holy Nation and weapon more reminiscent of a long, metal paddle than a sword, becoming renown for destroying a man's skull in one swing. Tuner kept mostly to the sidelines, choosing to pick off the bandits from the flanks rather than risk charging headfirst into danger. She was easily the fragile of the group, but most effective at dealing with the small fry.But this party would soon meet it's untimely end, their quest cut short.On their usual run between towns they  see a strange sight ahead. A gigantic mob swarming around the settlement. Upon further observation they realized it was cannibals. They would always travel in large groups, but never have they seen one as large as this. Their numbers were so many that their howls and cheers could be heard from miles away. At least 5 or 6 hundred of them. Not willing to travel to another town and feeling heroic, the party decides to attack the mob head on.The Cannibals came pouring from the gates, some of them carrying the unconscious residents with them and easily surrounded the party. Roud, whipped into a fury, charges deep into the mob, cutting down cannibal left and right while De-zerka, Tuner, and Hanbu instead of following him, stayed behind, choosing to cover their backs and fight defensively. Roud fought valiantly, but each hit the cannibals were able to connect with him wore him down. Slowly, but surely. All around him lie corpses, yet the chanting, screaming mass of ugly, tatooed abominations surrounding him were unfased. He had made a significant dent in their numbers, but there were still far too many to be considered done.A cry rings out, Hanbu had been struck dead. Tuner panics and runs through the thinnest part of the crowd, fleeing for her life as ten or fifteen cannibals give chase. Roud, distracted and dishearted, takes a blow to the head. He staggers, his vision blury, and he swings his massive sword into the crowd. Another blow, this to his arm: it dangles by his side, effectively usless in the situation. He continues to swing his sword, furious at his sloppyness, the death of one of his comrades, and the betrayal of another. No matter how many cannibals he slaughters it seems like no use as they wittle him down to the point where he can barely stand. He sees passed the crowd one of the tribal monstrosities carrying De-Zerka over his shoulder.... This was it... this is his last battle and it only took him until now to figure it out. He can barely muster enough strength to swing his sword one last time before a pipe to his head fells himBy the way the last bit was in no way an exaggeration, the game bugged and accidentally spawned a gazillion of cannibals.

								This game is early access, like super early access. It's got bugs, and issues, and crashes from time to time. But its got potential, and already has many working features. But I love the game to bits already. Options are numerous is very custimizable, varied starting choices, even got mods!Some people fear that this game will never be finished; that it's just a cash grab, well they're wrong. The developer has monthly updates with what they're working on, what new features, races, etc are being planned.It's a giant endeavor, and the one single developer and a couple of hires are working as hard as possible to make updates live, but its slow work yes.If you're looking for a complete game, get the ♥♥♥♥ out now. But if you're looking for that something that fun that could consume hours upon hours of your time, this is it.You're looking for that 100% open world game, this is it.You're looking for something to hope for, to once more confirm the belief that a game in early access can become great? This is it right here.They even got a demo if you're unsure about buying the game yet!It'll be a slow process, but I am 100% behind this game and the developer(s)!More information at http://lofigames.com/ "

Imagine if Mad Max was made by Akira Kurosawa.A desert world, bleak, hostile, vast.  Sparsely populated by junk towns and populated by newborn cultures based on old black & white samurai films, with a touch of the spaghetti westerns born thereof thrown in for good measure.  Men and women in coolie hats with katanas fighting against groups of bandits and crazed cannibals, trying to build secure outposts of safety in a violent and chaotic world.This was the game that advertised back when I bought into it.  This was the game that was promised.  Does this sound like a great idea for a game?  Does this sound like a game that you would want to play?  Well tough crap, suckers, because all that is going bye-bye!Welcome to a fantasy world filled with lush jungles, mysterious forrests, dangerous wolf packs, and strange races - bone men, bug men, and robots.  Oh joy, robots!  And giant monster things!  That's just what every samurai adventure needs, right?  That vast wasteland that took hours to cross is now a map ten times larger!  Why?  Because we can.  Not that you'll ever get any use out of that, but so what?  This game is no longer about wandering ronin traversing the desert in search of adventure.  It is now the living avatar of feature creep, fueled by what seems like some kind of unending mescaline binge and slowly morphing into new game entirely... a game that's only common denominator with the original is that there are swords.And all this has been while continuing to fail at fixing bugs that are literally as old as the game itself.  Constant crashes, dysfunctional pathfinding, and broken tools thrown around like a gas explosion in a mechanic's garage.  Rather than fix the game they already had they instead decided to turn it into a RTS version of Morrowind, only weirder, if you can imagine such a thing.Now maybe that is a game that you'd be interested in and I won't begrudge someone for liking that, but personally I don't care for the bait and switch.  I certainly do not appreciate the constant adding of more crap that I don't recall anyone asking for while everything that came before it is still horribly broken.I saw an idea, a great idea, for a game that I would like to play.  I paid for that game.  Today I see a completely different game being made, one that I simply have no interest in, while the one I bought was never finished - and never will be.So if you're looking for a high-fantasy, RTS version of your favorite magical wonderland, go right ahead and get Kenshi.  If you're looking for the post-apocalypse desert wandering ronin adventure originally advertised on the box then you're out of luck - keep looking, maybe someday, someone will make that game for real.Final note: Posting this as a review since I was being banned from forum for saying the same things.

								The game is exactly what you would expect from it, the pictures give out alot about the game. though the game has been in development for over 8 years now, its recent sucess as a green-lit steam game has enabled the team to grow ( 6 now), the game is pushing beta soon as many great features are being implimented. This game is aleady inovative and fun, a no loss investment with a great dev team that still hold onto their dreams for kenshi. Lo-Fi games could be standard barrers for what indie devs should be, but thier future as devs is still something to be seen, hopefully the team continues to grow and we could see even better, larger scope games from them.In short, defo worth the price and a safe investment for an early access.

								A game you can play your way, from wandering the world doing good or evil to making a village and expanding it to a town or a fort. Set up trade with other CPU towns and defend your self from the raiders and bandits that roam the land.This game is not finnished but its more playable than most other EA games and has a somewhat realistic feel, combat will result in damage to body parts, bleeding, broken limbs, coma's and even death, but fear not your villagers can not only heal each other buy carry them to bed to heal faster.well worth the asking price, rarely crashes but the combat can be a lil difficult early game due to poorly trained warriors.

								The Game:Kenshi is a game that can't be catagorized. It's a beautiful, sword-punk blend of RPG, RTS, and to some extent a city builder/Sims-style survival game where you cater to basic needs. The demo does the game little justice, and many people who rate it poorly probably never experienced the transition of this game into what it is now. The developers are committed to creating a living world, and tailors an RPG-style game where you are no hero. Even if you choose a start that makes you top dog when it comes to the scum of Kenshi, you bite the bullet. Pros: -Multiple ways/""genres"" to play.-Multiple settings for adjusting the difficulty, for better or worse.-Beautiful world, at least for an independently developed game. -Creature/racial artwork and variety is unique, and funnily deceiving (cute goats that can massacre a small squad).-Dedicated development team, which has proven itself over the long-term.-Lots of replayability, and even punishing starts can have a silver lining.-Combat can be sometimes frustrating, but always beautiful to watch, with drastic outcomes based on even the smallest decisions.-Character customization can be oddly entertaining, and...-Mechanics can be easily caught onto, and easier to work around with a little time and effort.Cons:-Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. It was much worse at the initial release of the Beta, but within a week or so the most game breaking were patched. -The Dev team actively makes use of bug reports, even catering to some very specific issues players faced in the past.-World can be laggy, even on a good computer. This is, however, on high graphics and almost exclusive to high density bandit zones or rendering of the map.-Updates may feel slow, but minor ones with huge impacts are frequent.-Game can crash due to random errors introduced with an update (commencing specific research, as an example when the game entered beta), but these are once again usually patched within a day or few.-Can be painfully punishing, and some mechanics are unrefined, but bear in mind many mechanics are fresh to the beta and much of it is an EXPERIMENTAL build.Kenshi isn't everyone's cup of... well, dust and rust. Despite this, its flexibility, originality, and progression through the years has proven it a capable contender and worth the attention.			"

								Probably the most effective genre-busting game in its' time. It's real, -real- post-apocalyptic game that doesn't teach you anything easily and lets you figure the game out as you go, and if you're an idiot, you'll be killed. Be a smart survivor - Realize that people are absolutely insane who live in the wastelands and will likely rob you, or at the very worst, outright eat you limb by limb. - And those in the cities treat you as far as your money can throw you. . Passed that, they will let you die from starvation, don't care if you bleed out in the streets and die, may rob you - or they might  join you in your cause. . as long as you have the money to sway them. You can be anything from a Adept Scavenger quick on their toes and trade goods for great profit between towns, to a bandit crew who massacres a farmers village for their base and all of the goods within  - whom you can trade to a fence inside a town while in a disguise as to not alert Bounty Hunters or the guards of the nation whom you've killed their subjects, to a group of settlers trying to eek out an existence amidst the wasteland and start from a lowly village to a legendary town with an abundance of food and technology new to the post-apocalyptic world. You may learn of hidden locations, if you're lucky, and encounter a plethora of characters. . Though not all are friendly.You may be lucky and find a wandering traveler in which you can sell your goods, as well as purchase blue prints to upgrade your skill set or your very own Factional town - Of course you could just murder them and take all their goods, though you may incur a bounty that will cause you to be hunted by lawgiving police. - You could either turn yourself in and face a smaller stint in jail and/or be forced to slave away in the mines, OR you could become an infamous raider whose tales of dread are recognizable to everyone in the province. Of course,  you could always be successful noble and create your own Faction city in which all nations depend on for their trade and have the most legendary army that no one would dare question your authority. -- Or, if you were to be really ambitious, you could become an abolisher of slavery and take over the province as the rightful sire of the lands - if you're ready for hardship, effort, death, surprises, and ultimate victory.

Early Access Review
								I have played this game since version .15 or so, back when it was nothing but a desert and black portraits for characters. Having said this, the game has come a long way since then. However, after the version that added the first new expansion to the north of the new map the additions are trivial and ""same old"" as the ones that came before them. While some bugs have came and gone no actual meaningful features have been added just new areas to do the same old things in.I've played this game on multiple different saves, some with huge squads, some with just 4, and on steam here this many hours was put solely on a single character. I mention this because playing with a single character will allow you to see the overglaring flaws that this game has fundementally. I loved Kenshi, when the first map expansion came out and I ran into the armor king I couldn't wait for chris to add more depth to the story or even special characters like him but I've been let down every single update since then as I said previously any new expansion is just additions to the same old routine. At this point in my solo playthrough I can kill anything without much effort, even being hopelessly outnumbered. Most of the main draw of the game *was* the difficulty for me, that has now been shattered. It took over 100 hours to get to that point but the fact it exists and any new content is null because of it shows that this game will not be anything more than it is currently. It lacks depth it lacks character. Even if they throw the rest of the map together I'll just roam aimlessly to find all markers and slaughter the highest stat enemies I can find but none of it will bring the fun back.You can steal things, why bother after the 2nd or 3rd town sack? You can kill things, why bother after 80+ stats, you can trade, why bother when you don't even need cats unless you need material from shops. That is the current feature list as it stands. You cannot meddle within the current factions, you cannot influence them in any way, you cannot help them against eachother in any way. In short, the only decisions you have to make seem rather dull and tiny compared to when you let your imagination run free and fill in the gaps for you. There's no doubt that anyone who first loves this game as I have will do that very thing. In the end it comes down to this; Is Kenshi worth 20$ as it stands? Yes, it is. even playing as I did, 100 hours is easily worth the money, I've spent far more on far less gametime. But do I recommend it to others? No, it's a love-hate relationship for me. Once you see the game for what it really is it's a shell of what could have been. I can only imagine how chris will decide to salvage what tiny bit is left to finish and tie it all together. Unless he's hiding some major features that he has yet to even announce to anyone after all these years the game core itself, the very heart of it, will be a cheap experience that will continue to make you feel empty and ask ""what if"" or ""what could have been""			"

								A very well done game. Kenshi provides the player next to nothing and tells them to make something out of a harsh enviroment full of dire wolves, maruders, and cannibals. The hurde is very high for getting top quality gear and experienced people to use it, granted they arn't mauled or killed in the process. But after that, you run out of things to do. Point being, the journey to the top is fun and challenging, but the end game is boring.			"

								Kenshi is a RPG-RTS featuring a slow progression and massive learning curve. It's core features, being RTS battles and Dwarf Fortress-like base building, are made more complex with every patch. Though, it does lack somethings, for instance: The beginning starts you out fairly weak, even the beginnings geared towards making you more combat ready only leave you with a powerful weapon against an army of more experienced bandits.The difficulty fluctuated heavily a few hours in though. Even after amassing an army, you still aren't strong enough to take on a single bandit party. However, when you reach a point, and you've leeched a few kills off of guards with your squad of cowards, you're able to leave the game running with no fear of attack -- or agency. I'd automated an entire camp. Random events and the like, a feature of base-building games that it emulates, would and have been a boon. This game could easily be the greatest game I ever play -- the potential is there. I need that 3D dwarf fortress.			"

								I remember stumbling across this game's website years ago, very early when it was a mere concept with a couple of screenshots. I didnt really understand it and there was no release or anything, but I liked the name and it had ninjas and open world rpg elements. I bookmarked the page and forgot about it until I found it on Steam when it first released as early-access. Bought it and it turned out to be what I expected from my first encounter. Different, with a learning curve, but extremely unique and tons of fun. Some of the coolest combat and health systems in any game ive played. Its early in it's stages but it is tons of fun with lots to do. The devs are active and fixing the game, and when there arent any game updates, they update us with progress and their plans for the future. buy this game			"

								I love this game, it combines the best aspects of an RTS base building game and an RPG, it has its fair share of bugs as an EA game. But nevertheless its a very good game. As of Beta this game is finally showing its true colors. They fixed most of the bugs that plagued the game and have implemented a huge new map as well as new races, and tons of new features, all around 80% polished and thank god its now pretty much crash free, after around 10 hours of gameplay only experienced one crash after dismantling a building with people in it. Everything else is pure perfection! Cant wait until they unlock the rest of the map, only about a 6th is playable right now and its still around 3-4 times bigger than the old map, its exciting and even more so since its now playable performance wise. If you where thinking about getting the game, get it now!			"

								(This review was created on March 3rd, 2014. It may become obsolete sooner or later.)This game has potential. It really does. It's a sandbox in a steampunk neo-feudal Japan-esque setting. The dev has not clarified what's going on and probably won't tell us for a very long time. I bought this before it was released on Steam, and I have to say: It has grown. It has trading, city building, realistic warfare, a complex medic system, and a whole lot of other things. There is one major issue that has been plaguing the alpha: a good portion of the game progression right now is attracting bandits and luring them to town guards. Once you have accumalated enough ""Cats"" you can try your hand at founding a faction, building an army, then start a town. Recent updates have added more difficulty to maintaining your humble abode. Raiders will come knocking and try to extort money off of you and cannibals will invade and attempt to take you and your men to their kitchen. You can research new technology with a certain workbench, but I won't bother saying much since I have yet to experiment with it.So. Do I recommend this game? Sure, but not in it's current alpha state. If you want to invest in a gaem that has a bright future, go ahead and buy it. Just remember that it's alpha.			"

								A Squad-Based Sandbox RPG, where you can become and do (almost) anything you want.So I became a rotting carcass after my first encounter with a group of Dust Bandits. 10/10!I purchased this game a long time ago in early-alpha state with nothing more than a desert map trying to survive in my own created settlement. I set up a small trading caravan and travelled across the desert to purchase and sell good for the highest profit. I really enjoyed it but stopped playing for some reason I can't recall.Recently rediscovered the game and came back to a brand new world. Some amazing new features have been added, like a completely new map, new species (love the Shek and Hiver Races!), new skills, new researchh tree. Really Enjoyed it once more!For people who don't know if they should buy it, just do it. It takes a bit of time and practice to get used to the game, but once you do you're hooked!			"

								The developers are really taking their time with this one.  Upon release it's gonna be a great game.  They are fixing bugs and taking time to really make it fun.  I've seen this game grow over the past two years and it's really turning out to be a good g ame.It has a fairly steep, but rewarding learning curve, so be prepared to be frustrated early on as bandits overpower you.  They are making ways for you to run away from slavers asap and escape from slavery if you are attacked and knocked unconscious, then kidnapped by slavers.  Often early on, its simply easier to run from bandits than to get slaughtered.Early on, try to spend money on building up your team.  Having many low skilled npcs on your side is a huge bonus against the highly skilled enemies you'll face.  If you can, train them up on the training dummies in the towns before heading out to the dangerous wastes.			"

Slow ♥♥♥ running.This is when the death march back to civilization began.Spiders, spiders everywhere. Took out the first few groups and bandaged up but began to get more and more beat up.Group of 8 spiders got me. Knocked me out and crippled my leg.Didn't die! Woke up but now even walk slower with crippled leg.Crippled leg and crazy amount of loot in inventory. I will not give up any loot. Too greedy. Keep walking at snails pace.Spiders again. Knocked out. Wake up. Spiders again. Knocked out. Wake up. This is my death march.Happens a dozen times and then i realize that i left all my food at the armoury to make room for more loot.So now I'm starting starve to top it off. Still a long way from civilization. Damn spiders. No fabric to make bed to sleep and heal. Starvation issue becoming more dire. So much amazing loot in backpack.No slavers around. No cannibals around. I might be ok. I am a walking living treasure chest for whoever decides to beat me up and steal all my glorious loot.Watch distance to town get smaller, as well as my stomach. Can i make it before i starve or run into slavers?Roll into town about 20 points away from death. Skinny as hell. Eat glorious meatwraps. Sell loot i dont want. Profit from deathmarch? Almost 175 grand. Greed paid off. Would death march all over again. One of my many adventures. Love this game. Support it. Buy it. Damn spiders.			"

								I really like this game, I'm not entirely sure why I do.  It could be the brutal difficulty, or the fact you can play about five different ways, and it feels like radicaly different games in doing so.1) Base building and trading2) Mercenary and Bandit hunting3) An RPG with a small well monitored team4) Grand stratagy with dozens or more soilders (I once had 256 at one time, all outfitted differently).5) All of the above at the same time.The game is a massive time sink, and I often find myself starting it up and playing it whenever I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for, or if it has updated recently.  It is a game where time goes to die, and you will find yourself at a loss of what happened to the last 12 hours of your life.  Overall, I recommend it to anyone who likes micro-management games with lots of little details to go over and make sure are working.Some downsides are, the graphics aren't the best, and there are some clip issues, and the base building could be a lot more natural, but I think even with those falls it works as a game.  But like I said, no idea why I like it as much as I do, just if you aren't sure about it, and you like micro-management stuff, well, give it a try!  If you don't like managing inventories and resource management, and always needing just a little more cash, not for you.			"

								First experience of the game: Cool - I started near a farm and I see other people. I'll go talk to them and see if I can get a quest. Wait why is he shouting at me about being a heretic. Oh I'm unconcious on the floor. Wait. Wait some more. That's better I'm standing up again. Oh look doggies. Wait what? I'm dead! One more restart and then I'm giving up on this...Cool I started near a different farm, in the desert. Oh look there's a massive fight between people and animals in the distance I'll go look. Arrive in time to loot corpses. Yay I have a few animal skins an some better trousers. Now I'll go sell these. Wait why I am being attacked by the villagers? Yay I got a hit in! Oh I'm dead. Just one more restart then I'm giving up on this...Cool I started near some weird insect people... (insert stuff). Wait I'm dead. Just one more restart...Cannibals? Interesting I bet they have some loot... Wait I'm (you guessed it) dead. Just one more restart...I was honestly ready to give up on this game after my first character died before I even really knew what was happening. But then the game really grew on me. When you start as just a normal person (or people if you choose some of the start options) there's a real sense of achievement when you make it! But make no mistake, this game is unforgiving at the start (which btw I think is brilliant) - if you get frustrated by losing your progress because you're outclassed and didn't run away fast enough (or sometimes even if you did) then this might not be a game for you25 hours in and I'm on probably my 7th or 8th restart but this time I managed to survive long enough to mine some stone, build a house, some walls and grow wheat. I'm now a bread baron, hauling 50 loaves a week to the local city and managed to hire a couple of extra pairs of hands. I feel like I've hit big time. Until I look at someone the wrong way and get killed I guess :)Really enjoying this game, despite my early fears that I might not. It feels like a dynamic world where you can build what you want and interactions with NPCs feel pretty believable, especially for an early access game. Yes it's quite hard. But as that's really the point, and by being hard you really do feel you've achieved something. And it's the sort of game where (like real life) from a random sequence of events you just sort of fall into doing something you'd have never planned and it turns out to be fun (I certainly didn't expect my best success so far to be as a baker running the gauntlet between cannibals and wild dogs to get my bread to market every week!)I look forward to expanding my bakery whilst seeing off hordes of hungry bandits for many hours to come (I've just installed some crossbow turrets to help with that). Until I overlook some small detail and die.ProsNo handholding / tutorial. Like real life!Engaging universe and NPC interactionsNo set direction - you canfight, trade, build in whatever combination you enjoyGraphics look niceConsDifficult - don't spend too long customising you character at the start - they probably won't make it!Some graphical issues which I expect will get ironed out before releaseDefinitely recommend this game if you enjoy a challenging start.10/10 would die again (probably several times)			"

								I can easily recommend this game to anyone who likes sandox games ( kinda Mount and Blade style.. more or less). Once you get a hang of it, its pretty addictive. You will most likely invest more play time into just getting your character and a few recruits strong enough to finally feel comfortable enough to build your own base, than the entrie game time you spend on many AAA games. Hell, Im 23hrs in and still hold up at a bought farm house training my character and stealing ♥♥♥♥ from cities at night.So yeah, my To-Do List is pretty full right now. Getting enough money and materials to build a base is on the top. After that becoming self sufficent in terms of food/materials, recruiting and training more people, getting into crafting and bigger-scale trading to equip them with good gear, and then finally attacking some bigger targets like outposts or cities. Looking forward to kicking some holy-nation ♥♥♥, after all the crap Ive taken from them haha.But of course, as with all early access titles, one has to keep an open mind when buying one. The game is far from finished and polished. I have to play it on lowest settings to keep it somewhat playable (especially in or near cities...but to be fair, my PC is kinda getting old haha) and many things arent implemented yet etc. If you can live with that as I do, then this game is your wet dream. Otherwise Id wait a couple of months for some more updates.			"

								Went on a solo run with my main character to explore.Found a sweet old armoury with so much loot...heavy ♥♥♥ loot.Got greedy and decided to take as much as possible.Crap...encumbrance at 80 percent. Slow ♥♥♥ running.This is when the death march back to civilization began.Spiders, spiders everywhere. Took out the first few groups and bandaged up but began to get more and more beat up.Group of 8 spiders got me. Knocked me out and crippled my leg.Didn't die! Woke up but now even walk slower with crippled leg.Crippled leg and crazy amount of loot in inventory. I will not give up any loot. Too greedy. Keep walking at snails pace.Spiders again. Knocked out. Wake up. Spiders again. Knocked out. Wake up. This is my death march.Happens a dozen times and then i realize that i left all my food at the armoury to make room for more loot.So now I'm starting starve to top it off. Still a long way from civilization. Damn spiders. No fabric to make bed to sleep and heal. Starvation issue becoming more dire. So much amazing loot in backpack.No slavers around. No cannibals around. I might be ok. I am a walking living treasure chest for whoever decides to beat me up and steal all my glorious loot.Watch distance to town get smaller, as well as my stomach. Can i make it before i starve or run into slavers?Roll into town about 20 points away from death. Skinny as hell. Eat glorious meatwraps. Sell loot i dont want. Profit from deathmarch? Almost 175 grand. Greed paid off. Would death march all over again. One of my many adventures. Love this game. Support it. Buy it. Damn spiders.			"

								First experience of the game: Cool - I started near a farm and I see other people. I'll go talk to them and see if I can get a quest. Wait why is he shouting at me about being a heretic. Oh I'm unconcious on the floor. Wait. Wait some more. That's better I'm standing up again. Oh look doggies. Wait what? I'm dead! One more restart and then I'm giving up on this...Cool I started near a different farm, in the desert. Oh look there's a massive fight between people and animals in the distance I'll go look. Arrive in time to loot corpses. Yay I have a few animal skins an some better trousers. Now I'll go sell these. Wait why I am being attacked by the villagers? Yay I got a hit in! Oh I'm dead. Just one more restart then I'm giving up on this...Cool I started near some weird insect people... (insert stuff). Wait I'm dead. Just one more restart...Cannibals? Interesting I bet they have some loot... Wait I'm (you guessed it) dead. Just one more restart...I was honestly ready to give up on this game after my first character died before I even really knew what was happening. But then the game really grew on me. When you start as just a normal person (or people if you choose some of the start options) there's a real sense of achievement when you make it! But make no mistake, this game is unforgiving at the start (which btw I think is brilliant) - if you get frustrated by losing your progress because you're outclassed and didn't run away fast enough (or sometimes even if you did) then this might not be a game for you25 hours in and I'm on probably my 7th or 8th restart but this time I managed to survive long enough to mine some stone, build a house, some walls and grow wheat. I'm now a bread baron, hauling 50 loaves a week to the local city and managed to hire a couple of extra pairs of hands. I feel like I've hit big time. Until I look at someone the wrong way and get killed I guess :)Really enjoying this game, despite my early fears that I might not. It feels like a dynamic world where you can build what you want and interactions with NPCs feel pretty believable, especially for an early access game. Yes it's quite hard. But as that's really the point, and by being hard you really do feel you've achieved something. And it's the sort of game where (like real life) from a random sequence of events you just sort of fall into doing something you'd have never planned and it turns out to be fun (I certainly didn't expect my best success so far to be as a baker running the gauntlet between cannibals and wild dogs to get my bread to market every week!)I look forward to expanding my bakery whilst seeing off hordes of hungry bandits for many hours to come (I've just installed some crossbow turrets to help with that). Until I overlook some small detail and die.ProsNo handholding / tutorial. Like real life!Engaging universe and NPC interactionsNo set direction - you canfight, trade, build in whatever combination you enjoyGraphics look niceConsDifficult - don't spend too long customising you character at the start - they probably won't make it!Some graphical issues which I expect will get ironed out before releaseDefinitely recommend this game if you enjoy a challenging start.10/10 would die again (probably several times)			"

								The developers are really taking their time with this one.  Upon release it's gonna be a great game.  They are fixing bugs and taking time to really make it fun.  I've seen this game grow over the past two years and it's really turning out to be a good g ame.It has a fairly steep, but rewarding learning curve, so be prepared to be frustrated early on as bandits overpower you.  They are making ways for you to run away from slavers asap and escape from slavery if you are attacked and knocked unconscious, then kidnapped by slavers.  Often early on, its simply easier to run from bandits than to get slaughtered.Early on, try to spend money on building up your team.  Having many low skilled npcs on your side is a huge bonus against the highly skilled enemies you'll face.  If you can, train them up on the training dummies in the towns before heading out to the dangerous wastes.			"

								A Squad-Based Sandbox RPG, where you can become and do (almost) anything you want.So I became a rotting carcass after my first encounter with a group of Dust Bandits. 10/10!I purchased this game a long time ago in early-alpha state with nothing more than a desert map trying to survive in my own created settlement. I set up a small trading caravan and travelled across the desert to purchase and sell good for the highest profit. I really enjoyed it but stopped playing for some reason I can't recall.Recently rediscovered the game and came back to a brand new world. Some amazing new features have been added, like a completely new map, new species (love the Shek and Hiver Races!), new skills, new researchh tree. Really Enjoyed it once more!For people who don't know if they should buy it, just do it. It takes a bit of time and practice to get used to the game, but once you do you're hooked!			"

								Brutal, lovely, lonely, and wicked. There are many games, and there is Kenshi, too. Not since Dwarf Fortress have I had such a primal connection to a digital dude. Kenshi is like a greedy nerd, it steals all the good ideas around it and  claims them as it's own. And it is wildly successful, there are few sandboxes as interesting as this one. You'll set out to make a mark for yourself, but be lucky to not get obliterated by a herd of goats on your journey.It's a game that, as I can see in my 'Guy and his Dog' initial playthrough, wants you to explore it. There are a number of different launch conditions and each is different enough to warrant at least a gander. $20 is not a lot of money anymore, but Kenshi is sure enough a lot of game.Hardcore stuff, I couldn't recomment his game any higher. This is dystopia.			"

								I really like this game, I'm not entirely sure why I do.  It could be the brutal difficulty, or the fact you can play about five different ways, and it feels like radicaly different games in doing so.1) Base building and trading2) Mercenary and Bandit hunting3) An RPG with a small well monitored team4) Grand stratagy with dozens or more soilders (I once had 256 at one time, all outfitted differently).5) All of the above at the same time.The game is a massive time sink, and I often find myself starting it up and playing it whenever I'm not sure what I'm in the mood for, or if it has updated recently.  It is a game where time goes to die, and you will find yourself at a loss of what happened to the last 12 hours of your life.  Overall, I recommend it to anyone who likes micro-management games with lots of little details to go over and make sure are working.Some downsides are, the graphics aren't the best, and there are some clip issues, and the base building could be a lot more natural, but I think even with those falls it works as a game.  But like I said, no idea why I like it as much as I do, just if you aren't sure about it, and you like micro-management stuff, well, give it a try!  If you don't like managing inventories and resource management, and always needing just a little more cash, not for you.			"

								Kenshi.Purchased 16th Dec 2014.Playing as  Hive drone, one of 4 playable and original races (minus the obvious humans who have various subraces) whom I named Peaceful Kubo, I started in a Holy Nation farm, mining iron for Cats (the currency of the realm) I scratch a meager living from the rocks, I purchase greenfruits, grown on the farm I now reside on, I endure the soldiers racism as they march past on daily manouvers. I stare off to the north, alone, as the sun rises. I rush into the bar and sell off the last scraps of iron ore, buy food an animal companion and outfit it with baggage. I fill the bags with food and meds. And set off into the unknown abyss that is the desert sands. A scuffle between holy Nation paladins and some bone dogs breaks out, I swoop in, take some furs and a kit of Paladins armour and his blade - he wont be needing them - I now have a bounty of 2500 Cats on my head. As I travel northward to my freedom.Kenshi Includes -Good stuff-Base building, entire villages can be brough up by yoru hand and hard workSquad building and recruitmentInteresting lore and an original world filled with interesting and unique species.A medical system consisting of injuring different parts of the body and having different detrimental effects.An utterly huge open world - But not too big so to as get dull and boreing.Multiuple factions. A dozen or so skills.Research for better, more upgraded items and building to help with your skills and your,Modding community is already bloomingBad/ not good points -Though the game does suffer slow down and the occassional crash (To cut a long list short my PC is far above the recomended specs)The game does take a few seconds to ""warm up"" and load in textures, models etc - its a big game.The game - if your unprepared for a ruthless world, is utterly brutal, this may be very off puttingThe game is without a doubt poorly optimized - BUT it has improved drastically since I firts purchased it.Yes I have pathetic playtime, owing mainly to my older ♥♥♥♥ poor build of a pc when i purchased the game, Now with a more powerful beast and several patches of content and optimisation the game flows - there is some slow down in certain situations (which for a game this size is no bother at all.)

								The amount of work that has been put into this early access indie game is phenominal. Hands down a great and engaging game that has completely changed everytime i play. This game came a long long long way from the initial release and i pray to god the good work keeps up to improve the game (especially in terms of stability) so that this titile may rival mainstream games. The concept is unique and a lot of work has been put forth into making it engaging and visually appealing. 10/10 keep up the good work and if you are new to the game dont let the brutal difficulty at the start discourage you. play tactfully and use city guards for help hahaha. I love how this game focuses on your people just being a ragtag group of average individuals.			"

Early Access Review
								An RPG game with quite a nice graphical detail and quality. Kenshi is quite fun and addictive even though it's still in Alpha stage. It has a few bugs here and there (mainly movement), but they are normally just a slight annoyance. If you know and love the web browser RPG games Caravaneer and Caravaneer 2, you will probably love Kenshi as well. It is similar in many ways, with the difference being that Kenshi doesn't have a story line and is in 3D.Build version when I wrote this review: v0.74.32.Some tips I'd like to share with everyone who is new to Kenshi:-- Ctrl + Shift + F11 will probably be your best friend in the game when it comes to getting characters unstuck. -- If you are having problems renting a bed to sleep for your character to recover quickly, and you have more than one character in your party, use any of them to pick up whoever that needs a rest and place them on the bed. This allows you to use the bed for free as well. Recovery while standing still is a very slow process unless your characters have a high toughness value.-- Even with the fast forward button, Kenshi can still be fairly slow. The start of Kenshi will probably be a slow one unless you get lucky. Don't worry about creating a settlement early on as it isn't really important. I took about 100 game days to start establishing my settlement after I got enough money and was satisfied with my crew members' skill level.-- The training dummies provided at towns can only train melee strength until level 4. Don't bother leaving your characters to train after that because you'll be wasting your time.-- Make use of the melee defence button for weak characters. You can train their melee defence easily this way while buying time for your attacking characters.-- Loot high value items from bandits only (weapons, headgear, shoes, and armour). Keep an eye out for sand ninjas because their armour is nice and light, and so is their weapons. Take note that their stats are quite high though.			"

								Kenshi is a unique game that is finding its niche in a mix between an RTS, Sandbox-Builder and Survival game with possible future elements of an RPG. While it's still in Alpha it is a very well polished game that offers hours of play and even more replay-ability. It's definitely not a game for the easily frustrated because you'll find yourself starting as probably the weakest character in its yet-to-be-defined universe. Combat reflects a very realistic feel at the start: You're weak and everyone can and just about will kill you. It's a game of judging whether or not combat is really worth the possible outcome. Groups of 2-3 bandits will destroy you at the start so luring them back to larger groups is pretty much you're only option while you slowly build up the skills of your character. Having a large party will improve your odds but if they're still untrained it would be like sending a bunch of children to fight an adult. Yeah, they may overpower the adult but more than likely they'll all get beaten. There's already several ways to make money and the economy in the game is being tweaked. This just means you don't always have to fight bandits and other patrols to get the capital necessary to start your own outpost. Then when you have that the game definitely delivers several different ways of improving your little town and building your own army. I recommend trying this game out. There's a demo version of it available somewhere, in case you're the type worried about purchasing and not liking games still in development.			"

								I have been playing this game almost from the time it was GreenLit.  It is an amazing mix of RPG, RTS, City Management. Even without all the planned features implemented yet. It is still worth playing. When this game is complete, it will be one of the most awsome games to date. The developement is a little slow, but considering the size of the dev team and that they probably do most of the coding during their free time, it is understandable.  There are bugs, but you can expect that from a game in developement. The dev team is quick to address most issues or bugs as they appear.  In the end I can't stress enough, that this game is one that will provide hours and hours of game play and provide the player with the most choices in how to play. Be a lone wanderer just making his way by his sword. Lead a group of mercenaries to fame and riches. Become the most notorious bandit in the known lands, Found a city and produce goods for trade. I give this game a 9 out of 10 for being original and well developed. I hope after this project is done, the dev team continues to produce more amazing titles.Update:For those that like the pros and cons listed.Pros:1. Freedom - Explore, develope, wander, or waste your time as you please.2. Character Developement - You gain skill when you use it. Not if you have exp to spend on it.3. Aspect View - You can watch over from above or get into an almost 3rd person view of your party.4. Sandbox - No pun intended. You can build a base, or even a city.5. Swords - Lots of swords to fit your fighting styles.6. Random - Bandit and Canibal raids. If you have a city or base, Bandits and Canibals will find you.7. Unique - RTS meets RPG with City Management and Crafting.Cons:1. Pathing - Sometimes you have moving problems of your own, NPCs can get stuck for days on a rock.2. Trading - Trading is a little hard because of the pathing issues. NPCs will get stuck trying to get to you.3. Goals - With no ultimate goal, you can get to a point where you have to say, what do I do next. If there were a rival system. Or just a set of acheivements to get, it would add much more flavor IMO.4. Ranged Combat - I have seen in the blogs that this is comming, but until it does, there is a chunk missing from the combat tactics.5. Better AI - It always seems to be that there will be that one poorly armed bandit that is willing to battle it out with your band of 20 no matter what. Or the Bandits will chase one guy into a city and be swarmed with high level guards.6. Battle Animations - There are only a limited amount of fighting animations. Hack, slash, block, can get old after a while. No evaision or anything like that. In the end, I am hoping for a bit of polish to make this game great.  The next Update is supposed to be out soon and I can't wait.  Even with all the little frustrations and bugs.  I have had many hours of fun with this game and it has already been more than worth the $20 I paid for it.			"

								It's a pretty good game and worth keeping an eye on. Most glitches can be resolved by saving and loading the save which takes maybe ten seconds. It has a long way to go before it becomes worth more than twenty dollars, but for now that's a fair and economical price for the promises being made and the content we're getting. Keep in mind that this is an alpha. It is not smooth, it is not spitshined and polished, and it is not complete. Do not cast any final judgements until you're looking at a final product. For now, keep an eye on this game. It's shaping up to be uber fun.			"

								The amount of work that has been put into this early access indie game is phenominal. Hands down a great and engaging game that has completely changed everytime i play. This game came a long long long way from the initial release and i pray to god the good work keeps up to improve the game (especially in terms of stability) so that this titile may rival mainstream games. The concept is unique and a lot of work has been put forth into making it engaging and visually appealing. 10/10 keep up the good work and if you are new to the game dont let the brutal difficulty at the start discourage you. play tactfully and use city guards for help hahaha. I love how this game focuses on your people just being a ragtag group of average individuals.			"

								An RPG game with quite a nice graphical detail and quality. Kenshi is quite fun and addictive even though it's still in Alpha stage. It has a few bugs here and there (mainly movement), but they are normally just a slight annoyance. If you know and love the web browser RPG games Caravaneer and Caravaneer 2, you will probably love Kenshi as well. It is similar in many ways, with the difference being that Kenshi doesn't have a story line and is in 3D.Build version when I wrote this review: v0.74.32.Some tips I'd like to share with everyone who is new to Kenshi:-- Ctrl + Shift + F11 will probably be your best friend in the game when it comes to getting characters unstuck. -- If you are having problems renting a bed to sleep for your character to recover quickly, and you have more than one character in your party, use any of them to pick up whoever that needs a rest and place them on the bed. This allows you to use the bed for free as well. Recovery while standing still is a very slow process unless your characters have a high toughness value.-- Even with the fast forward button, Kenshi can still be fairly slow. The start of Kenshi will probably be a slow one unless you get lucky. Don't worry about creating a settlement early on as it isn't really important. I took about 100 game days to start establishing my settlement after I got enough money and was satisfied with my crew members' skill level.-- The training dummies provided at towns can only train melee strength until level 4. Don't bother leaving your characters to train after that because you'll be wasting your time.-- Make use of the melee defence button for weak characters. You can train their melee defence easily this way while buying time for your attacking characters.-- Loot high value items from bandits only (weapons, headgear, shoes, and armour). Keep an eye out for sand ninjas because their armour is nice and light, and so is their weapons. Take note that their stats are quite high though.			"

								Kenshi is a unique game that is finding its niche in a mix between an RTS, Sandbox-Builder and Survival game with possible future elements of an RPG. While it's still in Alpha it is a very well polished game that offers hours of play and even more replay-ability. It's definitely not a game for the easily frustrated because you'll find yourself starting as probably the weakest character in its yet-to-be-defined universe. Combat reflects a very realistic feel at the start: You're weak and everyone can and just about will kill you. It's a game of judging whether or not combat is really worth the possible outcome. Groups of 2-3 bandits will destroy you at the start so luring them back to larger groups is pretty much you're only option while you slowly build up the skills of your character. Having a large party will improve your odds but if they're still untrained it would be like sending a bunch of children to fight an adult. Yeah, they may overpower the adult but more than likely they'll all get beaten. There's already several ways to make money and the economy in the game is being tweaked. This just means you don't always have to fight bandits and other patrols to get the capital necessary to start your own outpost. Then when you have that the game definitely delivers several different ways of improving your little town and building your own army. I recommend trying this game out. There's a demo version of it available somewhere, in case you're the type worried about purchasing and not liking games still in development.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been playing this game almost from the time it was GreenLit.  It is an amazing mix of RPG, RTS, City Management. Even without all the planned features implemented yet. It is still worth playing. When this game is complete, it will be one of the most awsome games to date. The developement is a little slow, but considering the size of the dev team and that they probably do most of the coding during their free time, it is understandable.  There are bugs, but you can expect that from a game in developement. The dev team is quick to address most issues or bugs as they appear.  In the end I can't stress enough, that this game is one that will provide hours and hours of game play and provide the player with the most choices in how to play. Be a lone wanderer just making his way by his sword. Lead a group of mercenaries to fame and riches. Become the most notorious bandit in the known lands, Found a city and produce goods for trade. I give this game a 9 out of 10 for being original and well developed. I hope after this project is done, the dev team continues to produce more amazing titles.Update:For those that like the pros and cons listed.Pros:1. Freedom - Explore, develope, wander, or waste your time as you please.2. Character Developement - You gain skill when you use it. Not if you have exp to spend on it.3. Aspect View - You can watch over from above or get into an almost 3rd person view of your party.4. Sandbox - No pun intended. You can build a base, or even a city.5. Swords - Lots of swords to fit your fighting styles.6. Random - Bandit and Canibal raids. If you have a city or base, Bandits and Canibals will find you.7. Unique - RTS meets RPG with City Management and Crafting.Cons:1. Pathing - Sometimes you have moving problems of your own, NPCs can get stuck for days on a rock.2. Trading - Trading is a little hard because of the pathing issues. NPCs will get stuck trying to get to you.3. Goals - With no ultimate goal, you can get to a point where you have to say, what do I do next. If there were a rival system. Or just a set of acheivements to get, it would add much more flavor IMO.4. Ranged Combat - I have seen in the blogs that this is comming, but until it does, there is a chunk missing from the combat tactics.5. Better AI - It always seems to be that there will be that one poorly armed bandit that is willing to battle it out with your band of 20 no matter what. Or the Bandits will chase one guy into a city and be swarmed with high level guards.6. Battle Animations - There are only a limited amount of fighting animations. Hack, slash, block, can get old after a while. No evaision or anything like that. In the end, I am hoping for a bit of polish to make this game great.  The next Update is supposed to be out soon and I can't wait.  Even with all the little frustrations and bugs.  I have had many hours of fun with this game and it has already been more than worth the $20 I paid for it.			"

								Purchased this game back in April of 2013, played it for around 8-10 hours, then put it on the back burner. Came back a little over a week ago, and have since put 50 hours in. This game has improved so much its crazy, I love it too much.Start with the drawbacks-- Pretty buggy, but there is usually a work around that is a little inconveniant but fixes the issue for a while. - Pathfinding is hilariously bad- pretty hard if you dont know what your doing- no real intro to the game or what to doHere are the reasons i stick around - + Completely open ended, this is a hugeeeeee turn on for me (Could be a negative if you need set goals, as there are none)+ Love the building crafting system+You are free to have a squad of just you, or a squad of loads of people (more than 10 needs some mod help (but you can have 30 in vanilla, just split in 3 squads))+ Learned curve is satisfying, not too steep, but its there. + Loads to explore, and a ever present sense of danger+ Getting a charactor OP in stealth is pretty fun/funnyStuff Im not really into / Dont know much about - | I dont do combat much, i am mostly just a trader with a walled off town, i fight pests, not people| Cant say much about the experiance with other races, as i play soley human, because i like the protection of the holy nationTo be honest, the bugs in this game drive me up the wall, and make me clench my fists in rage sometimes. They can get frustrating, and the lack of fps is annoy af, but i keep coming back, every time i rage quit due to a bug, or a bad battle, i always come back, i have had dreams about this game for chistsakes. This is the game *I* have always wanted, it may skew my judgement, but i would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.			"

								If you ever want a game to succeed, you must keep your players invested. If there's anything I can say about Kenshi is that it has definitely gotten me invested in bettering my character through hours of training. The first time my bad ♥♥♥ level 50 Attack and Defense character took down an entire cannibal camp, I felt like I had truly accomplished a feat (considering how much trouble I had with them in the beginning). Watching him cleave unhindered through their bare, tattoo-ridden bodies made me so happy, albeit a bit doubtful about my sanity at the time. I can safely say that Kenshi has finally fulfilled my desire for a squad-based game in which individual progression and background really means something to me.Now, I just want to address something that many of the backers of Kenshi have been pondering recently. Lately, Lo-Fi's been making some good progress, having implemented DX11 into the game (though it is very unstable), and added a new race and such, which is all great! But, simply said, it's still been very slow. However, I don't believe, like many people do, that this game is going too slow. In my opinion, and I feel as if people have forgotten this what with triple A games and the likes such as Star Citizen, indie developers should be slightly exempt from the time-frame criticism. I think this is especially true for a game like Kenshi, which hasn't even received that much funding. These guys need to make a living, and nagging them everyday isn't going to fix that. I guess you could say that I don't want people who are pursuing their dreams to be discouraged for going too slow.Keep it up, Lo-Fi. I still have high hopes for this game!			"

								Awesome 'early access game'. It's undergone drastic improvements in a relatively decent amount of time, the developer is growing and actually continually working on the game (!!), also the dev listens to, supports and works FOR THE GAMERS. Incredibly mod-friendly, great setting, really interesting combat system/dynamics, and it's just getting better and better.Gameplay is third-person, squad-based survival/base-building with the ability to personalize characters (including a main, beginning character).

Early Access Review
								Kenshi.Purchased 16th Dec 2014.Playing as  Hive drone, one of 4 playable and original races (minus the obvious humans who have various subraces) whom I named Peaceful Kubo, I started in a Holy Nation farm, mining iron for Cats (the currency of the realm) I scratch a meager living from the rocks, I purchase greenfruits, grown on the farm I now reside on, I endure the soldiers racism as they march past on daily manouvers. I stare off to the north, alone, as the sun rises. I rush into the bar and sell off the last scraps of iron ore, buy food an animal companion and outfit it with baggage. I fill the bags with food and meds. And set off into the unknown abyss that is the desert sands. A scuffle between holy Nation paladins and some bone dogs breaks out, I swoop in, take some furs and a kit of Paladins armour and his blade - he wont be needing them - I now have a bounty of 2500 Cats on my head. As I travel northward to my freedom.Kenshi Includes -Good stuff-Base building, entire villages can be brough up by yoru hand and hard workSquad building and recruitmentInteresting lore and an original world filled with interesting and unique species.A medical system consisting of injuring different parts of the body and having different detrimental effects.An utterly huge open world - But not too big so to as get dull and boreing.Multiuple factions. A dozen or so skills.Research for better, more upgraded items and building to help with your skills and your,Modding community is already bloomingBad/ not good points -Though the game does suffer slow down and the occassional crash (To cut a long list short my PC is far above the recomended specs)The game does take a few seconds to ""warm up"" and load in textures, models etc - its a big game.The game - if your unprepared for a ruthless world, is utterly brutal, this may be very off puttingThe game is without a doubt poorly optimized - BUT it has improved drastically since I firts purchased it.Yes I have pathetic playtime, owing mainly to my older ♥♥♥♥ poor build of a pc when i purchased the game, Now with a more powerful beast and several patches of content and optimisation the game flows - there is some slow down in certain situations (which for a game this size is no bother at all.)

								How to describe, hmm... Be a druglord, by making your own drugs, then selling it (duh), make your clan grow with some authentic human trafficking, just put them in a cage and add some brainwash. Or, be a bootlegger, a thief, a bountyhunter and a murderer. Start your own settlement and create an army or looting ninjas. And if you are offended by all of that   then no worries! You can still buy the game because you can be a honest Holyfarmer! Baking bread and selling veggies, help out hobos by giving them a chance of a better life. Love and devotion, brother. Also note that the game is pretty racist, Holynation doesn't like female and tinted charactes, but who does, right? (Disclaimer: calm your horses, its a joke). You thought Madmax and Fallout was a themebased wasteland game? Meet Kenshi.In short, explore, build a town, make money, research, explore, vape and explore some more.			"

								I played the game thinking it wouldn't be that great and I was 19 minutes into it thinking ""I'm not sure about this game"" but then I kept playing. 30 minutes went by ""I might refund this"" 2 hours go by ""how the hell did I get in trouble I didn't do anything... oh its because I'm a hive character."" 6 hours into the game ""Oh my god I love this game!"" its  a great game that can be a bit addictive and I NEVER say that about RTS games. the only problem is that its not complete yet BUT they are doing updates so that's great to hear. there is a map limitation that you can't go past from just 1/4th of the world map. can't wait when they get all the updates done and unlock the full map to go exploring and adventuring.

								This game is just simply amazing !!! even at this super early stage in alpha it is a great game alone but with all these new updates with new settings weapons, factions, and animals its going to be amazing also i am one to research a game lots before i buy it and the Kenshi developement team has made great strides in developement and i salute them for thatthis game is a realistic rpg squad based free roam where you are not the almighty hero you have to actually train and work at your characters stats for them to fight others well.and if you want a fight you can usually find one by either going to a certain area or creating your own base(which are super in depth awesome and can be customized pretty much however you want)once you create a base bandits will attack you and sometimes try to broker with you and will offer a deal you either pay them or they attack.this game is just awesome every pet peave you have about other games before is fixed in this game pretty much and also one of the greatest things you can do is to leave your people on permanent jobs so you can go to sleep for 24 hours and they couldve made like 100000 loaves of bread and created the entire fort you layed out for them to buildalso there are some bugs but most can be solved by simple reloading or restarting the game.i would give this game 99.99 out of 100 stars just simply for the minimal bugs in the game			"

								There is so much to be said about Kenshi... I will try my best to structure and condense it in a way easy to go through.First and foremost, Kenshi already is everything it promises to be in the descriptions, no exaggeration. A very important thing to state for an early access indie still in development, in my oppinion.Even in its yet unfinished state, the game world feels real. One might be concerned that a game that tries to be too many things at once might feel disconnected, stitched together and some portions of the gameplay might feel out of place. Kenshi however manages to turn city/base building, classical RPG and open-world exploration in one complex experience, with a reasonable amount of atmosphere on top.Going through this experience is strangely captivating, with a dose of small but noticeable wonder. The first time I realized how weak I was on my own, the first time I realized I can use my other party members to distract guards and shopkeepers so that I can thieve safely while wandering around a shop. The point at which after a lot of building and researching my outpost finally started looking like a small village, my first attempt at raiding an ancient lab that ended with half of my 10-people away team slowly carrying the other half to the nearest village, but with everyone alive and with spoils to show for it...On to the less important things, the game's graphics are good enough considering they are not the focus, but do look a little dated. Soundtrack is good but a bit repetitive.It is stable, in my 40 hours of playing it crashed once, and that was after intense and prolonged Alt+Tabbing to and from it so that is fine in my book.Overall, the game is a great pick for any classical RPG and/or Sandbox fan.

								Kenshi, this game has never failed to disappoint.  I've been with it since the greenlight, before there was even audio in the game.  I think that is probably the main point.  This game has been in development for awhile now but Lofigames has not done what other developers have done and simply abandoned the game.  Yes the progress has been extremely slow (small updates) but there have been constant updates.  Each time I come back to the game, yes I do stop once I've explored all the features, there is always something new to explore.  But the point is, it has never stalled out, there are always updates.  Lofigames has always continued on with development.  I'm not going to sit here and tell you about the features of the game.  Figure it out for yourself, just know that it will definitely be worth your time.			"

								This game started out as a glitchy piece of crap with an extremely interesting gameplay. The only thing that kept me playing back then were the 15 minutes of fun in between crashes. Most of that fun consisted of getting beat up by bandits over and over and having to keep my characters in bed to heal.Although, after a while, I got a nice settlement set up. The money I spent back then was well worth what the game has grown into now.The developer has been delivering on all his promises and more. All of the infuriating glitches are mostly gone and the amount of content that was added is simply great.

								For anyone who likes RPGs and RTS', this is the perfect combo. I absolutly love this game.It gives alot of freedom, and the progress is good, not too fast, not too slow. Everything is learning by doing. No levels. And if you want to, you can equib a newly recruited peasant with the biggest swords and armor. Although it might not be the best choise, it does give you somewhat of an advantage. When you do get to the point of where you have a secure foothold and a few soldiers, you reap the rewards of your labour. You see and guide your small society of people to advance and trade. And once in a while a few roaming bandits will come by, to keep your guards entertained and help with their training. OR you can just go around being the hermit samurai and doing your best to defeat the bandits you meet, although this will mean death, if you dont have an extremly strong soldier first. And such training can be gained by follwing the traders around, as a bodyguard. This game is a game i have been waiting for, for a long time. Its open ended. And its a perfect RPG sandbox. And its not even done yet. I recommend you to get this game, while its cheap! Its worth it already now. However, if you want a game where you can dive directly into high action, this is not the game for you. This game rewards patience and tactical gameplay.			"

Early Access Review
								Before I begin, I won't sit around and pretend like Kenshi is a perfect game. You are looking at an Early Access title. Maps will get wiped. A town you spent hours building in that perfect spot between two mountains will be gone when the next chunk of the map releases. The game is constantly being changed, and will continue to be in that state for a long time. The graphics are somewhat dated, an artifact of when the game first came out. Collisions can be very buggy, and you will probably have to deal with picking up your squadmate that won't stop blocking the stairs. The autopathing will do what you want it to do half the time if the distance is further than 50 meters. At least once, the captured dude that you put down will rocket into the sky and fall like a meteor because you approached him from the wrong side. That being said, I'll go into what Kenshi is, and why I recommend it:As the description will tell you, Kenshi is an open world, squad-based RPG that takes place in a post-apocalypse style region (I say ""style"" because of some disputes about this canonically). ""Open world"" needs to be emphasized hugely. There is no overarching task to the game other than survival. Any goals you have in Kenshi are self-set. However, certain items can incentivize you to explore the world; a map from an old library that shows you the far-away location of an ancient armory, or a bounty for a bandit king, or a rumor from a crazy, inebriated man that turns out to be nothing. The absence of any concrete goal isn't new to the sandbox-survival genre, but it's fairly unique in Kenshi, where there isn't any multiplayer. I initially thought this would result in the telltale problem surrounding nearly all games in this genre, but I learned later that two main elements of the game ensure you don't exhaust it:1. The map of Kenshi is absolutely massive. Only half of it is available at the moment (as the developers are constantly working on new sections), but in my experience, going from the south end of the continent to the north took an actual, real hour without utilizing the speed features (Sims-style buttons that accelerate time). In my 31 or so hours of the game, between two squads, I have only explored a good quarter of the available half-map. The land is varied and unique as well. Swamps filled with wandering assassins and blood spiders, a crater brimming with robot spiders and horrible giraffe-like monsters that run as fast as a car, or river valleys dotted with small farms belonging to a theocratic empire. The developers have clearly spent their time cultivating each biome/area to make it feel alive, complete with ruins of an old space war, alien-like flora and fauna, and a soundtrack that mixes pad-based wasteland ambient noise with a strange asian tone to create an otherworldly tone.2. Kenshi is a difficult, unforgiving game. I am aware most people see that warning and roll their eyes, as every undercooked developement team tries to desperately convince the consumer-base that their game is ""the next Dark Souls"", a marketing tactic that needs doing away with. But Kenshi is truly the embodiment of unforgiving. If I can give one piece of credit to the trailer, it is for having the phrase ""the world doesn't care about you"". Nearly everything in Kenshi will try to kill you. I distinctly remember within my first five minutes of the game, my efforts to attack a group of hungry bandits resulted in my character being beaten nearly to death and stripped of his shoddy weapon. Everything in Kenshi starts out stronger than you. Becoming stronger in this game is a matter of how much you are willing to risk. You will not become better with a weapon by targeting weaker enemies. You constantly have to aim above where you are, and that risk can result in being imprisoned by slavers, or captured by guards, or kidnapped and eaten alive by fog-men. Even if you fail (assuming you live), some good comes from the encounter; you gain toughness, and will be harder to fall in the coming fights, as long as you tend to your wounds. This mechanic is the central point of Kenshi; you will not become better unless you fight someone better than you. So you need to find or buy some friends, train them up with you, and make a name for yourself.---------But what I find to be the most unique part of Kenshi is how you can become attached to these characters, despite them not being attributed with a real personality (save a fair amount of unqiue hires). I would save a slave passed out from bloodloss, nurse him back to health, and equip him with clothes, hoping he would join my party. And when he was kidnapped by northern cannibals and locked in a ruin with 50+ men well above my strength, I would try and devise a plan with my other party members to get him out despite it being much easier and efficient to leave him to die. Nothing would be gained by saving him, but we still did it because he was part of our squad.That is where Kenshi shines, at least for me. It makes you care about these people that have never uttered anything more than trade dialogue. It makes you chase after that old man that was really awful at learning how to swing the fragment axe that was too big for him, after he was imprisoned in a tower of the Holy Nation. It makes you keep that dumb-looking basket on that short dude's head because you're certain he has to wear it because you decided he was the assassin when you first rescued him. It makes you give every shiny new nodachi to that girl with the best armor, because she was your first recuit and you just know she has to get the good loot.Kenshi doesn't pull its punches. It is dedicated to making you fail and wiping your squad. Your death will likely not be ceremonious: you're probably going to die to skin-spiders more than you are to an evil slaver army you tried to attack. When you get imprisoned and your Katana worth 100,000 Cats is stripped from you, I hope you're ready to spend 30 actual minutes checking each container in each guardhouse for it. If you really really want that Falling Sun manufactured by the Catun Scrapmasters, you better be ready to spend a whole in-game night picking that 0.6% chance to succeed lock with the shop guard sleeping nearby. If you've finally decided you're sick of your friends bleeding out and you want to get some Skeletons (robots) on your side, you better start shelling out thousands of Cats for repair kids, or else they're going down quick. You will think you're invincible after finally finding an Edgewalker Naginata, and you will probably get your ♥♥♥ handed to you by some bum with a rusty chopper that's done nothing but fight his whole life.You are never too high on the food chain to be invincible. Believe me, I know:I had raided all of the northern armories and found two Edgewalker weapons. I had a squad of 6 people: Dave, Kai, Soto, Hobbes, Kara, and Gynn. Through almost 20 hours of training, they had become true warriors. We had accumulated 120,000 Cats from our exploits, and were ready to finally settle down and establish a town for some money before we explored the next part of the map. Since the swamp was perfect for farming, we saw a little flat plane near the southeast on the map and decided to make our home there. We were off with nearly 30 building materials, a month's worth of food cubes, and some advanced health kits. When we finally got to the area, we noticed there were a fair amount of ruins, usually a sign of danger. And even despite this warning, we pressed on.And when we reached the plane, our long days of training, weapons worth their weight in gold, and samurai armor stolen from shops around the continent meant nothing. Against the blood spiders, swamp raptors, and acid rain, we were fallen within seconds and our unconscious bodies were eaten by the monsters. Weeks of training, great escapes, fireside meals, stealthy heists, and grueling battles - they were all undone in seconds.That is Kenshi.			"

								Addicted. While still a work in progress with an admittedly long development cycle, Kenshi offers dynamic factional interaction, a functioning economy, and a SPRAWLING world married to interesting lore. The sheer scope and freedom of self-driven narrative offer deep replayability, while the XP grind and research tree keep number junkies engaged.The depth can seem daunting as, right out of the gate, you're hit with a chargen system awash in variables. Stick with it. The core systems, be they crafting, research, farming, theft, or combat will shed their mystery in short order, leaving you free to create the game you wish, not the one a developer has decided you will undertake.Early on, embrace your failings. You'll die. You'll lose. You'll assail the heavens with ""WTF?"", but it's the best way for the realities of Kenshi's world to sink in. It's no JRPG and it can feel nearly cruel. That's just the fun you're feeling.Pros:+ nearly infinite replayability.+ engaging world-building with interesting and consistent lore+ the capacity to build BIG groups of henchmen / men at arms+ satisfying tech research / crafting / building+ the world is HUGE+ (in case you missed it) - the world is HUGE+ free-form gameplayCons:- early access (doesn't bother me, but some loathe EA titles)- infrequent world-breaks resulting from patches- graphical hiccups / oft-times bland imagery- upper tier hardware required for truly smooth play- a myriad of beta-level bugs and niggling issuesIt's hard to convey Kenshi's ability to capture the imagination. I haven't been this enamored of a title since the dawn of Space Engineers. Kudos and high fives all around both to the man responsible for this project from its birth, and the team he has recently surrounded himself with to complete it. Props.			"

								This is one of those rare games on steam that is pretty good, for me atleast, i have had a great time playing this game since i got it years ago.Tho its taking a long long long time to get anywhere its still happening and i understand that making games takes time.There have been changes to the game over the years, i liked the desert zone they had better then the new map but i am sure i will come to like it just as well after the map is properly done.The game delivers on its squad based gameplay, the combat is fun, the base building is pretty good, the crafting is nice.There is plenty to do in game right now making it worth buying the game right now.But if bugs and an unkown release time is a bother to you then i recommend you wait until after they are done making this epic game before you buy it, but if that is not a problem for you then i recommend this game 100%.

								This is a great make-your-own-adventure type of game. It's like Sim City meets Command & Conquer meets Fallout with a bit of Road Warrior or 7 Samurai mixed in. You start out by yourself and can eventually recruit an army to your cause. Build up your own village, town, or base, and raid other villages, help others, or trade! It's very addicting for an alpha build! I can't wait to see what else is in store for it!			"

								Kenshi is one of the best free-roaming RPG i've ever seen. I recommend it because even though it has many bugs, it's a very fun game. You can choose several ways to start the game, certain classes are more strategic and others are created for a direct style of play. Although it isn't without flaws as bugs and bandits that will follow you forever, this game will will keep you busy for at least a good 80 hours!			"

								If you're a fan of building your own towns that span the ENTIRE GAME WORLD, leading an entire army, hardcore gameplay where if you die you die (but game doesn't end! Carry on with your community and let your previous shell rot in the sands of time!), a free roam game, or hell just swords, katanas, straw hats and ninjas, then this game is for you. It's quite unrivaled in its free roam aspects (base building / attacking towns / trading etc) despite being in an early alpha stage. You can send out different squads of people to different parts of the map, start several towns, just click on a character to move your camera to them. It'll cause quite a micromanagement hassle, as everything keeps going (unless you pause it. It features pause / x2 / x3 / x4 speeds, but lacks a notification / alert system for when people are being attacked - at the moment.) I've been enjoying and will continue to enjoy this game, with future updates sweetening the deal.If you're a fan of ""real life simulators"" (hardcore elements, no artificial levelling, no hero characters, no scaling item & equipment quality, etc.) or titles like Mount and Blade, Sim City, The Sims, or any other simulator where you control the way a community grows, then this game is definitely for you. Oh, and there's bounty hunting. Kenshi also has a tinge of the post apocalypse feel, being set in the seemingly never-ending desert. (No fast travel! Buildings take a while to build! It's a good time killer :D)			"

								Kenshi is one of those games that once you start playing, it is very difficult to put down. I believe the 9.7 hours that I have on record is from one sitting. Unfortunately, the lack of content, performance issues, and bugs make it hard to come back. The one man development team is hard at work though, and continue to fix these issues and add more content. If you enjoy open world RPGs or city-builder RTS games, this may suit you very well. The desert landscape is fairly bland and I can't say I'm a huge fan of the asian theme, but they have mentioned adding new areas to explore. The map is fairly large and once you begin building your own city and army you won't want to stop. $20.00 is a bit steep at the moment, but I highly recommend Kenshi.			"

								To begin with, this is a game for the patient, tedious-loving, and hardcore gamers, that seek a fulfilling experience. If you played the pre-CU SWG, and loved it, then you should feel at home in this. It's slow paced, and requires a bit of thought, and I swear you could write a book based off of the experiences of your character. From being enslaved, escaping, and becoming a bad ♥♥♥ ninja, to slaughtering entire cities with your army of samurai. You could, instead, buy a house in one of the towns and live a peaceful life as a trader/farmer. Don't want to buy a house? Build one then, but why stop there? Build a whole damn fortified town, guarded by ninja with freak'n harpoon guns. Great early access game, maybe one of the best. The devs also appear to be fairly active, so I can't recommend it more.			"

								I'll admit that at first the game sucked real bad. I had no direction, no purpose, nothing. I was bored and felt like I made a bad purchase (around 5 hours into the game). I only had some basic armor and 1 follower who I named Grandpa.(The game has no storyline so spoilers ->?) I got brutally KO'd and tied up to a pole by the Dust King after I stumbled into his tower. That was when the game opened unfolded before me. I spent 2 days picklocking my way out and with no items weighing me down, I ran away but Grandpa had an injured leg. He didn't make it out. A few people joined my band. Some freely joined, others I paid to join. Now I have purpose. I'm building a town...my own faction. My goal now is to avenge Grandpa and capture the Dust King. Unfortunately, I've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off most of the other factions, but oh well.The game isn't easy at first and the optimization isn't great. It takes a while to understand. It's basically a do whatever you want type of game with no clear goals. All I know is that I can't...stop...playing...If you like resource management games such as RimWorld or Prison Architect, this might be fore you. There's just more depth to it than most others.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR pros and cons:+ Awesome game (unique style, interesting design, great gameplay etc.etc.)+ They did it to beta, yay!~ Seemless blend of RTS and a Town-builder on a solid RPG foundation.~ Tru sandbox (no story-quest-line, just sand, your toys and your imagination)~ Game is mod-able so you can add a sexy-armor, i guess... ~ Still being tested, so expect some instability and small bugs   - Some little bugs and glitches are still out thereNTL;WR (Not Too Long; Will Read):Synopsis: First of all, i have to say that the game's description and videos are quite accurate and trustworthy. Pay a close attention to the game's description, by the way. First goes ""free-roaming"" then ""squad-based"" and only then ""RPG"". While it is indeed an RPG, in the same time it's not. Not in the familiar today wiev that is.  You character(s) has a set of stats and set of skills that could be raised in particular ways. You can equip your character(s) with whatever gear is accessible out there, in any combination possible. You can tune out the phisical appearance of your character(s) in any given way. Basically, you can build your character(s) whatever you want in every possible meaning.  But that's where the ""RPG"" some may grew accustomed to ends.  In Kenshi nobody will give you a story and send you on the epic quest. Not even a minor quest. Not even to gather 5 rat skulls or deliver a love letter or wake up 11 guards. Every second NPC won't unwrap their soul to you in a complicated system of carefully thought-out dialogues with dozens of possible outcomes. You can't get married. You can't even woo anybody, if only figuratively.     What you can do, however, is to use your imagination, and with help of afeatures given in a first paragraph write your own story by action. Gameplay: Assisted by a dozen of starting conditions, set a foundation to your game. Start as guy with a dog, or try and lead the group of settlers to prosperity of their to-be-built town.  You do not have a direct control over your character(s), instead, it's a traditional RTS\MMO Point-n-click, so you select your character(s) and send them where needed, either to be or to fight, which is also done automatically, based on stats, skills and equipment of your character(s) and those of an enemy.  You may build your own outpost\town, with all the work-stations and various interior set by yourself. Build a shed and fill its inner space with whatever you want. If only it fits there and is available for construction. It's your choise whether that building will become a bar or a hospital. In most cases it's also up for you to decide what role which character will pick: assign them to a mining task, for instance, and their mining skill will progress, which affects the work efficiency. Various traders are available across the vast map, who'll either buy what you've produced, looted, or stole, or gladly sell something to you.  Stealth, stealing and lockpicking is available, and authorities do recognise crimes and in some circumstances - criminals.  Even in it's current state (ver 0.95-ish) map has a very large size and would require some dozen  hours to explore briefly, while only being roughly a 1/2 of a planned map.Conclusion \ impression: All in all, i'd call Kenshi a seemless blend of RTS and Town-Builder on a thick and strong RPG foundation, means, whatever you do - stats and equipment are always there and never neglected.That's said, gameplay is fantastically flawless and natural: Start a character, get some coin, keep wandering alone or hire more characters, build a base, research new tech, build industry, set  people to auto-work... oh, look, your guys didn't go anywhere, it's still they and their stats underneath that thick heavy layer of management and strategy. Quick, assign this guy to guard this girl, and tell her to do the same about him. Boom, Kenshi marriage just happened!    __________________________________________________First version of the review left here for the historical purpose:I want to ask you a few things. Do you remember Fallout? Nah, not that fancy F3 and F:NV, no, i'm talking about '97th Fallout. The world, completely destroyed by nuclear warheads, and then, intensively dried by merciless impartial Sun for over a century, become a harsh, empty desert... that was the world we lived in for a while. We did things, necessary for our cause, we met people, hardened by this hazardous environment, we saw rising nations, mindless bandits, we saw the life after... We were free to go wherever we wish and do whatever we want... Now, do you remember Mount-&-Blade? Where we could roam absolutely free, with no particular cause. We had a party of trustfull associates, we could've trade, fight alone, or swear an oath to a ruller, and fight by their standart. We had to think about provision for out group, so they won't starve and leave us...Before this point we had everything we could possibly want, except one thing...In Kenshi, besides all other things mentioned above, one of possibilities we have is actually settling our own village. Gather some coin, get some bricks and start to build your little paradise in a middle of nowhere. Build it in a trade route, open a tavern and watch caravans going by and leaving you some coin for your goodies. Build a large house and put some beds in, so roaming patrols could rest their feet and heal their wounds. Grow your own crops to make food. Grow your own hemp to make... err... fabric... Beware though, as not only peacefull force roaming the desert. Cruel bandits and mindless cannibals could show up in any hour. They will crave for your supplies, your money, or even your bodies and your life. Build walls, gates, and take deffence of what rightfully yours! Then gather some strenght, and send a squad of trained warriors back, to their den! Take their lives to bring peace across the land and earn respect of other factions. Travel, trade, fight and settle: ""The world is yours"". I can't forget to mention the party itself. Every buddy you hire is, in fact, a full character with same set of stats as your first created guy. So eventually, if you want to, you can go from a single hero to an army of individuals, and even if ""your"" character dies, it's not a ""Game Over"". Everyone are equall, and everyone counts as your character. Besides i'd like to say few things about a graphics. Maybe the textures are not perfect, maybe collisions are not always right, maybe animation is a bit dull sometimes... But, brick hit me, characters even has their FOOT FINGERS modelled! They don't even have this in Skyrim! Anyway, just buy it and help Lo-Fi Games finish this ambitious project and grind this diamond to the brilliant!			"

								Time to buyI’ve been following Kenshi since steam first started greenlight. At that time there was no sound in Kenshi, the world was bare bones, heck the whole game was obviously very bare bones. I really liked (and still do) the idea though. I like to play this game as sort of a city builder.Step 1 - make an outpostStep 2 - farmStep 3 - Profit. This is the first time in about 3-4 months that i've even started the game. I was waiting for more to be ready. I must have picked a good time because the game is now feeling very alive, and complete. I might as well say goodbye to the next 100+ hours of my life now.			"

								Let me start out by saying one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of owning and playing. I currently give it a 9/10, it will easily be 10/10 once they fix the crashing and the path finding and a few very minor bugs it will be one of the best games out there! I have logged 87 hours currently and I have played all of the starting options and let me tell you just because you start out as a group of 5 nobodies dosnt mean jack! This game is a true open world sandbox! I have played as a travling merchant who brought life saving medic packs to the local police, Iv been a smuggler who had to slip pass the same police to smuggle drugs. I played as a bounty hunter who got his butt handed to him many times and Iv been a bandit with horrible luck! Iv also been a slave and a slaver! and there is so much more to this game! You should give this game a chance even though it has a problem with crashing just be sure to save very often! My hope for this game is for it to become stable and to be moddable I get goose bumps just thinking about the greatmods that can come out of this! I will write a final review once its finished till then play this game and immerse your self in Kenshi!			"

								While the concept and mechanics are good, the execution is terrible. Little thought (or capability) was given by the developers for things like the pathing of the characters or the resources in memory.Characters are frequently unable to find their way to complete a task unless manually guided. The rendering of textures along the world is slow and buggy. NPCs and beasts are erratic at best.This game screams of Unity plugins and copy'n'pasted code. All-in-all, it's an amateur execution at best.			"

								I decided to go wih the freedom seekers for the idea of making a nation and conquering Kenshi. Day one My group and i travel about a 2 minute run from a town to begin building our haven (incase we get overran and have to book it). If you attempt this the first tech you should learn is makeshift walls. By the second day a little post at the top of the screen had said. Aldonia (name of my town) has been noticed by starving bandits. I only had one gate because i thought my walls would hold. Nope i was wrong. 20 bandits came like the Fire nation. They breached my gate. The Old solider and I ran to battle to defend our workers so they could get to safety. They saughtered us all and looted everything. This game is challenging yet appealing at the same time. If you like the sims, with apocalyptic feel and sword fighting. This is your game to try.			"

								This is one of the best games I've ever gotten my hands on. Honestly if development stopped now I would have gotten my money's worth ethier way as some bad reviews have mentioned.10+ different factions being worked on at the top of my head with one being slavers that capture you and imprison you as you hope your other squad members can rescue you by defeating the harpoon turrets guarding the prison along with different types of bandits ranging from highly trained sand ninjas to hungry bandits dressed in rags and weilding wooden sticks but in massive numbers.If your to worried to make a base that can be raided Abundantly by bandits then settle with a house in a fortified city as you make some basic armor.The possibilities are endless.

								Do you enjoy free roaming and getting owned at the beginning all the time? Then this is the game for you!On a more serious note:This game is slow paced, you will start out with almost nothing (Depending on which start you choose) and you WILL get rekt all the time at the beginning. But once your squad has grown in number and power the fun starts kicking in. Slaughtering silly bandits that used to slaughter you!Sadly I haven't been attracted to the building alot, it's still a little buggy in my opinion to enjoy the building part of this game. Also the View Distance is attached to your Camera, not to your characters so it's a hard time to spot enemies sometimes.All in all, this is still Early Access and I can see this game having a big potential.

								Avoid, only in the past few years has this game even started to gather any form of pace , let alone any kind of play. Despite the hundreds of hrs put into this and 5 years of waiting this game is still unplayable. Countless times have i unstalled this game because of it bugg ridden and constantly crashes. Verifying cache, rebuilding the nav mesh, broken pathfinding- still,and endless bug reports filed .Yes the game has an approach and style that come as very appealing to the sandbox/ sim / stratergy. But the implementation of these ideas are ham fisted and generally break the game. Resulting in a gameplay although i paid for 5 years ago, i have never been able to play this game to any sort of conclusion , even if it was a narrative or a play style that i wanted. It will list on the store that its a game for all sorts, And in theory it is- but only if ALL of these options work, which for most part they dont.  Want to be a trader- path finding is iffy- so is trading most of the time. Want to be a fighter- the a.i for your squad and group control is basic at best , no formations , its a drag box -gather all affair point and attack. Its rather warband mount and blade sorta thing only with slight dumber a.i /npcs.Which is a reall shame considering once you have a base set up and start crafting your going to win- full stop. The a.i in the game wont counter u in anyway. This is daft considering this game has factions, but for what ever reason other than some npc running after u to kill / or steal theres no real war going to happen. Its u gathering your troops and attacking what ever u see fit- the game wont counter or gather other factions to help. It wont come kick your ♥♥♥ if your getting to big. In all honesty buy warband  if your after a large warfare siege building  faction game. This is quirky and it has it moments , but waiting 5 years for this to come half way playable at best was a step to far for me. Early access has a bad name for good reason, companys came along , promised much and then sat on our money while we got broken codes, false promises, delay after delays in ""well fix that patches"" this imo was one of those companys.Now the fan boi's on steam will tell u the company lay golden eggs and there ideas for the game out way any gripes u have . Which is total b.s, if u sell something , even if its early access theremust be some form of timeline, steam must address this, because the dev of this game is like""o0 i have another idea"" so u have to wait while he codes his idea and then breaks the game again. All along while waited for his first 10 ideas to be fixed. This has been my first 5 years with the makers of this game.  You've been warned.This is the 3rd review- 5 years on			"

Early Access Review
								As of January 2017, the play experience Kenshi has offered has declined for several years in ways not attributable to the normal churn of development, to evolving code and ideas, or to the good and bad experiments we hope to see during development. So, I think it is fair to consider it one the very, very few early-access titles that can and should be ""reviewed"". But, it is an early access title and a normal ""review"" would be pointless and unfair. Instead I'll summarize why I recommend to hold off deciding to buy or not to buy for now.In a nutshell, what began as a great little gem with a focused and tight presentation and play experience, lacking only in polish and game-mechanic features, has become a bloated, unfocused fever-dream of bad user interaction, inscrutable play, poor reliability, and abysmal rendering performance. The only area that has improved is the length of the checklist of features implemented. But even those feel scattered, random, and not truly essential to furthering the core of play. Kenshi used to seem it was destined to be a master of one thing, now it is an amateur of many.Given that long and steady trajectory, so opposite in direction to its early course, I would recommend holding off on a purchase decision until LoFi releases this and it exits Early Access. Put it in your follow list, keep an eye on it, see how the critics and lets-players you respect get on in their games and hope, as I do, LoFi will prove me utterly wrong with their 1.0, because the early promise and execution were wonderful once and so there is still reason to hope.

								I've been playing for a long while now and only recently transferred my account from desura to steam, reason for my almost non-existent gameplay time...it's all about preference. All I can say is that this game is unique in its own way and a lot of reviews had gone into details which I would rather not repeat. The developer and maker of kenshi had before worked as a security guard before to make a living while designing this game until recently he got enough money from sales to form a small team. We had waited years for long intervals between updates but he had never disappointed us before. It is his persistence to complete this game, come what may attitude, is the selling point to me. I see it having a lot of potential and modable qualities, his preseverance and persistence at work is the deciding factor. Believe me, it will take some time to get a complete game but it will arrive and you will not be disappointed. It's just quality work by a single master-craftsman with a few helping hands to produce this gem, so you can't expect work to go fast to your liking....he wants it to be the best so for me, take all the time you need, just don't take too long....I hope. ^_^			"

								Dang...  I helped to greenlight this game. It was actually the first one I ever voted yes for.  And I've followed it since then, waiting for it to become complete enough for me to want to give it a try. And so I tried it today. And I'm a bit saddened by my disappointment. It reminds me of the old Neverwinter Nights mods that were just vast tracts of open space with occasional randomly spawned monsters. Those weren't games. Those were templates for games. I could open up the NWN toolset and hammer out something like that in 45 minutes. People often did do that.So Kenshii looks like it's just a template for a game. And, given that it's in the .9x version series now, It appears to me that the vision for it may not shift very much. Oh well. :(			"

								Wow! Really got a surprise with this game.For a beta nearing release with plenty still to be fleshed out, I give this 10 out of ten and, for once, I don't even vaguely regret the cash I spent. Fantastic game. (See Budkai's video on YouTube for a slightly dated but excellent preview.)Kenshi is easiest described as half squad combat, half sandbox builder.It's not at release yet but very very playable. The graphics and its engine are not spectacular but the gameplay is enthralling.There are bugs and glitches as well as computer load and game balance issues but these are few and far between and don't stop the game being playable at all.I definitely recommend this one!

								Epic, fun, impressive, and ready to play now.If you like free-roaming sandbox games with no level scaling and tons of base building options and exploration then this game is a must buy. There are no other games remotely like it that i'm aware of.I won't go into all the features but this game is rich and ready to play.  There are some large updates coming up so you can either resume playing or import everything into the new version depending if the update requires a new game.  Very impressed with being able to do the latter.Some other random good stuff:- The world seems plausible instead of a theme park like other games.- The dialogue is pretty good and funny.- You can fully automate your workers in your base(s) while you devote full-time to your exploration squad.- It's very challenging at first, it's fun getting past that hump and becoming strong.- Location damage is really cool, for instance if someone takes a hard blow to the stomach then they will be pressing on it with one of their hands until it's healed.- Combat is fun to watch as it's physics based animations.  If a blow is landed then you'll actually see the animation connect.- If you see something in a store inventory, then it's also stored somewhere in the shop physically that you can steal.Things I'd like to see:- Multi-threading and performance (coming very soon I believe)- Further help screens explaining some more of the game mechanics (how armor stacking works, damage reduction, etc.)- Audio improvements, especially combat- More of the map available- Notifications, for instance when one of your crafters's queue is empty and is idle.- Able to add notes to the world map- Underground structures to explore.  Like dungeons.- Traveling trader caravans.			"

								Spawns in with a dog in a weird spot with a bunch of farmers. Get a feel for the game, do some training.Templars later show up and beat up some evil dogs. I look about and realize there isn't really anything interesting to do in the area.So, I head off. I end up in a town of the one really religious group. I decide to steal some food since I'm starving. Decide to try out the selling back mechanic,get caught for selling uncooked meat to the bartender. Proceed to get demolished by the city guards. Drop the game for two days. come back in and try to escape. Escapes five times before being taken to a different cage in another part of the town.The town gets attacked by ninjas. I take that as my opportunity to run. Realize I have no gear at all at this point.Steal from a dead guard.I am now disguised as a guard. I am not known as an escapee anymore. Leave the town with a big grin on my face.			"

								I'm changing my review from a negative one to a positive one. There's just too much potential and fun in this game to hate on it. It has camera control issues, lag, and sometimes incredibly frustrating pathing issues, but I found that cranking down the graphics settings helped with some of those problems. With a great mod that increased the population limit and squad size, I've been having a lot of fun establishing bases and sending out parties to explore. If this game ever reaches completion (the full map accessible, some of the mechanics fixed - i.e. kidnapping/stealth kill which doesn't seem to work) this game will be incredible. In my opinion it's a better Fallout than Fallout - if you don't mind some beta flaws.Holy ♥♥♥♥ the pathing issues tho - those seriously need to be fixed.			"

								Early 2013 review: Get it, you wont regret it. Takes around 2-3 hours to really get a feel for the game. After that, it is all gravy. At the moment, there is no audio, but don't let that hold you back. Just thow on some good jams and start forging your name in this great title.Early 2017 review: It's been nearly 4 years to the date since I first review this. Kenshi has came a long way since the early days, mainly the audio. I do miss the desolation of the old map (all desert) compared to the new biome system, though I agree it's ""needed."" Kenshi has easily stolen a spot on my list of top 5 games since I've been gaming on the Sega Gen. It has a long way to go, but what's currently here is more than enough for me to be satisfied.			"

								Wow! Really got a surprise with this game.For a beta nearing release with plenty still to be fleshed out, I give this 10 out of ten and, for once, I don't even vaguely regret the cash I spent. Fantastic game. (See Budkai's video on YouTube for a slightly dated but excellent preview.)Kenshi is easiest described as half squad combat, half sandbox builder.It's not at release yet but very very playable. The graphics and its engine are not spectacular but the gameplay is enthralling.There are bugs and glitches as well as computer load and game balance issues but these are few and far between and don't stop the game being playable at all.I definitely recommend this one!

								An interesting, innovative game created by one guy. In it's early Alpha stages it's completely playable, but with minor bugs and some major crashes. If you're a fan of Mount and Blade's open world, KOTOR's combat, and Elder Scrolls's skill system then you'll have a blast with this game. Along with the similarities to the title I previously listed, Kenshi also has a fully creatable town system where you can craft buildings, create your own town, sell your wares to NPC travelers and merchants, and get raided by bandits. It's a unique experience and a fun, slow-paced game where every squad member counts, and every swing of the enemies sword could mean death to your party.			"

								Oh my god this game. An alpha that i've consume so much hours and it's still the case to transform into weeks. The first time i saw those image and thoses tags i was like... what the hell... I MUST TRY THIS!!! and oooh boy i don't regret my choice. Kenshi is a squad based rpg where you're basicly a rat in a giant world. Depends on witch start you choose, the journey beggane with you, mostly with a pants a rusty sword, and you strove the desert to make your legend. In this game, your an ant at the very begganing. imagine that you, normal guy/guurl of all day decide to take a sword and start off you're companie. As you fight and fight, you'll learn what a true fight is. you can literraly see your character getting better at fighting. faster, wiser, deadliyer. Recruits other squad members, engineers, medics, fighter, then train and equip them : cloth, plate, mail, depends on your play style. like all plating knights style? alright. you love it fast and ninja style? alright! take what suit your play style. The fight system is an awesomly done speacking of dynamics and there is a limbs system that we can think of the fallout 3 limb system. If the Hp of a limb go to 0, either he or she won't be able to use that limb and if its a vital limb (head chest stomach) then they'll be K.O and need some medical attention. If the HP bar of thoses vital limb go to a certain negative treshold, those wounds are deadly. That's how you know that one of you mate have died in combat. This realistic mechanics also request of you to take care of your mate and leave them time to heal up, before going out and start murdering again. Go out in this majestic and awesomely well done desert. i'm totally serious here : i've passed several minutes just watching the dune, mountains and the horizon. ALOT of work as been put into the enviroment, and you feel it as soon as you have that sand in your sandals. Also, the map is ENORMOUS. Sometimes i was even saying to myself : jeez... i have to walk all that? but the reasons i'Ve just said make that you want that walking experience in this wounderful desert. Make a gigantic and prosperous town or a secret Samurai HQ, trades, fight, you really are the master of your own destiny. no missions or objective, simply survive and make a good and badass living. it's a sandbox where you do what you want and of course what you can to survive. Start off as a battleground looter to a blademaster to a rich caravan traders, to a formidable bandit or cannibal hunter, Be a bounty hunter and capture bad guys for ransom, or be the inquisitionning justicar and bring their judgment. the choice is yours. your blade awaits and the sand is thisty for blood. Get that game and start your legend!!!P;S : sorry for the tones of grammar errors.Have a great day wandering the dunes!			"

								This game has a ton of potential.  And I don't just say that based on the projected features, I base that on how it feels.  As I play it, I get the feeling that as development continues the game world will become a complex and interestng place, and the different facets of the gameplay will compliment it.  It is ambitious, with base building, diplomacy, squad-based tactics, and rpg elements.  If all those come together, it will be an extremely unique game.The development is continuing steadily, it is not a project that is abandoned.  When I read about all the planned features I almost worry that the developer has bitten off more than he can chew, but the progress that has already been made proves otherwise.As it is early access, there is not a large amount of things to do within the game world yet.  However, a significant map expansion and diplomacy/faction system are a couple of the updates coming down the pipe, and if they are as advertised this game would be justified in shedding the ""alpha"" tag once they are released.A couple of the game mechanics are clunky, it can take 5+ minutes to sell all the items in my squad's inventory due to having to run around to different merchants in the towns.  However, the game attempts to be realistic in many respects and this is one that reflects real life, a merchant likely wouldn't be able to take a dozen sets of armor off someone's hands in real life.  Although I complain about the selling system, I can see that it was purposefully done to make the game seem realistic; it is not just something that was poorly implemented or was not though through well enough.As it is alpha, my characters do get stuck in walls occasionally, it is NOT a common occurrance however.  It is easily fixable too, just save the game and reload with a ""reset squat position"" option.  This is another example of the thought put into it by the developer; he recognizes that its deveopment status could cause bugs, but implemented a system to allow people to enjoy their experience despite it.  And the bugs really are few and far between for me.I really think this game is going to be something special.  Aside from the planned features, it just has the feel of something that will be a great experience.			"

								One of the best rpg/rts games ive ever played, and its only in early access. I bought this game ages ago after seeing the first part of a lets play thinking it looked amazing, Altho it looked really complicated and it seemed that it would take a long time to figure out how things worked and played so i put it off for almost a year. Finally a week ago i decided to pick it up. One week later and i have 57 hours clocked in this game. Do yourself a favor and get this game. It may seem a bit daunting at first but its worth the first 30 minutes to an hour floundering about, because once you figure out how everything works it becomes an amazing experience. I only wish the entire game was out so i could enjoy the full vision of the devs, patience was never my strong suite tho, and right now it shouldnt be yours either, so stop being patient and buy the game!

Early Access Review
Kenshi - A RPG mixed with some tactics and base-buildingDid you ever want to play a RPG where your character was not the chosen one until you achieved the skill to be him? Did you ever want to play a game where you can play with a single or multiple characters with pros and cons for each style? And most of all: Did you want a game with an open world where you can build your own outpost which can produce materials, weapons a.s.o.? If you don't mind some bugs and pathfinding problems (only sometimes) then even the alpha is good for you.You begin with a character for whom you first choose the background. There are a few backgrounds you can choose from and each changes the difficulty (i.e. you get a better weapon or none at all, have a squad or are a loner...). So you begin on a big map (which shall get bigger as the development continues) and don't have a real goal. Except to survive. Bandits may find you very fast and the first thing you REALLY want to do is run away. You need experience. The levelling system is like in Oblivion: You get better as you do it. So now you should get to the next city or a patrol. Bandits are Bandits and you don't have the experience to fight them. Like I said: You are NOT a hero. As you venture to the towns you may find better equipment and buy it from money you got for selling looted stuff from dead bandits or ninjas. Maybe you even find better thins on them, but that does not happen very often. To get the best equipment you need to produce them on your own. As soon as you have got money and found a safe place (not too far from a city would be best) you can begin to build a research bench and begin building an outpost. It takes a lot of time. Many hours (real time, not the ingame time) until you researched everything. You also need to buy some blueprints for better weapons and armors. Now that you have even better equipment you can do more in a fight and if you already have more experience, you can take on at least 1 or 2 enemies at once. Since I only played to this point, I cannot go further with the gameplay. Oh, did I mention you can lose limbs? And need to bandage your wounds? There are no health potions and it takes a lot of time to recover. Conclusion:Pro:- Huge map- Learning by doing- Build your own outpost/city- Research- Limbs can be severed- Different weapons with different playstyle- Research better weapons- Not as easy as most of the games nowadaysCons (at the moment):- Still alpha (includes bugs and similar problems)- No animals- Mines can be build anywhere- World seems very empty- Cities are small- Even if more guys around sometimes 1on1Neutral:- No AAA-gaphics, but still not so bad- Animations			"

Early Access Review
								I am not recommending this game in it's current state, but I am giving it a thumbs up because of its amazing potential. I mean, seriously, if it gets through EA without the devs abandoning it as so many do, gets the updates it needs and is released in a finished, polished state, then this could be an absolutely amazing open world RPG. It has all the elements of the,perfect game; base building, farming, recruiting town/party member then upgrading them, crafting, research, factions, a huge open world, there are many more elements but I didn't intend for this review to be a long one until I put more time into the game .The reasons that I am not recommending this game in its current state are simple.The terrible, seriously flawed control system.The ridiculously bad camera,The awful performance. I have, literally, a top of the range PC, and the FPS still drops to a level where I want to throw my base unit across the room this is ridiculous for a game in late 2016.I appreciate that it is in EA, and the regular updates make me hopeful that the game will get finished. In the meantime, buy it on sale (unless you want to support the devs, which can only be good for the game), or wait until it is rather more polished.			"

								I love this game. I feel like this whole game was made with me in mind specifically. Wasteland, samurai, giant sword fights, building your own town, it's not even finished and yeah it's buggy at times, nothing you can't work around with a little patience though. It reminds me of certain games in a way, but I find this to be pretty unique. I've played a lot of games in my life and nothing was ever really like Kenshi. I HIGHLY recomend it. I have never once reviewed anything ever before. That should show you how much I love Kenshi.			"

								This Review will tell the story of my first 3 Charakters.The first one is short. I left the town and got beaten up by bandits.The second one took way longer but is as short to tell. I left the town and built a house. Then after watching my people working for about 20 min I got bored and started a new game.The third try I was exploring the world, hired a few followers and built another house. Then a single ninja walked by and killed all of my people.I see a lot of potential in this game. Right now it feels too easy to just roam the map, get rich, build an army and then a settlement. I expect that to change once needs like hunger are introduced and you need to get them covered. Also I miss a lot of RPG-content. But I trust the developers that they can deliver what they planned. The game right now is quite entertaining and once they do it will be near to infinite fun.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has a ton of potential.  And I don't just say that based on the projected features, I base that on how it feels.  As I play it, I get the feeling that as development continues the game world will become a complex and interestng place, and the different facets of the gameplay will compliment it.  It is ambitious, with base building, diplomacy, squad-based tactics, and rpg elements.  If all those come together, it will be an extremely unique game.The development is continuing steadily, it is not a project that is abandoned.  When I read about all the planned features I almost worry that the developer has bitten off more than he can chew, but the progress that has already been made proves otherwise.As it is early access, there is not a large amount of things to do within the game world yet.  However, a significant map expansion and diplomacy/faction system are a couple of the updates coming down the pipe, and if they are as advertised this game would be justified in shedding the ""alpha"" tag once they are released.A couple of the game mechanics are clunky, it can take 5+ minutes to sell all the items in my squad's inventory due to having to run around to different merchants in the towns.  However, the game attempts to be realistic in many respects and this is one that reflects real life, a merchant likely wouldn't be able to take a dozen sets of armor off someone's hands in real life.  Although I complain about the selling system, I can see that it was purposefully done to make the game seem realistic; it is not just something that was poorly implemented or was not though through well enough.As it is alpha, my characters do get stuck in walls occasionally, it is NOT a common occurrance however.  It is easily fixable too, just save the game and reload with a ""reset squat position"" option.  This is another example of the thought put into it by the developer; he recognizes that its deveopment status could cause bugs, but implemented a system to allow people to enjoy their experience despite it.  And the bugs really are few and far between for me.I really think this game is going to be something special.  Aside from the planned features, it just has the feel of something that will be a great experience.			"

								Oh my god this game. An alpha that i've consume so much hours and it's still the case to transform into weeks. The first time i saw those image and thoses tags i was like... what the hell... I MUST TRY THIS!!! and oooh boy i don't regret my choice. Kenshi is a squad based rpg where you're basicly a rat in a giant world. Depends on witch start you choose, the journey beggane with you, mostly with a pants a rusty sword, and you strove the desert to make your legend. In this game, your an ant at the very begganing. imagine that you, normal guy/guurl of all day decide to take a sword and start off you're companie. As you fight and fight, you'll learn what a true fight is. you can literraly see your character getting better at fighting. faster, wiser, deadliyer. Recruits other squad members, engineers, medics, fighter, then train and equip them : cloth, plate, mail, depends on your play style. like all plating knights style? alright. you love it fast and ninja style? alright! take what suit your play style. The fight system is an awesomly done speacking of dynamics and there is a limbs system that we can think of the fallout 3 limb system. If the Hp of a limb go to 0, either he or she won't be able to use that limb and if its a vital limb (head chest stomach) then they'll be K.O and need some medical attention. If the HP bar of thoses vital limb go to a certain negative treshold, those wounds are deadly. That's how you know that one of you mate have died in combat. This realistic mechanics also request of you to take care of your mate and leave them time to heal up, before going out and start murdering again. Go out in this majestic and awesomely well done desert. i'm totally serious here : i've passed several minutes just watching the dune, mountains and the horizon. ALOT of work as been put into the enviroment, and you feel it as soon as you have that sand in your sandals. Also, the map is ENORMOUS. Sometimes i was even saying to myself : jeez... i have to walk all that? but the reasons i'Ve just said make that you want that walking experience in this wounderful desert. Make a gigantic and prosperous town or a secret Samurai HQ, trades, fight, you really are the master of your own destiny. no missions or objective, simply survive and make a good and badass living. it's a sandbox where you do what you want and of course what you can to survive. Start off as a battleground looter to a blademaster to a rich caravan traders, to a formidable bandit or cannibal hunter, Be a bounty hunter and capture bad guys for ransom, or be the inquisitionning justicar and bring their judgment. the choice is yours. your blade awaits and the sand is thisty for blood. Get that game and start your legend!!!P;S : sorry for the tones of grammar errors.Have a great day wandering the dunes!			"

It's clear to me that these developers care about their game and name considering how far it's come and the fact that they still work on it, having not taken our money and ran like a Nigerian Prince. At this point in time, it obviously has it's bugs but Kenshi is still a fun game; definitely unique in a good way and I cannot wait to see it completed.

								Ah sweet sweet Kenshi, first off I want to point out I stole numerous copies of Kenshi before but in the end the game was so great(and had so many new bugfixes coming out) that I just had to buy it, so my gameplay time should be way way higher.  When I first played Kenshi the walls weren't in the game because they were to buggy, this was 2-3 years ago then im guessing, there was no background music in the game and a bunch of items didn't even have functioning icons but man was it great anyway.  Eventually I had to take a break for a while because a gamebreaking glitch where your characters take forever to respond to commands and then just stop responding.  But the glitch was repaired and they even came out with a whole new map for the world that looks just beautful instead of the rather barren one before.  Kenshi has a delightful limb damage system and a few dozen skills/attributes that all improve with use.  Kenshi has an easy to use base building system that allows you to set up basically anywhere.  This is one of the few alpha games that still seems truly unique every other major game has something a lot like it out or coming out as well but not Kenshi.  I haven't even tried out the new hunger system yet and I love survival aspects in games.  The only complaint I have right now is that the Slavers are like everywhere and if your team gets beaten in the start of the game looking to settle down theres a seemingly 25% chance you will all get picked up while knocked out and locked up.  The slavers seem to be a little too annoying at this point even on the easiest settings.  Oh and how could I forget the new races, they are awesome and unique and fit the feel so well, nice work on them.			"

								Let me start off by saying I've been following this game from it's early days. I never thought that this game would turn out as awesome as it has. I thought that it would've remained in it's previously quite barren alpha state. I was wrong.Kenshi is now one of my most favourite games of all time! It's become quite an amazing sandbox experience and I would definitely recommend this game to everyone and anyone. Although the world and lore still has a little building to do at this time, the game and it's features are well worth the £12.99 I paid for it (If its on sale, then even better!) The world is bustling with activity and things to do. You can do literally whatever you want (within reason) and all the hours I've spent playing this game have felt definitely worth it. (Bear in mind that i've played Kenshi off of steam for a long time)This game is truly a hidden gem and I can't wait to see what comes next. HOWEVER, currently this game is based around what YOU MAKE OF IT. If you're looking for storyline or cheap staright up violence then this game isn't for you. It's better played with a mindset of creating your own story (although the factions and lore help direct this I feel). Also the developers are bringing frequent and progressive updates to the game, and the mod community is very active and talented. A plus on the side!10/10			"

								Well, I've bought this game couple of years ago, and now I can see that it was a great «investment». Even with all the bugs the game has, it is one of the best single player games for me, since it uses a totally different way of interacting with you as a player.The world lives around you, and it doesn't care if you die. You are not special, and yet, if you've got patience, you can grow really strong and get your own faction going.That's what most modern games totally lack, and this one delivers.Totally recommend.

Then clothing, Crafting, Shops and Shop Keepers, then more Towns and Outposts.. Then His one man band become 2, then 3, 4 ect ect Adding Sound, Music, New Biome development, new armours, weapons, meshes... and Now.. Creatures.. This is a unforgiving land, Everyone can and will kill you if you attack them, Bandits want your blood and so do their enemies.. oh an The Beak things & Wolves in the experimental beta.. they are hungry for anything they can eat and they can smell dead things.If you don't own it.. your nuts! I've been on this journey following chris for a long while now and for it's price, it's bloody worth it! Get it before the price goes up and up.. I got it for like 10bucks AU years ago... worth every dollar.			"

								Been playing Kenshi for a while now.  Its definately not the kind of game that is easy to pick up and play, its a bit rough round the edges but if you persevere you will be rewarded with a very deep gaming experience.  I love open world games and games that give the player a lot of options which enable them to choose their path, Kenshi does this to a high standard.  One tip I will give new players - when you starting a new base; you can assign your characters jobs on the bottom right.  This makes them perform tasks automatically.  When you are up and running you can train your guys on dummys and start fighting with banditos.  Very fun game, constantly being developed and updated.			"

								     I personally highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a challenge, and to anyone who is looking for a fresh new way to play video games.  Yes the Graphics might not be the best at the moment.  Yes it might be in alpha but this game already has so much to offer.  You can create your own faction, and live the way you want to within the game.  You can start a brand new settlement and fight for survival.   You can raid, and mug and terrorise all over the play area.  Make enemies and forge alliances.  This game is well worth the investment and more. Support the creator my buying this game, and reporting bugs and giving suggestions on the forums.  A simply revelutionary way to play a video games, fresh and new.			"

								Kenshi is still in alpha and full of bugs that crash the game, causes some mechanics not to work, has a single repetetive desert landscape to play on and has only just had basic audio added to the game. Yet i look at the in-depth RPG and realistic combat systems in place and the potentiol of the game even in its current state makes me, for the first time, accept calmly that my game crashes and things don't work, because what does work shows just enough of the great things that are in the future of this title. This may not be a must own just yet, but the odds are stacked in its favour that it will be one day.			"

								One of the greater mix of the sandbox and RPG games. Its a top down RPG game focused on gamepaly rather than a 'campaign' If you have a great imagination, then by the time you push that new game button, its the start of your own campaign. However, this game doesnt take kindly to new players, in the beginning of the game, its harsh. But once you get a good character that could defend themself, you'll have a great time just like I did playing this game. (By the way I dont know if this is a local problem but to install updates to this game I have to reinstall it..Probably a local problem.)			"

Early Access Review
								Clearly an early access game, so a lot of content is still missing. However, it's a very FUN game even now, and since I bought it about a year ago, it's a very DIFFERENT game than what I bought, in a good way. The team has grown and is steadily updating with new and improved content, and they're quite dilligent about squashing bugs.The ambitious idea behind this game is pure sandbox gold, and thus far, I see no indication the game will fall very short of its goals. Even in its current state, it's a game I sink 4-6 hours at a time into. I tend to take long breaks, usually coming back after a big content update overhaul patch, but when I do pick it up, ""I think I'll play Kenshi for a bit"" always turns into ""Wow, I played Kenshi for that long?"" It's an addictive game with an extremely promising future.If you enjoy sandbox games, survival games or games that let you make a personal mark on the world, you'll love picking up a guy here and there from the taverns in the local towns, banding together for protection, and watching your recruits grow into hardened warriors and master builders as you carve out your own little piece of the world to call your own. I definitely recommend Kenshi for anyone who like a game that gives you freedom and rewards you for surviving in whatever way you see fit. I also recommend it for those who like to start out with nothing and eventually (a long time into the future) have to means to obtain anything they wish.If I were to compare it to other games... It's a little bit Mount and Blade, a little bit Age of Empires, and just a tiny bit Minecraft. (Tiny bit; you get to build, but you don't get to design your buildings. You can, however, place useful constructions like beds to heal in and containers to store materials and items into these buildings however you choose.)Do bear in mind that Kenshi is still in alpha, so it's a little barren and it does have its bugs. Also keep in mind that Kenshi isn't a game that holds your hand too much. You're plopped down in a world populated with various hostile and neutral factions, and your purpose is to survive however you can. Trade between the cities, start your own society where you mine and farm for resources to sell, or prey on starving bandits until you become bandits yourselves capable of waylaying wealthy merchants and their caravan guards.However, what you do and how you do it is left entirely to you, so do bear in mind that at first, you might feel a bit lost and without direction. Also keep in mind that the world is a dangerous place, and you might lose quite a bit before you start to see gains. Don't be afraid to fall; just speed up the time, and there's a good chance you'll wake up. If you do, you'll be tougher than the last time. Every scar in Kenshi brings you a small step closer to being the big dog in the game.Long story short: If you're thinking about buying Kenshi based purely on what the store page has to say about it, you'll probably be glad you bought it. It's an amibitious game that is slowly doing all it set out to do, and gives you the sense of accomplishment you'd expect. It's paced to be played for the long haul, so if you enjoy open-ended sandboxes where you reap your rewards after many long hours of effort and character growth, this is definitely a game you'll want to consider.

								Well, I've bought this game couple of years ago, and now I can see that it was a great «investment». Even with all the bugs the game has, it is one of the best single player games for me, since it uses a totally different way of interacting with you as a player.The world lives around you, and it doesn't care if you die. You are not special, and yet, if you've got patience, you can grow really strong and get your own faction going.That's what most modern games totally lack, and this one delivers.Totally recommend.

Early Access Review
								Disclaimer: This game crashes. A lot. It is also buggy. It is the very definition of early access/alpha. Very rough but an amazing concept.Now with that out of the way, let me get started. I bought this game one night after I saw it on an ad at some gaming news site. Once I started playing at about 11 pm, I looked out my window for the first time after starting playing and wouldn't you know it, the sun had come up. This game is slow paced the way I play (mind you it can be somewhat fast-paced if you're the fighting type) but holds my attention well enough that hours can pass in real time without my knowledge of it.You start out in one of about, as it stands, six or so scenarios. You can choose to be anything from a group of six people with all the right supplies to start out with a small town wherever you choose to, or a guy in his underwear with a broken arm and a crappy pipe for a weapon starting in the middle of nowhere. From there it is your choice where to go and what to do.Now I am the owner of quite a few early access titles here on steam, and with the exception of one game (space engineers) this game is updated the most. Lo-fi games seems to have it together and wants this title to be finished. They are also very receptive of community input. They have also said that when the game is released the price will go up, so if you're thinking about getting it but you're not sure, now is the time to buy.If you're wondering how this game is played, which is a question I get often, then here's the best I can describe it. You order your squad around RTS style by selecting then by clicking or click and drag mouse boxing them and order them around that way. The folks in your squad however tend to be uselss in all respects when you first get them and slowly by doing different tasks (labouring, weapon/armor crafting, fighting) get better at those things, adding an rpg element to it.Now just to wrap it up, if you buy this game, be patient and take a few hours to really get to know what you're doing before you make an opinion. Even in alpha this game is deep.			"

								A whole lot of fun, though a bit challenging at first. This game is overflowing with potential, and I can't wait to see where it goes. Right now the gameplay is pretty versatile, with a number of different ways to earn money, experience, and respect. Most of these paths, e.g. farming, smithing, trading, etc. take quite a while (1-3 hours) to really get functioning, so from the getgo you've got atleast 4 or 5 hours before the game gets anywhere near the risk of being boring. Throw in random attacks from the different desert and city factions, recruiting new members from the taverns of the world, and the amazing fun of mass combat and you're looking at a game well worth the price.

								This game is definitely unique. One of the first titles to be released when Early Access came about onto Steam.I've had so many different adventures playing this. It can be frustrating, challenging and even cheap at times. Yet I love it. Everything the developers have done has been great. Making new maps, units and races. You can build a city out of nothing. You can go to war with major cities or small farms. There are no right and wrongs. Just whatever you feel like doing. I did have an issue for a long time. My game would constantly crash making it really unplayable. Since a few patches, the game runs great for me again. I know it's been in development for a very long time, but that doesn't matter to me as long as the game itself so far is solid, which it is.			"

								This game deserves recognition. One of the most original games I've ever played, and don't be misled by the hours I played before it was even on Steam and for many hundreds of hours offline.It's harsh, as they say you are NOT the chosen one, you aren't dragonborn or some save the world badass. You are just some dude, and every encounter could be the end of your life. It's pretty rewarding to put the time in, strengthening yourself and the friends you meet.This is one of those games where when you take a substantial loss (home destroyed, friends dead or enslaved) and you either put the game down for a while or you pull your broken bloodied body up and get back to work. To survive in Kenshi is to do whatever it takes. Luring bandits through a peaceful village and plundering it afterwards, leading your warband several days through the mountains and ambushing passing traders, looking for wounded enemys retreating from battles...

Early Access Review
 Overview – Kenshi version 0.93.28 StableKenshi is an interesting game that's very hard to describe. It's a blend of RPG and RTS that functions quite well. You can dwell in the broken world just by yourself, with a squad of faithful friends, or with an entire army (using a simple mod, you can control up to 256 characters). So, what all does this game offer? Plenty of options you can find in most other RPGs. Be a thief, pawning off stolen goods to make profit, or you can travel the cities to make a living off honest trading with a bull to carry your load. Scavenge the ruins for artifacts with a faithful bonedog companion by your side. Establish outposts/villages/cities, serve a holy purpose, hunt down cannibals, become a leader of an army to sweep over the lands, battle giant creatures, or just chill in a tavern and listen to some of the stories others have to tell. Sounds good, doesn't it, but does it actually work?  The Good   True sandbox experience – almost all that the enemy can do, you can do too (and if not, there are mods for that) Official mod support (with Steam Workshop) – modability can carry the game when the game can no longer carry itself Giant map – even though only about ¼ of the map is implemented so far, it is still quite large, and will become only larger and more diverse as time goes on Updates – disputable (read more in The Bad), but the game is basically being made by a single guy (except for sound, music, and art), so with that taken into account, the game is being updated quite frequently Soundtrack – the music is great, and I applaud the composer for pronouncing the atmosphere of the game with fitting music. Look up the sound engineer and music composer of this game, Kole Hicks. You'll find that the music system of Kenshi is a lot more complex than you might think. Gameplay – All I described in the overview, you can truly do.  Replayability – Even when I explored the map, seen what there is to be seen, I still have the urge to play again and again, just to try a different style, a different race, or just to hang out in the amazing scenery once again   The Bad  Bugs – the game, to be honest, is a buggy mess. Some features that are implemented are not working correctly. For example, mercenaries that you should be able to hire to protect your outpost or to bodyguard you on your adventures don’t work (they just eat your money and act as if they had done the job), clipping textures (your characters can get stuck in inescapable places), shops can get bugged and be opened when they shouldn’t, which leads to guards attacking you, and more Pathfinding – While it’s amazing that you can just click anywhere in the map and your characters automatically go there, it’s not quite so useful when your characters get stuck, run around unnecessarily, etc. Your outpost workers will get stuck in buildings, behind staircases, and in other places. Learning curve – it will take you quite some time to get the hang of the game. This means you won’t be able to experience the game in enough time to be able to claim a refund if you don’t like the game anyway. So, buy at your own risk, knowing you won’t be able to get a refund Long development – the earliest Kenshi development video on the developer’s channel is 9 years ago, where in the description he also states that it’s a pre-alpha footage of something he had been working on for a few years by then. It just might be another decade before we see this game enter at least a beta stage. Still, at least we have an actually playable, feature-rich something, unlike another game that comes to mind – Overgrowth. What’s notable, though, is that even through such a long development the game is still being updated on regular basis, so the developer is definitely determined to see this game through. Dubious PR – I can’t attest to this myself, just thought I should mention it anyway. There has been, allegedly, some controversy. I don’t participate in the forums/steam discussion, so make your own picture of this. For further inquiry, read Extrasmooth's review of the game. If what he says is true, I fear that the developer might dig himself too deep into unfixable bugs. We shall see. Optimization – the game runs like garbage. You will have to contend yourself to playing the game at low/very low if you have older hardware like me. Still, the game will run like ♥♥♥♥ in some areas. Be wary. I don’t really care about the graphics as long as the gameplay is fine, but I know some people do care.Phew, that's quite long so far. I don't think I'll be able to write the story of my first serious journey in the end due to character limit, but I might do some ""greentext"" version later on once I get it written down. Just so you know so far, yes it does indeed ""work"" and you can experience all I have said you can. With that, I do recommend this game even in its kinda broken state, as I most definitely got my money's worth out of it, and will continue to do so in the future.  But, I still urge you to read through other reviews and to take ""The Bad"" things into account.			"

								I love this game. I feel like this whole game was made with me in mind specifically. Wasteland, samurai, giant sword fights, building your own town, it's not even finished and yeah it's buggy at times, nothing you can't work around with a little patience though. It reminds me of certain games in a way, but I find this to be pretty unique. I've played a lot of games in my life and nothing was ever really like Kenshi. I HIGHLY recomend it. I have never once reviewed anything ever before. That should show you how much I love Kenshi.			"

								Absoluely awesome even in it's current Alpha state. The gameplay and features planning to be added definately set this game apart from the crowd, in that it's hasn't been done over and over again.If your a fan of RPG and RTS games and would like to see a melding of the two come together then you should definately give this one a look. Understandably as it is still Early access it lacks what most would hope for from a finished game. I however think that the developers have worked hard enough on it that it warrants my money being invested.Keep in mind that it is still very rough around the edges and make sure you do a bit of research. I sincerely hope more people see this game for the absolute Gem it can and will be.			"

								This Review will tell the story of my first 3 Charakters.The first one is short. I left the town and got beaten up by bandits.The second one took way longer but is as short to tell. I left the town and built a house. Then after watching my people working for about 20 min I got bored and started a new game.The third try I was exploring the world, hired a few followers and built another house. Then a single ninja walked by and killed all of my people.I see a lot of potential in this game. Right now it feels too easy to just roam the map, get rich, build an army and then a settlement. I expect that to change once needs like hunger are introduced and you need to get them covered. Also I miss a lot of RPG-content. But I trust the developers that they can deliver what they planned. The game right now is quite entertaining and once they do it will be near to infinite fun.			"

								9/15/2015TL;DR at the bottom.  The Team I have been following the development of Kenshi for almost two years now. It started with only a single creator, but as the game gained popularity, the team has expanded greatly. One of the biggest drawbacks that may push many people away from this diamond in the rough is the slow development. But while the updates may be slow, the Lo-Fi team has proven their consistancy and dedication. Updates are regular and often expected, thier website lists projects currently in the works, and the team is very responsive to the community.  The Game Kenshi is an open-world, tactical, squad-based RPG, with a 'Sword Punk' style. It runs on the Havok engine. While a great engine, it has created significant obstacles in the way of pathfinding. However, this issue has almost completely resolved. The world has a post-catastrophic event type feel, but this may change when the giant 0.8 world update is released. Currently, the environment is a sparse desert with settlements dotting the land and bandits roaming the dunes. A faction system is present but not fully explored (you can decrease relations by attacking, increase it by healing). The art style is Jappanese influenced primarily, and the newly updated hud adds a rustic, bloody feel to it (A+). When starting a new game, you can choose from several different scenarios, from starting with a legendary sword to a group of traders to absoloutly nothing and a bum leg. The combat is based on your characters' skills, and damage is locational. One of the main portions of the game is base building. You can create a completely self sufficent settlement with farms, textile industry, arms crafting, and more, and traders will stop by at your stores.  Conclusion/TL;DR Kenshi has a LOT of promise, so much that this has to be my most anticipated game currently (besides Fallout 4, of course), and has been since I bought it. It is perfectly playable as is, but gameplay can get a little dry. But having gotten 173 hours out of an early access game started by a single individual, it'd be a crime not to recommend it.			"

								One of the greater mix of the sandbox and RPG games. Its a top down RPG game focused on gamepaly rather than a 'campaign' If you have a great imagination, then by the time you push that new game button, its the start of your own campaign. However, this game doesnt take kindly to new players, in the beginning of the game, its harsh. But once you get a good character that could defend themself, you'll have a great time just like I did playing this game. (By the way I dont know if this is a local problem but to install updates to this game I have to reinstall it..Probably a local problem.)			"

								I've been playing Kenshi for the past three years slowly watching the crazy amount of improvement it has underwent. At the beginning I was on the fences with everything due to some bugs and less opportunity for exploration with the old old map.. I recently got back into it and I just CANT stop playing it. The experience that I’ve had with the new map and the whole new system makes adventure 10x more ‘awesome-er’. This RTS/3rd-Person Hybrid, Sandbox, Squad-Based, Adventure-RPG is now a forerunner to a new genre in the RPG world and I’m extremely happy with the progress that Lofi Games has made.

								An interesting, innovative game created by one guy. In it's early Alpha stages it's completely playable, but with minor bugs and some major crashes. If you're a fan of Mount and Blade's open world, KOTOR's combat, and Elder Scrolls's skill system then you'll have a blast with this game. Along with the similarities to the title I previously listed, Kenshi also has a fully creatable town system where you can craft buildings, create your own town, sell your wares to NPC travelers and merchants, and get raided by bandits. It's a unique experience and a fun, slow-paced game where every squad member counts, and every swing of the enemies sword could mean death to your party.			"

								If you mainly play survival or rpg games, you may fall in love with Kenshi. If you enjoy customising a game to your own tastes or creating your own story, this is the game for you! Despite being early access and missing many of the features to be implemented in the final game, this game has so much content and so much potential. Currently, for me, the only downside is the bugs, but early access often comes riddled with bugs. Luckily the current ones don't make the game unplayable.The pros:-Lots of customisation-Huge map (with bigger map in the making)-NINJAS!-SAMURAI!-Solid economic and trading system-Enjoyable combat-Build a town/fortress/prison/camp any way you want-Deep weapon and armour crafting system-Custom team building (custom names, looks, armour, weapons, strengths and weaknesses)-in-depth character customisation-quicksave (F5) (you will be thankful if it crashes..)Cons: -Bugs (can be quite rare, but often frustrating. Verifying game cache can often fix the bigger bugs)-Crashes (even more rare, mainly happen after hours of having the game open)-TELEPORTING UNCONSCIOUS GUYS!!!All in all, well worth the low price it is, a game with incredible potential that will suit most play styles.

								One of the most ambitious and creative strategy games I've had the pleasure to play. Multifaceted RPG-City Building-Micro managing-Squad based(soon) strategy honeycluster of a game. Think open world Dungeon Siege 1 with city building, crafting, trade goods system with more stats to level up than things to do in real life. Currently it is still in alpha and enjoys frequent crashes and multiple game-breaking glitches, so don't buy into it just yet if you'd get annoyed at game crashes every 25 mins of gameplay, but do keep this game in mind. Amazing soundtrack, unique immersive atmosphere, fantabulous HP system and over all spectacularly well thought out game mechanics. This game is so good it made me write my first review on anything ever. ehrmagherd kenshi, please get funded by a gajillionaire so you can be completed ASAP.			"

								Awesome game. It is currently in alpha, but I could (and have) play for hours on end. The mechanics are stellar and, while buggy and incomplete, really make the experience a unique one. You can do just about anything you'd want to do in this game, save for maybe taking on a group of bandits solo. The combat is difficult, so taking on enemies should be done strategically so as to not get yourself killed. Luckily, you can hire as many companions as you'd like to help you take on the baddies. Want to build a base for manufacturing goods, weapons and armor? More power to you! Want to build an army to ravage a nearby town? Better start training! The possibilities are near endless. All in all, I cannot wait for this game to hit 1.0 version. If it keeps going at this rate, I've no doubt it will be extremely successful. GET IT NOW!			"

								One of the best rpg/rts games ive ever played, and its only in early access. I bought this game ages ago after seeing the first part of a lets play thinking it looked amazing, Altho it looked really complicated and it seemed that it would take a long time to figure out how things worked and played so i put it off for almost a year. Finally a week ago i decided to pick it up. One week later and i have 57 hours clocked in this game. Do yourself a favor and get this game. It may seem a bit daunting at first but its worth the first 30 minutes to an hour floundering about, because once you figure out how everything works it becomes an amazing experience. I only wish the entire game was out so i could enjoy the full vision of the devs, patience was never my strong suite tho, and right now it shouldnt be yours either, so stop being patient and buy the game!

								Ah sweet sweet Kenshi, first off I want to point out I stole numerous copies of Kenshi before but in the end the game was so great(and had so many new bugfixes coming out) that I just had to buy it, so my gameplay time should be way way higher.  When I first played Kenshi the walls weren't in the game because they were to buggy, this was 2-3 years ago then im guessing, there was no background music in the game and a bunch of items didn't even have functioning icons but man was it great anyway.  Eventually I had to take a break for a while because a gamebreaking glitch where your characters take forever to respond to commands and then just stop responding.  But the glitch was repaired and they even came out with a whole new map for the world that looks just beautful instead of the rather barren one before.  Kenshi has a delightful limb damage system and a few dozen skills/attributes that all improve with use.  Kenshi has an easy to use base building system that allows you to set up basically anywhere.  This is one of the few alpha games that still seems truly unique every other major game has something a lot like it out or coming out as well but not Kenshi.  I haven't even tried out the new hunger system yet and I love survival aspects in games.  The only complaint I have right now is that the Slavers are like everywhere and if your team gets beaten in the start of the game looking to settle down theres a seemingly 25% chance you will all get picked up while knocked out and locked up.  The slavers seem to be a little too annoying at this point even on the easiest settings.  Oh and how could I forget the new races, they are awesome and unique and fit the feel so well, nice work on them.			"

								Edit - Map is almost done! Such a great game. And now there has been a serious optimization upgrade. From 20-30 fps to 80-100.Edit - The map is expanding...the game keeps improving by leaps and bounds.Edit - Beta is out and man...it has gotten THAT much better.By an order of magnitude.The strangest, best, least, most RPG you will ever play.If you like free form games that allow your imagination to supply the details then this is the perfect game for you.Do you remember Daggerfall? There was a story, but it was easily ignored allowing you to do as you wished. It was the best sandbox a gamer could ask for in 1996. (I still have it)This is Daggerfall made by intention. There is no story...other than the one you supply.There are a few character types to choose from and that is it. You are plopped into a town with whatever cats (currency) and weapon the character had. No quest. You can stand there and watch the sun rise and set until you have logged 1,000 hours if you choose.Or...I trained on a fighting dummy for a month to improve my sword skills.I walked to a neighboring town some days away, avoiding the Dust Bandits along the way.I hired two mercs and took them to train with the dummy as I had.I looted a few unconscious people, and a couple of dead ones.I upset the local constabulary because I had looted one of them after they had been killed in an unrelated (to me, at least) battle. ""Damned looters.""I plan on building a town after I recruit more bodies. The history, the lore, the quests are all up to ME.One of the significant differences I have found is that although I save a lot (due to the early state of the game) I do not reload when something adverse occurs to my squad.I know that by combat itself my squad improves. The better the opponent the faster you learn defensive moves.We got jumped by some Sand Bandits and suffered wounds. In the run-of-the-mill RPG there is little benefit from suffering at all, so you reload. Replaying a particular battle over until you figure the puzzle out is frustrating and usually results in my abandoning a game.Not now. In fact, they are badges of pride. ""Dude, we fought and won!""edit - I just beat the boss of a local bandit posse. He followed us, alone. I turned my crew and fought him 10:1. Yes, we won. Danged straight I am beaming. I thought his group of bandits would cower after seeing me holding his head but...I had to run to fight another day.I also am impressed with a dev that loves their game more than I do. It is a labor of love; it will continue at whatever pace Lo-Fi can afford.edit - Support is amazing. The Beta introduced some issues so the response was to issue a quick series of hotfixes. A game-breaking bug is reported, a game breaking bug is quashed 5 hrs later.This is the weirdest RPG that I love so much.			"

The slavers seem to be a little too annoying at this point even on the easiest settings.  Oh and how could I forget the new races, they are awesome and unique and fit the feel so well, nice work on them.			"

								Edit - Map is almost done! Such a great game. And now there has been a serious optimization upgrade. From 20-30 fps to 80-100.Edit - The map is expanding...the game keeps improving by leaps and bounds.Edit - Beta is out and man...it has gotten THAT much better.By an order of magnitude.The strangest, best, least, most RPG you will ever play.If you like free form games that allow your imagination to supply the details then this is the perfect game for you.Do you remember Daggerfall? There was a story, but it was easily ignored allowing you to do as you wished. It was the best sandbox a gamer could ask for in 1996. (I still have it)This is Daggerfall made by intention. There is no story...other than the one you supply.There are a few character types to choose from and that is it. You are plopped into a town with whatever cats (currency) and weapon the character had. No quest. You can stand there and watch the sun rise and set until you have logged 1,000 hours if you choose.Or...I trained on a fighting dummy for a month to improve my sword skills.I walked to a neighboring town some days away, avoiding the Dust Bandits along the way.I hired two mercs and took them to train with the dummy as I had.I looted a few unconscious people, and a couple of dead ones.I upset the local constabulary because I had looted one of them after they had been killed in an unrelated (to me, at least) battle. ""Damned looters.""I plan on building a town after I recruit more bodies. The history, the lore, the quests are all up to ME.One of the significant differences I have found is that although I save a lot (due to the early state of the game) I do not reload when something adverse occurs to my squad.I know that by combat itself my squad improves. The better the opponent the faster you learn defensive moves.We got jumped by some Sand Bandits and suffered wounds. In the run-of-the-mill RPG there is little benefit from suffering at all, so you reload. Replaying a particular battle over until you figure the puzzle out is frustrating and usually results in my abandoning a game.Not now. In fact, they are badges of pride. ""Dude, we fought and won!""edit - I just beat the boss of a local bandit posse. He followed us, alone. I turned my crew and fought him 10:1. Yes, we won. Danged straight I am beaming. I thought his group of bandits would cower after seeing me holding his head but...I had to run to fight another day.I also am impressed with a dev that loves their game more than I do. It is a labor of love; it will continue at whatever pace Lo-Fi can afford.edit - Support is amazing. The Beta introduced some issues so the response was to issue a quick series of hotfixes. A game-breaking bug is reported, a game breaking bug is quashed 5 hrs later.This is the weirdest RPG that I love so much.			"

								Although Kenshi is a bit buggy (pathing & structures) I have found it to be a very satisfing combination of simulation/rpg/tower defense games.  I do enjoy aquiring new followers and ""training"" them to fit my overall strategy.  The open-world aspect fits really well giving you the freedom to play any way you desire.  So far I havent dealt with many aspects of the game, like faction reputation, but I do look forward to exploring them and new updates as they are released.  So far it has surpassed my expectations making it a fine investment for $20.			"

								Kenshi is an amazing game. You don't start out as some chosen one who can instantly take on an army of guys who have the best weapons in the game with their bare hands, you don't start out as someone who can build a city and have hundreds of people traveling through, you don't start as someone who has lots of money and can buy everything, in Kenshi. You start as a nobody. To even think about beating the weakest enemy you will face in a fight you will have to hire another person to join you, and then train on some dummies for a couple of days, and you'll still probably lose and have to limp back to a hospital bed. 10/10 would get captured by cannibals again.P.SWhile this game is absolutely amazing, please keep in mind this game has been in development for years and it will not be finished any time soon. The developer of this game is basically creating this on his own. although i do believe he has hired outside help. Plus, he's called Captain Deathbeard. give him your money already. check his steam page  HERE.			"

								Early Access so far and it is quite interesting. Though character development becomes ruled out after you get to the gist of the game, it is still a unique game. Focused on squad or team members, you create your own town/village and try to excel in the wild lands. Bandits will attack occasionally and you'll have to move your goods to market to make profit. Overall, a fun game and will be even better if final version in the future brings the full integrity of the game to light.			"

								It's half finished, buggy and incredibly fun if you're into the RPG/simulator/strategy genre. It reminds me quite a bit of The Guild 2 (also sold here on Steam). It's a bit unstable. I crash about every 2-3 hoursI made character, picked the origin where you start with a broken arm and a stick in the middle of nowhere. I was the gimpies gimp that have ever gimped. Knowing what to expect from reading other reviews I looked at my map and headed for the nearest town. As expected my crippled self attracted the attention of some bandits on the way. Knowing that fighting them would be brief and pointless I just kept running (bravely) away. Made it to a town and hid. The town guards dispatched the bandits. When it was safe I sauntered back out and started looting, making several trips to the local shops. After I had confiscated all the bandit possesions and profited I headed to the nearest tavern and recruited some backup. I could now confiscate things twice as fast! And that's pretty much how things went for a while. Traveling from town to town, luring bandits along into town guard ambushes, recruiting more and more people. Invested in some backpacks. I even started getting a little bolder and would help the townguards with dispatching these outlaws. My people would get hurt and sometimes even knocked out but I always made sure everyone had first aid kits on them, ready to patch a fallen friend up.  Before I knew it I was leading a group of 20 people, 18 females and 2 males (amazons!),  and we could actually kill single groups of bandits alone without the help of town guards.  It was time to build an outpost!Outpost life is hard. Not a day goes by without getting hassled by bandits, ninjas or cannibals. It didn't take long before I decided to pay the Dust Bandit faction off to leave me alone. One payment and they havent bothered me since. That cut the constand hassling down to about half and made it manageble. I can usually handle any town ambushes but I do sometimes get overrun and have to make a run for it to the closest town (Brink). But I finally finished the wall surrounding my outpost and my little group gets stronger every day!			"

								Made a guy that was a mongoloid. Spent 2 days picking a lock, then proceded to lure bandits to the town for easy loot. After much looting I thought it would be a nice time to leave my safety net... I built a small shack, and was loving it, then a evil gang of sand ninjas circled around my shack. The leader emerged yelling ""Oi! Come out 'ere pansy"". So I complied with the bandits. I walked out there and they offered to be best friends for the ""small"" price of 2,000 cats. Being the poorfag that bark was, had to decline. They enclosed me, and beat me into a small coma. They lingred there until I woke up and finished the job, and left me out in the desert to die.

								Well worth the money. It's a great game for the price it's at, there are games that currently are out and ""AAA"" that arn't nearly as fun as this (i'm looking at you skyrim!) Yes, this is still early access, but it's decently stable with the odd crash here or there unless you opt into the experimental version. And if it doesn't look like it's that intresting now, check back in later down the line and see what else has been added, you might be surprised.Edit for 0.95.5: The game is coming along very well and recently has added unarmed combat and the dodge skill into the game.

I was so upset watching them die while i was helpless to do anything, as i had been training each to specialize in different skills.

								I'm writing this during the Alpha 0.62 phase of development. Positives:Self-set goalsInteresting worldEpic mass battlesA wide range of gameplay optionsDetailed battle system and character creationNegatives:Self-set goalsMany bugs (for now)A lot of patience requiredvisually bland environment (endless desert)I got this game as soon as it was released on steam and I can say that it is absolutely fun to play. It has plenty of bugs (for now) and there are many unfinished aspects of the game but that is alright. Whatever this game is lacking right now it makes up for in excess with its gameplay. You do not start strong and there is nothing designed to be ""easy."" In fact, you will get demolished by anybody at the start of the game. The real fun for me came from building up my squad (I started with two characters, i now have 20) creating a town of my own, and then using my expanding reserves of money, skilled fighters, and tradesmen to utterly dominate anyone who crossed my path. Be warned though, because of the nature of this game it takes a LOT of patience. If you are able to strive through that though then it will be both extremely rewarding and enjoyable for you. I expect many great things as time goes on and can't wait to see the new game dynamics which will make this even better in the future.			"

								First of all, my playtime is not accurate as I bought Kenshi well before it was available on Steam. Just want to add my thoughts about the dev cycle of this game. I rarely buy games before their full release given the risks of doing so. In the past years I have seen the dev team for this game go from basically one person's passion project to something more likely to be able to provide the grand vision the dev has. I have to say I have been impressed with this dev's committment to this title, even after making a good deal of pre-order/beta sales over the years. Integrity is important, and in my view this dev has done a good job working consistently to live up to his promises during this time. If watching a passion project game slowly grow is something you can be patient and handle, Kenshi is worth the ask price.tl;dr I do not regret buying this title years ago pre-steam. Would buy again.

								so an idea came to me while playing. i imported unit buildings research.  and seeing as my settlement is close to the town of catan for when ever reason catan inhabited my buildings and in my GUI i had one citizen and control of all of catan and still my own units. thats when the idea occured to me. give a scroll wheel on the GUI for the units (i know simple but needs to be said) and add tabs above the GUI so i can then assign units to a squad and make tabs at will that stack like cards in solitare. now i would rule the world with an iron fist with the largest city backing me but the game seems to enjoy crashing. but overall amazing game its been a long time (normally i would of fizzles out waiting) but the end game from what i guess is going to be insane! keep up the hardwork!

								This game is great, even in it's early stage. The fact that you have many start options is amazing, very few games will give you this opportunity. I must admit i started at least 20 games... At first, the Freedom Seekers, a group of 7 people with a very good stack of building materials is tempting. So you can build a farm or mine very fast. In the long run, i decided to start solo, with the trader, no cash but what you have in your backpack is enough to get you started. If you're brand new to this, google a guide for beginner, believe me, it helps... As i said previously, it's in an early stage, so you will encounter some bugs... Thank god you haven't deselect the auto-save which will save you're skin many times, believe me. The producer is updating regularly so if you encounter some new bugs, like i did, it's fixed in no time. So, overall, all good except for the camera style... I can't adjust myself to click on the middle-mouse button to rotate camera, and for some reason the camera system is only for top-bottom activity, so if you're heading to a city that's up to a moutain, you can't see it until you're almost in it, as if you were trying to see a bird in the sky, it's only top-bottom, that's mainly the only problem i see on the current version of this amazing game... Enjoy!			"

								A lot of people worry about buying Early Access games. And they should. Early Access is a risky investment for the consumer. But you don't need to worry about this developer. This is a solid team making a great game. I've had it several years now. It started off rough around the edges, buggy, unstable, but fun. I had a lot of fun in its early stages. Its a testament to the core aspects of the game that I loved it even with its Pre-Alpha quirks. It pre dates Early Access on Steam altogether. After all this time. The original lone developer, Chris, (and now a complete team) made something really special. Its got a ways to go. But it has grown exponentially since when I bought it even.I bought it just after they added sound to the game. I want to say that was 2012 but I don't quite remember. I had my eye on it prior to that but that is when I took the plunge. I started off confused. I wasn't really sure how the game worked. The style was nice but the world was a little off in the ways that any game is prior to an alpha release. Despite that, I had a great time. Its fun just roaming a desert. Its fun talking to the weird inhabitants.  It was awesome when I finally WON a fight. And base building is as fun as it is time consuming.I was running from city to city, gathering resources, gaining a comrade or two in the process. Booking it past Bandits and Ninjas to the safety of city. And, once I was strong enough, fighting back, with mixed results. It is interesting that the sense of relief I feel when my limping character carries a bleeding out comrade to the safety of city walls... is immediately followed by the desire to venture outside of those walls yet again. Thats Kenshi for you. Its all in the goals you set for yourself. The original map was a massive desert. Fun but monotonous. The new map adds quite a bit of spice to that. Swamps. Fog Islands, Coastal areas, Forests, Mountains, and a new and improved desert. More is to come. Only half of the map is available at the moment, but it is huge. I'm not even close to discovering all the major cities and I have put 20 hours this week on exploring it (and that is all I have been doing with my squad)First the danger outside of those walls was Ninjas and Bandits. New updates added Cannibals, wildlife... fog men. There are hostile areas (particularly in the North) you should back off from unless you have a group of solid fighters. Either the enemy's numbers or skill will overwhelm a new player there. I really enjoy the creature design. Familiar creatures exist like dogs, bulls, turtles and then there are Garrus, Beak Things, and some creatures that should be avoided altogether because they are four stories tall. Its a journey for your squad and its a personal thing, because the game doesn't tell you where to go. It doesn't tell you to stop until all of your guys are dead. It just says, ""GO."" From a guy with a sword to an impressive company of nomadic traders. From a crippled old man stranded in the desert to builder of a city. An escaped slave to the conqueror of an empire.			"

								I Love the idea of this game and have put about 90 hours into it.  I believe in being honest so here is the good and the bad.First the bad, the game lags quite a bit if you don't lower view distances even with an I7-6900K, 64GB ram, 1080 video card, 3 SSD raid 0.  In other words a pretty decent gaming rig.  In order to get it to a playable state I had to drastically reduce viewing distances, turn off shadows, reflections etc....  I am able to play in the correct resolution for my monitor 3440x1440 but I had to turn most options fairly low before it was in a playable state.  Game is still in Alpha apparently, so may be this will be worked on and get corrected in the future through some sort of optimization.  Now for some of the good things about this game!  Character customization is superb, you can drastically change the way your toon looks when getting setup.  The devs have made massive updates to the game content wise since I first started playing it.  The game world looks substantially better than it used too in almost every single way imaginable.  I am not saying the graphics are F'ing amazing or something but they have improved and the world is not nearly as boring as it once was visually.Long story short it is a good indie title and definitely enjoyable if you have some patience.  Just remember your character sucks badly when you start and your best bet is running from danger to begin with.  You characters improve steadily through harvesting, fighting, running, carrying heavy objects, manufacturing etc... etc... if you like the idea of a squad based sandbox game with no real end game goal this could help you kill many an hour of boredom.

								Bought it when it first came out. Back then there were waaaay less things to do and alot more bugs... still i managed to play 20 hours in just 1 week.... Extremely addicting tactical game with alot of possibilities... that just improve with time. 8/10Because of its numerous possilities (can make a town, make a squad, research stuff, sell stuff, set up a shop etc..) as a squad game (in other words, you give commands... your units will do actions without you manually having to do them 1 by 1) i give it a 5. 2 points i reserve as a matter of taste and 1 point for the amount of details and uniqueness this game has.Updates are slow so im still waiting for more stuff before starting all over. but its definetly a great game that proves that, unique and awesome games may come from the smallest or most unexpected places.

								recently i've been sinking dozens of hours into this and i decided i had to write a review. this is a openworld RPG with enormous freedom of choice.. have played since oldland (0.4 or something i think) and this game is what i like to see in RPGs..Story:this is a RPG that plays in a postapocalyptic wasteland thousands (?) of years after an extinction event and now people fight with swords and sticks because technology has mostly been lost..Freedom of Choice:tons of factions each with distinctions that set them apart (cannibals, zealots, ninjas etc..) so you can meaningfully change what kind of playstyle you want to use.. you can be a farmer, raider, trader.. kind of reminds me of x3 and other space-sim gamesHigh Customizability:choose between 4 Races and change your appearance with tons of slidersModding / Workshop:I have no experience with modding but with the tools provided by the devs (FCS - forgotten construction set) you can get at the guts of all the settings ingame that govern how the world and you / the NPCs workActive Development:this game has been here for quite some time and has already changed very much from the first versions and while the experimental branch (testing version) sometimes has bugs its very much enjoyable and improving all the time..

								My take on Kenshi is a mixed bag.  Bottom line is I love the game but it's horrendously buggy and development is extremely slow.They bill it as an RPG with RTS elements, but it doesn't play that way for me.  I see it more as an RTS with RPG elements.  You scavenge materials, build a base, train recruits and laborers and defend or go on the aggressive.  It reminds me a bit of Earth 2150 in how each unit can earn experience and lvl up (the RPG aspects) while maintaining an RTS-like squad-focused feel.It's a lot of fun training your troops and building your town up.  But the bugs, oh my.  If you play the ""stable"" release, expect to crash randomly every hour or so like clockwork.  I honestly had better stability with the ""experimental"" opt-in steam beta branch, however some friends with similar rigs say they can't play the experimental version at all due to single digit frame-rates (it plays fine for me).  But either way you go, the sad state of pathing AI in this game really kills the joy.  Regular reloads when your own guys get stuck in the landscape and terrain and a constant spectacle of enemy units stuck on hills and corners.   This is by far the worst of the bugs, but there are lots of others.I really like the game and think it has awesome potential, but the state of development and the persistence of bugs through so many releases really has me discouraged.If you managed to pick it up on sale like I did and don't mind risking a small investment on a game with great potential, then go for it.  If you aren't willing to throw money at a project that may never be completed and has too many bugs to enjoy for any length of time in it's current state, then I suggest you wait and see what happens.  For me, I'd do it again.  I knew what I was getting into and the sale price of $10 makes it an acceptable risk.			"

								I just want to say that this game is pretty incredible for what it's worth. Even though it's early access and still bug riddled, the devs are still putting out updates so it's not like a Stomping Lands kind of deal.The soundtrack is probably my favorite part of it. Beign a video game design student that is focusing on audio and visuals, the soundtrack sets the tone and just gives me chills. I would very much like to meet the head of the sound department for this. Gameplay reminds me of Baldur's Gate in a sense, with the stop starting squad movements.Overall, quite an amazing game well worth its price. I would very much like to see what the devs come out with next. 5/7			"

								If you are looking for a game you can casually play for a few hours and be done with it, you should not buy Kenshi. This game takes a lot of time to get almost anything done. The huge world alone (and not even all of it is playable at this point) takes hours to explore, especially if you dont want your characters to starve on the way. The different zones make the world feel interesting enough, even though there are a lot of huge open spaces (perfectly suited to start a base).There are a lot of different ways you can play this game:Build a base with everything you need protected by a huge wall strong enough to withstand groups of raiders... orGather a few capable fighters to pillage camps, raider groups and whole cities if you are up to it... orMove swiftly in the shadows while you steal the most expensive goods to sell in another city where nobody knows (or cares) that the goods were stolen in the first place.But no matter what you do, be prepared to lose fights and almost get killed or enslaved over and over again, until you are an experienced survivor, because the start is very rough and the first few hours you will probably barely hang on to your life. But keep going, because once your stats allow you to withstand a proper fight, it will be so rewarding to pay back the beating.All in all this game has already very deep and intriguing mechanics and no matter what play style you choose, there is enough content to keep you busy for days. The development seems slow at first, but whenever there is a content update, it is usually pretty profound. The game is still a little glitchy, but there have been big improvements over the last year, so apart from occasional reloading, the bugs are not really much of a problem anymore.			"

								I remember seeing this game a couple years ago and being genuinely interested. I had a He-Man Lunchbox for a rig back then, so I figured it wouldn't run and held off on the purchase. Fast forward to my current rig, and now I still can't run it at max. But even with choppy frames it held my interest.The open world of Kenshi gives you an interesting post-post-apocalyptic backdrop where death is a constant threat, but survival is rewarded. Next to nothing remains of the old world, and there's been too many generations since for anyone to remember it or even know about it. The desert sands have left only unrecognisable hulking metal structures for scavengers to gather scrap iron, and the technologies of the past are only hinted about in tattered books that are sold at high prices. A fanatical religion dabbling in feudalism controls most cities and outposts, but searching beyond their military's grasp will find you in stranger places and their people, where you might find reward or a desolate death.In Kenshi, the player's role in the world is never specified. Your actions are completely free to you, but the world does react to them. What sets it apart from other sandbox is that NPC's can perform the same actions as you. Bandits will loot you after knocking you out, and factions may send trader's if your shop interests them. When you're researching walls and farming techniques, NPC outposts are studying the same, if not better, technologies. The Kenshi world is truly large, and set to be even bigger with future updates. There's nothing else really like Kenshi in similar genre's, and it's a truly ambitious idea. Only regret is not buying it earlier.			"

								recently i've been sinking dozens of hours into this and i decided i had to write a review. this is a openworld RPG with enormous freedom of choice.. have played since oldland (0.4 or something i think) and this game is what i like to see in RPGs..Story:this is a RPG that plays in a postapocalyptic wasteland thousands (?) of years after an extinction event and now people fight with swords and sticks because technology has mostly been lost..Freedom of Choice:tons of factions each with distinctions that set them apart (cannibals, zealots, ninjas etc..) so you can meaningfully change what kind of playstyle you want to use.. you can be a farmer, raider, trader.. kind of reminds me of x3 and other space-sim gamesHigh Customizability:choose between 4 Races and change your appearance with tons of slidersModding / Workshop:I have no experience with modding but with the tools provided by the devs (FCS - forgotten construction set) you can get at the guts of all the settings ingame that govern how the world and you / the NPCs workActive Development:this game has been here for quite some time and has already changed very much from the first versions and while the experimental branch (testing version) sometimes has bugs its very much enjoyable and improving all the time..

								Can´t believe this started as a one man project. It´s still ALPHA but it´s totally awesome. A sandbox RPG kinda like Mount & Blade  but much better with realistic swordfights that improve with experience. Can´t wait what comes in the next Update- The dev is clearly a genius specialised in AI and it´s unbelievable what he´s done so far. I would love to buy this at full price- finally something new in a time where devs just like to ruin the old games in bad remakes. Please excuse my bad English, it´s not my native language.			"

								Holy crap does this game have potential. I don't even want to know how much time i'm going to sink into this game when the mechanics are all in place and the content comes in faster. This game has so much depth, and requires a little bit of patience at first, but when you get the hang of it you'll fall in love. I'd recommend this game to someone who loves games like Starcraft and Fallout, at the same time.			"

								See my game time?I used only 3 days to play for so long, and I am a high school student of China(You know hign school student in China always have a hard time)This game is really funIn this game, you can do whatever you want.You can roam around, get to know the world of HeroesYou can own behind closed doors, to build the city of hope in the end timesYou can do business, to create your own business empireYou can luocaoweikou(It’s a Chinese idiom, which means “become a bandit), rob everything you seeYou can walk alone with your own sword .or making a Gang GroupIn a word, in this game, you can go to your own life.Or, to dieIn short, this game is recommended for you to play, but you need to play this seriously, the game is definitely not the fast food garbage can be compared, but the game is very time-consuming,so if you have enough time ,try this,I’,m serious.

								I trained a random wasteland dreg into dayman who proceeded to take other dregs and teach them his secerts of Karate. Camping out in the pits of despair fool of monsters with sticks and practising getting beaten into a finely chiseled hulk of godlike strength, and only having to watch a 4 disciples be eaten alive, I then proceeded to roam the wastes and loot ruins for max tier armor. Garbed in the finest of clothes, and armed with the greatest power of all, texts books on how to build crossbows, i set out to establish my staging camp. You see, the best places to create cities and camps area already taken, so i had to go all Communist revolution and seize all property though force of arms.10/10 would strave the masses again for ego.

								A realy great game and worth a buy even in its early access state..An rts/rp/sim/ninja/running/headf**k of a city building style game with alot more..Im not gonna get into all you can do go look at youtube for that..Great building system.Fresh Training/leveling system (The more you do something the better you get).Large map (All sand but new bios comming soon).Not easy mode, if you want a squad of elite ninjas you will have to train them. rest/house them. keep them alive with medics and craft them gear and weapons.The game will crash .... alot so get used to saving and its not so bad.The ai tends to get stuck, stand around and do strange things but ...ya know early access.You need to put time into this game to get the good so if your looking for an arcade style fighting ..keep looking.But all that said i love this game and if you can look past the early access bugs buy it as its gonna be something unique.

Early Access Review
								If you are looking for a game you can casually play for a few hours and be done with it, you should not buy Kenshi. This game takes a lot of time to get almost anything done. The huge world alone (and not even all of it is playable at this point) takes hours to explore, especially if you dont want your characters to starve on the way. The different zones make the world feel interesting enough, even though there are a lot of huge open spaces (perfectly suited to start a base).There are a lot of different ways you can play this game:Build a base with everything you need protected by a huge wall strong enough to withstand groups of raiders... orGather a few capable fighters to pillage camps, raider groups and whole cities if you are up to it... orMove swiftly in the shadows while you steal the most expensive goods to sell in another city where nobody knows (or cares) that the goods were stolen in the first place.But no matter what you do, be prepared to lose fights and almost get killed or enslaved over and over again, until you are an experienced survivor, because the start is very rough and the first few hours you will probably barely hang on to your life. But keep going, because once your stats allow you to withstand a proper fight, it will be so rewarding to pay back the beating.All in all this game has already very deep and intriguing mechanics and no matter what play style you choose, there is enough content to keep you busy for days. The development seems slow at first, but whenever there is a content update, it is usually pretty profound. The game is still a little glitchy, but there have been big improvements over the last year, so apart from occasional reloading, the bugs are not really much of a problem anymore.			"

								I just want to say that this game is pretty incredible for what it's worth. Even though it's early access and still bug riddled, the devs are still putting out updates so it's not like a Stomping Lands kind of deal.The soundtrack is probably my favorite part of it. Beign a video game design student that is focusing on audio and visuals, the soundtrack sets the tone and just gives me chills. I would very much like to meet the head of the sound department for this. Gameplay reminds me of Baldur's Gate in a sense, with the stop starting squad movements.Overall, quite an amazing game well worth its price. I would very much like to see what the devs come out with next. 5/7			"

Early Access Review
								First of all, my playtime is not accurate as I bought Kenshi well before it was available on Steam. Just want to add my thoughts about the dev cycle of this game. I rarely buy games before their full release given the risks of doing so. In the past years I have seen the dev team for this game go from basically one person's passion project to something more likely to be able to provide the grand vision the dev has. I have to say I have been impressed with this dev's committment to this title, even after making a good deal of pre-order/beta sales over the years. Integrity is important, and in my view this dev has done a good job working consistently to live up to his promises during this time. If watching a passion project game slowly grow is something you can be patient and handle, Kenshi is worth the ask price.tl;dr I do not regret buying this title years ago pre-steam. Would buy again.

Early Access Review
								The game can be described as Skyrim meets town building.I think the beauty of it is probably the early game struggle whether you're playing a single warrior or a weak bunch of settlers... in both experiences you'll only just be barely surviving and it's that edge of your seat moment to moment that makes the game so addicting. Yes in time you will become a master but it does the early game better than other survival rpgs in the genre. You will come to care about your characters if only due to all the extreme close calls you've been through with them.If you can imagine your most ideal open sandbox game lacking only a well written story or deep characters, well that's Kenshi.It does go from being one of the best games I've played to being a painful bug-ridden headache. But the Dev is very active adding a lot of new content quickly and likewise trying to fix bugs just as fast. I have a lot of faith in the Dev and the beautiful game he's creating and know it will be a labor of love that only continues to get better over the years.The highs for me overcome the lows. I'd recommend playing, it will be a game you remember fondly for a long time to come - provided you're lucky enough to have your first playthrough be a stable experience :)			"

								Bought it when it first came out. Back then there were waaaay less things to do and alot more bugs... still i managed to play 20 hours in just 1 week.... Extremely addicting tactical game with alot of possibilities... that just improve with time. 8/10Because of its numerous possilities (can make a town, make a squad, research stuff, sell stuff, set up a shop etc..) as a squad game (in other words, you give commands... your units will do actions without you manually having to do them 1 by 1) i give it a 5. 2 points i reserve as a matter of taste and 1 point for the amount of details and uniqueness this game has.Updates are slow so im still waiting for more stuff before starting all over. but its definetly a great game that proves that, unique and awesome games may come from the smallest or most unexpected places.

								The most important thing first off to mention is it's an early access game. it is by no means complete, and if you choose to buy it keep that in mind. However, I myself bought it when it was $15, and really after playing it for so long and getting so much out of it when it is not even close to complete I would have been willing to pay much more than that. This is a masterpiece in the works, and is well on its way. The only complaint I can make is the updates are fairly spaced out, but this is very understandable because of the type of game this is and the size of the development team. If anything they are fairly sporadic in their updates all considered.If you like the idea of building a city/army/both, or strategy games in general, this is for sure the game for you and I recommend buying it as soon as possible not only to support the developers in their endeavors but also to experience the greatness.

								Even though the game is just in an alpha, it is remarkebly well made for being an alpha. The options that are available, and the difficulty of the game combined with the feel of community among your team is just a great experience.The reward of seeing your city flourish with traders trading at the saloon, workers working in the field and in the mines, visiters walking through the town and bandits being killed and drawn off by your guards is huge!This game is recommendable!

								Even in alpha game has a lot of things to do! Research new things and continue expanding your own little town make sure to get everyone trained up to speed to make defending your town a lot easier! Or just run to the nearest city to protect yourself with the city gaurds. Loot, sell, level up skills and make trade items and sell and recruit new people to your squad.  This game has so much potential its a steal of a price right now if you buy into the alpha!			"

								It is a wonderful squad based game that has undertones of Japanese culture and Knights of the Old Republic. When the multi-threading and squad cap is removed is when the game will really shine as armies will no longer be behind a loading screen.One of the best Early Access games available hands down.			"

								I've put 300+ hours into this game; and really enjoied it. I've built towns, and found a bunch of bugs, but it is in alpha. I didn't buy it because I thought I would enjoy it, I bought it because I thought it was briliant, and diffrent from other games I've played, and that when finished, it would be a truely great game. The only other games I've put more time into are Fallout 3 & nv, oblivion and skyrim. Kenshi is tough, and unforgiving, and very unkind; but a great challenge if you can manage to survive. the ammount of times my squad has run into multiple battles on the way to another town, and had to run to the gates to just barely escape. Having friends is good, espicially in kenshi.			"

								This, at the moment an early access indie game, is an RPG game with elements of RTS. You can play this game as one character, or play it as a group (at the moment maximally 20 peoples).None of your characters will be ""unbeatable"". Even your main character is just a man - and in the beginnings practically everyone will be better.Usually I start the game in hardest mode. Totally naked, with bad arm and a STICK. Yes - I can survive somehow... The best way how to show that any character can die is to give a preview of my game:I got around six peoples group and went from city to city. I walked too close to Cannibal outpost, and all my group except one girl had been prisoned. I walk then with that girl, and found a band of samurai's. And I made her to walk with them... Then I ordered all the rest of the band, to try pick-lock their cage to get out. one by one I managed to get out... One of the cannibals started to attack to my first character - to the AssassinLV, they beated him up... And were eating my character... After time He managed to get out... But My band was beated up - again but still alive... Later I was close to the city - when bandits attacked on my band... After many attacks AssassinLV were dying... Then that girl - who was not kidnapped, I ordered her to save my character, cause he had the bag full of trade... She managed to prevent AssassinLV from dying, but also she was noticed by other group of bandits... Then she was dying... And no one could been able to save her... She died - cause she was saving the other......			"

								So, I've been playing for 20+ hours now and I can Say I love to hate this game.Its a good RPG or Town management game that you have to manage squads, hunger and resources.Only downside, is that there is a tonne of stuff that needs to be fixed.All good games do take that time of course but when you are trying to farm and get raided and crash as it auto saves will drive you mad.Pros: you will lose your squad mates, you will want to build more, you have the freedom to mod the game for your self. BUGS THAT CAN KILL YOU, and holy arsehats they hate anything non-humanCons: the game is still being made, it doesn't run smoothy at first but does after a while. FPS drops alot in new areas. BUGS THAT WILL KILL YOUR COMPUTER, and lack of playable races(without you adjusting some stuff in the game editor)It has a lot of content, Its a solid game, needs alot of work but I think it will be worth it in the end. Limit your self in this game to see if you can do well. And have fun waiting for your guys to heal in cages. "

								If you liked M&B you will love this. Bear in mind that being in alpha state the game has some issues like glitching, AI pathing conundrum, and squad members randomly forgeting what jobs you have assigned them. Apart from that the absolute freedom of gameplay is there. The grind to level up your skills is substantial as well but then again you feel a certain satisfaction when you hit that coveted threshold. I am looking forward to seeing this game bloom into its final release version.			"

Early Access Review
								I gave this game a negative review about a year ago. The reason for that was at the time, the game had stuff to do but doing any of it required you to travel across a vast and featureless desert. I played for two hours and most of that time was spent doing almost literally nothing. It was a slog. I didn't mind the difficult and unforgiving combat, and the lack of ranged options only put me off mildly. It was that wide open desert, that vast expanse of nothingness seperating all that juicy interesting content.I noticed Kenshi in my library recently, and knowing well that it's developer was dedicated to making this game, I clicked it to see what had changed in the last year between now and when I had written that first review. As a friend of mine said, Development had gone from slow to frantic in that space of time. The old boring map was scrapped in favor of a far more interesting landscape. I installed the game and upon booting and making my character, my eyes were met with far more than brown sand and nothingness. The landscape is clearly still a wasteland, but it is now filled with interesting flora and fauna, and dotted with the twisted metal wreckage of some long gone peoples. I actually WANT to see this new world that Kenshi's creator has put foreward. That alone is enough for me to turn a thumbs down into a thumbs up. Apart from that, the game also features several races and female characters now. Sneaking and theft are a thing. Ranged combat is still not planned except for as mounted crossbow emplacements, which irks me a bit but not badly. Some of the stuff I didn't get to see before has become more accessable thanks in part to a landscape which isn't ballachingly tedious and boring to cross. The UI is also a lot more attractive and fitting.As a final note from my new experiance with Kenshi, I entered a town and immediately some preist told me I was a ♥♥♥♥♥ and needed to repent the darkness in my heart. Also, Someone shouted that some bandit nearby was ""possessed by skeletons!"" I know that one of the races is called ""skeletons"" but at the same time, I find the concept very funny.			"

								my my where to begin... this game is over 9000% early access (strange bugs, horrible pathfinding, very little variety in anything, very few updates, so many unexplained crashes) and yet... it appeals to me like very few other games have. i mean when you first jump in the game is hard as diamond and as rough as sharks skin and more brutal than dark souls but i think it really sets the mood.the game takes place on some sort of desert planet full of bandit groups, thugs for higher and shabby towns. its survival of the fittest and you better hope you and your crew are fit to survive.Pros:-completely open ended gameplay (you want to murder and cage every npc in a particular town? if your characters are strong enough then by all means!)-super in depth damage system (some bandit breaks both your legs? prepare to crawl on home boy, and pray that you don't lose em!)-build your own town/outpost (for training, crafting, and trading)-lots of crafting to be done-super in depth character creation (can also be used on newly recruited characters)-indication on the hud on who is being aggroed allows the easy snapping to any battle situation no matter what you are doing with verry little load time (like if you have 3 units running weapons to a nearby town for trading when suddenly a group of bandits shows up to your town)cons:-some structures can not be deleted-its not entirely clear whether or not your machines are not working because you don't have any power or they are full of junk at first glance-some of the UI is cut off-fast forward not fast enough (i don't want to watch my guy with broken legs carrying tons of stuff and an unconscious ally inch along the barren desert for hours looking for a town with a bed)-beds are easily exploitable     -if you have no cash or the bed is not public you can just pick someone up and lay them on the bed and it just works        -you can place NPCs with bounties who are ""dying"" in beds to prevent them from kicking the bucket and as an added bonus they also won't take any ♥♥♥♥ from guards who will be aggroed on them until they are removed from the bed(s)-very peculiar bugs (one that comes to mind is my armor smith somehow getting a stack of 40000 iron plates and another stack of the same size in the container i was keeping them in when he only had time to make 40 or so of them and his AI constantly taking way more that the armor making station can hold and stopping work on armor production as a result)-SUPER ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PATHFINDING!- one of the towns has 2 gates however one of them is blocked by a poorly made hill or something and the pathfinding dictates that they exit the other gate and go all the way around the outer town wall just to get to where they are going.-super steep learning curve-amazingly slow pace-HaVOK physics engine makes ragdolls look silly (even the dev made fun of it on twitter)-strange bugs with carrying people some distance and later dropping them-job allocation not clear enough (and for the longest time i didn't even know it was a thing making for a lot of tedious micro management)if you don't mind bugs and don't have interest in any finished games at the moment: get itif you do mind bugs or are looking at other games that are complete: go get those other games! its early access (at the time of writing this its actually in alpha) its not done and many of the cons i listed may be fixed by the time it actually comes out. so for you guys i would just wait until then.

								A one of it's kind genre of a game. Open World RTS RPG ect ect. The work on the game is quite fast (considering the features added all the time) and was slowed down by a huge amount of work on Pathfinding, which is finally done. In the meantime, they've been adding animals, random insult generator, and all sorts of fun stuff to their dev build in preparation for the finished pathfinding. I found the game fun back in the earliest stages of alpha, without sound, great graphics, or any polish at all. It was buggy but fun then, now the bugs are fewer and the fun is far greater.The limitations for the game are slowly getting reversed, and the game is becoming more grand by the day, with lots of dev updates and supports. The community is still small, meaning it's a lot easier to get a message across to the devs if you are feeling concerned. Overall, this is my all time favorite strategy game, start the game with a stick and become a martial arts master who runs a fortress with well armed squad of companions who tear up all sorts of bandit life in the wastelands.The game is great, but it's only gonna get better from here!

Here´s my review:good graphics and setup. the character design and customization is neat, although I played zoomed out most of the time anyways. nice ideas and gameplay when it comes to base building and crafting. pretty good production chains. very nice concepts in this game. I love the post-apocalyptic-style of world design. atmoshpere-wise this really stand out.BUT... and there´s always a but it seems:( i know it´s early access , I get it. I never expected a finished game. it´s not that I bught it without having experience with other EA titles.)1. core mechanics not working or not working consistently enoughthis one is my main concern. workers forget their jobs, which means you end up a lot of micromanaging individual group members. also pathfinding and collision is a mess sometimes. even the workaround (which are offered, that´s a plus) don´t work consistently2. slow development cycles. the game is in development, which is nice. but so far I have experienced only one real update. the devs are in contact with the playersm which is nice. but I wonder how this game will ever pick up some momentum and gain some ground. basically from my standpoint, i couldn´t care less about great char graphics and player customization... thats all icing on the cake once its baked and finished to eat. but pathing, collision and AI behaviour is so essential for this kind of game that it needs to get taken care of asap. and when  Í read on the forums that some core game bugs are dependent on the actual game engine chosen for the game, I am prone to believe that maybe the have chosen the wrong engine....its been a good expense/reward scenario for me. I don´t mind spending the money as the time I played was great. but there´s no poin fo rme in keeping playing right now, because of the points mentioned before. keep in mind: it´s early access. so if you want to support the game and idea behind it (like I wanted to):buy it. its a good investment as the game itself will be sweet once it´s far more advanced. whenever that might be though...

I never expected a finished game. it´s not that I bught it without having experience with other EA titles.)1. core mechanics not working or not working consistently enoughthis one is my main concern. workers forget their jobs, which means you end up a lot of micromanaging individual group members. also pathfinding and collision is a mess sometimes. even the workaround (which are offered, that´s a plus) don´t work consistently2. slow development cycles. the game is in development, which is nice. but so far I have experienced only one real update. the devs are in contact with the playersm which is nice. but I wonder how this game will ever pick up some momentum and gain some ground. basically from my standpoint, i couldn´t care less about great char graphics and player customization... thats all icing on the cake once its baked and finished to eat. but pathing, collision and AI behaviour is so essential for this kind of game that it needs to get taken care of asap. and when  Í read on the forums that some core game bugs are dependent on the actual game engine chosen for the game, I am prone to believe that maybe the have chosen the wrong engine....its been a good expense/reward scenario for me. I don´t mind spending the money as the time I played was great. but there´s no poin fo rme in keeping playing right now, because of the points mentioned before. keep in mind: it´s early access. so if you want to support the game and idea behind it (like I wanted to):buy it. its a good investment as the game itself will be sweet once it´s far more advanced. whenever that might be though...

Early Access Review
								Update 10/07/15Kenshi has gone through a massive bug bash and is now far more playable than ever before. It is still missing the complete world map and still needs more content, but the majority of the bugs i mentioned in my review are now squashed! Kenshi has all the potential to be a great game, possibly even Warband great.At the moment it is fun but with no real longevity and a lot of bugs. This is to be expected in any Early Access game and as more content is added and the bugs are slowly squashed the game will only get better.Pros* A different play style - the world is cruel and you are but a grape waiting to be stamped on. (being beaten to a pulp by a group of starving homeless people with sticks, wearing pajamas is a cruel start to any game.)* Excellent damage system - limb damage and animations.* Base building (leads to CTD's at the moment but you can still experiment.)* The beginnings of an economy, with many items to purchase, craft and sell. (selling is a little bugged and not fully implemented yet.)* Open sandbox world - with the promise of many more biomes to come (currently there is only one flavor, desert!)Cons* Bugs glorious bugs! - CTD's every hour or so in the stable version, less to none with experimental, but a boat load of others such as NPC's getting stuck everywhere.* Without quests, faction relations and other planned features the game can get a little repetitive after 4-6hrs. (you will need to create your own adventure.)* Thrown in at the deep end - steep learning curve (can also be seen as a pro!)* Slow developmentMy main issue with Kenshi, and i believe the only reason you should not buy it if you like this type of game is the slow development speed. I cope with this because i really do believe in the devs and understand that this was a 1 man show for a long time and that this is their 1st project together. Everyone has to start somewhere! But because of this big bugs, such as the memory leaks and pathfinding are taking a long time to squash!So, should you buy Kenshi? If you like open world RPG squad management games... then it all depends how patient you are..... if you are not, then i would wait, there is an option on the Kenshi website to receive an email when the game is fully released.

								I'll write a short tale on how I became Hitler of Kenshi, the human experimenter.My journey began in wanting to be the world's greatest swordsman. So naturally I studied how to increase my combat skills. It says in the description of leveling up your combat skills, such as katana, dexterity, offense, and defence to fight stronger opponents than you in order to gain a bonus in leveling them. But, the obvious problem to that is when fighting stronger opponents you run a very high risk of dying. So I took on a passive approach. In the beginning I aggroed stronger mobs into friendly cities in order to maybe get a hit in between the crossfire. After the fighting was over I looted and bandaged the mob. Then I realised something, if the mob were not armed (because I looted them) they cannot fight back. Thus I learned a faster method to grinding my skills. Every once in a while I would get hurt so I ran to the local inn and rested my injuries. There I wondered, if I can rest my body faster this way, can I rest the bad guy's bodies? Of course I can. So I started making a human farm of looted enemies where I would beat them to unconsciousness, put them on a bed, then beat them to unconsciousness when they got better. But, the story doesn't end here. Later when I was building my village I noticed I can construct prison cages. What originally started out as a simple outpost for researching weapon crafting, turned into a human livestock factory of caged samurais and holy paladins where they would be beaten to unconsciousness every momment they are awake.tldr: I made a post-apocalyptic japanese concentration camp.9/10 (1- for the damn glitches, go finish the game)			"

								So at the time of writing this I only have 7/8 hours gameplay, and I can say that when I first play a game that I don't understand, I get frustrated, and find it crap unless I force myself to learn, Kenshi is the kind of game that you WANT to learn more about, it took me several new games to figure things out, find good trade routes, and eventually set up my own buildings.This game requires the very basic of common sense to get a grips of, and it rewards you for clever thinking, can't wait till the dev's add more and hopefully make this already brilliant sandbox game into something that everyone will want to play (I hope they add multiplayer at some point, you will understand why when you ply this game) at the current stage of EA 8.5/10 easily c:			"

								Update 2/20/2016:This has been a LONG time in the making, but the game has progressed nicely. Content is always coming and the game is looking amazing. The struggle to survive is real. Now with food and water being an issue, it's not quite so simple as scavenge what you can to sell and get better weapons and armor. Nope, now it's actually more surviving. Great game if you are looking something more realistic in terms of survival as in most things can kill you, and if it doesn't, it give you a broken arm/leg making the next thing so much more likely to. Highly recomended. This is a very cool and HARD realistic type game... which makes it AWESOME!!! Definately recommended!			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of the few early access titles I've not regretted picking up early. It delievers a decent level of content already with a lot more promised on the horizon, and it actually abides by the spirit of what early access is rather than just being a sort of super early preorder; the developer actually uses community feedback to determine what features to focus on.The game itself is also very engaging, but that's more a matter of personal preference. At its core it's primarily a sandbox game (and as far as I'm aware the first sandbox game to feature primarily desert, which strikes me as odd; think of the symbolism!), though at the moment it isn't as flexible as you'd expect a sandbox game to be. Even in early access, however, there is a decent level of easily accessible moddibility to be found. You can tweak and create weapons, NPCs, characters and even build NPC towns and modify the base mechanics of the game with a simple and relatively straightforward GUI.There is unfortunately not much more to say about the game at this stage because it is still early access and seemingly a long way off from release, which may be enough to put a lot of people off. Let me repeat because it can't be overstated: this game is made by an incredibly small team (it was a team of one for a long time) and it isn't likely to be finished in 2014, maybe not even in 2015. But it's already a fun game at its core if you like squad based RPGs or town building simulators or a mix of both, and it is steadily progressing. I also expect that over the coming year it'll start seeing some decent modding.			"

								To preface this review I would like to say,  ""I really did not want to rate this game negativly. I also understand the early access stance of the game"" It has a bold and unique style. And presents great ""Potential"" for gameplay. Many systems are implimented and more will be added. The game handles adventure and  the life of a wonder very well. These aspects will get even better with the new map. This is were my issue with the developers priorities come in. Far more resources need to go to bug fixing at the moment before adding new content. The second you start trying to build any mildly complicated base you will be in micro managing hell. Characters commonly get stuck  when depositing items into storage, get stuck under the stairs of buildings, randomly get their position confused and think they are outside a gate (this one is a little wierd), characters fill their inventories with ♥♥♥♥ when the container they are trying to hall to is full (I could probably fix this one if given access to the code. Check if their is space to stire the item in before allowing a character to pick up items from the original container. Items currently being hauled there by any any other character assigned to the task of auto hauling are counted into this total as well. They would still have issues if the player fills the container they are going to manually, but it is a start.), river raptors congregating at the base door and glitching through. Most of the issues involving characters being stuck can be fixed by reloading saving and loading the game. Until the game crashes as a result of this.			"

								A very fun and addictive game a cross between stratergy and survival game genre. You can choose diffrent sceneries to start your story all of which add diffrent difficulties and fun to the game for example one spawns you in the middle of a camp of cannibils in which your be knocked out and have to escape, Another starts you off with a bunch of freedom seekers wanting to start their own town with a few supplies to get you started. This game adds a lot of replayability and freedom it has a few bugs here and there but it has a lot of promise and in this stage i find the game very fun and addictive.  One of my favirote features is the body health feature which if a body part gets damaged too much it will effect how you move and behave like holding your stomach from being damaged in the torso or being damaged on the leg causes you to limp which adds a dramatic feel to the game trying to limp to safety to a town or your outpost from bandits. this game still gets updated and improved on and i'm excited about seeing the future content they are lining up for this gem of a game.

								Update: April 6, 2016The Beta landed on 4-1-16 (EST) and already there have been no less than nine (9) hotfixes. The map is long and dark and full of mystery. All of the game mechanics are being refined. I know it seems to be a bit assholish to declare one's self correct, but, I was right about this one. Kenshi is an absolute joy, even when it is killing me. Its difficult nature lends to its developing world. Its unforgiving nature challenges the Player in ways that almost make her quit. Yet, she can't. Because the world of Kenshi is so beautiful and full of challenge. I highly recommend this game.Update: March 31, 2016Gotta say, I am super psyched for the beta release that is incoming. I have logged at least 150 hours since I wrote about my initial reaction to the thing that is Kenshi. I say 'thing' because this game is quite unlike anything I have ever played before. Yet, it is something I have always wanted as a gamer ever since I can remember.It scratches an itch that I've had for years. It combines sand box with squads and squads with player characters. It merges tower defense with  world domination. Troop dispositions and enemy  patrols so seamless, you might have died and gone to Heaven. But no. There is no Heaven in Kenshi. You could build a haven though, if you live long enough...There are strange beasts that roam the lands, looking only to pick off your weakest squad member. Leviathans prowl the dunes searching for... I don't know what... Best hope your haven isn't in their path.There are roving bands of dispicable men who would surely cut your throat as soon as rob you.There are strange tribes of what once were people who seek only to sate their hunger in this wasteland. I have grown used to dealing with the Cannibals, but, I wonder what brings them this far South? A lack of meat, maybe. Or perhaps they wish to test me and mine's swords...The Lo-Fi folks have lovingly and diligently crafted an amazing game. I have had a ton of fun playing it over the years. Yes, development has been ""slow"". But, damn if it didn't develop!!!I wish nothing but the best for Lo-Fi and thank them for the amazing times I've had playing in their world.After only an hour and a half, I can say without a doubt that this charming game is a gem and one I will enjoy watching develop even further.There is some nicely layered gameplay here with the RTS styled squad-based combat, base building and research opportunities. I have only skimmed the surface of this game but I can already tell I have many hours of fun ahead as I develop my army, base and economy.With the currently ongoing STEAM sale of Kenshi, I'd recommend jumping in now to support the developer in bringing this game to fruition as the little online research I have already done reveals that there is much more fun to be had in the comming months!

								This concept is the best i've ever seen, hands down. Love it.INSTA FANBOY, of the concept!!!I'm not even going to list to many of the bugs and flaws...because it's still in an alpha/beta  stage,and has been so for a long time.7 years + mostly with one guy working on it.Biggest Cons imo are,Lack of Heavy armor types/skinsNo AXESNo Maces,hammersNo bows/ranged combat..is planed tho on the roadmap.lack of buildingsBuilding walls is so broken its sad after countless fixes over the years including the new beta build.Men building the walls bug getting stuck in place or just will not build them etc.Can run through walls.(will be fixed )Even with chase disabled your men will chase enemy and start to spread out across the landscape.Game needs a stand ground or hold postion option for squads.The lag is real,game needs to be optomized.The stuff that makes this game just Great.(really to much to list)You can set up bases anywhere you want and as many as you want.Have up to 30 men in your faction,you must arm them and train them(this number will go up during beta maybe,if not easy to mod or DL a mod off the workshop)Buy and sell  goods.NPC SHOPS WORKCan have pack animals so far Bulls are in gameCan have dogs.Craft yourself and your men swords and armor.Huge open would. check the roadmap on their website.(Google LO-FI games.)The combat  is good,lacks good sounds tho.You can hardly hear any combat sounds in general.Hard at first, after maybe 10 hours or less becomes a cakewalk till more things are added.(that is if your starting guy or men are built up enough and have not been KILLED!!!)Each of your men have about 40 or so skills,its pretty crazy that you can lv up.Lots of research trees to upgrade everything.PERMA DEATHImport to a new world(map) with your squad you had from other saves...Steam workshop-modsCreate mods with the FCS,comes with game.Overall tho this game is cool and worth the time.Play this games experimental build that way you can play with all the new stuff before it gets added into the ""stable build"" the games gonna crash no matter what build,so imo its better to see all that the game has in it.After playing on the new map a bit,94hrs+ so far...got to say its looking good lacks flat areas worth building a nice looking base.I give the games concept a 10/10  the build 7/10 so far. Worth the 20 bucks as there is nothing like this one.			"

								Kenshi, well well ok it took me about an hour to get into the game but when i did i have to say i love it, i like that you start out how you want to wether as a trader, a lone warrior or as a group of settlers looking for a new home. The trading system is very good and is part of the game that could really make it do great things. One word of advice for the creators though maybe you could include in the game that when currently looting dead or unconcious npc's you can take there clothing and swords and whatever items they are carrying but you can't touch there money, well how about in the next update we can loot there money aswell this would make the game more realistic which isn't a bad thing.

I would recommend this game to any one that enjoys games like xcom or the Total War series of games. The game features town building, tech research, farming, mining, smithing, squad building and lots of exploration and fighting.  There also seems to be a growing mod community for the game.			"

								Worth the money I found. Ive got most of the game figured out other then the exploring part. I stuck to mostly town building. After that I made an army of people and made my way north to get a better feel for the fighting part. I found it usefull if you build resting outposts were ever you wanna send troops. All in all though I have to explore the combat and the world map more. For now though im taking a break so I can come back to the game later with a bunch more updates. Even if it wasant updated anymore I would be fine with whats is working and done so far. Really easy squad management. A little buggy for plotting movments on world map but eventually you figure out that there is certain points that work. If  you try to really far spot on the map you squads might not make it. As for graphics I actually really like it. I always enjoy all the detail off how diffrent some of the areas look. Its nice that its not some generated map for once. Worth the price! Its a game that I know I will always play.			"

								This game has come a long way from its humble beginning. Even at the early stage it was very playable. Since then more features and improvements have been made. I like the fact that the dev does not rush things and in doing so I can see this game having a very large fan base when its finally completed. Its difficult to describe this game accurately as it contains many well thought out ideas. Its a great combination of things and because death comes swiftly to the unwary you actually start to care about each individual member of your group. They are vulnerable like any human and require training and experience. As this takes time you can get quite upset should one day your group get attacked by a large group of bandits and many members die or become seriously injured. Its this level of detail that makes the game so rewarding because you have to actually think rather than just throw a bunch of disposable, easily respawned soldiers into battle as you would in other RTS games. In Kenshi a human life is a valuable commodity.			"

								Kenshi is well thought out and being actively worked on with quick responses to bugs. There is a lot to look forward to and I can't wait to see how this game matures.  It is already quite enjoyable putting together a squad and leveling up. The character development, combat, crafting, and building have interesting mechanics which refect nuances of reality. The game can be paused and saved at any moment which makes it great for short stints or a weekend binge, but I often find it hard to quit.			"

								This looks really solid so far, some more shortcuts for common actions would be grand, but at this pace, I see that happening soon. The visual syle and presentation are rather grand, I can really appreciate the efforts at consistency in certain areas. I'd like to see more random stuff - civilians doing things, maybe cities slowly changing, more npc interactions. But the engine is all there for these improvements, it's just a matter of adding the content itself. I really hope this game does *not* getting a debug/cheating/modding system as there is quite a lot of enjoyment in comparing progress and seeing what the game is capable of - the scale so far is EPIC. Single, squad, and city elements are all coming together so well!			"

								One word comes to mind to describe Kenshi: CONTENT.There is LOTS of CONTENT. This game is like Skyrim mixed with Total War mixed with Fallout mixed with Rust mixed with Divinity:Original Sin. With the totality of CONTENT from that mixture.No multiplayer - atrocious performance - crashes galore - blatantly unfinished downright pre-alpha ""tech demo"" feel - ugly visuals - buggy as all hell - frustratingly unforgiving and difficultAnd yet I keep playing. If you are an intelligent, patient, PC-tech-literate, determined gamer, you will find a real gem here. You just gotta dig REAAAAL deep.Did I mention you need patience? Lots of patience.VERDICT: Buy the F*** out of this game right now. Stop reading reviews and just buy it - you MUST experience the enigmatic contradiction that is Kenshi			"

								It took me a long time to decide to buy Kenshi a year ago or so. I was really intriged by this game I've never heard of before and that poping up in my steam suggestions. After reading some reviews and watching some gameplay videos I decided to risk a 20$ on this wierd looking game. Had this game for a while now. And I can say I really really like the skill system. It's a lot of fun to start with your weak-♥♥♥ squad and struggle to build a settlement that will survive a starving bandits raid. I had my main character becoming a martial art expert by kicking my bandit prisoners' asses on a daily basis. Said prisoners in return improved their defence skills, making it more chalenging for my character. Profit. I gave them little names.Of course the game is still in developpement and new features are still appearing and bugs are getting fixed as time passes, so I don't really mind if it's not as polished as you would expect from regular game. The gameplay is lot of fun, once you understand what the hell is going on, and the universe/lore of the game is truly unique and fascinating. I did not regret buying it.			"

Early Access Review
								Kenshi hates you and will punish you for every terrible thing you’ve done in your life.It will sometimes bring its wrath down upon your unsuspecting character right out of the gate and other times it will bide its time, waiting and watching you as you build up your perfect village, before it crushes you into the sand of its hauntingly beautiful world.And that’s just one of the reasons it’s so great.At its core, Kenshi is an open world group survival simulator. You begin the game with up to five characters and your goal is to keep them alive, heck maybe even try to get them to prosper in the Japanese themed post-apocalyptic world. This is by no means easily done – your characters start out pitifully weak and even a starving bandit can (and will) beat you half to death on his way to the shop before leaving your broken mewling body lying in the sand hoping you don’t bleed to death. Which brings us nicely onto death. Losing in a fight doesn’t mean death in Kenshi, it means you’re left lying in a pool of blood. Often you’ll recover on your own and limp painfully away but even if you don’t, all you need is a single member of your group to get back to his feet and he can then run around giving medical aid to everyone. Assuming you have a medical kit. You really should have a medical kit.With your character created (from a selection of origins, ranging from easy to hard – though easy isn’t all that easy) you can choose what you want to do. Do you want to hunt down bandits, loot them and sell their gear? You can do that. Rid the world of cannibals? That too. Become a trader, ferrying goods from town to town or even start your own village to try and make your way in the world.Whichever option you choose there will be a host of enemies that want to stop you achieving your goal and they will descend upon you time and time again. Interestingly, the initial point of the game is the hardest – being poorly equipped and rubbish at everything means that anyone passing can mug you. As the game progresses you hire additional mercenaries and gain skills, perhaps a fortified town with nitro-powered crossbows all around the walls; which means that the difficulty curve is strangely reversed – the game starts hard but becomes much easier later on.Despite its roleplaying open world sandbox style, the game which Kenshi struck me as most similar to was X3 (Not X4. That was a travesty) in that you are provided with a world where you may live however you want to, and expand to become whatever you want.The graphics of the world are nice if a little sparse. The world is a barren desert and there’s little to see when travelling from one town to another. At first this sets the mood quite nicely in that it’s a barren world that’s harsh and unforgiving, but this feeling drains away after a while since there’s little change and not a lot happening. There are bandits, traders, cannibals, and all sorts of factions, but no other signs of life – I’d have liked to have seen something like mutated scorpions, giant radioactive yaks, or even an occasional cow to give the world more life. Additionally the user interface is extremely basic in looks if not function – I’d very much like to see a more graphical interface rather than the generic default grey boxes.This is Alpha though, and there is a brand new world on its way with new biomes and, hopefully, wildlife that will serve to bring the world to life.Progression is through doing. There are a host of skills related to survival and combat and each skill is improved by doing work in that skill – the Engineer skill, for instance, is improved by building things. There are also three stats; strength, toughness, and agility, and these too are improved by doing things related to the stat – Toughness is increased by getting your face kicked in.Sound is still somewhat lacking; there is a pleasant music track throughout but ambient sounds – the hum of generators or creaking of windmills – is noticeably missing.I definitely recomend this game but, if you do get it, prepare to spend some time looking at your character whimpering and  gushing vital fluids.

								An amazing game of epic proportions.This game is not without flaws, first of all. If you have a slow computer or laptop you should expect frequent freeze-ups and even crashing. If you have a decent driver and a decent computer then you should be fine.Onto the good things, this game is incredibly difficult, you'll die or lose several times before you develop a gameplan to make it. Not to mention when you step into this game you'll be surprised to find yourself in an alien land both familiar and mysterious, you'll probably explore far enough to realize the inevitable nature of oneself. You are mortal, you are weak, and you are nothing compared to the beasts and residents of this land. You can be captured, imprisoned, enslaved, and you can break away from slavery and wander until you find a method of removing the binds.There is a silver lining though, being taken down isn't always the end, many roaming guards and factions will patch you up if they see you, other times your wounds may heal themselves and the more you get beat, the tougher you get. So being a legendary ninja or samurai is still possible.			"

								Best purchase I've made on steam thus far, the amount of joy you can get from this game is incredible and only seems to get better and better with each update from the dedicated developers. Only way I can describe it is it kind of feels like what if there was a single player version of Star Wars Galaxies and it jumped into bed with Mount & blade. The offspring would be a little bit like this. It can run a bit slow at times even on my beasty machine but that's just the Engine of the game but the future sounds promising for improving that side of the game and well... everything else is just a crazy joy amount of depth and you will lose track of what time it is with this beautiful rare gem of a game.It's also rare nowadays to see not so heavily funded developers staying focused without getting too sidetracked with other less important things and thus swaying off the original path of importance. Money well spent in both departments. Me having a lot of fun and devs getting what they deserve.			"

								This is gonna be an painfully honest review. This is just my opinion of the game. Honestly I personally like the game, it's entertaining. So that may make me bias but let's just put the genera things about this game out there.1. It's a sandbox game.  Meaning there is no purpose, no goal, no direction what so ever. As that may be it's a pain in the *** to start. The game will rip you the hell apart in a second and you will have to tough it out. There's been times where i just started up and got killed for no reason. You'll have ""what the f--k"" moments by galore and it may just ♥♥♥♥ you off. Talking of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off this leads to the next thing perfectly.2. The bugs. Not just one or two bugs either. Just to name some you have people walking through your walls, bandits spawning as giant group in your base, your guys walking off, randoms guards attacking, yadda yadda yadda. Theres a good amount of bugs but thats just a warning. I would go on but i think you get the picture. If you have a calm head you may be able to stand this. If not then don't get it. Go play something else. The game is overall fun, but also makes a good rage bait. I like it personally but i would not recommend getting it just yet.			"

								Hi, this game would be really great if we could have a purpose of playing it a bit more(I am demanding player), like having stronger agressive foes, not simply roaming-patrolling empires but grinding, expanding (at a reasonable rate tho).Building a town is an achievement for me, but it's so peaceful when you reach that point. I know it's 0.9X, and a lot of work still going. This could be to me one of best RP/RTS game if it has more devs because yeah, the project is real and lacks of workers I'd say.as a fantasy it could be funny to see undeads and necromancer wandering at night to make a use of all these starving bandits corpses lolthere already is a lot of work we can feel it, but keep going please !!!

								Currently in alpha however shows amazing features for any patient veteran player that seeks a challenge.DownSideLimited things to do other then fighting,trading,building a town.UpSideThe graphics are nice.There is alot of types of weapons and armor also vanity items.You can build your own town and reaserch things while holding off raiders who discovered you and trading in towns.You start as a no body and with ALOT of effort you can work your way up to being a powerful warrior.True sandbox feel.The game punishs rash actions and rewards the patient thinker.20-30 hours of content in a earlie alpha.All in all a game that is brilliant for it's cost and i can't wait for more content.

								Started with a few people, made a bunch of wheat farms, and established a bread factory. After fending off tons of overly hostile beaked giraffes and endless patrols of king kong, finally got some walls and made a pretty respectable town. Every once and a while, characters would get stuck and glitch on many items (terrain, buildings, enemies)... all solved by picking up the char with another char and putting them back down (some kind of reset)All glitches aside, things were going great. Never mind the random spawning of ♥♥♥♥♥ons of cannibals and hostile wildlife that made my characters constantly stop and battle (inside town walls). I ended up making 500k running my bread factory and selling excess armor/weapons from the smithy. SO I decided I would set out with my fairly rugged, well laboured, farmers and see what hell I could raise. I walked not even 200ft to see a char get stuck. WELL I try my normal technique of using another char to pick up char... etc. Hrm WHAT IS THIS!?Somehow, I managed to get no one unstuck and my entire squad stuck instead. Then my autosave kicks in...As I'm trying to problem solve...My previous hard save was from over 4 hours ago. I feel like I just lost time in my life I will never get back. Overall, very fun addicting concept, but with multiple years in, you'd think they would have character pathing and tracking down. "

It has evolved a lot since I bought it last year and looking at the future updates it excites me even more to see this game finished. It is a good mix of sandbox, open world, strategy with rpg elements. The world is vast and it will even be more vast, with different kinds of creatures and biomes, in the coming updates. 11/10			"

They overhauled this game to what it seems to come back to the same conclusion, it's unplayable. The bugs, performance issues will slowly if not instantly ruin your game (mind you that this game is a grind, bugs and show stoppers will wash away hours of work). They have been adding to this game which is great but they still have yet to deliver something that's playable. Most of the previous positive reviews were more than likely from the previous build which was more playable to an extent***The game itself will be a masterpiece if its ever finished but thats where I give it a negative review, it felt almost complete before the overhaul now it feels like its taken a few steps back but with even more depth and with the scale I'm wondering if it will every be completed. I'd grab it on sale or hold off, its one of those games that wow you, you play, the bugs and un-optmized feel have you back shelf the game to only revisit.

								This game has a big potential and is already lots of fun. The main music theme is beautiful.One point I like in particular about games is character customization and this game has alread plenty of it already. Besides facial features, you can even adjust the height, boob size and shape and many other things for every group member, let alone all the clothing and equipment you can buy. Fighting is fun and somewhat realistic. You are not a super hero fighting off a group of enemies on your own. Building a base already works really well and is interesting. Although this game is far from being finished, it will be amazing once it is done.			"

								FIrst off, I have had this game for a good many years now; It has progressed so greatly that I feel proud when I play it now. Proud for the developers and proud of how I have learned the ins and outs of this game. This game started out pretty basic, just lots of sand dunes and hungry bandits everywhere. Slowly, a game started to appear out of the haze. Building towns, getting invaded, shop counters (still kind of broken, oh well) and then cannibals. Gotta love cannibals! Now the map expands and there are new places to uncover. I recently uprooted from one area into Holy nation land (Although they hate me) once I had a devoted military group. I have a base in on an island sorrounded by rivers and the holy nation must cross the water to get to me... Which is no easy feat while getting hit by mounted crossbows =)This game will kick your ♥♥♥ hard though. I started out in a setting that gives you a veteran soldier who is hated by the biggest faction in the game currently. It gave me a springbox to move forward though. I worked up his stealth and was able to kidnap a holy nation soldier in camp and use his armor as a disguise to get into their cities. Oh there are also raptors and giant turtles to kill and eat11/10			"

								Do you like The SIms, or squad based RPGs in general (games where you can control multiple characters or individual ones each with their own skills, and statistics)Do you like Ninjas? Have you ever wanted to play a sims type game in a ninja / samurai filled apocalyptic world?this is the game for you, its a bit rough around the edges still, and sometimes the glitches can be quite frustrating But with the bad out of the way this game is a master class game that you should try. Favorite parts: The game plays without you and your characters are not ""heroes"" they are probably weaker than almost anyone you can encounter.. however they have the ability to grow depending on what you do. The game will not need you to start events, or to stop them. You are more of a drop of water in a big puddle. You can influence and affect what happens.. if a big band of bandits shows up at a city your base is near, they can take out the guards and shops, effectively neutralizing the town. Later a travelling group of lawmen might take it back.. either way, even if you could have changed the outcome, the game keeps playing. Your characters have stats in almost everything. if you want yout character to be stronger, give him or her a lot of heavy equipment and have them run around. Eventually their strength will increase. Speed is the opposite, have someone run around without anything in their bags and they will become more athletic and therefore faster. Laboring from mining, or smelting. Crafting from weapon or armor smithing. Medicine from healing. The characters become increasingly valuable as time goes on..The fact that you  can plop a town wherever you want, build walls, turrets, arm your soldiers with swords and armor and have your builders be guarded and automated with designated tasks is beautiful. Kenshi is absorbing, Rough, Frustrating, Comically suprising and has the potential to be an amazing game. Id say get it.. try it, support the devs and enjoy the process of their creation  "

								FIrst off, I have had this game for a good many years now; It has progressed so greatly that I feel proud when I play it now. Proud for the developers and proud of how I have learned the ins and outs of this game. This game started out pretty basic, just lots of sand dunes and hungry bandits everywhere. Slowly, a game started to appear out of the haze. Building towns, getting invaded, shop counters (still kind of broken, oh well) and then cannibals. Gotta love cannibals! Now the map expands and there are new places to uncover. I recently uprooted from one area into Holy nation land (Although they hate me) once I had a devoted military group. I have a base in on an island sorrounded by rivers and the holy nation must cross the water to get to me... Which is no easy feat while getting hit by mounted crossbows =)This game will kick your ♥♥♥ hard though. I started out in a setting that gives you a veteran soldier who is hated by the biggest faction in the game currently. It gave me a springbox to move forward though. I worked up his stealth and was able to kidnap a holy nation soldier in camp and use his armor as a disguise to get into their cities. Oh there are also raptors and giant turtles to kill and eat11/10			"

								Do you like The SIms, or squad based RPGs in general (games where you can control multiple characters or individual ones each with their own skills, and statistics)Do you like Ninjas? Have you ever wanted to play a sims type game in a ninja / samurai filled apocalyptic world?this is the game for you, its a bit rough around the edges still, and sometimes the glitches can be quite frustrating But with the bad out of the way this game is a master class game that you should try. Favorite parts: The game plays without you and your characters are not ""heroes"" they are probably weaker than almost anyone you can encounter.. however they have the ability to grow depending on what you do. The game will not need you to start events, or to stop them. You are more of a drop of water in a big puddle. You can influence and affect what happens.. if a big band of bandits shows up at a city your base is near, they can take out the guards and shops, effectively neutralizing the town. Later a travelling group of lawmen might take it back.. either way, even if you could have changed the outcome, the game keeps playing. Your characters have stats in almost everything. if you want yout character to be stronger, give him or her a lot of heavy equipment and have them run around. Eventually their strength will increase. Speed is the opposite, have someone run around without anything in their bags and they will become more athletic and therefore faster. Laboring from mining, or smelting. Crafting from weapon or armor smithing. Medicine from healing. The characters become increasingly valuable as time goes on..The fact that you  can plop a town wherever you want, build walls, turrets, arm your soldiers with swords and armor and have your builders be guarded and automated with designated tasks is beautiful. Kenshi is absorbing, Rough, Frustrating, Comically suprising and has the potential to be an amazing game. Id say get it.. try it, support the devs and enjoy the process of their creation  "

								1.9 hours in(at the time of this review), I think its safe to say this game is worth it. After reading through the planned features on the main website, its clear the devs have  the potential to make this game a success.Its true, the start is hard. Especially if you're playing on rock bottom like me. But in time, each hour you survive, you get stronger and faster. While not being too powerful, this game teaches you how to be smart and humble. Don't be fooled by that herd of goats wandering aimlessly. To give you a visual of what its like in Kenshi, here's my first playthrough.>naked dude walking around>see group of people in the distance>'hello friends!'>nope, slavers.>'don't think about running!' 'C'mere meat!'>at first it was just one guy>whole squad joins in>1 blow to the head>KO>unconcious for 400 seconds>wake up>hungry, broken arm, bleeding head>reach lone shack>broke>see iron resource>its mining time!>8 ingame hours later>fed and recovering>mine some more>get iron stick>stats increase while mining(str and labour)>see goats>prepare to get sacrficed to okran! >whole herd attacks me>dying>in lone shack>some guy picks me up>im saved!>lolnope.gif>throws me outside>die outside of lone shack>endThats how exciting my life was in Kenshi. All in all, worth it.			"

								It's a very good game and i love it very much. Have some bug but it's not problem, you can handle it. The dev make this game success with the concept: make a character, be a slave or leader on your community (RPG Mode, one of the choice mode in game), make a building, grow your community, give them some job or controlling them all, be a mad so you have a bounty and make sure you have to survive from the crazy world, be hunter or hunted. And one thing, make sure to save the game often because nobody know's who is coming for you to kill and robbed you.			"

								Game has some of the best potential i've seen in a game in a very long time but that's all it is at this stage.. Potential.For a game that has been in progress for such a long time it should be much more stable than it is.4 hours of fun quickly turned into an hour of nightmare as it repetitively crashed, even with a new character and save file.

								This game was my first ever EA game which i bought about 4 years ago. It had already been in development for a few years before that. Im worried that when it finally gets released we will all be living in space and no one will have a computer old enough to run it.			"
