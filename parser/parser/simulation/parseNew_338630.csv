												Pretty decent animal game, I'm 20 and still love animals and it's hard to find stuff anymore that doesn't take billions of hours of commitment. Though I do have to mention that the game has a few bugs. Though I do enjoy mushy animal games, I am still a gamer. This being true, I like to do everything possible that I'm not supposed to do. So here's something you might want to fix: I was walking along and saw a Hyena. I really like Hyena's they're my favorite animals, I noticed I could not interact with it, so I left it alone. Upon further examination I realized you could buy a tranquilizer gun, so being the little idiot I am, I decided to use it on the Hyena. Well I got the Hyena, but I don't think I was supposed to.Shortly after I was bringing the Hyena back, I kept getting a notification saying the camp was mad because I had too many animals and had to release some. I'm thinking this might be a product of me doing something I wasn't supposed to. As soon as I got to camp my game crashed. I broke it. I broke the game. I can't get back on. Please save me.Also please add more animals! If not a branch off game, or an expansion would be really cool! I haven't gotten too far, but correct me if they're already there. I'm guessing the theme is obviously african animals, and I think some wonderful additions would be: Crocodiles, African Wild Dog, Secretary Bird (even though that's just me wishing lol), Rhinoceros, Red River Hog (god I love them),  and Baboon.I've made it far enough to see: Zebra, Gazelle, Leopard, Lion, Giraffe, Elephant, Chimpanze, Hippo. Not sure if there are any more, but I hope so when I fix my broken game.			"

												-- This game is intended for a younger audience --Despite its target age group, this is a cute, fun little title. (Emphasis on cute!)I was looking for a calm, relaxing game to play where you get to interact/take care of animals, and this definitely delivers. The animals are really cute, and you get to interact with them by bathing them, feeding them, treating their ailments and eventually training them and releasing them back to the wild.This isn't really a title you should consider if you're looking for a challenging game, as it is directed at a younger/kid audience, and its primary feature is more about exploration and husbandry. The graphics hold up nicely, both the human models and animal models look good. The animals are absolutely adorable.The UI/movement is a little dated and sometimes clunky, but not in a significant enough way to ruin the experience.If you want a relaxing, no-pressure game where you get to wander around exploring and taking care of cute animals, this game ticks all the boxes. :) "

												This is an awesome game! When I first opened the game, I thought it would only be about healing animals. Which, most games like this are. But no, you get to care for the animals (feeding, watering, petting, grooming, and cleaning hooves if applicable) and you also have to train them! Once you trained them all the tricks possible (you have to unlock them all, first) you can release them to either the Savannah, the Songutu Forest, or the Kingo Swamp based on where the animal lives. I recently found out that you can name the animals and even dress them up or give them 'haircuts'. Wildlife Camp is more in depth than I thought it would be. I'd give it a 10/10! I totally recommend this, the game is way underpriced and it should be worth about $20! If you love animals and/or you would love to be a veterinarian and an animal caretaker, Wildlife Camp won't disappoint you!			"

												It's a repetative, simple, not hard to understand game, and it's definitely not meant for an older audience. I played this when I was a child and I loved the heck out of it, so if you're looking to get this for a small child? Go on ahead. But if you're older and you just love tycoon or simulation games involving animals...? Find something different.			"
