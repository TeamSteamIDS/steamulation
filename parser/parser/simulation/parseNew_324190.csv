								This is the kind of game where I wish I could vote neutrally on it. It has amazing potential but is an extremely risky purchase. I've been a programmer for a few years now (C, C++, C#, Java, Python) and I'd love to see this game developed further.I love these sandbox type games with a passion. There's no point to them other than the points you give it. The spell creating and testing CAN be incredibly fun, but at the moment, it's limited. Currently, everything you do costs certain amounts of mana. Since everything costs so much mana, there's no way to create 90% of the awesome looking spells I saw in the trailers and previews. I feel kinda gyped.It's a risky purchase because this game can go either way: Blow up with popularity or fall into obscurity. If it blows up with popularity, the producers will probably put more effort into it and create it faster. If it falls into obscurity, the producers are likely to abandon it. I can easily see this game going either way.There's so little to do in the game, even for a sandbox game, that it's not really worth it yet. All you can do is move rocks around and make the ground go up or down. I love the spell creating system and this in and of it self could make the game, but it doesn't. I can see a lot of potential for it in future builds, but there's not much to it at the moment.I'd say the worst part of this game so far is the extremely limited implementation of the current spell design. You can only do certain things with either code or block-code. I often find myself having to do long, complicated work-arounds for some of the simplest things I want to do, increasing the cost of the spell and diminishing the full capacity of it. And some of the things I want to do are completely impossible.So far, in the current build, I would not recommend it. This review was done on 2/5/2016 on version  0.510c. If you're reading this far into the future with a much later build, then it might be better, but so far, I'm not impressed.			"

								Day 1:As I walk through this mysterious land, I try to better understand my power over the elements. Simple things like moving the earth and water come to me easy enough. But I am trying to further develop my skills, and create more and more complicated spells with which to manipulate the environment around me. Day 2:Today I decided to hone my fire magic. This of all the elements requires a high degree of control. After much trial and error, I was able to create a new spell where fire orbs spin around me, and then I can release them all at once at a specific target. As these orbs leave me, I am able to twist them around a bit until they impact. Day 3:As my journey has only just begun, I decide to use my teleport ability to explore this land some more. Although I initially thought myself alone, I stumbled across a few creatures who at once began to charge at me. Quickly, I teleported a safer distance away, but the creatures continued to come at me. Not wanting to do harm to these animals, I chose to magically dig a trench between myself and them. My journey has only just begun, and I wonder what is in store for my future…[So far really enjoying this game. It has a lot of potential, and can’t wait to see more abilities and air magic to be released. On low graphics settings, the spell making menu has the controls graphic all pixelated. When checking the code for a specific spell, the menu at the bottom is pixelated as well. This is only a minor issue, and likely has an easy fix for our low-end computer users. Looking forward to creatures, more plants, and possibly multiplayer/npc’s. They might end up going in a minecraft direction due to having seed generated worlds, but more focused on crafting magic.]			"

								I have been in the game since a relatively early alpha and honestly there is no other game quite like it. If you like the ability to truly build things, from the ground up, there is no more impressive game out there. Now I have to warn you, this is early access:1. Not all of the abilities that will be in the  game are there yet.2. Multiplayer is not yet there, but is on the way, and oh man am I excited.3. The developers are working really hard on this and are some of the most communicative developers I have encountered. Just check out the forums. A_lomo is the guy coding all of it and has a significant chunk of the posts there.What it comes down to is this: This game has given me the opportunity to be a wizard and it only gets better. Who wouldn't want that.			"

								Truly the most advanced coding game in existence, CodeSpells allows you to become the wizard YOU'VE always wanted to be, not the one that the game developers think you should be. Instead of being stuck with a bunch of pre-made spells with very limited possibilities, you get to make your own spells from scratch. Thanks to Blockly, CodeSpells' spell-building interface, it's very easy to build complex spells that do things no one has ever even imagined before! Better still, Blockly is an excelent introduction to programming without having to learn all the complicated syntax that is involved. It's the perfect way for an aspiring game developer to start learning to program while having the time of their lives!			"

								CodeSpells is currently in a very early alpha. Don't buy it if that's not your cup of tea. Aside from that, the premise of the game is one that practically everyone has wanted since they were little kids: you're a wizard and you make your own spells. And it is AWESOME.The game's physics system is impressive, allowing players to create rock-tornados, unleash torrential bursts of water, part seas, and - of course- hurl fireballs to and fro. Spells can are created with programming logic: a few predefined functions give players a place to start (OnCreate and OnHit, for example) and effects can be added by controlling certain variables (spell movement, lifetime, etc) and logic (if then statements, loops, functions, etc).Is there a lot of content? No. Is it a cool game? Absolutely. The concept is amazing and the execution is impressive. If you want to see the game's development progress, I highly recommend buying it now. If you don't want to chance it, check back every so often and see how it's grown! It just might win you over later on.			"

								CodeSpells is an interesting and unique game. The power to devise your own magic, limited only by the physical rules of the universe and your own imagination, is a truly unique experience.  The art style and music are very charming and draw you into the world from the start.The first time you wander around and use a simple push spell to launch a little red dinosaur into the sky, you will feel a sense of awe of the possibilities. Then you get a spark of an idea and bring up the spell menu.  At first, you may be a little daunted by the Block-based language used to construct the spells. But after some guess and test and a little bit of practice, you will soon be creating all kinds of magic! From jumping on a rock and causing it to float and lift you off the ground, to building structures and terraforming the world around you, to changing the ebb and flow of water around you, to manipulating the elements around to ignite massive fires.I have been playing/tinkering with CodeSpells since its earliest Kickstarter Alpha release and have seen it evolve a lot since then. Currently, there are a limited number of options of what you can control in the world around you, primarily:  Create physical connections to objects in the world, pushing and pulling them in any direction  Raise and lower the terrain around you  Add/Remove water from the world, and change its direction of flow  Increase and decrease the heat level of the environment  Increase and decrease the humidity of the environment  Create an explosion  Teleport yourself to another location  Complex control over the movement of your spell orbs  Create a chain reaction by casting another spellThese may seem very basic and trivial, but the combination of simple logic and these abilities provides an enormous amount of variability in the awe and potency of your magic. One of my favorites is a very simple spell that leviates boulders and allows you to fly around in stylePros:  A game like no other, devising magic only to the limits of your imagination  Nice graphics, with a unique, charming style  Teach your children to program, while playing a fun and engaging game.  MAKE YOUR OWN MAGIC!Cons:  Somewhat limited number of magical abilities at this time, but they will increase as the game is developed further  Combinations of magic types can be a little confusing for construction and organization of multi-element spells  Some of the blocks for building spells don't provide enough granularity of control, limiting scope a bit  There are a few relatively minor graphical glitches in the game on lower quality settingsDespite the few issues of the game, the development team has been extremely receptive to ideas and suggestions by users and there have been many improvements as a result of backer feedback.Overall, I highly recommend CodeSpells.  No other game gives you a charming world that is both fun and engaging for creating your own magic. As an added benefit, you will learn/improve basic programming skills that are directly transferrable to the real world.			"

								I've been playing this game for a good amount of time now. So hopefully this review helps those who are interested. CodeSpells is a pretty awesome game. That alone is an understatement. I was an Alpha and Beta tester so I got to see it progress, and I've had a good amount of playtime.The game runs well and to be honest I find it very unique. I love the idea that I can create practically anything I want. The game is still improving by the way. Multiplayer, Modding tools, and more are on the way according to the devs. The developers update the game pretty frequentlyy. I'm an active member on their forums and I even recall one of the devs making a hot-fix for just one player who complained about an individual issue. The devs are super approachable on the forums and are active. Likewise, the community around this game is great. It's small but growing. Everyone on the forums is willing to help. Whether it be with programming/spell casting or technical issues. Additionally, the community has created some pretty awesome spells on the forums. Most all of these spells have detailed instructions, many with pictures, on how to create/code them. I would recommend this game. It's already pretty awesome, and it's only going to get better. If you have any technical issues with it, head to the forums. You'll get a response promptly.			"

								Games that tackles magic were always  my favorite, but I sometimes get dissapointed with them either because the magic system in them was like a ""bonus mini-game""/a bit incomplete or it was useless. This game fixes that allowing you to create you own spells that do whatever you want and adds a  randomly generated open world on top. It runs pretty well even on my crappy laptop with an i3(some old forgotten generation) and an AMD HD 7650m . Besides coding graphically with blockly, I also love the fact that I can write code for spells using javascript in an rudimentary IDE they built in the game, tough it lacks auto-complete and I have no ideea what methods/classes I can use(guess I'll have to read the documentation on that one). All in all it's a game I don't regret buying and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.			"

Early Access Review
								NOTE: This review was made for an earlier version of the game and I haven't kept up on the progress of it, so this review may be outdated in terms of current game content.I don't really understand why the game is getting the reviews it is. I understand it's early access, but there are a lot of things that should have been done from the get-go from a design perspective.  Here is a list of problems I have with it. - One of the first things I noticed is that there's no infinite loop checking, and you can easily lock up you game by making one. Well, at least with JS, and on that note it could just be a JS issue that Blockly detects but I honestly can't be arsed to check. That not being implemented (for the JS, at least) really shows what kind of game these guys are making, one focused on final results rather than code implementation. For me, this is a big red flag, even though it might seem trivial or nothing at all to someone else. If it is in this state because it was released too early, then don't release it until it's ready for players to test. I am entirely certain that some prodigious beginner programmer has at one point crafted a beautiful spell just to have it be destroyed with a game-freezing accidental open loop that they can't fix. - Even if one does get far enough into the game as to be able to freeze it like that, the UI feels... unresponsive. I found it difficult to find specific functions In the Blockly editor, and what little time I spent with the interface felt unintuitive and haphazard. Orb creation isn't even called that, rather it's listed as casting another spell... While this makes sense logically based on how the game works (one orb per spell), my first instict was to look for ""Create orb"" or similar. Even Multimedia Fusion does it better. - The JS editor is okay, and has a number of simplistic IDE-like features, such as syntax highlighting, simplistic realtime syntax and error checking, and the occasional autocomplete, but the clunkyness and unresponsiveness of the UI still really hampered the experience. Also I wasn't able to find any select all option, to copy it into something that didn't suck to edit, and the mouse selection works when it wants to. To boot, there was no proper error console for all I could find; errors would just pop up at the bottom of the screen, with a surprising lack of information related to the error. Having an actual console like nearly every other programmable game would be nice, guys. - There is a code converter that converts Blockly code blocks into JS... This leads me to believe the code blocks actually just generate JS on the fly, which makes me wonder why you can't do the reverse (i.e. JS to Blockly). You also can't edit the generated JS without making a new spell and copy-pasting it. There isn't even a button to do this on the code generation pane, so you'd have to repeat that process for every spell you want to add a little JS flair to. - There is a distinct lack of proper low-level documentation. Sure, there are some help prompts [in the Blockly interface] and plenty of explanatory beginner spells [also mostly in the Blockly interface], but all of that is just as haphazard as the rest of it. There is no documentation for a number of JS functions that, according to numerous spells posted on their forums, a number of people use regularly. There is no one central place to read about how these functions work, and one of the functions relies on understanding of the underlying Unity framework (it evaluates UnityScript) and how the CodeSpells world is set up programmatically (you can access the game scene from the US scape, which isn't that super unsafe???). At least if you don't want to use those functionalities, there's not a ton of different things to learn and the beginner spells keep it relatively simple, so a new player won't feel overwhelmed...? I guess?? - Mana (right? that's what it's called? I forgot already) drain doesn't really make much sense, and there's absolutely zero feedback on what takes what mana and by how much. You can't mix together mana usage very well, either; too little of whatever primary source your spell is assigned to, and it just flat out won't work. You can't change the type of a spell without -- again -- copy-pasting it into a new spell. Nothing but clunk. Maybe this was meant to introduce some challenge and mystique into the game, some guesswork on what will work and what won't. However, code doesn't work like that and will either yell at you or crash silently if you do something wrong. I doubt the game will hold your hand when you try to make this awesome spell to find that it takes way more mana than you even have available to you, and it hurts more knowing that it could have helped you out earlier, saying ""hey this costs 100 so don't use it more than twice"", but that doesn't happen. I really rarely used the Blockly interface, so excuse me if this is actually implemented and I just didn't see it because I only used the Blockly interface to get an idea of what kind of functions there were. That's not an excuse for it not being implemented in the JS portion, however.Aside from the programming, I also have gripes with the presentation of the game: - The game world is incredibly tiny. The edges of the world fall into what appears to be an endless void, and there's no indication other than falling to your untimely death that anything is wrong. I thought it was just a cliff for a moment, and was prepared to create some water with a spell to cushion the landing. That landing never came, as I was just teleported back up to a random position on the map.  - While the fluid simulation is very nice, it's incredibly jagged, and really needs some visual polish. - Heating things up doesn't really make as much sense as I'd have expected. Instead of being able to light individual objects on fire, you instead increase the heat of the surrounding area until it gets hot enough for things to burn. Maybe I missed something, but that seems really silly (though having both abilities available would make for smashingly good design). Heating water to create clouds and humidity to create rain (if I was reading that right and it wasn't just random luck) was really awesome, though.TL;DR it has promise, but generally falls flat due to clunky, disjointed interfaces and lack of proper documentation. It tries to be simple and easy to understand, but complicates this by not having a very solid foundation to build on. I certainly wouldn't want anyone to try to learn programming using this tool, especially not my children or anyone I care about.I won't be requesting a refund or anything like that, mostly because I never have and don't want to go through the effort, but I doubt I will be playing this again until these issues are addressed. Yes yes early access blah blah, but not making sure your core gameplay mechanics are fully functional (or at least better alert your buyer that they are still undergoing development) is a downvote from me. The currently implemented features and functionality are done so poorly and there's no excuse for that. Regardless of my personal feelings on the matter, it's certainly not worth its hefty pricetag. Not yet, at least.somewhat related, why teach programming through visual methods like this, and then when they want to get into more serious, low-level stuff, they basically have to relearn everything? why not start with the text but with visual aids? that's just my hatred of visual programming though "

								This game is incredible.  Some people need action, story, stuff to do, however this game just lets me relax with my imagination.  I thought the sandbox would just be a giant field but they spawned me on top of a mountain!  I fell into a gushing stream of water, ran from some strange creatures with teleport and accidentally casted onto this ball that pulled me in like gravity.  When I had the chance to look up there was a vast scenery to work with.  Boulders on tiny cliffs with what looks like giant roots that arc and bow in the distance.  Before I knew it it was night and I began to work with some fire spells that would light the scenery.  When I couldn't think of anything else to do I switched to water and flooded everything letting it carry me far as I split the water and sent shockwaves down the stream.  Finally I went to the arena to see the premade spells, I pulled rocks as I stood on top and slung them around.  If you can convince another friend to play with you this will almost surely be an amazing experirence.  I haven't figured everything about the spell making system, I know that you can use blocks or javascript.  I didn't see if you could import things that were already created.  Anyway I completely recommend this.  Even though it's early all I would really need to be more hooked on this game than any other is just add stuff to it which just takes time.  Finding some way that Dungeons and Dragons can be a part of this and create amazing scenarios in their sandbox would be a huge plus.Love the game keep up the good work!			"

I've played it for about 4 hours (at time of writing) and I think that it's really enjoyable if you know what you're doing. There are some older spells that don't work with the newer versions (devs removed ability to change the size of orbs, removing a lot of cool functionality). If this game was 10 dollars, and with the exact features it has now, I would reccomend it without any qualifications. But, for 20 dollars, I can't see this game worthwhile in its current state.

								This game was pretty good as a tech demo.  The only issue I have with it is there isn't enough to justify spending money on it.  It is a pretty neat trick to be able to write your own spells but there is no incentive to do so.  There is no mission,story,plot,survival, etc. so no reason to keep playing.  If the functionality of writing your own spells could be integrated into an RPG type of game it would, in my opinion, make this a better game.  Granted there are the 4 ""mission"" type mini games other than sandbox but that is still limited in scope.  I'll continue to watch this game and if it becomes more than a tech demo, I'll be more willing to spend money on it.			"

								Warning: Persons with no interest in computer programming not like this game.This is a 'programming game'. Look up the term in wikipedia and see if the concept appeals to you. If you like to tinker with code and are studying or considering a future in programming you might want to give it a try.The game is at a VERY early stage, I feel at US$20 it is a little pricey for what you get, so you are more supporting the developers than buying a game. Steam sometimes offers discounts on games, so if you don't mind the wait you can add it to your wishlist and wait for a sale - which is what I did!Currently it's just a sandbox where you get to try out the exisiting spells and have a go at writing your own. The graphics are beautiful and the random map generation makes for some amazing landscapes. Performance on older machines may require you to turn the graphics settings down a bit, but it's OK.It uses Googles 'Blockly' code builder which I find an interesting way to write. (I am a experienced programmer with a background in C and Visual Basic). You can then look at the generated Javascript, or you can write in Javascript directly. (You cannot yet mix between them)Looking at the provided spells, making a copy and changing things to experiment is the best approach if you have never programmed before. The worst thing you can do is freeze the program (infinite loops and/or recursion are possible), requiring a task manager 'end program', but code is autosaved so nothing is lost.In the fantasy world (ie Harry Potter), becoming a Wizard/Witch usually requires years of study and practice (Hogwarts) and the most powerful Wizards/Witches are usually depicted as being very old (Dumbledore, McGonagall).In the real world, being a true 'Code Wizard/Witch' also will take lots of study and real-world experience, so don't be disappointed if you don't get instant results. (Even Neville Longbottom becomes a hero and a success in his chosen field)Functionality is being added all the time, and there is a great forum to discuss ideas and get help.I'm looking forward to see what this game turns into!

								I have been playing for a couple hours as of the time I'm writing this. I'm not typically someone who takes chances on alpha games and usually don't bother to write reviews. That being said this game's concept is amazing, and if pulled off well, I would like it to become a staple of all magic games. As someone who loves magic in games, some part of me is always dissapointed when I find myself climbing a skill tree, looking around and seeing every other player doing the same. This game allows the gamer the opportunity to literaly create his/her own unique spells, forging one's own prefferences and style.  Even at alpha stages they have provided impressive diversity. It is obviously not perfect, but it's imperfections amount to little at this stage in it's development. Since everything is based off of code I even feel like I'm learning a little, but not to the point where it is like a lesson (though if I did study code I could probably kick butt in this game!).The number 1 thing new players will find defficient is the lack of any guidbook. Though it is said to be coming soon, you are thrown into the game with complex spell making based on coding and no manuel. At first this really anoyed me, I wanted instant understanding and the ability to craft mind-blowing spells! However it appeared I had to dissect the starting spells the game gave me to determine how they worked. As I said, I wasn't happy at first, but after trial and error for around a whole 20 minutes, I was rewarded with my first semi-original spell! Talk about feeling the rush and emersion in the game! The feeling of having worked and earned it, something being yours. Being able to use the spell and think of how you had put it together, how the idea had come to you! That is all worth it in my book. Conclusion: Good game. Not great yet, it's too early, but definately a project I would recomend supporting.  "

								Very impressive Alpha. Bit of a learning curve but its half the fun finding how things work. The range of spell variables is overwhelming at first untill you use them and see them in action, its fun trial and error. had some crashes with really long/complex spell strings, but it was most likely due to running on a low spec machine. if this gets a final polish and some good content, could be a really great game.

								I don't usually write reviews, but even in its severely incomplete state, I am in love with this game. I've played my current 9 hours in only two days, and it was competing with the other $85 of game that I bought in the recent sale. The devs are committed and the game has its own discord for anyone to join. Even with all of that in mind, this is a game built for people with an interest in coding and fantasy, if you are interested in neither, steer clear until it has more that may interest you later.

								This game really is the coolest concept I've ever seen for a game. Creating your own spells? What's cooler than that? It's super easy, too, and teaches you a big chunk of programming if you don't know anything about it. Additionally, it may seem like this game doesn't have too much to offer as of yet, it is of course in Early Access. There are still tons of things to be added in-game! (Unfortunately, it runs extremely slowly on older computers. :/ Hopefully it will be optimized as more updates come out, though.)			"

								This review is in 2 language:(English and Türkçe)English:*I wanna say that the developers and moderators is highly active, and they are creating a game technologh, this game can be a revolution in game sector.*First don't forget that this game is in early access right now.**(What is this game about?) -This game's theme is wizards and spells. You are gonna have 5 elements(3 available right now) and you will control these elements with spells.**(How much you can control?)- With codes. So we can say 2 coding language is exist in that game, one of them is drag and drop looks like game's own language (that has functions,loops,if,else,return etc.) and the other one you can use is JavaScript. You will create your own spells, such as old wizard master's did.(Actually  aren't the wizards are physics benders? You will try to bend game physics. :D)**(How much i'm free with codes?)- It's up to you, how powerful-minded programmer you are, show your talent. If you are smart enough probably you can do whatever you want. Even you can add 3d models and gave them Artifical Intelligence.**(What's in the future?)- Professionel moders, professionel game-types. Something like 3d model library, so servers. Multiplayer(just think about you will fight with your spells). If i am not mistaken, limitless map.**(Why do i buy that?)-Because this game is different, and believe me your time will not be a loss for  you, you will improve yourself. And you will be the first audiences of a new game category. **Aren't you want go a wizard school, or play a quidditch match with people, why not in the future, maybe some mod developer does that.**By the way, game doesn't have very heavy graphics, just what's needed.**With guessing the future my score is : 9/10Türkçe:*Moderatör ve Geliştiricilerin gayet aktif olduklarını söylemek istiyorum. Bir oyun teknolojisi geliştiriyorlar resmen, bu oyun oyun sektöründe bir devrim olabilir.*Öncelikle bu oyunun erken erişim olduğunu unutmayın.**(Oyunun konusu ne?)-Oyunun ana teması büyücü ve büyülerle alakalı. 5 elementiniz olacak(şu anlık 3 tanesi kullanılabilir) ve bu elementleri büyülerinizle kontrol edebileceksiniz.**(Kontrol etmek derken?)- Kodlarla. Oyunda 2 kodlama dili olduğunu söyleyebiliriz, bunlardan bir tanesi sürükle-brak tarzı oyunun kendi dili gibi(içinde fonksiyonlar,döngüler,if,else,return vb. barındırıyor) ve öteki dil ise JavaScript. Kendi büyülerinizi oluşturacaksınız, eski büyücülerin yaptığı gibi(Aslında büyücüler fizik-bükücü değil mi zaten? Siz de oyun fiziklerini bükmeye çalışacaksınız. :D)**(Kodlarla ne kadar özgürüm?)-Tamamiyle sana bağlı, ne kadar üstün-zekalı bir programcı olduğuna, yeteneğini göster. Eğer yeterince zekiysen muhtemelen her istediğini yapabileceksin. Hatta 3d objeler ekleyip onlara Yapay Zeka bile verebilirsin.**(Gelecekte neler olacak?)-Profesyonel modcular, profesyonel oyun-türleri. 3d kütüphanesi gibi birşey, tabi serverlar da var. Çokluoyuncu Modu( tamamen kendi büyülerinizle savaştığınızı hayal edin ). Ve eğer yanılmıyorsam sonsuz harita.**(Bunu neden alayım ki?)- Çünkü bu oyun farklı, ve inanın zamanınız boşa gitmeyecek, kendinizi geliştireceksiniz. Ve yeni bir oyun kategorisinin ilk seyircileri olacaksınız.**Bir büyücülük okuluna gitmek istemez miydiniz veya insanlarla quidditch maçı oynamak? Gelecekte neden olmasın, belki de bir mod geliştirici yapar.**Bu arada oyun aşırı ağır grafikli değil, ne kadar gerekiyorsa sadece.**Gelecek hakkında tahminde bulunarak benim puanım: 9/10			"

								This game is really amazing for what it's worth! Although the price is a bit high (I'd say it'd be around 10 or 15 instead), it is a really fun sandbox game. It's a ""breath of fresh air"" for sandbox games in which you can control every tiny aspect of it. And being able to play multiplayer and make new gamemodes, like even soccer, could be really amazing (even though those features are not out at the current point). I think that if this game plays it's cards right, it could be going to high places and onto people's steam libraries, even for teachers!Note: I RARELY ever rate a game, so you know it must be good! ;D			"

								The big question for this game is... Is it worth $20?At the moment, no it is not. However this game has massive potential for the future and due to the fact that it is early access, I would reccommend getting it now to familiarize yourself with the coding program in-game for when the full version is released. Once the full version is released those who have stuck with it in early access will be leagues ahead of newcomers with spell creation and the spells that could be created would be limitless and all in all, I am extremely excited for the future of this game.

								Gf loves magic and code. Going to recommend.I like the easy interface. It's confusing at first glace, but if you keep rereading, it gets better.I can't wait for more features like multiplayer. Right now, $20 buys you the sandbox and early access. I'm very impressed, so I don't mind. I didn't like wizardy stuff before this game.If you can edit the .js, I have no idea how...I didn't understand the ""video"" option. I believe that's unnecessary. However, it would provide helpful insight for debug and sharing. It seems like that was the idea.Overall, the game is definitely incomplete thus far. It only supports blockly. It doesn't make your goals clear. It does what all code games do, which is ask for a xx-XX lines of code minimum-MAXIMUM GP. I'd like to know how to play before I'm restricted to how or what code I use. The interface was pretty straightforward. If the full game added better mission, was more clear, and maybe even had multiplayer I would give CS a 7/10 based on EAG play.			"

								A very interesting concept and that alone means a lot now that people complain that ""there never is something new"". Be aware that at the moment this will only be fun to you if you like to engineer your own spells, since there isn´t much gameplay yet. There are four challenges and a sandbox mode. Where the game truly shines is, as expected, it´s ability to let you create spells. After 2.5 hours of getting to know the game I was able to create things like a spell where I aim at a point of land and a meteor shower (5 fireballs that explode) will come raining down after a short delay, a firelance that lets up a line of orbs that explode after a short delay, a bomb that bounces on impact and strikes a random nearby location, which it repeats until its mana is exhausted, a flooding spell, a spell to bring items it hits to me, etc. Can´t wait to see what people come up with once this game spreads a bit.TLDR:Get it if you want something unique that let´s you live out your creativity and engeniering skills and you aren´t afraid to learn a bit about logic connections, maybe read a few guides.Don´t get it if you are looking for a campaign or any kind of gameplay above a few simple challanges and a sandbox mode (yet) or if you aren´t willing or able to learn a few complicated mechanics.

A must buy for it will have untold outcomes and an amazing future.Also things I would like to see:-Workshop support to share spell packs-Spell packs to group your own spells-A more user friendly delete system (Refering to how scratch does it)-An option to use the proper code aswell as the BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks) coding-Survival mode ( Possibly)-Head to head mode-A Construction system for building your wizardy lair-More ingame options and settings-An easier error system to help figure out where the error is in your code blocks-Just a creation mode where you don't have to load up the sandbox to make spellsI would go on but I'm sure the community would make this game amazing with it's ideas.10/10 "

								My recommendation comes with a caveat:  ONLY IF THIS IDEA INTRIGUES YOU.  I say this because the game is in a VERY early access alpha and there isn't much to do other than play and experiment with the few basic spells and effects that are implemented.I believe this game will be an incredibly powerful sandbox (and hopefully an awesome action/adventure game!) when it gets more fleshed out.  The idea of crafting spells through a visual language is both fun and rewarding.  You have to work to make your spells work, and that makes any spell you craft feel much more awesome than if you just made it with a predetermined effect.There is no tutorial and little documentation as of yet, so I reiterate strongly only buy this game if you are intrigued buy the idea.For more information, feel free to check out my first impression video:

								To play this single player game they demand you give a valid email address and remember a password. Unfocused developers, put  focus on kickstarter rewards before developing their gameplay. DO NOT BUY.			"

								This is a good game, basically it gives you the capability to manipulate the environment around you and do coolish things. It's still in BETA so it needs a bit more work. They also need to add a tutorial but it's mostly self explanatory anyway, my toaster can run it on high so 10/10.			"

								I'm not CURRENTLY recommending this game beacuse it doesn't have enough features yet, however if the devs play their cards right and make a spell system that allows literally ANYTHING to be made (a spell that summons a flying taco that shoots lasers for example) then i will buy it and i currently don't know how to code but in the future i probably will. Also i'd like to have a tool that allows you to create your own models cuz obvius.			"

								This game has the potential to be one of the best magic based games out there, it has a literraly infinite combination of spells that you can create from scratch.The only problem with creating spells is the programming, and if you are like me and have 0% experience with it then the beggining will be just learning. This game does a great attempt to make programming easy, dragging and dropping commands into the spell is very simple, learning this is simply a matter of understanding the commands and if you look at the premade spells and what they do then you can learn pretty quickly.

								!!!Early-Access!!!!+has a deeply complex ""spellcrafting "" system- has no tutorial to explain it to the player (yet)+ learning to use the system and building a spell step by step is very rewarding-  the amount of spells is right now more or less limited to:     1. Earth (which is mostly move things and dig/raise)       2. Water (which is create/repell/vanish water)         3. Fire  (which is Raising/lowering Temperature, Explosions)+The sandbox is beautifully crafted and sunsets and sunrises are gorgeous- Water behaves like a big blobmonster rather then waterIf you like the idea of crafting your own spells but dont mind working your way into this coding system all by yourself and  the help of the internet, then buy it.TLDR:Great concept. Solid (but not explained) Mechanics. Beautifull yet empty Sandbox.			"

								CodeSpells is a very ambitious game Early Access in which allows you to be a Wizard in a randomly regenerated world filled with rocks, trees, water and creatures as well as other magical landmarks for you to discover, Also you can not only use a great vast of diverse spells but you can create one yourself.It is Early Access right now but it has alot of great content, In this game the main feature is to create your own spells or mess around with other spells. Creating your spells is aquired through the use of blocky scripts and javascripts, the spells have limitless power so basically with these spells you can manipulate the world and change it, making you omnipotent. With this not only are you having fun but you are also getting to know programming. It will have multiplayer in the future so hundreds will be able to play with their friends and create spells and just mess around for some amazing fun.			"

								I bought this game recently, as you can see only played it for a few of hours, so this isn't an in depth review, just my first impressions. This will be very long winded so read another review if you do not have the patience for long reviews! This game is in very early access, so i am impressed with how far it has got already. I have already created a few simple spells and though there is not much to it yet, there is enough to explore and enough content to have a few hours of entertainment with no trouble. The forums are very helpful, and if you are new to code, you can get spells from them to help you learn how to create your own. From what i have seen, the developers are very active, update the game often, and the development is very user-feedback centered, meaning all of your favourite features that you request have a good chance of being implemented. Anybody buying this game should definitely make an account on the forums where they are very helpful and there is no trash talking or any innapropriate comments whatsoever. But back to the game. It is fairly impressive graphics wise, and the physics do not take a supercomputer to run, which is good, as my computer is not great. In case anybody is interested i will put these at the bottom so that you can get an idea of how yours will run. The possibilities of what you can do with these spells is not literally endless, like the description says, but there is more than i care to discover. It would take thousands of hours of tinkering with JS or the blocks to discover them all and new code is being added all the time. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has ever dreamed of being a wizard or liked skyrims spells but didnt like the lack of invention with the spells. You do not need any history of coding to learn this, especially with the forums.

I've done very little coding but I found this to be very accessible. The blockly style is easy to use with just point and click and simple logic.  I do recommend this game if you are interested in learning some basics of coding. The price is prehaps a bit steep for early access (I picked it up during the winter sale). However I believe the final release will be well worth the full price.Early Access so no rating yet. I found what is currently available very enjoyable and look forward to seeing more.			"

Because of this game, it made me want to learn javascript because you can make spells with that instead of the blocks. It does need some more work to make it run better too. Also things needs to cost less mana. If it doesn't get abandoned by the devs, this could be my favorite sandbox game.			"

Russian version of this review could be found at https://www.artania.ru/?p=358For a long time I wished for a game where mages could be much stronger than mere jugglers. In many books a mage is a man who has monstrous powers and abilities. It’s takes no effort at all for him to crush half of a world into ruins or to get powers by sacrificing kittens. He can raise armies of undead or elementals, summon spirits and demons. But all we see in present-day games is just hilarious hocus-pocuses. Well known “Magicka” that gave us a lot of fun in one’s time, noticeably gone much far away with its arcade spell constructor.And here comes CodeSpells. A new milestone of a games-about-magic evolution, where you can make spells starting from hocus-pocuses and eventually ending with destruction of the world. All you need is to build your very own, very powerful, hyper-destructive spell! MUAHAHAHA!!!And there you find your first problems. If you do not understand at least basics of programming (loops, conditions, variables etc.) it will be either too hard or you couldn’t make something at all. Yes, this game for developers first of all: novice or skilled – no matter. However, even for me as a programmer it was very difficult to understand controls pile of the spell constructor. Moreover, even a simple spell looks like hell in the spell-constructor, as in code viewer it has just five rows of JavaScript in two Unity3D methods: OnCreate and OnHit. You can’t write your code inside the game, but it could be more comfortable as for me, and I see at CodeSpells forum that I’m not alone in this opinion — people want to have a JS editor inside the game. And it could be possible to have C# compatibility because the game made using Unity3D.But what could do those, who has never tried to program something and even can’t imagine how that works but nevertheless wants to dip to the world of boundless magic? Unfortunately, it’s the only way for now – you have to gain an understanding of all that stuff. In fact, I want to ask developers to make more user friendly (for more casual gamers e.g.) spell creating tool. For example, possibility to draw different lines which could give different effects depending on curvature, intersections, length etc. Perhaps, there is much more interested people could be found.As a whole, the idea is great and perspective, so I give it a like. If developers are willing to improve the game, it could be a true bomb. But for now it’s not a game; it has a sandbox where you can’t understand what to do, except experimenting with spells, and there are a couple of mini games, where you need to complete tasks in time to test yourself, your abilities and knowledge of spell constructor.I hope that there will be serious product closer to the release date, which planned in a year, not only for programmers but for different categories of players. Good luck!			"
