												Before you ask, no, you won't learn how to replace your busted clutch or how to find that squeaky sound underneath your car- it's not that type of game.  What you will find, however, is a great puzzle game that is a breath of fresh air compared to the thousands of other puzzle games out there.The premise is simple:  you own a mechanic shop, and people bring you cars (problems) to fix.  You get a short blurb to tell you a bit of information, but the amount of information that you get can vary- going from ""Hey, my battery is dead, can you fix it?"" to ""Something squeaks under the car.  Fix it.""  Your goal is to find and fix the problem while trying not to run out of cash- you get an extra amount of cash for each order, and if that runs out, you can ask the bank for a loan that you have to pay back.  To be honest, though, if you're careful about what you buy and aren't replacing stuff willy-nilly, you ought to be fine.  Just remember- fix it if you can, or replace it outright if you need to.And don't worry about losing parts- the game will not only make you remove items in order off the car, but it will also force you to put them back in order, as well- there's no need to worry about missing any parts- unless it's something like a starter or a plastic engine cover, but even then it won't let you mark it as done until the car is completely put back together.Once each objective is met, you'll be able to mark the car as ""fixed"" and send it on its way.There are over seventy problems in the base game alone- plus another twenty in the DLC pack that comes free with the game.  There's another free DLC pack launching later this month with another pack of problems, and that will add even more value to it. The problems I have with this game are actually somewhat slight- for one, some of the detection on th orders can be really, REALLY picky.  If it tells you to replace the right front tire, then your new wheel must go on the right front- you can't just move a used wheel from the other side of the car onto there, because it's not explicitly a new wheel. It's smart to take big orders a step at a time for this reason- work on one region of the car at a time, and replace everything needed- or make notes as to what the busted parts were.  There is nothing more swear-worthy in this game than completing a huge order, but being unable to continue because you didn't put some tiny part back in its right space- and then you have to pull the whole blasted thing apart to hunt for it.The only other complaint I have is that you will want to hit the radio with a wrench and kill it dead after a half-hour of its awful music.  If you need music, bust out an iPod or turn on an actual radio, because this one will make you want to take it out to the test track and drive over it a few dozen times.  Would it have been too much to ask to get a simple MP3 player in there or something?All in all, though, if you're looking for a puzzle game that isn't something about jewels, you'll enjoy this- especially if you have an interest in cars.

												Several notable annoyances, but this is an enjoyable ""lite"" simulator of working on cars!I say lite because it is not a true simulation by any means. It's a moderate approximation of working on modern day cars, but plays more like a puzzle game. That said, what it does offer is quite enjoyable if you like cars or just problem-solving in general. You're given a car and a description of the problem, sometimes specific and sometimes vague, and it's up to you to figure it out.Often this will involve poking around with a magnifying glass to see if something is glowing red, other times it will mean taking a test drive and seeing what rattles. Come back, take it apart, buy a part online or repair it, replace the part, there you go. Sometimes it'll be as straightforward as changing the oil or brake pads, other times it'll involve tearing down a significant portion of the drivetrain to get to a hard-to-reach part. It's not too complex either, with just the right amount of detail to be believable, but not *every* nut, bolt, and wire from a real car is accounted for. I find it very satisfying to be presented with a car that doesn't work for who knows what reason, poke around and inspect all sorts of parts, go shopping for new ones online, install them, find you need more parts, finish it off and finally take it for that successful test drive around the track. It also looks and sounds fantastic while you're doing it, which is not a requirement in this genre but it's a nice plus if you have the hardware.My biggest issues: sometimes it's far too vague and makes a lot of assumptions about what you know. If you don't have a basic knowledge of car parts and their locations, too bad, you're going to be stumbling around a lot since it doesn't tell you where most things are or how many of them to look for. It's also not initially very clear *how* exactly to get to the parts you need to repair, even if you can see them, which is made worse by the camera being finicky. Also, some jobs are insanely picky, like one where you have to replace an ignition wire with a new one: the game gives you the option to replace the wire with used ones, but nope, it has to be new (or over some ambiguous percentage of quality) even though it doesn't tell you this. It is also incredibly easy to screw yourself out of money, since there is a way to upgrade your abilities in the game. If you spend too much on these upgrades before finishing a job, you may not have the cash needed to buy the parts to finish it, leaving you stuck.I'd still recommend it for sim enthusiasts and the car-curious though, as the price seems *just fair enough* for the amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of it! However, it's lacking in some areas as far as accessibility, clarity, and variety in things to do. It's not as in-depth as some previous games like Gearhead Garage, but it's not nearly as simple as some of the flash games I've played either.			"

I'm going to say that I recommend this but I think it's worth pointing out some things first, as it's definitely not for everyone but I think there are some people that will like it so I'll explain why.Basically the aim of the game is to order in parts from the computer, then go and find where those parts are on the car and to take them off and replace them, then run some checks. There isn't that much more to it.The major part of this game that is worth pointing out is that apart from the very first level, you're left completely on your own. If you don't know where something is or how it works you may find yourself stuck. I spent a great deal of time trying to find where the fuel filter was despite me knowing where one belongs on my own car in real life. However because of this fact, I do feel that makes the simulation part of this game rather accurate. I am not a mechanic and obviously I don't know how to work on a car all that much, and you do kind of feel that way when you play this game. Is that really a sign of a good simulator game though? Should the simulation of menial tasks in a video game make the game almost as boring as real life? I think the prospect of at least tinkering and having a go in the comfort of your house without getting dirty is what may warm some people towards this game. Perhaps namely, the teenage car enthusiast / wannabe mechanic market.This game is different to the usual game with ""simulator"" thrown at the end of the name though, although maybe that could be due to the fact for the most part, games that have simulator in the title generally set the bar quite low other than a few of the major players in the simulator genre. I do feel like this one actually gave it a go. It feels like there has been some thought put into it, it doesn't feel half-arsed as you may initially think. When you compare it to other simulator games, it does actually have a lot of things to do, and the way the gameplay works it means you won't ever run out of things to do if you were to find yourself continuing to enjoy playing the game. It's not linear or working to a dreadful storyline, it's just completely honest. Here is a car, here is a list of jobs, go buy the bits, go change them. Admittedly though this will probably get monotonous rather quickly.As for the feel of the game, the graphics are actually rather pleasant. Nothing was too garish and nothing of low quality popped out at me, it all felt quite warm and had a nice charm to it. The cars are kind of all the same. They are all generally front wheel drive European style cars. However they do look rather nice, and clearly take inspiration from real life cars but with a few twists and tweaked badges to perhaps avoid any legal issues. The driving aspect is pretty dreadful, the handling is terrible and it's definitely more of a very small almost mini-game function of the game rather than a key element.I think it's reserved to perhaps car enthusiasts who want to try a car game that's different to the norm, but I wouldn't expect a huge amount of game time. Maybe in the future this game will see a modding community as seems to be the case with a lot of car games. I think this game would appeal most to the typical teenage car enthusiast, but not much more.			"

												It's not a tremendously accurate simulation by any means, but it's great fun nonetheless, and it might even teach you some of the basics about how cars are put together.  The repairs themselves usually follow a standard plot:  run diagnostics (test drive, OBD checker, etc) or examine the parts yourself until you find the one or two parts that are bad, remove as many parts as are necessary to remove the bad parts, buy replacements for the bad parts from your garage computer (or repair them if possible), then install the new parts and replace everything else.At least, that's how it's *supposed* to go.  If you want to go a different (*cough* chop shop *cough*) route, you can make use of the otherwise mostly useless used parts store also on your garage's computer.Say your job is to replace some bad brake pads.  To get to those pads, you'll also have to remove the tire and the brake caliper.  The parts that you don't need to replace for a job are usually in pristine condition, meaning that if you sell them, you'll get a much higher price for them.  All you have to do is go to the used parts store and see if they have a working caliper and tire for that car that's in okay condition (as long as it's better than red condition, it should work).  Of course, they might not have a barely working caliper or tire for that car, but they might have an exhaust manifold that will be just perfect.  So, remove the original exhaust manifold too.  As long as it's in better condition than what the used parts store is selling, you'll profit.  Sell off the originals, buy/install the used parts, and pocket the difference.  Your clueless customers will drive off happy, and you will have sold off perfectly good parts of their car for a tidy profit.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is a game where you play the role of a mechanic with yourvery own workshop/garage. There are two modes available, Career Mode and Endless Mode, though Endless Mode isn'tavailable until after completing the main Career Mode.In Career Mode you'll be given an invoice, one invoice at one time,(There are a total of 75 in the game)and this invoice will usually detail the job that needs done to a vehicle in question.For example someone might want their brakes changed out.As you play the invoices because increasingly more difficult, albeit with a little playin them.. meaning you might be given a fairly difficult job in one invoice, then the nextone could be just changing some brakes again.The jobs you can be give can range from changing brakes, as mentioned above,or changing oil, air, and fuel filters, to changing the entire transmission/gearbox/clutch.You can also test-drive vehicles, take them on a track where their braking and suspensionis tested, as well as tuning them to increase their performance.Though I quickly tired of test-driving vehicles, since I could never see the issues thatwere described in their invoices.For example the invoice stated rattling coming from the front of the car when driving,but I couldn't hear anything.Or the invoice stated that steering was loose, but it was kinda hard to tellsince the steering mechanics of the game aren't the greatest.Personally I don't have much experience with car mechanics in general..I worked on semi-trucks for a short during in my teens, but never really learned much hehe.However regardless of the complex nature of mechanics this game was surprisingly easyto get into, and I found myself learning a lot.From the way you get around in game, to how you inspect parts, both with in-gamevisuals such as worn out parts being dirty, to the color-coded Inspect Mode;the game was quite easy to learn and get into.A lot of things are simplified and made easier than in real life..you don't have to go scrounging around for the right sized wrench..your jack automatically is placed under the vehicle when removing a wheel, etc.However there's the other side of the same coin; about halfway through the game I beganto realize the game was becoming too easy.Money was piling up and in jobs where you're supposed to be stingy and only replace afew of the broken parts I was like 'what the hell' and replaced all the broken parts justfor the heck of it, because I wasn't concerned about profit.Which is quite contrary to in real life.Another thing became quite prevalent as I was breezing through the missions.I started wishing there was more.. more everything.By the time I completed the game I knew every part modelled in-game inside and outand have replaced every part many times, sometimes even replacing every part in one job.I was starting to wish I could do more complex things, and more mechanical thingsin general.This is both the games blessing and it's curse.. that you'll love the game for it's easeof learning and it's fun factor, but then once you become a pro there's just not enoughmeat on the bone.Luckily it seems over the course of the next year or so (possibly longer I'm not completely sure) the developers are planning DLC and patches, some of the DLC I believe is free as well.Personally, being the impatient person I am, it couldn't come soon enough, I can't waitto see what depth will be added to the game, as it can only improve upon it.Overall this game was a great experience, taking me 16 hours to complete the maincampaign, and though there's still Endless, I have a general feeling of'been there done that' when it comes to replacing any parts in the car at this point.Though at the same time if there was more meat to the game I'd be gulping it downlike my pet cat gulps down chicken. ;)Sound 7.5  (Overall good sound quality, but occasional hitches/pops in the sound)Gameplay 8.5  (Easy to learn and get into, but by the end of the game it's too easy)Graphics  9  (In some places slightly muddy textures, but for a simulator it looks darn good)Overall 8.5Great experience with it's only real downside being it leaves you wanting for more.

												After reading several reviews and noticing it was on sale, I decided to give this game a try. I have a Quad Core 3.8ghz AMD, GeForce 730 2gb Graphics Card, and 8gb DDR3 RAM. As soon as I loaded up the first vehicle in the game, I experienced low framerates. I exited and changed the video settings to Quality High, Resolution 1280x720, VSync OFF, Antialiasing DISABLED (These are the same settings I use for DayZ, which gives me 40+FPS). I now have 0 drop in framerate, and the game still looks beautiful. I've been an experienced mechanic for over 10 years. I am a certified CNC Machinist, as well as a certified Mercedes-Benz Technician. I've been a gamer since the NES days. The graphics are really good, and I haven't experienced any noticeable bugs, glitches, or clipping issues. The sound is ok, but nothing to brag about. I did listen to the radio, but had turned it down 50% before I even started. I never found it to be annoying. Movement around the shop environment is pretty smooth. No issues there. The game starts every level with a worksheet that explains what the customer wants you to check for or replace. Great thing is, you can refer back to this worksheet at anytime. Most of the parts can be visually inspected without removing them, but a lot of parts can only be inspected upon removing something in front of it (i.e. a timing belt before inspecting the water pump). The electrical components must be checked using the OBD Scan Tool. You are also able to test drive vehicles in order to diagnose bad parts, and the physics are good. Right clicking the mouse opens a menu allowing you to install parts, remove parts, turn the chassis transparency off/on, and turn the parts color, such as red, yellow, and green corresponding to the condition, off/on. Some of the parts can simply be removed, others must be unbolted and bolted back on. Everything must be installed in the reverse order of removal. Yes, you can forget to install parts, but you cannot give the car back to the customer until you fix your mistakes. The game automatically checks tasks off your worksheet as you complete them. After a little over an hour of playing, I found this game to be very fun. I'm impressed that any developer would tackle a game like this, and with such detail. Don't expect it to be 100% realistic, such as every nut and bolt, accurate pricing, names of cars, etc. I don't think anyone could learn the basics of car repair from this game, but I do think someone can use this game to understand the overall concept of automotive repair. I honestly don't have anything bad to say about this game. I wish the concept of this game would've implemented on Forza, Grand Turismo, or Need For Speed a long time ago! If you're interested in automotive repair, get this game now that it's on sale.			"

												I repair cars for a living (Voke school)I bought this game since I was: 1) Intreged by it2) To help me ""freshen"" my skillsThis game is accurate for the most part, and it is addicting. Some inaccuracies is that V-6s are vertically split, not horizontal (due to game mechanics, I can see why they did this). Plus, most oil filters are at the bottom of the engine, not next to the dip stick. Like i said, mostly accurate, addicting, and fun, makes this game its own original series.Final Rating: 9/10			"

												So as a trained mechanic and a general gearhead, I figured I just had to pick this up. However, after going through the first four or five jobs, I gotta say:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I recommend this as a puzzle game, but not as a ""simulator"" or educational game----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pick it up if it's on sale - it's fun to fiddle around with and see how fast you can find the problem. But the game is far, far away from simulating the really important things about being a mechanic. I guess if the devs implemented a few more challenges like stuck bolts, and the need to use the right amount of force (and maybe to pick the appropriately sized tools for the task), this would be much more challenging. I'd love to see that implemented, maybe by dragging the mouse to keep a ""torque bar"" in the green area or something.Pros:+ you get to learn about lots of car parts and what they do+ it's fun to figure out what the problem is+ sometimes you get one symptom with several causes - just like in real life. Very good.+ sometimes, you can fix parts instead of replacing them. That's something many real life garages seem to have forgotten.So why am I giving it a thumbs down?Well. Some of the most basic and most important things about fixing cars are missing. The game reduces disassembly and assembly to clicking a few bolts:- No torque requirements for bolts in sensitive places. - No stuck bolts that you can break off. - No need to pick the correct tool for the task. - No caveats where order of disassembly is important because of the mechanics or the electrical systems. You're either prevented from making mistakes, or the things that would be mistakes in real life don't matter. The worst I've seen so far: I can rip out the starter without even disconnecting the battery - now there's a recipe for disaster. Other cons:- the real life challenge of saving time by disassembling as few things as possible in order to get to the damaged part is missing. Maybe it comes in at a later stage of the career, but as far as I've played, you can happily rip apart the whole car if you feel like it without any financial repercussions.- Different versions of the same part for different model years? Multiple vendors with different price and quality levels? Delivery times? Everything that makes the ""parts"" part of a mechanic's business challenging is missing.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is a game from PlayWay and Red Dot Games. You certainly play as a car mechanic, although I think the ‘simulator’ part of the title is a bit of a loose term.The game is slightly educational though. I knew the basics about the inside of a car and how it works, but I definitely wouldn’t have been able to fix one for you. I still can’t, but at least I can tell you where most of the stuff is. In CMS2014, you are tasked with fixing a stream of cars with various problems. At the start of each level, you receive a clipboard with a check list of objectives. Change the brake pads. Check the exhaust. You’re also given a note from the customer trying to give more details about what’s wrong with the car. I wasn’t sure if the poor grammar in these sections was intentional to give a sense of dealing with idiotic customers, but I fear it wasn’t. Your job is to fix the car, stamp the form, and send your customer on their merry way.Early levels are simple as your customers appear to be mechanics themselves and know exactly what’s wrong with the car, leaving you with the simple task of replacing the broken part.However, it isn’t long before someone shouts “IT’S MAKING NOISES”, and runs off leaving you to figure out what’s wrong. This is when you will have to start examining the ins and outs of the car. Damaged parts will be shown in red and must be replaced. This often means taking large sections of the car apart. Who knew it was so complicated to change part of the suspension? Maybe complicated isn’t the right word here. I’m sure it is in real life, but in CMS2014 it’s just… lengthy. You have to unscrew bolts one at a time by holding in the mouse button, but that’s about as tricky as it gets.The only barrier is knowing exactly where the part you’re looking for is when you’re trying to fix it. This is quite a high barrier when you don’t know, but each part is labelled when you mouse over it, so you’ll find it eventually.The monotony is broken every now and then when you’re asked to take a car for a test drive to test acceleration, braking, handling and suspension, but after the first drive of unresponsive handling, I wasn’t particularly looking forward to the next one.You never really feel like you’re progressing. The garage I was working in changed a couple of times suddenly, without any fanfare. It looked nicer and there were some more gadgets, but it was odd that I was plonked in there with no warning. It was as if I had walked into someone else’s garage and decided to work there for a while.Maybe you need to be a lot more into cars than I am to get something out of CMS2014. Objectively though, it just doesn’t seem like a whole lot of fun. There’s a lot in there for the price, but there’s only so much you can fix in a car, and with 75 levels in the main game, along with an “endless mode”, things become repetitive fairly quickly.Overall 6/10.

If you told me I'd completely finish this game and its two (free) DLC addons I'd have laughed in your face.If you like cars, puzzle games, and dubstep radios, get it. I hope to see a CMS 2015 because there's loads of potential in this one that just doesn't go far enough.			"

												I expected something in the vicinity of gearhead garage but it truly wasnt. I had been looking forward to this game and perhaps therefore my expectations were a tad too high.  This game seems hastily thrown together, all the cars look like ssangyongs or toyotas, they all seem to be mostly front wheel drive, front engined, there are no v8s, there seems to be no variation what so ever except a few exterior details.Yes the fact that you could drive the cars to diagnose them would have been a nice touch if it didnt feel like I was driving a maxed out clown car propelled by rubber bands with suspension made out of matches. The worst part is that I dont seem to get to buy my own car, fixing it up and trying to turn a profit but rather grind my way through repetetive tasks with a bunch of whiny women who are not able to change their oil or even their own air filter.

												Had I written this before CMS 2015 appeared, I'd have recommended this because whilst it has some flaws, there's definately an engaging idea here.Problem is, CMS 2015 smooths out of lot of the rough edges this game has - which areHaving to lift/drop the car a lot due to (rather unrealistic) restricted access/crappy rampsHaving to guess what's needed/what should be replaced for some jobsHaving to walk to a PC and navigate a LONG list of parts to order replacements (2015 adds a mobile tablet and SEARCH!)An really annoying bug whereby the mouse isn't locked to the game in multi-monitor mode - which causes the game to minimize CONSTANTLY (the developer's solution of 'Clip Cursor' DOES NOT WORKSo what I recommend is if you're interested in the idea, 2015 is worth the extra to reduce the frustration!!

												This review is for people who think they would learn a lot about auto mechanic work from this game.It's a game so you really can't mimic everything. This game shows you the basics of things like names of parts and the general places where parts go but thats about it. I've only play this game for 30 minutes and already its less of a simulator and more of a game like Cookie clicker. Just there to waste your time doing nothing.These are the things that they just breeze by. No one hand wrenches tire bolts lel. Atleast make the sound an air tool instead of a ratcheted tool noise. They obviously just put in random prices with some of the jobs because an OBD test does not cost $300  ♥♥♥♥ing  dollars if you spend $300 on a scan for your car you might aswell buy a scanner and do it yourself. You shouldn't have to individually buy things. Brake pads come in a set of 4(2 for each side) The second car you work on in campaign makes you change an oil filter, air filter, and a gas filter. Paper filters are not the only oil filter, there are can filters too. You also don't change only your oil filter unless its a defective part thats leaking oil. Other then that you get it with an oil change which is also the most basic thing you learn as a mechanic. You also rarely ever change a gas filter. (I've only done them twice in the past two years and both on Mercedes that have a common problem with them)Refrences: I'm an auto mechanic.			"

												Really cool-looking game about fixing broking cars in your garage. But... will you like it? Would I recommend it for you to buy? That's depends of what are you expecting from this game, in the first hand.Let me tell you how it works, right from the start: you'll find yourself locked inside the garage, with some broken car and notation of what you should do with it. You can disassemble the most of the car's engine, suspension and exhausts. You can fix some of those disassembled parts on the workbench, or buy new ones in the PC installed in your garage. Reassemble the car with new or fixed details, and they'll send you next one. After some time you'll get enough ""free"" money to ""buy upgrades"", namely, the discounts for the spare parts market, ability to squeeze the next client for more money, ability to notice some of the wrecks with your blind eye, without any expertise, and, finally, ability to turn screws faster... Which is really suitable, especially when exhausts needs fixing.After 2-3 dozen of cars, they let you in the new, bigger garage, with more tools to examine the wrecks. And in the third garage, which you'll get in about half of the game, you'll face ""the master tool"" - thing for making magical ""chiptuning"" (which looks as some kind of puzzle - or the way to make quick buck, depends from perspective).That's it. Quite an accurate attempt to draw the line of work for cars mechanic, with its bright and dark sides, choices and so on.Downsides? There is one noticable, but boy, it's Big! You see, all is quite simplified: two different engines (V4/V6) and front-wheel drive/four-wheel drive - which gives us four, only four possible variants of what we should assemble and disassemble over and over. After you'll fix 2-3 cars in the main career and 1-2 cars in each of two dlc's (4wd and tuning one) - you've seen it all.So, if you were planning to use this software to safely find out how to fix your own VW/Ford/Toyota/whatever - forget it. If you were looking for game about making cars out of scrap or just wanted something powerful enough to keep you awake all night long - nope, not this case.So, why I like Car Mechanic Sim and think it's good for any games collectioner? First, it's really looking good now - being made on quite limited resources. Yeah, an example of good code work. Second, even while there are not enough depth and variety, it still can teach something - I'll definetely provide this piece to my son - before showing him wiring schemes and options for gear boxes and other more complicated stuff. Third, it's good 3d puzzle game - find out the easiest and cheapest way to get wheels spinning - that's steeper in my book, than crushing numberless skulls... Even if not that fun. And note various languages at game's settings! Learn how to call your wheel in Spanish, German, Russian, et cetera! Yeah, learn the cars topic on your favourite foreign language! (Too bad they don't have Chinese and Japanese, though.) Finally, the price. It's good now, even without bundles!So, Car Mechanic Sim 2014 deserves 6.5/10 points and good place in my game's library. Will it fit for you? I don't know. But you may try, it won't bite.PS: the music there gets old fast, I turned it off after the 1st hour of playing... a small thing, but I still wish for more options there			"

												It seems this software is decent at what it does, namely beign a car mechanic simulator. But if you're looking for a game, take caution - you might get disappointed. There are few minor problems here and there, but the major one for me is that the Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 seems to expect you beign an experienced car mechanic in the first place, knowing where all the parts are and what they are, and more strangely, what are the rules of playing this game.After something like 2 hours of playing I have messed up a job by spending the money on the wrong things and it seems all I can do is to restart my career. Cancelling a job isn't an option. Oh well.But if you are the kind of person that likes high learning curves and, most of all, fixing cars, you might just enjoy it. Perhaps even a lot?Also, this is ""few hours after the release review"", changes and patches might occur.EDIT: The ""restart order"" button has been added.			"

												I have zero real-world knowledge about cars, or how they work.I do not have any idea how accurate the parts in the game would relate to the real-world, but I figure it has to be good enough to give you a pretty decent overall idea of how cars work, and where parts would be, and how all the parts fit together.That being said, I really like this game! Each work order requires you to think about the problem, and then identify the right part, find out how to GET to that part, and then either repairing the part, or replacing it. The interface/controls feel slightly awkward, but still much better than many of the other ""____ Simulator"" games that have been coming out recently.Even if you don't really care about cars, or how they work, this game can be highly enjoyable even from a simple puzzle-solver perspective. For me, it's even given me a different perspective about how cars work. I don't expect to suddenly look at a real-life car and know how to take it apart, but maybe, just maybe, I'll at least not be so blank-face dumb about it. Not that it's a required part of playing this game, but hey, you may learn something. I definitely recommend checking this game out.			"

												As a former mechanic myself I have got to say this game isn't far off the truth, tracking down annoying problems while trying not to go over budget on parts, one serious mis-diagnoses could wind up costing you dearly. obviously I have an unfair advantage over casual players but I would highly recommend giving it a go, it's pretty much a standard puzzle game. although the removal and locating of componants on the vehicles is highly simplified when compared with reality, it would have to be (try locating and changing an air filter on any french car made after 2010 and you'll see what I mean). also cars that feature rear wheel drive have the engine set up as a front wheel drive wich isn't unheard of but is very uncommon, but I get they probably had limits with what they could do.The game looks pretty damn good and though the test drive consist of the same course over and over again with no noticable change on the vehicle before and after repairs, I enjoyed them none the less. I think the game would be enjoyable weather or not you have prior experience with motor vehicles, and who knows you might actually learn something. Definately worth the five pound I paid for it and will definately be picking up car mechanic 2015 once I'm done messing around on this one.  "

												A nice concept, and one I was hoping would be fun and help me learn a bit more about cars than I already knew. Sadly, the difference between the car in game and a real car is seriously just enormous. The only way this could be a solid game is if at least all of the parts of a car that aren't chassis, interior, and automatic transmission were correctly modeled and there were at least several variations to encounter, or the game at least had an interesting metagame that rewarded efficiency. Instead, it's seriously just a super simplified engine, suspension, exhaust and fuel systems, and that's it. Basically just a rough approximation of a car. You'll do the same three or four things over and over and you almost don't even need to read the scenario information, just find the grubby looking part and replace it. The game trailer says there are around 150 parts in the game, what they aren't telling you is around 130 of them are screws.The money in-game is seriously worthless because there is no metagame, at all. None. So, no matter what you do, efficiency is irrelevant. Buying used parts is a waste of time, even good used parts aren't counted as 'good' parts for the repair. Selling off the old parts from each scenario is a pain, not to mention worthless. The diagnostic track seriously does nothing; no matter what is wrong with the car it is the same every time, you just magically know what's wrong after wasting your time driving around. Which is something you are often required to do for no reason even if you know what to fix because it's included in the scenario objectives. The music is good for about twenty seconds, after which it becomes patently awful.Overall, the fun petered out after about two hours and eventually I realized that the game isn't ever going to get any more complex, approaching that of a real car. New garages don't matter because the car and its problems are always the same, the extra space is actually annoying. The game is more of a tech demonstration than a game, I would expect it to be nearly free, so I'm glad I got it at a significantly reduced price.			"

There are plenty of parts and alot of steps to perform for some of the parts but i found it to be more tedious than fun, really.  YMMV.For me, in the bundle it was 7/10, but I would not buy it at retail or for more than a couple of dollars.			"

												I like this game it show the basic understanding of mechanics and would recommend you to play it. the only thing i would like to see is an other game like this that goes more in depth. Like having to work on more different types of motor vehicles from motor cycle all the way up to over the road truck or 18 wheelers. that you can do miner repairs at the beginning of the game and as you progress in the game the more major the repairs get by doing every thing real life mechanics do. for example rebuilding an engine from the inside and out.

												If you have no interest in puzzle games or working on cars, this probably isn't for you. If you have an interest in one or especially both than you might be surprised that you could enjoy something like this. And that's what this is, it's a puzzle game based on car repair. Customers bring you work orders with complaints or requests much like in the real world and you have to diagnose and repair the problem. There are 76 work orders (many of them with rather humorous descriptions) in the base game and 20 in the included offroad DLC with more to come soon.Malfunctioning vehicles are basically the puzzle to be solved and it's a very simplistic puzzle at that compared to a real car. You don't have to be a pro mechanic to play this but some basic troubleshooting knowledge does help. Otherwise you might find yourself tearing down the entire car to find the bad parts if you're clueless where to start when someone brings you a car that has trouble starting for instance.The repair jobs vary in length, time and complexity as you go. You can order the parts you need online at your terminal and fix some of them at your workbench to save costs and increase your profit. You can also spend money on training to increase some basic skills that earn you more money per job, discounts at the parts store and speed up disassembly and bad part identification. There is also a test track and diagnostic path that you can drive the car on to help identify malfunctioning systems.The in game music is this terrible dubstep crap that just annoys the hell of me but thankfully it can be turned off.You won't become an ASE certified mechanic or learn to run your own repair shop by playing this, but it's a good way to kill some time without a huge time commitment with no pressure. It's definitely worth picking up on sale at the sub $10 price point that I got it at.			"

												This part is for the base game.All though the game can become boring and feel like a chore I still really enjoyed it. There will be more cons then pros but I still recommend it. I know this review is a bit late seeing as how the new game is already out which looks awesome (I have yet to play it), but I finally got around to playing and beating this game. Any way here are some pros and cons I have for this game.  PROS:Can “learn” skillsLots of puzzles (more of a puzzle game then simulator which isn't too bad)You get a new shop as you progress (I would of preferred to have to buy the shops)The tests you run on vehicles are pretty cool (but can become boring)May help you learn about vehicle parts CONS:Can become repetitive and feel like a choreSometimes too simpleDoesn't feel like a true simulator (more like a puzzle but still not too bad)Not many parts some don't even get used and USED parts are pointlessLots of parts are missing (compared to a real car)Strange sun glare that can become annoyingCamera sometimes does not want to cooperateNo exotic carsVery empty shop (would be cool to have coworkers working on other cars and maybe seeing customers in the lobby)End of career kind of a let down (didn't really feel like I accomplished anything)With all those cons I still really enjoyed the game. My favorite repair order was 42 which had you finding out what parts are missing, kind of wish more were like this.And now for the DLC. I have not fully completed the DLC but I did try it out to get the basic idea of it.For the 4x4 DLC I felt like it would have been better to combine it with the career mode. PROS:New Test track for 4x4 vehicles (I thought it was pretty cool)New vehicles CONS:Things you learned from the main career (books skills) don't transfer overAll in all its basically the same so yeah nothing to special.And now for the Drag DLCI really liked this one and wish the main career was similar towards end game. They added a lot which is nice. PROS:Shop is a bit dirtier (made me feel like cars have been worked on earlier)New parts (instead of learning books you get a whole new store for racing parts)New test track (drag)You get more options when it comes to working on the car, this time its not about oh my muffler broke, it's “I need to beat this time so here's money, make it happen!”I didn't have any cons, I really enjoyed this part.Like i said I know this review is late and I'm sure the new game will be much better.

Yes, it takes a very detailed and complicated industry and simplifies the heck out of it, but thats really what makes it fun for me. The end result is a soothing enjoyment of diagnosing and repairing automobiles without the headache of actually beating a car apart with a hammer.As a side note, I'm really thankful for the developers continuation of adding new features for FREE.

It's almost no challenge and the only times it is, is when it doesn't follow the principles of logic. Got bored real fast and no more motivation to play so I feel it's only a waste of money.

												I really enjoy this game, the only thing I can fail it on is overall realism. Some of the things inside of the engine and car are either not named correctly, do not look like that in real life, or overall do not exist. There are the following.Pro's-Nice graphics-Educational and teachers core basics of light motor vehicle repair.-Has a cool sound track.-A diverse variety of cars modeled closely to resemble some real world brands like Ford, VW, Vauxhall and more.-Is fun.Con's-Unrealistic models for certain parts of the engine.-No difference in engines, their all the same pretty much.-Some of the jobs can be just damn right tedious.-Limited sound track.-Unrealistic part names, and uses.-No air powered tools, you relay on good old spanners.-Does not teach some core basics such as torque settings when putting wheels back on, or correct tensions for the serpentine belt etc.Sources: I am a motor vehicle technician.

												Took the whole car apart looking for the fuel filter. I know nothing about cars but I do know where the fuel filter is now. Test drove a van to see what is wrong with the front side of the van and to replace anything that is broken and worn out. I gave up on searching what was wrong with it and called my brother who is a mechanic to see if he had any pointers. Instead he was confused and wondered why I took an interest in cars suddenly. I didn't have the heart to tell him I was fixing a car in a game. So I told him it was for a friend. I still haven't figured out what the problem was.

												The primary objective of a simulator is to accurately recreate the feeling and control of completing an existing real world task, like driving, managing, farming, dating, etc. Obviously, not all real world tasks are entertaining, in fact, most are repetitive jobs you work day after day for a paycheck. The draw of a well made simulator is the ability to experience a career virtually that you may never have the chance to experience in real life. Sometimes this can be interesting and educational, sometimes a lot of fun, and sometimes extremely boring. It's up to the individual to decide if the simulator is fun or repetitive, which makes this genre extremely difficult to review. Do I review it based on its entertainment value alone, or how accurately it depicts the task it's trying to recreate?The focus of this particular simulator is in the title. At the start of each job you are provided with a work order explaining what the issue is, and it's up to you as the mechanic to resolve the issue as best as you can. Generally this requires you to remove and check individual parts, and replace the ones that are damaged. If you don't know anything about cars it can be difficult to locate the issues at first, but once you fix the first ten cars or so you'll know exactly where to look for the problems and how to fix them. Don't worry, there is no time limit or grading system to worry about here. Each job takes however long you need it to, so you never feel rushed or stressed. In fact, later on the game feels entirely too easy, since turning off the body model of the car grants you immediate visual access to most parts, and the ones that are in bad shape stick out like a sore thumb with a very different texture than the rest.Locating and resolving the issues is very enjoyable. Removing and replacing the individual parts is very intuitive and even a little educational if you have zero experience with fixing cars. The models are easily recognizable, even though the vehicles are generic due to licensing constraints. There's even a radio in your garage to listen to while you work, though I hope in the future they provide a way to point it to your own music directory. You really do feel like a professional mechanic, which is the most important thing when developing a simulator.As you progress through the 70+ jobs that come with the main campaign, you'll unlock new garages to work in with new tools such as the Path Tester, Workbench, and Chip Tuner. The interesting thing is, you don't really feel like you own the garage, even though it's implied. Each car that comes in is paid for in advance and you have to fix the problems as cheaply as possible to profit. Not being able to set your own prices or contact the customer after inspections seems like a missed opportunity here. There are zero management duties when it comes to running the garage. No rent or utilities payments to make, employees to manage, cleaning to be done, inventory to take, or anything else that comes with running a business like this. Car Mechanic Simulator is very focused on the act of fixing cars, and little else. That can be a good or bad thing depending on what you're looking for, but personally, I hope that these aspects will be added in later updates.Features such as the OBD Reader and Obstacle Course seem more like novelties than required mechanics. Neither helps with diagnosing the issues with the cars, but both were required on multiple occasions for completing a work order, which is a shame. Providing more feedback from these features in the future would go a long way to improving on this idea. Even having your character mutter to himself while driving about how the car is handling would be a fantastic addition.Car Mechanic Simulator feels like a great base for what will eventually become a fantastic simulator. I feel that the developers are on to something special, and cannot wait to see what the future holds for this franchise. If you are even a little interested in working on cars, but don't have the money, energy, or are generally against getting covered in grease, then look no further. With multiple free add-ons, and an endless mode, you'll get hundreds of hours out of this title. It does a great job of simulating the act of working on cars, so in that respect, it succeeds in its primary goal. As far as the entertainment factor is concerned, I'll let you be the judge.			"

												I graduated as a car mechanic back in 1996 and therefore i was very curious how such a game would be.Basically its a good game that delivers an amount of entertainment that matches the pricetag.Besides replacing spareparts the game has a testcourse where you can drive the car thru obstacles to check that its working properly.....however it always works properly on the test course as bad dampers etc doesnt affect the driving experience, so the test track isnt really of any help in regards of finding out whats wrong with the car.The missions are straight forward in the sense that you get a sheet listing the problems to be solved and some things are more puzzling that others and that gives the game a touch of reality.It does kinda lack the things like ""sound and feel"" that you get irl when testdriving a car, where youll be able to tell if the dampers are failing, steering is slugish, engine isnt running right aso.That leaves you with the option to check all the parts and replace the worn ones to ensure theyre working properly.On that part I find it hard to define when the game accepts partially worn, but not worn out, parts to be left on the car or not, sometimes itll accept partially worn parts and other times it has to be 100% condition.Again, adding some rl touch would highly increase the gameplay, like in a real shop when you get a job where the customer says ""Imma drive 2000 miles on vacation in my car, can you check it and make sure its up for it?"" you can get to use your judgement on which parts to replace/fix and based on how well you do it, the customer will be more or less happy about the job you did.Also adding the ability to buy up used cars, fix them up and puttem out for sale on the lot would be a nice feature as well, kinda like the way you could in ""Gearhead Garage"".All in all, the game is good and i do recommend it, but I also hope to see some implementation of the features mentioned, I wouldnt mind if it came as addons in the form of DLC @ maybe 10 EUR or so each.

												GOTY 2014! But honestly, this game is so much fun, and in my top 10 for all games that came out this year. Its full of fun cars to fix, different types of peoblems, and evey issue has a specific way to fix it. You dont need to be a complete gear head to play this game, but if you are (like me) it really helps out. It is a relaxing change of pace and a hidden gem amongst all the ""simulator"" games out there.			"

												There's a decent puzzle game in there, if you turn off the music, but it feels unfinished at best. All the test drive feel exactly the same (And the cars handle terribly), and getting to a given part requires camera acrobatics. The lack of documentation also hurts the experience, as does the absence of anything more complicated than ""Take part out, put new part in"".It'd be a nice time waster for $5.			"

												Working in the after market automotive industry I thought it worth my while to check this simulator out.  First of all I recommend this product not because it actually captures the essence of being a auto mechanic but because I felt this was an innovative concept worthy of people's attention. This game only introduces you to the very basics of being an auto mechanicI think that this simulator is a good bases of a game, but if the developer does not add levels of complexity in future versions I would not be willing to purchase in the future.  It would be a shame if the developer simply changes the look of the garages, adds a few cars and slaps a 2015 on the title.Being a mechanic is more than just diagnosing problems, taking parts off, and than putting them back on.  Imagine you are a mechanic and you have eight vehicles needing repaired with one bay and all eight customers wanting their car done now.  In addition, you have to battle the different part stores trying to locate the parts you need to complete the jobs.  It is a constant juggling act and this simulator does not even touch this aspect of being a mechanic.Further more, parts do not come off as easily as they do in this game.  Bolts seize, snap, and get cross threaded making the repair more difficult and resulting in a lot of lost time.  The time of the mechanic is very important.  The quicker the mechanic can complete the job the faster they get paid and get the next vehicle in their garage.  Mechanics receive their pay through their labor which is determined by the amount of time it takes to reasonably complete a repair job.  If a repair job takes longer than expected the mechanic loses money and has an upset customer.  This is also not captured in the simulator.This simulator does not let you misdiagnose a problem.  mechanics screw up all the time causing themselves lost time trying to fix the problem and make things right with their customer.  This game does not let you advance until you have complete the entire repair job correctly.Future versions of this game  could have a lot of potential.  If I was rating this game from 1 - 10 I would give it a 6.			"

When I am in between more serious games I enjoy the relaxation that I get from games like this.  It is well thought out and is priced fairly.  If you enjoy relaxing games, this would be one of the ones I would highly recommend.			"

												The spiritual successor to the 1999 Mekada developed game, Gearhead Garage. If you're like me, and was a huge fan of GHG and was patiently waiting for a sequel that never materialized, I'm happy to say that you'll finally be able to scratch the itch one more time.While Car Mechanic Simulator doesn't have as many features as I'd like, for example you can't completely tear down an engine (the block and all it's innards are inaccessible) but, there's a huge amount of features that really do a great job of simulating the act of car maintenance. Unlike Gearhead Garage where cars could be snapped back together in under a minute, things in CMS actually take time. All the bolts need to be twisted into place, parts need to be observed to determine if they're still good or need to be either repaired or replaced, and approach angles to get at certain parts that you can't reach from overhead or underneath.You're given a garage space which you can walk around in and interact with. Turn on the radio if you like, though most of the songs are terrible dubstep beats. There's a repair bench and a computer where you can do some online shopping and buy new or used parts. There's even an rig for draining oil that you can drag into place.In career mode you take work orders from customers who either know what the issue with their car is or just vaguely describe what happens when they drive. You can determine this yourself as well by taking the car for a test drive and seeing how it handles giving you some insight about the parts you should check.My biggest complaint is the camera is a little sluggish and takes time to zoom in and out some times making the bolt you're trying to reach very awkward.They are of course planning updates and expansions, my biggest of which (maybe for a future sequel) would be the ability to own and race your own cars as well as tear cars down completely. For now though, if you're a car guy or gal, considering it has zero competition, it's pretty fun. 7 / 10			"

												the most unfortunate aspect of car mechanic simulator 2014 is probably its visual and functional resemblence of car building-tuning-racing classics like (prehistoric) street rod and old but more recent street legal. expectations need to be right from the get-go - this is not a game of the same building-racing genre. there is no real tuning, there is no engine swaps, there is no bodywork, you will not have your own car to work on. and that is completely fine.this is a simulator of the somewhat boring life of car mechanic, complete with vague issue descriptions from car owners (at least in the campaign mode). and while there may be some aspects of the game that are not made in the best possible way, being true to its name is where this game undoubtedly excels.you get access to a garage and are given a car that needs a mechanic to fix it on a given budget. rinse and repeat. there, that is the entire game.more precisely you do get access to 3 garages over time with increasingly better interior and a different added diagnostic/tool. from start, you can test drive cars and use odb tool, with the second garage you get brakes and suspension test track and with the third - ability of chiptuning.you can work on engine, exhaust and suspension of the car, naturally it's simplified and streamlined but works surprisingly well. the goal - diagnose and fix the car. you can either use diagnostic tools in your disposal or just look at each part manually. looking at deeper parts mostly requires dismantling to actually get to these deeper parts which will take more time and be more annoying (as it is in real life). state of parts can be highlighted with colorcoding from green to red which will be very helpful to give a good overview.campaign consists of 75 broken cars with predetermined scenarios with descriptions sounding from serious to hilarious and i recognized more than one that i myself have given to a car mechanic. you will also get a list of (vague) objectives that you need to complete. you can also play endless more which is mostly the same but with no worded issue descriptions and generally goal being ""fix all the broken parts"". in both campaign and endless, you can level up 4 aspects of yourself which ultimately make things just faster - not significant but this provides some very welcome bits of convenience.now, to the not-so-good side of things, in no particular order:- detection of parts to be fixed is rigid. a broken part must always be replaced with new, 100% part. understandable, but very annoying. say you need to change a wheel. you may have taken off two wheels and one looked good enough at 98% and you bought only one new wheel. if you happen to put that 98% to where a new one was supposed to go it will not count as fixed. - coupled with the previous point, used parts store is much more trouble than its worth and after a couple failed attempts i stopped looking at that completely.- camera, oh that camera. i can understand that camera in a game like this is very difficult to do but they could do just a bit better, right? click on a part will try to center camera on the part, often causing you to try and aim the camera again. there are couple parts that are difficult to remove due to camera - drive shafts, i am looking at you!- driving in test drive feels utterly disconnected. that's not the focus of the game and cars do feel considerably different based on fwd/rwd/awd but it just fails to actually feel nice.to summarize - it does provide a very calm and relaxing fun virtually fixing virtual cars. i spent a lot more time playing this than i initially expected to.

												Buy Car Mechanic SimulatorI think this is best way to start my review i have played my fair share of simulators on and off Steam and Car Mechanic Simulator is one i have been craving for very long time i have been around and working on cars since 12 years old so i have good knowledge of cars and there workings.First appearance of the game when we start up is clean and simple which are good but some option need to be added which they will in upcoming patch.We start career mode and get under way graphics are good for simulator maybe little heavy on the reflection nice chrome texture we get first job you have job sheet which gives you rough idea what issue maybe and you need to find and fix this issue in start this can be little tricky but there are some things you can use to help make game play easier with high lighted parts etcControls are very nice and smooth once setup feel great no major issuesTest drive mode is low on scale but does help in sourcing the issues same with the scanner etcmission do slowly get harder and harder but for some people they might find it repetitive but i liked it its not to hard so some one with no car knowledge could play itIt took me around 20 hours to complete the game which is good for simulator and developers have been more than helpful when facing an issue and im looking forward to DLC and possible 2015 version its a game which as lots of space to grow and become bigger i hope the developers run with that and build on what they have.Some people wont like the game and some will and for what the game is the price is rightmy rating is 10/10			"

												I was really impressed by the fact that you can drive the cars, since I originally thought it was just fixing them in the garage. It is realistic to a point but way simplified, so if you know nothing about mechanics (like me) it's not an issue. Gameplay can get a tad repetetive at times, but I find a feeling of satisfaction when you know exactly what the problem is, can quickly fix it and get your payout and move on to a more challenging job.PROS--Addictive, interesting gameplay-A variety (albeit small) of environments-Job satisfaction-Fun problem solvingCONS--After a while, gameplay can get repetetive-You can find yourself spending ages on one job, because you just can't figure out the problem.-Some jobs are not specific enough, the might say ""find the problem"" and you also have to fix/replace all the parts to do with the problem, which was not clearly explained.-Driving mechanics are not brilliant-Controls can be fiddly when examining the car.OVERALL RATING: 7/10			"

												Greater variation would have been a welcome addition to this game. More extensive access to components would have made for a more realistic challenge, i.e. being able to do simplified engine rebuilds etc. The tuning component may as well not have been in the game. There doesn't seem to be much sense in trying to get three bars to match at a certain percentage through trial and error.Nonetheless, it took up a few hours and if you are looking for a mechanic simulator game....go ahead, but it dit get a bit boring and repetitive towards the end.

												Who expected Gearhead Garage 2.0 will be disappointed. Who did not may actually enjoy this game. I expceted some ""new GG"" and bought the game on Steam Sale without really checking it on some gameplay video.Here are my main problems with the game.The UI design and general controls are really touching my nerve. How camera works and how you actually select and use various parts is not very well designed. It lacks some swiftness, it feels really clumsy. Also - the game touches only the surface, it does not go deep, it is very basic level of simulation. One example for all - if you need to determine what is wrong with the car, you just take it to the same track every time, doing exactly the same things and then it will automatically show you which exact parts are damaged or busted. Another example? Starter, that was worned out to the point it showed only 5 % of it's ""health"" was repaired back to full 100 %. I mean, why do even need spare parts then, if it works like that? Oh and the soundtrack...I'm only grateful, that you can turn the radio in your workshop off...It's hard to explain. The game looks good, but I can only recommend you to see some gameplay videos and decide after that.Maybe I'm just not the target audience, maybe this game is supposed to be for little kids (please explain?). But 20 € for this is hugely overpriced. Even when on -66% Steam sale I would consider if this is a good deal, if I'd had another chance.			"

												I bought Car Mechanic 2014 last year and thought it was going to be a great game to try since I like to work on cars in real life. My laptop and desk top PC could not handle the graphics so I couldn't play it. I kept the game in hope to get a better PC that could run the graphics. It was worth the wait! I got a gaming PC and played the game with complete enjoyment. The game did crash a couple of times at first but was fixed with the latest updates and works like a charm! I stayed up last night and finished all 76 orders in career and 4x4 and now am working on the tuning. Oh by the way, you get a very cool car when you finish all the orders in career! I took it for a test drive and it is fast! Loved the suprise! Now I have unlimited play unlocked and may never sleep again, lol!   If your going to get this game, which I highly recommend, make sure your gaming device (PC or Laptop) can handle it! Check the  specs for details! You start out small in a hole in the wall garage and work your way up to a nice fancy garage with a test path and a dyno to do chip testing so you can boost up the HP (horse power) of the car! There is a way to set up the chip without just clicking the + or - countless times to get that perfect setting. I figured it out after a few tries when I noticed how they move. You'll see what I mean when you play it. Another feature I like is the test track outside the garage! The career track is straight forward marked off with cones that you try not to hit to complete each of the 4 test runs. The 4x4 has the same test track but with mounds of dirt to really test the suspension and can be very hard to controll but do-able if your careful. Then the tuning track which is a straight 1/4 mile track to test the cars for drag racing, which by the way has it's own upgrades in the garage to buy to boost HP. Love that! I have had no glitches in the game play at all since the updates and really enjoyed my time playing it! 2 thumbs up!This game is worth the money you pay for it!			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is a very basic representation of automotive repair, you really need to have at least some interest in automobiles or an interest in being a handyman to find enjoyment in this game. You'll delve into the life of an automotive mechanic, starting out in a basic ""shade tree"" style garage and work your way into more professional garages, which is a neat.The depth of which the game delves into auto-repair in my experience with the game so far, has been very basic; but a couple steps above ""Gearhead Garage"" of yester-year. If you aren't very knowledgable in the automotive service arena, you might find this game entertaining in it's own right.However, if you are knowledgable with cars and car repair; you're going to find yourself pointing out flaws in the details of this game. For example: The lower suspension arm on the cars in game doesn't look like it would work because only one side that mounts to the chassis is designed to pivot while the other side is a solid mount. And $200 oil changes.Beyond that, the camera movement controls can be frustrating at times. In dissassemble/assemble mode the camera orbits around a selected object, which often makes some parts difficult to select or view. Once you get used to it you'll figure out quickly how to work around it.The test drive feature is pretty much useless in my experience with the game, I've test driven cars numberous times and this feature just doesn't communicate problems like you'd expect. I've never heard an odd sound, or experienced problems with the handling or performance of cars I've test driven. And if you have any knowledge of cars at all you can pretty much track down issues with just a few clicks of the mouse.If you're an autoentusiast like myself, I don't think this game will scratch that tinkering itch for very long. If you aren't an autoenthusiast, or very knowledgable of automobiles; this game could serve as a basic introduction to auto repair.But the important question is: ""Is it fun?"" Sure, I enjoyed playing it for a little while; but due to certain details and a lack of interesting cars to work on, I lost interest.			"

												While this game is surely not Gearhead Garage, for me, it worth it's price (Also, there are V6 engines, not only i4's). Overally, it is what it looks like: a cheap X. Y. Simulator <insertyearhere> (but one of the better). It does not have a manual, or a proper tutorial, so if you do not know a bit about cars, you might need to watch some community tutorials (when they will be available). The Career mode is much longer than what you would expect, after 4 or 5 hours I am still not finished or bored. There is an endless play mode, too.I'd recommend this game for those who enjoyed games like Street Rod or Gearhead Garage.Dear Dev's!Thank you for this fine game, and also for the fair pricing. Nice job!			"

												One of the best Simulator titles in the market. At first might be a little difficult for people who doesn't know a lot about cars but after a while it gets simple.+Cars aren't 100% accurate but people who doesn't know a thing about inside of a car can get general idea about how stuff works.+Upgrade system, a nice addition to the game which could be improved even furthermore.+Variety of cars and parts.+Progression of your garage, makes you feel like you're doing progress, not just fixing never ending cars.-Freedrive feels like a chore just to get wheels of a car marked. No mater if they're at 1% or 100% they still feel the same while driving.-Too much of dynamic movements. Camera is never steady, when you focus on some part of the car and remove it, camera jumps into some other place so you accidently click on wrong part again and again. "

												 I hope content comes flying out. I want more types of suspension, more vehicles. FIS,Solid Axles, 3/4 link. I want lift installs with the 4X4 pack. I want more motors, I want MPFI motors under the hoods of the newer looking cars, old motors for the old ones. Basically for people who are real world mechanics. This game has absolutely no appeal. Not near enough parts, not near enough realism. Using the money you guys earn from this very basic, very learning curve game. You should be able to blow our minds with the next one. If you developers lack deep pockets for 3D animations, higher graphics pixles, you really only got the ability to make different types of cars, and more parts. Atleast having so many more parts or things to do on more vehicles may reduce the notice that the graphics per part already in the game are just not good. I dont think your big enough developers to buy real world Trademarks, but that investment would pay back 20times. I would love to work on an old international scout 2 terra. Maybe an old Bronco 2. At the same time I do want to pop the hood on a new 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee, V6 diesel with the 8 speed tranny!!   Get it done guys and you will have a game that would make tons of money, and even chance leading Tech institutes to purchase your game as a training program.			"

												I was really expecting more from this game, arguably too much, perhaps, but still. There are multiple elements of the game which while they exist, seem to serve no other purpose other than a tick box to check. In particular I'm referring to the Test Drive and/or Diagnosis Path, which no matter the problem with the car, is just a short series of actions to do before returning to the workshop essentially none the wiser of the problem as it plays out the same every single time.This, however, doesn't even present a problem as once you've had 5 minutes of gameplay, you quickly see that the whole repair is simply a case of looking for the grubby/rusty looking part, removing it and replacing it. You barely need to look at the description at all.As others have also said, the gameplay is just simply not deep enough to be challenging or rewarding in any way. Just plays out as a time sink with little to no pay off. Thankfully I picked this up for very cheap in a sale, but definitely not worth full price and wouldn't consider it a ""sim"" at all.			"

												Very fun, High learning curve if you don't understand vehicles.  Also, high learning curve if you do, later in game you have to find out where to locate certain items on your own (I learned with YouTube).  It's very addicting.  My only complaint is that all the vehicles have the same structure, everything looks exactly the same, which leads to annoying redundancy.  However, besides that, I'm still playing and love it.			"

												Okay, this game is actually better than you would expect. You can't get into the engine blocks or heads, but pretty much everything else that a mechanic would have to deal with on a vehicle from a 4 banger engine up to a V8. The parts in the cars are all set up the same, give or take, so you're not learning Ford, Chevy and Dodge etc. You have the option to repair certain parts to save money. All in all WELL WORTH the  money if you are even slightly interested in Simulators or Car Mechanics.			"

												I have been looking forward to this Game for a long time! I am working on cars a lot and so I know exactly what they want me to do or what has to be done from the Description of the job. But it sometimes is challenging because they get you an description of the problem but not what parts have to be changed (""There's a rattling and after 15 minutes it stops...""). I can only imagine that people who have no mechanical knowledge cant figure out what to do!So if you know the mechanical basics of a car and you loved Gearhead Garage than this Game is an absolute Must Have! For everyone who tries to learn something new (and probably soon with the help of walktrough's) this is worth a try. Like said before, try not to spend too much money (always keep up to 2000$), because is once short on money you have to restart the career... Apart from that, for the small price it is a Must Have for mechanical Enthusiasts! "

												First and foremost, this game is by no means anything but what it claims to be.  Don't expect uber racetracks or incredible realism when you take the car out for a test drive.  It's a mechanic game, after all.  With that being said, this game is not an accurate depiction of working on a real car (as many, many other reviewers pointed out).  It does, however, feel like a good approximation in terms of where a video game should go without overcomplicating or oversimplifying the game.If you're a real automotive mechanic, then you already do this kind of stuff enough, and don't need to buy this game.  If you're a realism nazi, then don't buy this game...or any video game...just go do real world stuff.  If you're looking for a game with uber fast paced acion, then this game isn't for you.  If you're someone like me who like to dink around with random game titles, then by all means, get this game at the current sale price and have some fun with it. "

												Very interesting game for people who either have basic knowledge about cars, or trying to learn about it. I suppose it's really possible to find a solution for every mission by checking every single part on the car and replacing it but this would be quite boring and mundane so I really don't think it's for people who are clueless about the thematic. Sometimes customer has an idea what's going on and tells you straight up, sometimes they just want you to repair all the damaged parts and it can be difficult to narrow down the last part or two that need repair/replacement.In terms of reality/simulation it's definitely simplified but the game is featuring all basic parts and especially the usual suspects that mechanics are dealing with. A lot of missions are based on changing oil, filters, or timing but then again I guess this is most common in reality as well. Progression is such that you start in a basic garage, and as you work through the missions you gain access to better garage with additional tools for tuning vehicles. You can also shop for upgrades (faster unbolting, discount at parts shop, etc.)I would add that on graphics side it's really well done, the parts look very realistic. Damage can also be observed visually, for example worn rubber, or corroded metal can indicate that part needs replacement before even checking it out.One negative that I would mention is lack of absolutely any kind of help or tutorial system - you're completely on your own. I guess this can really put off a number of people who are not really familiar with all of this.			"

												I recommend this game solely because it is fun.  But it leaves a lot to be desired.  This is a review about as game that could have been much better, and instead is just a fun play if you get it cheap.The ""simulation"" aspect is weak.  I am not saying that the game is bad, I am saying that I wish it was better.  For instance, a customer's car won't start:  I thought it would be a good idea to check the battery cables but alas there are none.  There are also no radiators, no fluid in the transmissions, no tire pressure, the list goes on.  The game also features repairs of an individual part; you can, apparently, repair a water pump!  I have never known a mechanic to repair something like that.  Maybe it can be done but typically they just install a new part on your car and charge you for it.  The only part-repairs I have seen are things like splicing wires or welding a busted exhaust pipe.  Simple stuff.The pricing is crazy too.  People are spending over 10,000 USD to repair used cars.  Things like a new battery cost 350 USD even though they can typically be had for under 100 USD in real life.  Other things are odd too, spark plugs are 35 USD but again in real life they are perhaps 2-5 USD.  The game play gets tiring.  In the beginning you are using your mind to try and troubleshoot problems and find a damaged part.  As the game goes on you learn to, 1: diagnostic scan; 2: test drive; 3: path test; 4: click hide body and show part condition.  9/10 times it will show the damaged parts in red and then you just have to spend the time disassembling the vehicle.  The only time this won't show you the damaged part is if its in the transmission or if its the air filter.  Very little challenge at that point.The 4X4 add on is a good idea but it mostly consists of unlicensed Jeep Wrangler models.  Not One Pickup, Not on Land Rover, Not One V8, Not One Lift Kit.The 1/4 mile add on is the best part of the game.  In the beginning you have limited money to upgrade the parts and tune a car to hit a 1/4 mile time.  This too grows easy over time as the budget increases you start having enough money to simply buy ALL the performance parts for each car.  Most of the bolt-ons give ridiculous amounts of extra power.  Worst of all, there are no Cold Air Intakes in a performance shop - just crazy.  Unfortunately, while drag racing there is no shifting to be done by the player even though many of the vehicles have manual transmissions.  What a shame, its one of the main aspects of drag racing titles that you find on your mobile phone.This could have been an incredible game - and I hope they make another one, because developers can usually build on simulations until they are truly great.  For now, its a fun game and I gladly played through the whole thing.  I think its enjoyable, but it won't give you any real world knowledge.  It might be damaging if you learned that its normal to pay 800 USD for a mechanic to install a new battery, or perhaps you think that your transmission ought not have any fluid in it.  I don't consider this any more educational than I do Need For Speed Hot Pursuit.  But its still fun - Happy Gaming.			"

												Fun game to fool around. But not that easy if you have no clue about cars. Like me...I thought I would learn some new stuff about cars, and I actually did. But after your second repair you are left alone in the dark. No tutorial, no help, just fix this cars problem. I did fix a couple of cars. And I must say, I did enjoy searching for a solution. But it is hard to find the problems when you have no clue what to look for.Overall it was an okay experience, and now I know what those scamming garagists do to my car when I bring em in.			"

What is with the first person interface? Is the shop on a boat?Some of the parts are very difficult to get in view of the camera.I'd love to see more detailed engines, some cut scenes would be nice, a project car for your mechanic to work on on the side would be cool. High performance parts.. Engine noise troubleshooting with actual sound clips would be really neat. Overall it's a pretty great game. Well worth the 15-20 bucks.			"

												At first, the game is just telling you about how to move around, and interact with some objects, and then begin with first order.This game lacks explanation and direction. I wandered around the garage and tried anything just to understand what to do.Definitely needs better tutorial.The camera is shaky and too much mouse sensitivity when in first person mode. The mouse sensitivity is acceptable when in inspect mode.I don't know much about car components and such, but I can feel that this game displays all those components in such detail, even how to assemble and disassemble parts. And I didn't expect there is a test drive feature, where you can drive the car to test acceleration, breaking, etc.Fun game, and unique gaming experience.7/10			"

												I like this game. It's nothing more than a basic simulator on garage repair. It may not hold all the detail needs of work but it is a game. Your given a work order to fix a problem. On the work order is the budget amout for parts you may need. So you get to see the mechanic fustration of a small budget with a customer who wants one thing replaced and the vehicle has all thease other problems too. Some parts can be repaired on the work bench such as starters, altenator, and what not. You go through the mechanic foot steps on inspecting parts by means of trouble shooting and problem solving. Not much different than a regular car repair. Just like fixing a real car you go through the pains of having to take parts off to get to the ones you need to replace. How ever unlike a real car everything comes off perfact. The only thing I find useless in the game so far is the OBD scanner. It is sopose to trouble shoot problems depending on any failuer that is given to the on board computer from the sensors. It dose nothing but just scan and tells you nothing. And you can't hook to the computer in the shop to get a reading. Other than that its good game. Just like real Mechanic work, this game may not be for everyone.			"

												I sure hope you like undoing and doing the same bolts over and over and over again because that's a good 80% of the gameplay. The different vehicles appear to have virtually identical underpinnings and most jobs start off with taking off the wheels, the brake caliper, the two brake pads and the brake disc, then repeating on the other side and on it goes.Even for a sim enthusiast this is pretty dry stuff. There's no decision making about how to expand your business, or a choice of cars to repair, or hunting down cheap parts (well I did find cheap, worn parts on the 2nd hand market, but I wasn't able to install it in the car as they always appear to request new parts and not all of them can be repaired).Like a regular grease monkey, you just do your job, rinse and repeat. Not fun.			"

												What needs to be added is radiators need work, fans that go out, heater cores, thermostat replacement, air conditioners, electrical issues.  Headlights go out as well as tail lights, blinker issues, check engine light issues, the use of the diagnostic meter in game is a joke.  Most automobiles have on board computer issues that need attention, even in dash nav, radio, and systems all tied to electrical.   Inclusive, if you repair parts at a workbench, make the workbench work like the parts computer where one actually can rebuild issues with alternators, water pumps, brake cylindars, etc...  Even a fuse box would be nice to work with as well.  What of gear boxes and transmissions?  That too could be expanded at a repair counter.  Just adding more cars is only eye candy to the game if you're only repairing the same ole things over and over again. Simulators need lots of immersion where you don't complete a game in 48 hours.  Overall its a great simulator but needs more, lots more.			"

												Totally awesome. This is the best simulation game I have ever played. It really helps your mechanical knowledge and its just fun.   The tutorial hints for this game a seriously small and don't give you all the details, but it does that so you can figure it out for yourself. Most entertaining car based game I have played since Next Car Game. If this simulator could put the repair and replace part options from this game, and put it into Next Car Game. That would be the best combination of mechanical and car racing/smashing ever made. It would make it very realistic, if you race with a car, and you have to replace damaged parts and wear and tear. Just like the pit crews at every racing event have to do. Only it just you, unles you hire people NPC's to help you. Awesome ideas. I love this simulator, 10/10. :-)			"

												For me this is not a game it is more like a basic where is game, where is the air filter, oil filter, back box for the exhaust.I feel that this would suite children interested in been a mechanic or someone going infor there test in the UK that requires to know where to fill up the oil and give general pointers but nothing percific (people that know nothing about cars).For me, I dont klnow a lot about modern cars but know enough to change a ball joint, cv joint and drive shaft etc, I find this game a little tad on the boring side as I know where the problems are or the area when a vaige description is given in the work chart.I find the game is massivley lacking something as there is little challenge and as I said I think this game is more towards  children or people that know nothing about car's that may find the game a challenge.Personally in my opinion, I was interested in this game as I thought it might give me more of a insight of whats in new cars as I was brought up with the good old carberetta and none of this modern sensor's that put up the price when a car breaks down.As I say in my opinion the game price is a little high as my 14 year old daughter finds the game to easy and she knows nothing about cars but saying that it has made her aware of where things are in a car so its more of a early age educational tool more then a simulator.I would rate this game in the budget type game for price like max £6, educational tool for children and people that are going for there test in the UK to know where partts are on a car like oil filter and tires.. lolThe educational aspect is the only reason I recogmend this game, if you have an idea of what your doing under the bonet of a car stay away..

 Recommendation  Recommended to purchase  Base Game Score  B-  Style  Simulator  Recommendation Summary  Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is a simulator in which you repair cars as a mechanic. It is a fun little game, and is even somewhat educational. Even if you are not into cars, you will still enjoy this game, whether you play it passively as you listen to music or a podcast, or actively with no distractions. The game does glitch sometimes, and it also can get frustrating when you can't find the cause of the car's problems.However, the game is still recommended to purchase.			"

Exhaust manifolds which bolt to the engine block rather then the head and which cant be removed without disassembling the entire exhaust system first. Front engined RWD cars with transversely mounted engines. Brake systems with no master cylinder and induction systems with no injectors or throttle body. Suspension arms that bolt rigidly to the spindles with no ball joints. Batteries and suspension arms that can be rebuilt at a workbench (just let me get my hammer...). The list goes on. So a cute idea, but they should have perhaps involved an actual mechanic. I'm still kind of curious about the sequel but I won't be paying full price for it.			"

												Although it's not a 100% accurate simulator, it's a right tool to learn where the several components of a vehicle are positioned in the insides, how they interact with each other and how they affect the overall performance of the car.The realism is purposely not driven to astoundishing levels: in real life you don't have ""chassis-hiding X-ray"" sight or ""let's see how much worn-out this component is"" sight, a 5 hours work such as replacing a whole clutch can be made in less than 5 minutes, but you still have to reach the component by disassembling the others that are in the way, in this case components such as the gearbox, drive axles, and the wheels.If you're expecting an hardcore car repairing simulator you'll be disappointed, but if' you're looking for something more ""educational"" this is the right game.

												Incredibly dull and repetitive after the first few cars. It's the exact same car for 20 levels then the same one for another 20, and all you do is buy a part, spend 5 minutes hovering your mouse over bolts with no variation in routine, and replace it (and occasionally save a few bucks by pressing x to repair a part instead). There is pretty much no way to mess up, you can't do anything interesting (like maybe steal parts or something) and I (being someone who knows nothing about cars) am fairly sure nothing even happens at all when you run it through the course or diagnostic machine. Maybe it gets better after you reach the third garage, but no. Not even worth the two bucks.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator is an immersive mecahnic experience!  The attention to detail, and accompanyment of not just two, but THREE amazing musical arrangements ranging from EDM, ROCK, and DUBSTEP really help to make you feel like you are in there getting your own hands dirty.  I was blown away by the 5-click-to-remove-anything system they implemented which takes all of the ""work"" out of working on cars and lets you focus on the fun aspect of being a mechanic, the internet!  Ordering parts is all done online in this future car maintenence simulator.  I haven't even mentioned yet, but the parts ordering system is so forward looking!  There are two options to purchase parts, new, and junkyard salvage.  Using the junkyard salvaged parts has the added benefit of not serving a single purpose in the game.  These second rate parts can be bought for real(see fake) money, installed, then removed and replaced with new ones after you discover that junkyard sourcing is not acceptable for any application.  This game has tought me the importance of a 3 track mixCD, and that a car can be completely taken apart in just about 200 clicks IRL!  Buy this game!  You won't regret it for at LEAST 25 mins.			"

												The amount of detail put into the mechanical process of the vehicles is great. It is just like working in a real Garage. The only reason why I am giving this a thumbs down, is because you often find yourself doing the same thing over and over again. Eventually you upgrade to better garages, but you are still doing the same missions as before (although you get a few new features). Now that Car Mechanic SImulator 2015 is out, I hope they have fixed this and made it more entertaining than ever before.			"

												Love games like this, its kind of the spiritual sucessor to an old game called gear head garage. No knowledge of cars is really needed as the parts are clearly labelled and what you have to remove to gain access to the part you need is highlighted. My only real complaint is that you have to be in specific positions to remove specific parts, this is OK generally but there are situations where you have to switch to using the ramp and back for parts that are right next to each other. Other then that, brilliant game.			"

												This is my first review, I normally do not make reviews but I seen a lot of people bashing this game. This game is not need for speed, you do not upgrade cars or make them faster. It's simply a game where you repair customers cars. If you ever played gear head garage and liked it you will like this game. The game can get old pretty quick, it becomes a puzzle sometimes repairing cars but that's what happens in real life to a mechanic. The test track is useless and doesn't offer any real way of trouble shooting what's wrong with a car. If the clutch is bad the car still drives fine etc.The career mode is repetitive and towards the end offers nothing except the enjoyment of fixing cars. They have only two different motors so far and I'm towards the end. You only replace basic parts on the car. Nothing internal in the engine itself just external stuff. The game is simple and if you do not know much about cars you could kinda learn the basics from this game. I recommend this if your a car/motor enthusiast but if your looking for something on the lines of NFS stay away.			"

												visual part damage would be an improvement, if you know youre way around a car some of the symptoms and faults can easily lead you to what basic parts are faulty.  After awhile the variety of work becomes limited.  More indepth levels involve guess work and going through every part although you only deal with bolt on engine parts as apposed to breaking down the engine to deal with the more advance workings.  There are older garage games like redline that have far more detail in building cars from the ground up and repairing salvagable cars.   Graphically the game looks nice though and would be more suitable to people unfamiliar to basic car mechanics, 6 out of 10.			"

There is a bit of mouse lag but nothing any one can't deal with but would be a great idear to looking in to getting it fixed.3 . More cars some super cars 4x4's rear wheel drive cars all that lot some v8's an v12's.5. What others are saying being able to buy really wrecked cars an just do them up then sell them on that would be great.6. Fine tunning the test driving part of the game. But other than that great little sim theres a lot that can be done with it almost enless stuff they can do. lets hope they will put the profits back in to the game to make it better.			"

												Calling it a simulator is a bit of a  stretch. When I hear the word simulator in a gaming context, I think of intracacy and attention to detail in design, and an attempt by the developer to make the experience as close as possible to the real thing (whatever it may be). That said, Car Simulator 2014 is definitely not a simulator. As others have said, it's more like a car mechanic themed puzzle game.The gameplay is relatively simple: you get three different functions when interacting with the parts of several different cars (analyze, remove, and install). Parts on the vehicle are colour coded, ranging from red (bad) to green (good), with percentage values. You'll get repair orders, always with some description that will hint at the problem (e.g. ""my car won't start""), and then you use the tools and the aforesaid functions to solve it. You start out with a basic garage, but eventually you progress to two better shops; the second shop comes with the ability to path test vehicles (a minigame that analyzes suspension and brakes) and, additionally, a module for chip tuning vehicles in the last. In all of the shops you have the ability to take drivable vehicles on a test drive, which is yet another way to check for damage to parts without having to tear the vehicle apart - it's not very fun, and a little clumsy, but it gets the job done.What I like: * There are several different models of vehicles, many with different arrangements of parts (e.g. ""V6"" versus four cylinder, 4x4 versus 2wd)* The visuals are nice for a game of such small scale* Some progression (spend money to make bolt removal quicker, for example)* The interface is simple and relatively intuitive: you can hide the car body and turn on a filter to show the condition of partsWhat I didn't like:* Realism isn't a big factor in the design of this game at all (e.g. an air filter will keep the engine from running)* The number of parts is quite limited; some front-end pieces, brakes and wheels, and stuff around the motor - you'll never see the inside of the crankcase* Customers don't pay for parts or labour; they pay a flat rate, and your profit is what's left over after you've bought the replacement parts (or repaired the limited number of repairable ones)* Despite the limited progression above, the game becomes very repetitiveSummary:If you're looking for a simple (if not simplistic) puzzle-like mechanic game, then you might get some enjoyment out of it. But, if you're looking for a proper simulation of car repair or running a shop, then you may be disappointed with the limits of Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. I was hoping for the latter, and I was disappointed by the limitations of the game, but I did enjoy tooling around with it for a few hours.			"

												Fun puzzle game. Executed reasonably well. If you ever played Gearhead Garage, then you're in for a treat. It is essentialy that game, but in a modern package. It is in some cases much more realistic than Gearhead Garage. There are more aspects of being a mechanic than just assembling and disassembling cars depicted. I really liked the game, but i have few things that are less than ideal.Unfortunately you cannot disassemble the whole car- engine is almost monolitic, there are parts of the suspension that are non interactive. Also there is no way to disassemble the body of the car.Part of the game is test-driving a car. Unfortunately it is almost the same every time. Car drives the same way no matter what faults it has- you don't hear additional noises parts of the suspension are shot, there is no indication that steering is off or if there are problems with the ignition or anything else. The only diferences between cars are acceleration rates and interior design. It works like this- there are parts of the suspension that cannot be examined to see if they are broken unless you disassemble them or take the test drive. Also sometimes it is required by a client for you to test drive the car and there is no way around it. All these things make the test drive fun for one maybe two times, then it becomes more of a chore than fun. Thankfully test driving a car takes about 1-2 minutes, so unless you play for a long time it will not bother you much. Don't get me wrong- i absolutely like the idea of test driving a car. I just would expect it to be more consequential and let the player to figure out what's wrong with the car instead of giving him an answer.The last thing i'm going to complain about is number car models and parts you can buy. I hope developers will add more cars and parts to the game, but now there are two different engines and i belive there are 3 types of suspension, but there are no real diferences in them beside names of the parts that were used. To sum up- I played 6 hours and I think i saw all the content there is to see, but i cannot say for certain. What i saw so far was mostly good. If you like this type of game (which is essentialy a 3d puzzle game) you'll have a good time, but keep in mind before you decide if you are going to buy it- at the time of writing this, game is somewhat limited, there is no much variety when it comes to cars. Game is rather easy, but i believe there is almost no competition- if you look for similar things look for gearhead garage (a bit dated, but i think still playable).			"

												Let's first define this game. Most people sees this game as similar to 2 games: Street Rod and Gearhead Garage. To be honest, it doesn't have much in common with the first one, as in SR your main goal was to race, and tune your car rather than repair it. From the other hand it's also not exactly Gearhead Garage, as in that one your main goal was to buy a car, repair it and re-sell. You exactly knew what’s broken in the car you had and you just had to click through repair process.This game is actually about diagnosing, repairing cars and charging people for that. You don't have everything given at the beginning and you have to figure out what's wrong on your own. It has a good learning curve, however it’s good to have at least some basic knowledge of what car consist of. At the beginning you only have access to test drive, but later on you get more powerful test tools, but also you get harder and harder tasks with not clear description.I can definitely recommend that game to any car fan and to anyone who wants to get some basic knowledge of what can break in his car, and how to repair it. It has a good example of what happens when you don’t have required knowledge and the garage can charge you thousands $$ for things as simple as change of the air filter. With it's price, and promise from developers to add new content soon, it's definitely worth getting.The only cons are no real tutorial for people not knowing basics of car mechanics, and small variety of cars/engines.It also has some references to Street Rod and to old Polish car history, but you have to find them on your own :) "

												Not a full simulator in any way, but it has increased my general knowledge of cars.It's a fun game to play when you want to relax and unwind, or just when you need to pass a half hour, here and there. But once you have completed a fair few ""missions"" you can find the game to be repetitive (especially if you're like me and take all four wheels and track rods off just to change an air filter (it takes a lot of wrench work!)) However I'm not bored of this game after 4 hours, but I do wish it had some achievements.Should a sequel be released, I'd hope for more ways to fix the cars, as in this iteration, although you can do a lot of work on the cars, you can't change anything in the interior of the vehicle, and you can't work deep within the engine. You can change belts and starters and gearboxes; but pistons and manifolds are out of reach, sealed in the engine block. Maybe add some cosmetic work too? Someone brings their car to you because they want a dent removed, or it repainted? That'll be fun! Maybe even work on your own car/garage with the money you earn?So to summarise, it's a fun game, even more fun than I expected from a game called ""Car Mechanic Simulator 2014"", but in the next one I'd like to see a lot more jobs and mission variation.

												Nice to see a refreshingly different title but it's not entirely realistic. For example, you'd never change your oil and not change the filter at the same time and if your brake discs are worn out, you would normally change the pads with them as well. Coming from a background where I work in a parts department at a local car garage, it is easy for me to spot these little details but at the same time someone who doesn't know about cars wouldn't necessarily know to do those things.Despite these minor details, it is actually a really good way to introduce someone to how a car works because it keeps things simple enough so that it is easy to understand but goes into enough detail to make it interesting to the casual audience or people who may well be just getting interested in cars. It does end up getting a little repetitive and that may put some people off and for the petrolheads out there, some different layouts for engines/mechanics would help to mix things up a bit more but ultimately, I enjoyed this.

												Some people are complaining that this isn't as detailed as they'd like it to be, or that it's not a true mechanic simulator.  I don't think it's meant to be...otherwise we could use this as the first step in a Mechanics qualification.  (Which would be cool by the way!)I like to think of it as a puzzle game.  I mean, what is being a mechanic, if it's not a puzzle?  You have to find out what's wrong and fix it.  Same thing here.  Except, it doesn't overwhelm the player with all the aspects of being a mechanic.I would've liked a bit more of a tutorial, especially when you get your new garages, as when I got the 3rd garage, it asked me to do a chip tuning.  I had no idea what this meant.  Just looking around, I found a new door...went in, and then haphazardly clicked on things, until it worked.  Yeah, there's a little 'guide' in the chip tuning, but it doesn't tell you much.It might get repetitive...but, think about it.  If you're a proper mechanic, surely you've done the same things over and over...so it does give you a sense of what it's like in that respect.The only downside...is the test track.  On the repair orders, it could say ""There's a horrid noise when I change gear"", or ""When I go faster, there's this whining from the rear of my car.""Well...there isn't.  When you get one of those jobs, and go out in the car...you expect to hear what the client is talking about...but you don't.  That would've been a great thing...to hear and feel the car handling differently, based on what was wrong.  But, it seems that the test track, and even the path test indoors, are just formalities, with no real indication to you, the player, as to what's wrong.  It's just a way to automatically highlight problems when you're examining the car.It would've been so much nicer, and realistic, if these problems were actually in the test track area...The only one that is reflected in the test track...is when the problem is, that the car wont even start.  At least that one's there...lol.This is a Car Mechanic simulator, as much as Farming Simulator is a simulator for farming.  It's got the basics, and honestly, if they added more, it could be so much better.  The framework is there...I enjoy this game, and I can see myself playing for a long time.  Especially if they let the modding community at it.			"

												Picked this one up on sale and out of curiosity about how realistic it was. And while it won't be the most realistic game or fully-deserving of the title ""simulator"" it is definitely a few hours worth of perfect balance between realism and fun that should give you your money's worth. It even has a decent EDM/Dubstep soundtrack(that you can disable if it isn't your thing) that makes this game one I recommend, even if only when it's on-sale.			"

												I think this game is really good, the graphics are astounding and the gameplay is of the same quality, a really informative game althought it does seem to require the slightest bit of entry level mechanical knowledge, but even if you are lacking in that the game isn't too hard to pick up. Some things can be a bit iffy but overall the game is a 9/10 in my books			"

												Being an ASE certified Automotive Technician I wasnt entirely certain what to expect from a game portraying the complexity of my field. A few hours in I can say that the game does an excellent job bordering the tediousness of certain things with making it interesting to try and diagnose the various amount of problems that a vehicle can have,while also trimming the fat on some of the non essentials pertaining to the functionality of the car. If you have ever fancied your hand at seeing a little of what the automotive world is like I would recommend giving this game a shot.			"

												I enjoyed this game a lot. When I read negative reviews I nearly didnt buy it and that would have been a shame. I had so much fun :)I read some people complaining about it being too hard unless you're already a mechanic. I have to agree that I dont think this game is for young kids. It is for the mechanics/car interested teen/adult. It was perfect for me because I only knew a little about car mechanics and now I have learned a lot. The game is quite small but the game play part of troubleshooting and using diagnostic tools is nice. The description say ""Deal with customers"" but the only part I have seen is an order report, so I never actually saw any customers or had dialogue with them. That also makes it hard to know what customers actually want fixed. Eg. ""Replace all damaged parts"" does that mean you want everything less than 100% condition repaired or is 90+% okay? You can't finish the order until the customer is 100% satisfied but you cant ask them what's missing.			"

												Overall, the game felt more like a beta, or an early development concept than a fully fledged simulator. Decent in some respects, but not phenomenal. Most of the top-most ""helpful"" reviews have listed all the obvious deficiencies of the game. There are a few I'd like to add, along with some suggestions for what would make the game better:1.) Improve the camera behavior; feels like you have to fight the camera to focus the tiny dot reticle on an interface target. If I've tried every mouse sensitivity, and still have to adjust the mouse an average of 5 times every time I try to interact with something, there's a problem with the interface design.2.) If you must include a test track feature without much ability to control look camera or any rear-view features, add some flashing directional arrows or something to tell the driver where to go.3.) Also, if the test track is something that I just drive a car through demolition derby style, from highlight pad to highlight pad, requiring no thought from the player in actualy formulating the diagnosis, maybe it's a feature that should just be done away with entirely, or reduced to something in the game menu along the lines of ""send for test drive"". Since it requires me to do nothing except pilot a car in the same repetitive fashion around the same track, it just feels like a time waster or a pointless minigame. Since I'm not actually doing repairs with this feature, just basic piloting of a simplistic drive simulation, it detracts from the point of the game -- to actually repair cars.4.) If possible, add some real life makes/models to the game. This was probably the one thing I found myself most yearning for while playing, and would truly make the game engaging. To actually be able to work on, say, my own car, or some recently released model of car, or some exotics, classics, etc. would be truly amazing. If licensing or IP constraints make this feature impossible, I'm sure there are some foreign or outdated models of cars that can be reasonably cloned. Like older cars no longer in production, or made by defunct manufacturers who wouldn't sue you for copying their schematics. The point here is not simulating the actual mechanical issues of any particular model, but rather, letting players actually dismantle particular models that are interesting.5.) If trying to simulate real mechanical challenges seems too daunting, consider adding a feature for players to design their own repair missions to share with other players. Players with a lot of experience with a particular model might come up with something really clever to challenge fellow players with. Such a feture would help build a following for the game.Conclusion: overall, the game philosophy seems to be shaky: why check obd if all it consists of is clicking ""check obd"", then watching a little bitmap image of a low res display pop up and tell me I'm checking OBD. Can we actually simulate an OBD unit somehow, like, make me look for a data port? If I'm going to take a car to a test track, can we figure out how to actually make the player responsible for diagnosing a problem? If I'm going to repair a part, is there any way that I can actually learn to repair a part, or be responsible for fumbling with a facsimily of what it takes to repair each part? Again, if it's not requiring the player to actually be a mechanic to some degree, it just feels like a time waster. What aspect of mechanic behavior is it simulating?Overall, good start on a cool idea. Not many mechanic simulators exist. I would love to see this idea develop further, because as a simulator it seems to fall short.			"

												The game itself is good, but the repair works take too long, i.e. the clutch took 20 mins. I can imagine it would be hard with someone with little car maintenance knowledge to grasp the concept of ""theres a problem, fix it"". Once the main elements have been completed the game gets repetitive due to duplicate tasks. Different cars and different vans have no difference in the parts and/or the design of the engine or chassis so gets boring pretty easily. I thought this game would be quite interesting, and it is but the game has no feeling of progression and repeats itself very often.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is the first FPS game ever to give me motion sickness.I only noticed I was getting nausea about an hour in, when the FPS POV I was seeing the game through wouldn't stop ♥♥♥♥ing bobbing, like I was playing as The World's Drunkest Car Mechanic. Thankfully, I was able to find a way to turn off the head sway. However, it does not stop the camera from zooming in and out suddenly like it was bobbing its head to a song I couldn't hear while I was trying to take apart the car. Need to remove the timing belt? ENHANCE. ENHANCE. That's gone, now the actuator. OH YEAH, PARTY TIME. OONTZ OONTZ OONTZ. Fix the water pump? ZOOM IN ON THAT♥♥♥♥♥♥LIKE WE'RE THE NSA. Unlike the sway, I cannot turn that♥♥♥♥♥♥off AT ALL.It did teach me a few things about cars and I like a game that makes me use the parts of my brain involving deductive reasoning. I like to fix♥♥♥♥♥♥and it made me feel smart. However, this simulator skimps on a lot of the finer details of automotive maintenance and it's actually not all that good at making me feel clever when I've finally managed to fix the problem with the car. There's nothing really to gain from playing this. Especially if playing it makes people feel queasy. Don't bother.			"

												Well i say yes :)If you love cars like me then this game is for you !The game really hooks you up to the screen, especially with the wife jokes(oh stop it.. :p).But i can't give it more than 7 out of 10 score, because it simply lacks some stuff.For example, the camera isn't so smooth, sometimes you end up going to the wrong section/part of the car and u have to go to your character again and once more click the damm car to reach the pieces u want.The Test Drive isn't as good as it should be, it doesn't feel it really says the problems the car has.Now for stuff i would love to see in-game... i've played gearheadgarage back in the day, and i really would love you could go deeper on the engine and repair/replace alot more peices than the car has at the moment.Would love an auction-house system in the game, like scrapyard, so you can buy old/screwed up cars, and fix them for a profit, but also adjust prices and rewards, so you never are overflowing with cash ^^Well that's it.I hope u like my review :)			"

												Great game, very enjoyable. If this is based on real life car maintenance, it is a great way for a guy such as myself to learn the fundamentals of maintaining my own car just in case. I am a big fan of simulators generally speaking and this is one simulator that I have never seen before. The graphics fidelity is good but not great, then again it is focused on car maintenance and not really a racing simulator where every visual has to be perfectly crisp. As a person who never touched a car bolt, it is quite fun to learn the quickest way to get to a part and replace it. Took me quite a bit of time to realise how easy it was to get the engine start part out. However the down side to this game which I noticed, taking a car for a test drive for assessment is completely useless. Reason being that you won't be able to know what is wrong with a car just from a test drive or at least you don't receive a test drive results. I have done a test drive before I repaired a faulty muffler, to see how loud the car goes. Did the repair and tested it again, there is no difference in engine sound. Customer said the the car is too loud because of the muffler isn't doing its job. But you can't really tell because there is no such thing.Secondly, Suppose as a mechanic you want to save some money by buying used car parts in very good condition to use for repairs. Sorry to ruin the fun for you, you can't do that. This is because A) in-game used car parts shop does not show if a particular part is in good condition or bad.. Maybe a percentage scale??? and B) Even if you are lucky to snag a gearbox which scores 80% out of a 100% with a really good price tag, you replace the old damaged gearbox and Job done? No, the game does not allow you to do that and you wont be able to progress to the next job.I hope this review reaches the game dev team to make it better in future updates.Will I recommend this game to friends or simulator enthusaists? Answer is yes, despite those little quirks in the game but I do agree I personally found it fun to play and this is just starting out, did not reach the point where I do complex jobs and tweaking engine power using power commander etc.			"

												It's one of a kind, you will have your own workshop, you get an contract to repair a car, at the beginning you get simple problems to fix and the worn out part is mentioned in the contract.After that you get much complicated problems, customers will only give you the symptoms and you will have to find the worn out part that causes the problem by your own, it might be more than one part.This game is really amazing and it won't be everyone's choice because like any other simulation game it has a certain fanbase.If you are much into cars and parts stuff and have a good knowledge about mechanics and want to test your skills, this game is for you!I've got expierence in my previous car that i had in REAL life, and it seems that the bad days i had with it payed off now in this game :pHave a nice time playing this game, and I hope the developers will go deep with this game, more details more costumization to your workshop, competition with other workshops and so on would be very nice to see in the game.7/10 , one of the few games i spent more than 5 hours playing in late 2013, and 2014.

												All the fun of being a shade tree mechanic without any of the mess, busted knuckles or that awesome feeling of dread that you've broken your car beyond repair. You're presented with various customers' auto problems that range from the very specific ""I hit a giant pothole and destroyed my left side suspension"" to the very vague ""my car makes a rattling sound on startup."" You can visually inspect various areas of the car, or go on a test drive, or use an OBD scanner and later in the game you get access to a suspension and brake tester. You have the choice of buying new parts or buying used parts of dubious quality from the junkyard to make the repairs with. My favorite part of this game is that it lets you keep all the messed up parts in your inventory. Pretty soon you'll have a nice collection of busted water pumps, torn up clutch wheels and a mountain of worn out shocks and springs. The game gives you an option to sell these (presumably to the same junkyard you buy stuff from), or you can be a completely unethical thief and slap the busted parts on a later customer's car, taking their good parts for another customer. See, the game has certain milestones you have to do in order to pass a scenario, like ""replace oil and air filter."" It doesn't care if the rest of the components of the car go down in quality, as long as the parts the scenario cares about get fixed. So sure, I replaced Mr. Smith's dead battery, just like the game wanted me to, but unbeknownst to him, I also swapped out his perfectly good gearbox and ignition system with almost broken ones from Mr. Johnson who was my previous customer. In the scenario where I had to fix the guy's left side suspension, I simply flipped the parts from his good right side onto his left side, then sent him on his way. If this game has taught me anything, it's not about learning how to fix cars, rather it is to WATCH YOUR MECHANIC LIKE A HAWK in real life. I think I spend more time essentially screwing over each one of my customers than I do actually repairing their vehicles. Remember that junkyard? I regularly buy crap from them and swap it into my customers' cars, just so I can have a good copy of a part when I need it, without having to pay full price for a good one.			"

												A relaxing game that requires a decent knowledge of cars and also quite a bit of time. The game is based around solving senarios, some of which can be challenging and time consuming to complete.However one of the scenarios was bugged and the only way to solve it was to look up the instructions to complete it. Overall the game is great fun, and is ideal for wasting some hours on a night. Totally worth the price and since I played it, has been updated with dlc that I will have to try out.Whitty's rating: 7/10			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is quite fun if you enjoy pulling a car apart and attempting (in my case) to find parts to remove where you havn't really any idea where to look! A few logisitics here and there, for example, to work out how to change a clutch.. Removing certain parts around it to find the problem. Although the test drive phsyics and mouse movement are something to be questioned and get used to, it is in all a simple yet enjoyable simulator which addresses an area of the game market which is very much neglected.Graphics (especially for game type) 9/10Game Concept 8/10Playability (so far) 7/10Understanding (straightfoward) 8/10Overall 8/10*Would highly recommend if you thoughly enjoy unscrewing blots*			"

												For myself, someone who knows less than nothing about cars, I found this game to be fun and informative. I found the controls a bit wonky and wished I could remap some of the default directional controls, but it didn't prevent me from enjoying the experience. As I've owned the game additional features have been added so I can't say whether remapping keys is an option at this time.The graphics are very clean and sharp, allowing one to see where the various car components are in an uncluttered transparent skeleton model. I know looking under the hood of my car certainly doesn't look remotely like this game. Where's the boundless layers of grease, rust and leaves. Why do I have leaves under my hood?There are a few good songs that play in the game, one of which has a heavy riff guitar that I enjoy the most. The songs are basically just background music now that I've turned the volume down some. The variety of songs is varied enough to keep things from getting too stale.I would agree with some other reviews that there is certainly some repetition to the repairs, but that's exactly why I got the game. I wanted to learn about car parts and where they are on the vehicles. So this is probably not a sim well suited for the mid to high level car tinkerers out there. I would recommend this sim game for the uninitiated auto jockeys like myself.			"

												I'm writing this after completing the first tutorial order. So far, the game seems fairly enjoyable as well as educational to a reasonable degree. The graphics are fine, nothing too fancy, but fits the game. The music has an electronic flare, which I found fit the game, but some may disagree (it can be muted). The gameplay itself is what you would expect from a simulator, it's straight foreward and not too difficult to grip. The one Issue I had was with the controls, they do feel a bit clunky, even after modifying some of the mouse settings, but it's not unbearable. The $20 price tag seems a bit high (I got the game on sale), but if you're a diehard fan of simulators or automotive themed games, than I would reccomend this game.			"

Here we have a sim that demands you learn the basics of vehicle repair AND it's on sale 'til the 11th?? No brainer.The game obviously doesn't have 'specific' cars in mind, it's more or less presenting a generic 'all car' to give an overall understanding of parts with very little explanation of function. There's a plan for another edition next year that will hypothetically have even more cars and frankly, I can hardly wait.Rating: 7/10			"

												I'm having trouble seeing how this is a ""Car Mechanic Sim"" because it doesn't include having to go to the autoparts store (at least twice) first time to pick up the tools needed to get the spring back on the rocker arm, the second time because you didn't know you needed that part and then 3rd to get back the core deposit. Also, have I in no way accidentally put something on backwards. Then have to take all apart again, just to put it back together and then find out I left off the seal, so I gotta take it apart a 3rd time to install the seal. There haven't been missing parts, screws or bolts, nor have I had extra left over screws or bolts.  It's these missing factors which make me question the title of the game but thats also the nice part about it too. Though the games 3D models seem a little simplistic at times, again its also the nice part about this game, because it otherwise becomes a chore. Do not get me wrong, navigating between area's of the automobile definately cannot be conviently traversed. Controls are a huge issue to me for any game, though they not crucial for this one.All around, its a fun game, it gives you some very general auto mechics knowledge, without the headaches of have to deal with an automobile and you can still get to work in the morning (results may vary). I've been running this on my i5-hd3000 lappie, at times I've seen the frame rate drop below 20fps, though still playable.

Ok, I'm kidding you can't really overbill on labor.  That would make it too realistic.I started out this game with a kind of wide-eyed enthusiasm, going the extra mile and replacing oil and oil filters when people brought me these crapwagons with tar for oil and clogged filters.  Pretty soon though I lost that zest for excellence and just started shoving work out the door with the cheapest parts I could find doing as little work as possible.   There are some things missing however.  Disappointingly, when I am recklessly 'test driving' someone's muscle car and I run over 20 pylons and smack into a wall there are no amusing consequences.  For my own satisfaction I just imagine Danny Devito's voice crying out ""What happened to my car!?""  That'll have to do for now. "

Perhaps the game might be even more enjoyable with a wheel and pedal setup, but I think it is very playable with just keyboard and mouse. I would like to see the business end of the game developed a bit further, and a wider variety of vehicles available for the clients. I understand there is a 4x4 add-on in development, but I think body work, and paint might be content the users would like to see in future versions.			"

												This is the real deal. I mean, not literally the real deal, Car Mechanic Simulator won't leave you covered in grease or anything. Like most sims, the fundamentals of CMS are simplified--you don't, for example, have to worry about things like re-tightening the bolts on a wheel in a star pattern, and you don't have to think about what kind of oil the car takes, you just empty it and refill as needed. But the basic idea is there: figure out what's wrong with the car, identify the parts to fix or replace, and bolt the new parts into place. Simple! Or maybe not.The first few tasks are very simple, but as the game goes on you'll run into more difficult or more vague problems. Sometimes, this isn't so great--a few of the orders, for example, want you to restore a part of the vehicle to tip-top shape, not mentioning that all parts must be green (hey, the car still drives with yellow or orange parts, and some cars come in so beat up that every part is orange, so clearly the game doesn't expect me to replace every non-green part, right?). But most of the time, the challenge is fair. Why does the engine cut out occasionally? What's causing that odd sound at low RPMs? If you don't already know the possible answers, you will soon.There's still more the devs can do to make this an awesome game--the garage management aspects aren't very interesting, and sometimes you'll get a request describing odd behavior with the car only to find the test drive doesn't show any of these aspects (it's not supposed to, it turns out). But this is a surprisingly absorbing sim. Definitely recommended if you like the idea of tinkering with car engines without having to get your hands dirty.			"

												First Impressions:I know jack squat about cars and I had a pretty fun time playing this.  The game makes it incredibly easy to perform maintenance on a car and the game remembers what pieces go where, thankfully.  I""m relatively new to the game and I'm assuming it'll get more difficult, but I'm enjoying the pace of the game and the level of detail so far.  Worth the $3.75 I paid for it (down from $14.99 during the Autumn sale).

												the first thing i thought when playing this was 'woah' and that is because the first car you get in is actually the car i drive in real life.that aside, im probably a fully qualified mechanic after an hour of game play, i never knew changing a clutch could be so easy.. (not that im trying it anytime soon, thats what garages are for..) i perhaps was slightly generous too, a lady (lets call her mary white, brought her vehicle in to get the starter REPAIRED but instead i gave her a new battery and new starter.. anyway moral is mechanics are and should not be overly generous.. (i lost alot of money) anyway the review.. if you own a car and have no or a slight idea about parts and how a car works this game is gon' educate you.. i knew how to change the tie rods so when that order came in i knew what i was doing, along with others but yeah, educate, become mechanic within hour! plus its on sale so you might aswell give it a try and the creators/developers or whatever you like to call them are creating a 2015 version (this is the 2014 if you didn't read that earlier) and they're needing your help so if you enjoy it give them the help they need!game good. very educate.~~~~~~~ BECOME A FULLY QUALIFIED MECHANIC ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ DOWNLOAD CAR MECHANIC SIMULATOR 2014 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~ WHO NEEDS COLLEGE????????????????? ~~~~~~~~~			"

												Eh, it's not bad. However, it gets quite repetetive after a while and you cannot do anything advanced, like engine swaps, turbo installation - basically, as the name says, you just repair cars. A good start, for sure, but it's more of a point-and-click adventure game than a proper car mechanic sim.			"

												It's fun,  I would like more detail on the components like taking apart power steering racks, alternators, gearboxes, engines etc, more diagnostic gameplay and the ability to upgrade car parts like bigger exhaust, stroker kits, turbos, maybe even engine swaps in the future but its fine as it is. Looking forward to the 4x4 add on and hopefully more add ons in the future.			"

												I'm yes and no on my recommendation for this game. This is the groundwork for a game I'd love. Kind of a long reading following but this'll give anyone looking into game an exact idea of what they're jumping in to. This game is a nice buy for car/mechanical enthusiasts. This game would be best set up for someone who is just getting into cars, but isn't very familiar with their mechanicals. You could learn how basic parts go together and what some of their effects may be. However, to advance through this game at a decent pace you need a little prior mechanical knowledge. For example, you may be told that you need to find a power issue and not know that the fuel pump or fuel filter could be the problem.The problem with this game though, is that no matter whether you're a mechanic yourself or someone learning, The game will have become mind-numbingly monotonous about 3/4 of the way through. At this point you'll have seen all the vehicles, driven them, taken care of every problem, and you'll be running on repeated problems so you can buy all the Learning Book upgrades. All the concepts are presented less than halfway through the game, then the later garages simply allow you to diagnose parts faster. At the time of writing this I quit the campaign about 6/7 of the way through out of sheer boredom.If you've ever played the 1989 Street Rod DOS/Commodore 64 game, then you've played this game. Infact, in the first garage, the game can be seen lying on one of the shelves as a neat little reference. I would recommend searching around for Street Rod, since it's a nice little game to play. The only problem is that this game only has slightly more detail than Street Rod did 25 years ago. In Street Rod, you changed wheels and clicked the bolts much like you do here. You changed out engines, removed heads, carburetors, and upgraded your car in general. After upgrading, you'd go do a basic NES-era street race to earn other cars or money and continue until you beat the fastest racer in town.In Car Mechanic Simulator, I'd say you have a little more variety of detail but not where most would enjoy. Put graphical detail of 3D models aside. When it comes down to it, you're changing air intakes, timing chain/belts, suspension parts, gearbox parts rarely, and the exhaust. You will never touch the engine block, the sub-frames, or any body work (on that note, the feature list specifically states that you will do body work). These parts are off-limits and can't be removed. You will never be able to customize any setup; it's Part-On, Part-Off, and what condition the part is in.The car models themselves are nicely detailed, but are static and feel a bit bland with the way they are rendered. The cars are modeled after real-life cars, but use slightly different design and names. Most of them will be European/Japanese economy cars or small vans/SUVs. The 2010+ Mustang replica is the most distinguished car, but oddly one of the SUVs seem to the fastest car you can test drive. As parts wear, they begin to show slight signs of rust, which is a nice detail. That said, parts are fixed. There's two engine designs: I4 and V6. The two engines are the same in each iteration, and the V6 will sometimes have a RWD dif or 4WD dif with an additional driveshaft. Also, both engines are always transversely mounted, which is a bit odd considering most V6s in this game are RWD rather than FWD.Gameplay wise, there are a few minor annoyances. While part selection in general is nice, there are times when you'll find yourself clicking to a part 5+ times because of the cursor trying to select a part that's behind the one you want to click. Certain parts, while obviously accessible from your current position (under the car, left side wheel well, etc), can't be touched unless you exit the current area, walk around, access the ""proper"" area, and then remove the part. Often, the camera will zoom or align to an impossible angle to remove the bolts you just selected, so you'll have to fiddle around and zoom out to remove the part. Occasionally, the bolt removal will glitch and you'll have to move the camera to be able to click the bolt again. You'll find yourself constantly moving between nearby areas and lifting the car up and down repeatedly to reach nearby parts. One of the bigger annoyances was the removal of air filters and exhaust parts.  To remove the air filter, you have to remove the plastic engine cover, the tube, the MAF sensor, the cover, and finally the filter (VS just taking the cover off in real life). God forbid you have to remove the exhaust manifold or the catalytic converter. You will have to start at the back of the car, removing every section of exhaust until you reach the desired part. In real life, you'd either drop the whole assembly or simply remove the problem section by itself. These little things, while not that big a deal by themselves, can become annoying after a short amount of time.Also, never buy used parts. Just don't. Often the game requires the replaced parts be of a very high condition and often the random part will be in the green and still not be accepted as a replacement. In regards to replacement parts, often you are not told what the complete requirement of repair is. While not knowing a problem is true to real mechanic shops, some work orders (goals to complete a repair) simply don't give you the full goals. One example in an early mission is how you're given a work order to ""Do an basic examination of my engine."" Do a full examination, and the requirement isn't fulfilled. Turns out you have to just replace broken parts even if the service is not requested. This causes confusion, as early on in the game, you're given specifics that ask for examination but not service. Perhaps the work orders need to be re-written.Finally, a small personal gripe of my own. The game feels like a hospital bedroom. Everything feels stark and bland. Everything on the cars are perfect save for part discoloration. There's no character to any of the vehicles or the locales (save for the first garage itself). Perhaps if there was unique body damage, difference between cars (other than color), or visual dirt/grime and broken part models it would feel a bit more lively.Over all though, this is a fun game for the auto enthusiast for a few hours. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes cars and wants to learn the basic setup of car mechanicals. I feel at the current time it's more of a $10 game rather than $20. I'll have to see how the game evolves with updates, but as the core game is now I'm going to let the last of the campaign sit. I want so badly to have a modern, high-definition version of Street Rod or Gearhead Garage. This is a step in the right direction. I'd pick this game up to support the developers and to help show that there's a market for this kind of game.			"

												First let me tell you, that I have absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing clue about cars. I don't even own a license and I am 28. So when this game threw words at my face, telling me to check/change them, I was totally confused. But that's exactly where the fun starts. Call it ""exploring"" if you want to.I played it 10 hours straight and finished the non-DLC part (76 ""missions"") without realizing how time is passing by. Once you get used to it, there's something like a workflow that shows up. Like a daily routine, you know exactly what to do and you feel like a ♥♥♥♥ing car mechanic who could open his own shop (Don't do it. You will fail and fall on your fugly face. Your family and friends will come at you and remind you that they ""told you so"").I got the game for free, so no big thinking there. At first I was like ""Yeah, probably just another stupid simulator where 50% doesn't work and the other 50 are bugs."", but I gave it a chance and damn it was fun. If money is not an issue for you, than it's probably smarter to go for the newer 2015 edition that seems to have tons of more features and stuff. I will buy it myself I guess.Pros:- Addicting- You'll get a hang of it after a few question marks over your head and then the fun starts- Kinda of an upgrade system- The graphic is okay'ish for this type of game. You usually don't expect either nothing or comic style from simulators.- This game can make you feel satisfied when you finish your job in the right way. It just feels good like when a girl touches your balls.Cons:- The camera is pure♥♥♥♥♥♥for like 80% of the time- I don't know about other languages, but the german translation is so hardcore garbage that I almost want to make it a ""pro"" for a humouristic attempt.- Clicking on small stuff, combined with the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥camera, can be painfully annoying. You know what I'm talking about when you try to switch your first spark plug.- No search function in the parts shop. Scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and dieing while scrolling and scrolling and balls.10/10 would repair friends cars now			"

												Fun game. Not realistic, but fun in it's own wayYou trying to repair cars, sometimes there is orders with direct instructions like ""replace oil filter"" and sometimes there is orders with description of the problem like ""weird noises from engine"" or ""bad steering"". You need to examine car parts and replace (or repair, if possible) them.Some parts can be examined by just looking at them, some needs to be dismantled.There is some tools to help you with that - read data from on-board computer, run a test drive or use diagnostic stand to check out brakes and suspension. After that, you will see condition of relevant parts immediately.There is one bad thing about test drive - car alway acts like a perfect working car, even if order states that it makes weird noise or doesn't start at all. All that it does - it reveals condition of some parts.There is also some illogical orders, like so: It states that car don't startYou checks engine, find out that electrical wires and spark plugs are damaged, and everything else looks ok. You replace them and nothing happens - order doesn't complete.I watched that order on youtube - and somewhy, you need to replace starter as well, even if it's on 60% condition (doesn't looks so bad).Fortunately, there is only one or two of that, other orders are fine.This game doesn't have all the systems that real car have, and after playing it you will not be able to repair your own car. But it's kinda educational anyway - you will know approximate layout of the car systems. And yes, it's fun, so if you like that kind of games - it worth a try. There is even free demo version to try it out - so try it, and buy it if you like it.			"

However, if you choose poorly, you will find yourself in the red- unable to pursue both options. Which will you choose: future opportunity or present stability?

												The idea is good, very good, but way to far to be called a simulator... The most simplest job in the game is changeing brake pads on a disc brake system. In the game all you do is... 1. take the wheel off 2. take the caliper off 3. remove the pads from the brake rotor 4. Replace the old pads with new pads 5. Reinstall the Caliper 6. Put the wheel back on. In real life this is the basics, but so far from the actual thing, its great for the casual gamer who dosen't know anything about cars, but when you do this stuff for a living its somewhat silly and mundane. If your wondering how many steps their actually is to replace the brake pads in real life... 1. Break all lugs on wheels 2. Jack car up 3. Remove all wheels 4.

												This is probobly the best game ive playn. I bought this game because I wanted to know a car inside out. And honestly this  game perfects that. I Really think they should even use this in school as a pre-teach before getting into the real car. ill have to say now I know substantial things about a car. This game is Amazing 10/10, if your a full gear head and have a passion to learn about it get this game. I dont regret buying this game!P.S To the creatorsOnly thing I think you guys should add is a Dyno !			"

												STOP! BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW BEWARE NONE OF THIS IS COPY AND PASTE I WROTE THIS HOLE REVIEW!Really cool-looking game about fixing broking cars in your garage. But... will you like it? Would I recommend it for you to buy? That's depends of what are you expecting from this game, in the first hand.Let me tell you how it works, right from the start: you'll find yourself locked inside the garage, with some broken car and notation of what you should do with it. You can disassemble the most of the car's engine, suspension and exhausts. You can fix some of those disassembled parts on the workbench, or buy new ones in the PC installed in your garage. Reassemble the car with new or fixed details, and they'll send you next one. After some time you'll get enough ""free"" money to ""buy upgrades"", namely, the discounts for the spare parts market, ability to squeeze the next client for more money, ability to notice some of the wrecks with your blind eye, without any expertise, and, finally, ability to turn screws faster... Which is really suitable, especially when exhausts needs fixing.After 2-3 dozen of cars, they let you in the new, bigger garage, with more tools to examine the wrecks. And in the third garage, which you'll get in about half of the game, you'll face ""the master tool"" - thing for making magical ""chiptuning"" (which looks as some kind of puzzle - or the way to make quick buck, depends from perspective).That's it. Quite an accurate attempt to draw the line of work for cars mechanic, with its bright and dark sides, choices and so on.Downsides? There is one noticable, but boy, it's Big! You see, all is quite simplified: two different engines (V4/V6) and front-wheel drive/four-wheel drive - which gives us four, only four possible variants of what we should assemble and disassemble over and over. After you'll fix 2-3 cars in the main career and 1-2 cars in each of two dlc's (4wd and tuning one) - you've seen it all.So, if you were planning to use this software to safely find out how to fix your own VW/Ford/Toyota/whatever - forget it. If you were looking for game about making cars out of scrap or just wanted something powerful enough to keep you awake all night long - nope, not this case.So, why I like Car Mechanic Sim and think it's good for any games collectioner? First, it's really looking good now - being made on quite limited resources. Yeah, an example of good code work. Second, even while there are not enough depth and variety, it still can teach something - I'll definetely provide this piece to my son - before showing him wiring schemes and options for gear boxes and other more complicated stuff. Third, it's good 3d puzzle game - find out the easiest and cheapest way to get wheels spinning - that's steeper in my book, than crushing numberless skulls... Even if not that fun. And note various languages at game's settings! Learn how to call your wheel in Spanish, German, Russian, et cetera! Yeah, learn the cars topic on your favourite foreign language! (Too bad they don't have Chinese and Japanese, though.) Finally, the price. It's good now, even without bundles!So, Car Mechanic Sim 2014 deserves 6.5/10 points and good place in my game's library. Will it fit for you? I don't know. But you may try, it won't bite.PS: the music there gets old fast, I turned it off after the 1st hour of playing... a small thing, but I still wish for more options there			"

												The idea is good, very good, but way to far to be called a simulator... The most simplest job in the game is changeing brake pads on a disc brake system. In the game all you do is... 1. take the wheel off 2. take the caliper off 3. remove the pads from the brake rotor 4. Replace the old pads with new pads 5. Reinstall the Caliper 6. Put the wheel back on. In real life this is the basics, but so far from the actual thing, its great for the casual gamer who dosen't know anything about cars, but when you do this stuff for a living its somewhat silly and mundane. If your wondering how many steps their actually is to replace the brake pads in real life... 1. Break all lugs on wheels 2. Jack car up 3. Remove all wheels 4. Disconnect all brake lines from calipers and allow time to bleed off. 5.  Remove calipers 6. Remove brake pads from Caliper 7. Compress cylinder within Caliper to allow new Pads to fit 8. Install new pads to fit 9. Reinstall all Calipers with Pads 10. Not a bad idea to check the rotors as well, Replace if worn or galded 11. Reconnect brake lines to all Calipers 12. In respect to the posistion of the Master Cylinder start from the farthest corner and work inwards bleeding the calipers to fit, make sure no air is in the lines. 13.

												This game pretty much nails the very basics of being in the automotive industry, though there were a few annoying details like not actually getting able to strip an Engine apart and adjust crank position or anything heavy like that. As far as heavy goes it's just Chip Tuning. I'm not exactly clued up on car mechanics since I mostly work on motorcycles but a lot of what is in this game allowed me to refresh and remember key basics. I could honestly play this game all day and I seriously recommend it to anyone who is just starting to do mechanics or to someone who already knows about mechanics as a small refresher.			"

												This just goes to show that there is a game out there for everyone. Car Mechanic Simulator is exactly what it sounds like; you fix cars. However, there are a few things that really make this game something beyond your typical simulator garbage.First of all, the ability to see into the inner workings of a vehicle is insanely cool for someone who grew up loving The Way Things Work. Next, there is actually a functional game here. Beyond just doing the repairs, you occasionally need to diagnose issues, you have to buy parts, increase your skills, and even figure out ways to complete repairs with used parts when customers don’t pay enough. Additionally, there is a new game mode in the complete edition called 1/4 Mile. In this mode you are given a budget and then are free to purchase whatever parts you feel are necessary to get a vehicle to run the quarter mile in a designated time. This mode is so awesome and oddly takes me back to the days of Need For Speed Underground 2 when I would spend hours at the track fine tuning my cars for different types of racing.Like all simulators, read tons of reviews to make sure it’s for you, but Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is a lot of fun.

												I LOVE THIS GAME! I own an automotive shop in Austin, TX and this game is very simple and enjoyable. I could play this game endless of time. This game reminds me of the game called GearHead Garage with Snap-On which was the coolist game to play in the past on PC and its almost similar to this game I played. I don't consider this game to be perfect... yet but looking forward to see this game grows with more adds, parts, vehicles.I wanted to say that the first time playing this game was a bit arkward with the camera and how to play but after a few vehicles repaired, I got the hang of it. Its very easy and fun game to play. I hope they consider adding Professional Mode where we could do more deep repairs and diagnostic like in real life. When you see the loading picture of the internal transmission parts, that is what I'm looking forward to see in Professional mode or such like replacing knocking piston by wrist pin or connecting rod bearings or etc. Hopefully they will develope one.Anyone whos into automotive work should consider buying this game, again some of you might or might not like it but it's not for everyone. Its a lite verison for now but I believe they will grow to develope more to add this game. This game felt some-what repeative but that's the same concept of automotive work in real life and it doesn't bother me.			"

												Car mechanic simulator is a game which you basically fix parts on cars that the ""customer"" either wants checked or replaced. The game itself is not bad but could have been better. I purchased this game because it looked like a game worth playing and the reviews were positive (so it must be a good game). After playing it for an hour, it got very boring and I could never come back to playing it like my other games that I own and have brought. Overall, CMS 2014 could have been a better experience if it was adjusted at the time but this looks like it has been slightly remodelled (CMS 2015).Gameplay - 8 / 10Graphics - 7 / 10Audio - 6 / 10Overall - 7 / 10Final Verdict:For a wannabe Mechanic or an extreme car lover			"

												While I love cars, this just wasn't the best game I've seen.     My one main problem with the game is the repetitiveness (is that a word?). There's some variation, but it's mostly- Find red parts (Sometimes through a test drive), replace, next mission. It would be fine if there was some sort of way to move through the game other than buying books for faster screwing.    Another problem was the interface. I was hoping more of a simulation, but that wasn't there. Instead of a visual damage (Which would be nice in a Simulator) the part is just regular, yellow, orange or red colored, which is headache inducing at times. Also, while I was hoping for a mechanic's view, it's just a camera with wierd controls. This makes taking out bolts and small parts very repetitive and boring.    Overall, I can't really reccomend this game, as it lacks both the gameplay elements of a game, and the realism of a Simulator.			"

												Originally I was a total pleb with anything to do with cars. But since I bought this game, my game with the women increase 1000%. This game not only helped me get tail at the bars but also cured my cancer and freed the slaves. The no-holds-barrred. no nonsese tactial gameplay made me relived my days as a SOCOM commando back in Vietnam. High speed, low drag ♥♥♥♥♥es. Also, this game has car simulation. 14/10 would buy, take out to dinner, and treat with respect.			"

This game is intended for people who are excited or interest in automotive, yet are afraid in working on their car or maybe don't own a car. For person like myself who's hobby is automotive and have taken several classes in automotive. This game does not help me one bit. 5/10 Score			"

												- Laggy input.- Floaty camera.- No FOV (Field of View) setting- No way to go back to the options menu after starting the game.- No way to fine-tune video settings (e.g. I want high-quality textures and anisotropic filtering; and low-quality other stuff).- No borderless-windowed mode.- No way to filter/search in the in-game simulated web browser.- No shortcuts to in-game actions: assemble, disassemble, examine conditions, show conditions.- Inconsistent input: going back sometimes requires right-clicking, other times requires pressing Esc.- During test-drive, it looks like the white light for the reverse gear does not work. I even thought I was a defect with the car, but I don't think I can replace them.Laggy input, low framerate, floaty camera that keeps moving too much... All these contribute to make me feel dizzy in the first few minutes of the game.I cannot recommend a game like this.			"

Test driving - Driving the car feels always (or is?) the same, the race game assetta corsa makes it possible to make small changes, mix these two games and you would have a perfect simulator.2. Tuning - WHY THERE AINT TUNING PAL ? :O (only women chip tune) 3. Cars - Why dont you ask rl car makers to use their names, Revton Van? Vulcan Family? What I do really like is the way you are actually working at the car, that you can see the status of eachs tires even if you are not inspecting these.Great game Red Dot gamesGreets lukas			"

												CMS14 isn't going to make you a real life mechanic overnight. It's not a true simulator, but it's more of a puzzle game. In the early part of the game, you are already given the areas that need to be fixed, and it's more like unbolting parts, fixing them, and rebolting them and finishing the mission. You are given several basic situations of what to fix in a given situation. Later on though, like a real mechanic, the customer will only give a general situation, and it's your job to figure it out. Pretty much anything that is red, you have to fix. I think the only negative is probably the variety of parts to fix. All cars have (more or less) the same parts, like the engines all look the same. Things like supercars with turbos aren't in the game, as are aftermarket parts. Everything is a FWD car.If you like puzzles and you like fixing cars, this is a good game for you			"

Car Mechanic Sim 2014 has very few, soundtracks so you need some music on the side going. The DLC is around the same as the ingame campaighn just a different model for a car. Runs smooth graphics are very good too. My only problem is in a test drive course you can get stuck not frozen or crashed but just keep spinning around. You also cant look in Test Drive mode making the driving feel awkward. The upgrade system works great and i will rate this game a 8 out of 10.			"

												This is a really great game. First starting it was a little clunky, getting the camera angles down, (I turned off the music, too. Just not my style), but very addictive once I got a work flow going. The bad, There isn't a lot of variety of vehicles or parts yet, the money model is not realistlc, and moding is not yet available. I really liked the 1/4 mile add-on, but it needs a lot more part options. A mod community, I'm sure, could cure a lot of these issues, if they add the modding ability later to the game. The good, easy controls and parts ordering. Not overly complicated feel. Overall, it is a realy fun game, and I think it has the most potential to end up one of the great game series, in future realeases. I will be playing it for a while I think.			"

One of the other reviews said that if you screw up you have to reset your career, they have since updated the game with a reset current work order options thus resolving this issue.Overall a pretty good game if you enjoy cars and working on cars.

I found the controls a little odd, but not too difficult to work with, but it didn't prevent me from enjoying the game.The graphics are very clean, and the way the game colors parts of the car allows for me to easily identify different components.The music is limited in its selection, but one of the channels is perfect for me in that it plays a hard rock style guitar song and so I just listen to that channel.Overall, I have learned just what I wanted from the game.  Where parts are, the names of different parts, and how various parts link together.  It's a fun game if you are looking for exactly what I wanted, which was to learn some very basic things about a car engine and where things are located in a car.			"

Summary:Generally a terrible game. The Why:Purchased on the Steam sale for a low price but even that can't justify the headache this game creates. As the blurb says you run a car workshop, carrying out orders to test or repair customers cars. Unfortunately, even if you over look the base graphics and the eyestrain inducing distance blur (it renders a workshop and despite this small space it blurs walls and details out when you walk too far away) the meat and potatoes of the game is sadly lacking. From a mechanically point of view the game is very basic, almost child like in the way the disassembly and assembly of the car and components occur. It's very much by the numbers and sometimes incorrect (good luck installing a helical spring into the car before the shock assembly) or removing a wheel without jacking the car up or using the car lift or even removing wheel nuts in the correct manner or any sort of torquing. From running the workshop point of view the business side of it is sadly lacking, I repaired a starter and charged the customer $100. Repairing the starter cost $92, so I made $8 on that job not including my time, any consumables, taxes or running of the workshop itself. The UI is terrible, the camera controls frustrating and the restrictions on how you can inspect components irritating. Test drive is pointless. Perhaps a good game to get a young child interested in car mechanics but I would not recommend for anyone else especially anyone who has actually tinkered with cars themselves.			"

												I would say 8/10. Some things I hope to see in future:-More replaceable parts (Engine parts, like pistons etc.)-Own car.-More realistic testdrive, now all cars sounds and behaves same way.-Career progress-More different learningbooks-Easier to use angle of view. Sometimes it's very annoying.-And tuning orders.			"

												Fun game. More of a car themed puzzle game than an actual sim. Some minor issues with the game but nothing that makes the game completly broken. (some of the detection to unbolt things is obnociously small, radio station resets on every new work order, some wonky camera angles). One of the other reviews said that if you screw up you have to reset your career, they have since updated the game with a reset current work order options thus resolving this issue.Overall a pretty good game if you enjoy cars and working on cars. Anyone with at least a basic knowledge of car parts will enjoy this game.			"

												Quite nice game. If you ever played Hot Rod this game for sure will suit you. Yes, I agree with few comments that the game is simplified and this is good point for the develepers to improve. Adding additional machines or adjusting leveling system. It is quite uncommon to purchase your exerience points with 1000 buck instead of achieving it trhough the orders. I was hoping that there will be an option for buying a car from the morgue and scavanging spare parts in reasonable condtion from it, but pity you can only buy second hand parts.Waiting for the first add-ons			"

Summary:Generally a terrible game. The Why:Purchased on the Steam sale for a low price but even that can't justify the headache this game creates. As the blurb says you run a car workshop, carrying out orders to test or repair customers cars. Unfortunately, even if you over look the base graphics and the eyestrain inducing distance blur (it renders a workshop and despite this small space it blurs walls and details out when you walk too far away) the meat and potatoes of the game is sadly lacking. From a mechanically point of view the game is very basic, almost child like in the way the disassembly and assembly of the car and components occur. It's very much by the numbers and sometimes incorrect (good luck installing a helical spring into the car before the shock assembly) or removing a wheel without jacking the car up or using the car lift or even removing wheel nuts in the correct manner or any sort of torquing. From running the workshop point of view the business side of it is sadly lacking, I repaired a starter and charged the customer $100. Repairing the starter cost $92, so I made $8 on that job not including my time, any consumables, taxes or running of the workshop itself. The UI is terrible, the camera controls frustrating and the restrictions on how you can inspect components irritating. Test drive is pointless. Perhaps a good game to get a young child interested in car mechanics but I would not recommend for anyone else especially anyone who has actually tinkered with cars themselves.			"

												Whilst the 'game' itself does have some bad points to it, namely not being very 'noob' friendly, it's a great little buy and gives the player a bit more of a depth of where to find components on your own car/engine.For its £2 sale price, it's absolutely worth it, as you'll easily spend 10 hours into this game just playing through the main game!Just remember, having a bit of knowledge of where to find components in a real car is a big help! Not knowing what the clutch is, or where it's located, besides being a pedal next to the accelerator and brake for instance. :D			"

												I bought this game after seeing a few youtube cilps of TomCat playing it and I have to say this game goes into high depth when it comes to what can go wrong with the car and what not. Not too long ago, I went to get my dad's courier van serviced (I had nothing better to do and he paid me for it :P) and being good friends with the mechanic, he let me into the workshop and showed me what was going to be done. With all the knowledge I acquired from a game I bought for about 9 dollars, I knew a good sort of the different parts of the van and didn't look like a confused toddler while he was explaining what I already knew from this game. I recommend this game to anyone who is in love with cars (like me. I'd probably marry a car if I could) or just likes a good challenge being puzzled with all the 75 different scenarios you are faced with.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is a brilliantly made game. It has so many parts u can interact with which makes it really quiet amazing. This game really makes me want to be a mechanic and it feels so real when played. U can basically strip an engine and most of the car except the shell of the car to pieces. It's so much fun to play and the jobs in the career mode can be challenging but when completed is so rewarding. PlayWay has done a brilliant job on this game and also there many other games.

												So, two things up front, then I'll get into the review.First up, this entire review can also be read on Youtube, with almost 19 minutes of gameplay that covers a lot of the features in the game.


YouTube™ Video: Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 - Running on a Surface Pro 2 Tablet 

			Views: 586		

			I made this video to show Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 running on the Surface Pro 2, and show some of the game play with a combination of the keyboard and stylus. So I'm a huge fan of Gearhead Garage.		

Second... I wish there was ""Maybe"" button for recommending the game. That's the one I would choose, and the review will explain why.Ok, so I'm a huge fan of Gearhead Garage. I've been waiting and hoping for a new version of it for at least 12 years now, but obviously at this point it's not gonna happen. When I first learned about this game a few weeks ago, I was estatic! My hopes were high, and when it released today I only lasted a couple hours before I bought it. Now I'm here to tell you how I feel about it.On the surface, it does seem very similar to Gearhead Garage. You get jobs, in which ou need to take parts off cars, and put new parts on cars. Not real cars, but make-believe cars that loosely resemble real cars. For those of you that don't remember, Gearhead Garage didn't originally have real cars either, the only real cars in the game were third party unofficial modifications. So far, looking good.Personally, my favorite part of Gearhead Garage (other than 3rd party mods) was the ability to buy crappy cars at auction, fix them up and resell them at auction. After 25 or so missions, I haven't seen anything like that in Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. It's just been mission after mission after mission. The only thing I see to spend your har earned money on is mediocre upgrates to make you 5% more money on jobs, make bolts loosen 5% faster, or other trivial upgrades. In other words, there really isn't much of a reason to make money in Car Mechanic Simulator 2014.Don't get me wrong though, the game is somewhat entertaining. It's not extremely educational, if you know virtually nothing about cars it will give you a basic idea of where car parts are, what parts are named, and a very basic understanding of car diagnostics, if you pay attention. But a lot of aspects of the game aren't very obvious. I've changed the oil on more cars than I can count, but it took way longer than it should have to find the oil drain plug in this game, and once I did it looked NOTHING like an oil drain plug looks like in any real car I've changed the oil on. I also didn't find out there was an oil draining pan until I read about it on this forum. This is good, and bad, a double edged sword. The game does not hold your hand through the car repair process... it gives you the opportunity to figure things out on your own. Still though, it would be nice if something had told me I could click on the oil catch pan, instead of wasing $100 on every oil change for a clean up fee.Also, the test driving physics are laughable. They made Grand Theft Auto feel like Gran Turismo. It's a nice touch... but don't expect any of the cars to handle even remotely realistic. It's a gimmick, at best. A cheap way to see the quality of some of the parts on the car. Not entirely useless... just not well executed. But what can you except from a game that released for $15?Overall... the game is decent. It's the best car mechanic game since Gearhead Garage... but it's not more fun than Gearhead Garage... not even AS fun as Gearhead Garage was, IMHO. The graphics are ok. The part location accuracy is decent. The gameplay mechanics are not bad. It's a combination of point and click searching, along with some puzzle solving. Once you start figuring things out, you can build a decent strategy to solve most car problems. The game still throws you for a loop though. Sometimes because it's a genuinely good puzzle. Sometimes because the game should have let you know where to go to find an option.I want to fully endorse the game... but I'm having a hard time doing that. For $15... I guess it's ok. If I knew what I know now, I'd wait for it to go on sale at $5, but I had to find out for myself. I'm not strongly disappointed with my purchase... just a little. I'm still hoping the game will get better with mods, expansion packs or maybe after a few more missions... but I'm not holding my breath either. If you loved Gearhead Garage... you might like this game. But personally... this game has mostly just whetted my appetite to try to get Gearhead Garage running on my PC again. Other than that, I think it'll be a decent diversion when I want a game to just burn time with. The mechanics of the game are ok, if you haven't played Gearhead Garage then I think you might find it a refreshing turn of pace from the average lot of games on the market today. If you did play Gearhead Garage, and loved it like I did, then I think you'll appreciate this game, but find it mildly disappointing... as I did.			"

												CMS is great if you want to grasp some basic automotive knowledge. And I do mean it. If you, like me, were seeking for challenges and in-depth content, then maybe this game is not for you. Here's why:1. It's too easy and repetitive.The first assignments will feel fresh and may be fairly challenging if you haven't had any experiences with car maintenance. After a while however, 2 hours in my case, the game gets boring. Problem searches become extremely easy as bad components will be very obvious to spot. This is also due to how the cars are built; every single car has almost everything put in the exact same place. Even GM couldn't pull that off.2. It's way too simple.There are no rusty nuts and bolts, anything can be taken out with a simple wrench, because, what are ratchets? You never have to appy oil, silicone grease and whatsoever. Basic car programming tasks are completely absent. There are also no customers that would pressure you, make work difficult, etc. (conversations would be nice). The only thing that requires you to actually do more than pressing LMB and RMB are freaking oil changes, but even those get repetitive after a while.3. Not enough content.Another problem of CMS is the little depth of content. You never have to pay for garage bills, every car has unlimited supplies of headlight fluids, the wrenching upgrades do not offer enough and, like I said before, no angry customers and competition. The biggest problem for me however is the lack of variety in cars; You can't find a diesel car, truck and anything that doesn't have its engine up front. So, if you ever wanted to do some car projects that would make you insane in real-life such as an V8 Audi or even Kim Jong-il's Merc 600, look away.Verdict: CMS is alright for anyone that wants to get a very general understanding of car maintenance. But then, you will have to shell out 6 or 12€ for a so-called simulator that makes car maintenance and engineering look as simple as a Volkswagen Beetle engine. There are thousands of literature and internet sites with more depth that are dedicated to these topics. Most of them don't even cost you a penny. If only the game offered much much more in terms of entertainment value, I wouldn't mind recommending it.			"

												If you don't know anything about cars, the game can be a little challenging at first but is easy to learn. If you do know about fixing cars (like myself) this game can be very easy with little to no challenge. The repair process is very dumbed down and very easy. For example to remove a starter you just remove two bolts and its out, no wires to remove or anything. That being said it is still a fun game that any auto fan should pick up. Also if you don't know anything about cars it can at least give you a basic understanding of how some of parts on a car work.			"

												Not a bad base game. Kept me occupied for a while but is a limited experience with less replay value compared to the old Gearhead Garage game that I remember fondly.The entire game suffers due to long load screens between the garage and different test areasThe main negativity comes with the two expansions.The offroad expansion adds little apart from some new vehicles and a tweaked test track, while being littered with multiple spelling errors and occasional broken orders. Order 13 broke for me and seems to be an ongoing unfixed problem for some on forums.The 1/4 Mile expansion becomes repetitive extremely fast. The early orders I played simply set a time to beat and I just buy and fit enough tuning parts to beat said time. I quickly lost interest and stopped playing this mode. There are two big problems apart from the repetetiveness  with this expansion for me:1. Due to hitting the drag strip after each upgrade I spent most of my time staring at the load screen (seems to take nearly as long as the drag test itself).2. The learning book upgrades unlocked in the career mode are not implemented in the 1/4 mile version so despite being in the endgame garage, changing parts takes a long time as though I'm back at level one. The skills should carry across from the completed career mode in my opinion.Overall, worth picking up on sale to play through the career mode and then move on, maybe dabbling with endless mode if you get the itch to play some more. Forget about playing the expansions in their current form because they add little, while having drawbacks and bugs. I cannot recommend buying this at standard retail price.			"

StoryNo real deep story, only thing you know is that you are a car mechanic with your own shop. You start off in what looks like your garage and then move on to bigger places as you get more money and more customers.GameplayIt handles nicely, sometimes the controls can be a bit bulky. You get a car, the customer tells you what is broken or what he thinks is broken and then you fix it. The way you do that is by examining parts and determining which ones need replacing or servicing. You can do all kinds of tests to see how the suspension is, how the engine is, how the tyres are and so on. You can change just about any part of the car and engine.You can even drive the cars on a closed course to check brakes and stuff, but the handling is really poor, almost farm simluator poor. And even though let's say the brakes are almost non existent when you checked, it brakes fine on the driving course, same with traction and speed, it's always the same no matter how broken the car is.You can magically reach into the car after removing some parts that are in the way, so you can after removing a lot of stuff for example change the flywheel or gearbox even. You would think that it will get repetitive after a while but as you progress further into the game you are completely on your own in trying to find what the problem is, you might only know that ""when I accelerate there is a clunking sound from the eninge"" or something. You can also tune cars and try to make them go faster on a dragstrip, I have not fully understood how to do this, I don't really have the know how on how to make a car faster, but not too fast.GraphicsThe graphics are really nice, way better than I expected. The cars are well modeled, so are all the parts. One thing that bugs me is that the cars look way too nice for some customers, there was one guy who had just bought a car for like 200€ and it wouldn't start, but it still looked really new out of the factory and recently waxed, you would expect it to be old and dirty.SoundThere is a radio which you can turn on and off for music, no real masterpiece music, just some generic simulator music, still good to listen too while working on cars. The sound the tools and engines make seem pretty realistic.Prize/RatingIf you are a fan of simulators and you are interested in how cars work this is the game for you. It's almost like a puzzle solving game once you progress a bit into it aswell, so if you are into that I would also recommend it.It is correctly prized, almost a bit too cheap even.			"

												Dumb. As an actual mechanic, i expected it to be far less complex than car repair actually is... but i never imagined it being this bad. The job where you have to do an obd scan on the car, i thought alright lets see whats wrong going on......doesnt even give errors or any info, scan complete, job done, same money as replacing a starter? Taking the intake mainfold off is just one click, but i have to wrench 4 bolts out of the airbox? Able to remove the fuel filter, which was located betweeen the fuel tank and body of the car, without removing the tank?I realize that if the game were too in depth it would be too hard and boring for most people. But i think a happy medium is needed and this is far from it. Neglects to mention simple things that people should know like lug pattern tightening. Guy says needs air, oil, fuel filter changes... changing the oil filter but not the oil? When you need new parts for a car, no looking up making sure you get the right parts, all parts fit every single car. Spare parts laying around fit every car. Hit it with a hammer, brand new again.I paid $1.69 for this game and im not even gonna request a refund since i got 54 minutes time waste outta it. Still i dont think its worth paying money to play. In fact even if they offered me money to play it i would still probably decline. "

												7/10 - Glad I don't work on cars!Pretty realistic simulator. There are 76 jobs to complete, upgrade your reputation, venue etc,. So that's all cool.Still not a huge fan, even changing the break pads takes some serious effort. (effort = bad)Controls are clunky even on low graphic settings.

												I'm a big fan of CMS 2015, after playing CMS 2015, decided to go try 2014.  The UI is very unintuitive, requiring menu esc - click each time you want to switch from assemble to disassemble mode.  Also some of the parts are in the wrong places.There really isn't a manual for the game, it's sort of like a puzzle game so you are supposed to learn to figure it out.2014 isn't very player friendly, but I'm glad I got 2015 instead, as that is way easier to pick up, and much more fun to play than 2014.  If you're looking for a Car Mechanic Simulator game, go with the newer one.			"

												After a terribly brief tutorial, the game throws you in to learn how to service a car by trial and error.  That's pretty good in most games, I guess, but I kind of figured that a simulator that's so close to real life would have more of a teaching aspect.  There's no in-game 'pedia that I can find.  I find myself wondering what the target audience here is...not total novices, surely, but would someone who knows what they're doing have any interest?			"

												Game lacks many common parts on the vehicle and is dumbed down to an extreme. Plus it seems the devopers are working on some sort of weird European cars as the filters do not resemble anything I've ever experienced. The game sadly lacks any sort of customization or way to spend your money. It also has some weird price problems ex. a oil filter is $50 on a standard car?!? and standard paper air filters for $100. This game feels like a chore to play so I would not reccomend it.			"

												Firstly, I'm disappointed that I can't give this game a neutral recommendation.  Because that's what I wanted to do.Secondly, I'm a little dissapointed in the game.  I've only played the first mission and believe it will get slightly better, but as of now I'm disappointed in the lack of realism.  I was hoping to gain enough confidence to preform real work.  I wanted to be able to select car jacks and measure nut and bolt sizes.  I wanted to be able to tighten bolts to specifications.  I wanted to be able to shop for different brands of brake pads and purchase brake pads for specific cars.  50 dollars for one brake pad is so unrealistic.  The game looks nice and was quick to setup.  I will probably continue playing this.			"

												I should start by saying that....after putting over 100 hours of ""gameplay"" into working on my actual car (94 chevy caprice wagon...a land yacht of a wagon with a corvette motor :D )  this car mechanic simulator will not turn you into a mr. goodwrench!!With that being said though, it can be rather enjoyable, especially if you're someone who likes solving puzzles or diagnosing things (which is definitely up my alley!)...Despite it's enjoyability, I have to give a warning to newcomers....this simulator does very much indeed expect you to know generally where to find specidic parts, and to an extent, know what it does in order to diagnose the problem. Frankly, if you're one of those kind of people who have never seen the engine bay of your car (which is perfectly ok!)...chances are you won't find this very interesting in the least bit. Ultimately...this is more or less a ""diagnostic simulator"" more than a car mechanic simulator.,,knowledge of a parts' function will prove invaluable!Another thing to note, the english translation is (though mostly understandable) a smidge sloppy......so occasionally you'll get a problem to diagnose that can be a little....misleading, if you will...nothing too bad though.The graphics, I have to say, is definitely one of it's strong points.....honestly one of the best looking simulators I've seen as of late. I must also note the soundtrack.....though it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I find it pretty enjoyable, and it's long enough to where I didn't seem to find it too repetitive, even after 5 hours straight of playing.....and if you're wondering, it's primarily DnB and Dubstep.Overall, if you're a car guy or gal, and you at least somewhat know your way around an engine and drivetrain...this might prove pretty enjoyable.If chilling out in your garage wrenching on your car for an evening is something that you'd willingly do...this might prove pretty enjoyable.If you're looking for a software that will turn you into a legitimate mechanic,,,you should probably look elsewhere.If you're someone like a very special lady of mine, who is totally loveable and extraordinarily smart in certain aspects of life but couldn't identify a starter from an alternator.....you should probably look elsewhere, lol			"

The engine rebuilding is very similar and you can repair damaged parts and buy used parts but as far as I have seen so far there is no auction block (my favorite part of GhG), no body damage and no upgrading vehicles. It sounds like the developers intend on adding to this game as time goes on but it isn't there just yet.			"

												Awesome game, get it while it is on sale. I have learned alot about cars, was up till 6am playing.EDIT: After reading the other reviews I just had to stand up and defend this game. Let me start by saying that I know almost NOTHING about cars. The learning curve is not that steep. The missions slowly step you up to higher levels of knowledge. I only ""almost"" got stuck once. Now they added a resart mission button though. There IS 4X4 and V6. Now I want it to be MORE complex. I have learned alot. After a repair sometimes I wikipedia the parts I replaced and as a result my knowledge has gone up. To sum it up, yes this game has flaws, and the comments from the makers have bad grammer, but at $15 you really cant lose if you are interested in cars. If you went to the movies you'd spend the same amount and that experience only lasts 2 hours at most. ""Skip the Big Mac and buy the game""			"

												Well, for starters, this concept is great, but it's kind of wierd & makes no sence most of the time.I've some basic knowledge of cars & some stuff is just out there. For example, to remove the starter you have to take it looking in from the hood, behind the motor. No way you would do that in real life when it's accessible from below and no way you'll get your face, hand and a tool down there from above. Second, to remove the power steering you'll have to remove BOTH Tie Rods from both sides, which also makes no sense. But to sum it up, it's a nice concept, fun to play for a couple of hours, but then you've done everything a couple of times. And besides, it isn't as ""Gearhead garage"" was. You aren't able to buy & mod your own cars.			"

Per la versione italiana scorrete sotto!Premise: Don't look at my gameplay hours, I had the DRM free versione and imported the savegame.Car Mechanical Simulator 2014 is one of the few game in the Simulator jungle that keeps his head up without looking like a 2 cent program made to lure people.Gameplay:You are a mechanic and in the story mode you will start in your little workshop. You will receive orders from the costumers and you will have to find the problem by investigating and/or disassembling the car, then fix it..At start you can only do a little test run with the car (other than disassembling it piece after piece), then you will unlock the diagnostic center and the chiptuning.The structure of the mechanical parts is a good compromise between detailed and ""Let's not freak out who doesn't do this job"", the only flaw: Almost nothing change between different cars model.Game engine:Do not expect too much from that, it's not made to amaze you. It has a simple graphic, you will never see your character, when driving a car it feels really ""arcade"". Music and sound are minimal as well.Conclusion:Even if it's a little repetitive and I hated the quarter mile addon (the 2 DLC are included in the steam version) I suggest you to buy it even if you are slightly interested in the subject. It's well done without being too demanding and it's quite cheap (even better when discounted)---------------------------------------Premessa: Non guardate le mie ore di gioco, lo avevo come DRM free e ho importato i salvataggi.Car Mechanical Simulator 2014 è uno dei pochi titoli nella giungla dei Simulator che esce a testa alta senza sembrare un brutto programma creato solo per intortare i fessacchiotti.Gameplay:Voi siete un meccanico e nella modalità storia inizierete in una modesta officina. Riceverete vari ordini dai clienti e smontando e/o investigando dovrete trovare la fonte del problema e ripararla.All'inizio potrete fare solo un test a parco chiuso della macchina (oltre al controllarla smontando pezzo per pezzo), poi man mano che andrete avanti sbloccherete il test diagnostico in officina e il chiptuning.La struttura delle parti meccaniche è un buon compromesso tra dettagliato e ""non spaventiamo chi non ne sa nulla"", unico neo: Non cambia quasi nulla tra i vari modelli di auto.Parte tecnica:Qui non aspettatevi molto, non è fatto per stupire. Ha una grafica semplice, non vedrete il vostro personaggio, il movimento delle macchine è molto ""arcade"". La musica e il sonoro sono anch'essi minimali.Conclusione:Nonostante sia un po' ripetitivo e pur avendo odiato l'addon del quarto di miglio (i 2 DLC sono compresi nella versione steam) vi consiglio di prenderlo se siete anche solo un minimo interessati alla tematica. E' fatto bene senza risultare pesante ed è anche abbastanza longevo, inoltre non costa molto (ancora meglio se lo trovate in sconto)			"

												Dont expect to be able to repair your own car in real life after playing this simulator. It has all of the essential parts of the car but it doesnt go into every tiny detail which you need to know in real life. An example of this is that you get to replace the brake pads and caliper but the brake lines are non-existent in the game. This is still a very good program for anyone to get themselves familiar with all the major car parts. At least next time you have your car tested and it fails, you know which parts are being replaced. For the price, this sim is cheaper than most books you can buy. You can visually learn where all major parts are without having to jack your own car up and asking someone else to teach you which is which. Its very easy to navigate too. 8.5/10			"

												This is one of the best car mechanic sims I have played but, it can become redundant after awhile.Initially there are lots of different jobs to perform and it actually requires you to remove screw after screw and seperate components to get to the innards of the engine, suspension etc. You have to order or repair parts after diagnosing what the problem is and replace the proper part. Overtime, this can be repetitive because there are only so many parts and always the same problems with each car.Overall, it is interesting at first and a well made game but, it becomes quite boring quickly.

												Its a ""ok"" game.but allmost all the parts are the same from one car to another, i do know that its sometimes like that in the real world but it should varies a bit more.What is missing (in my opinion)Brake pipes and breake fluids.Tire pressure.Better sounds from damaged part when testing.Diesel engines.Better mirror reflection, (damn its poor compared the the rest of the game)Cooling fluid.Adjust front light.Older cars! they all look nice but we need classics also :)The game feels a bit like Beta, still long way to go. even Street Legal Racing redline has more features.

												The controls to this simulator are soooooooooooooooo bad. Like you are locked in weird menu modes, with no obvious way to move around to different car parts. It becomes an exercise in how to work out how to get the wheel off, when it will let you take apart every part of the car other than the wheels which are the only thing you need to examine. Arggggh! Why do people insist on making such terrible controls for software, and aweful menus? Just keep it simple and functional. The colour and shape of the menus do nothing for the enjoyment.			"

												If you like to work on cars and you like puzzle games this IS for you.  If you know nothing about the basics of how a car is assembled but like puzzle games this might not be for you.  For instance, if you don't already know that a fuel pump is installed in the gas tank and the filter is in-line with that pump then you will be searching for days where to find a part that is supposed to be replaced.This game will not teach you how to fix a car. However, it can give you some basic ideas into what makes a car tick as well as learning some terminoligy such as what a tie rod actually is and where you would find it on a common car.  If your a mechanic (like me) it can be a little frustrating at times when you know what needs to be replaced and it makes you go through a ton of unneeded steps to make that replacement. But again, it is a puzzle game more than how a person would really work on a car.Some things that could be added to the tutorial IMHO would be to show that you can go to the repair bench and fix some of the parts rather than buying new...I'd also like to see controller support...WSAD in the test driving portions can make you sea sick.Lastly, the graphic optimizations need some work. I play this on an 27"" iMac; I had to turn a lot of the options off to make it playable as well as reducing the resolution.  When I play it on my MacBook Pro on Windows7 I dont have to...even though my iMac has much better specs.All that said, I am very happy with this game and look forward to the new update. "

												Hey guys,I have 5 hours or so on the clock for this droll lil game called Car Mechanic Sim! I personally know next to nothing about cars, and while awaiting Dragon Age's impending release, I needed to kill a few hours and I thought I'd learn a lot from the game.What I got out of it:* I know a LOT more about car parts and their location.* I have a basic grasp of replacing car parts.* I got more enthusiastic about cars.* I had a fair amount of fun for a few hours.What I did not get out of it:* An intuitive interface (it's quite cumbersome and the camera is dreadful).* Knowing how to tell when a part is bad.* Learning what different parts do.* Really finding out  how to do it (the game has a necessary level of superficiality).All-in-all not a terrific or extremely realistic simulation, with actually pretty poor controls and very little in the sense of helpful tips or tutorials, but for the few bucks I spent on it, I do feel I learned a lot of useful things and I had fun learning them!

												There is only one thing that's good about this game - an idea. Everything else is so terrible that it gave me a headache. So if you like to do the same things over and over again, with terrible steering, lack of options, clumsy graphics and awful interface - buy it. In my opinion it's a complete waste of money.			"

												 To be honest, this is very hard. I just love the concept, but the game doesn't play well at all.

Really that's more than enough to get a lot of people to stray away. Still, if you purchase this game you were warned (Escpecailly to check computer specs, as this game taught me to do.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator isn't really a simulator. It teaches you about the very basics of what a car might consist of and then asks you to take out all the red parts and replace 'm with green parts. The 'diagnostic' tools at your disposal turn the objects of the car into a particular colour so that you can easily hunt down the red parts.There is no real problem solving involved, the diagnostics are always the same and some of them do not even require any interaction. The only difference is the outcome of what parts will be green, what parts will be yellow and what parts will be red. Occasionally you'll be asked to give an oil change, which is sort of a mini-game but not a very fun one.It is interesting to see what a car is made up of when you don't know (the first few missions were quite a learning experience for me) but after that the game drags on and on, giving you the same type of tasks over and over. You could finish all of these ""objectives"" a heartbeat if you didn't have to unscrew everything at a snail's pace and be forced to wait for it to be done loading when you switch ""rooms"" in your garage. I also saw no point to using second hand parts or trying to cheat customers out of money by swapping parts around, the game would never allow for it. So not only is there no real car problem diagnostics, you're not allowed to run the business your way and the information you receive on what the various parts actually do is meager to non-existent. in other words: this is not a simulator. Don't go in thinking you'll be able to fix your own car afterwards. You -might- be able to tell where the fuel filter is and what a serpentine belt looks like, though. I could neither recommend nor disrecommend this game, it is an interesting concept but I wish it was more of a learning experience. I am, however, leaning towards ""yes"" as I got my money's worth out of it (€ 1.50).The 1/4th Mile add-on is horrible, it crashed on me and it is only about driving in a straight line. The car store functions as a sort of power-up marketplace now instead.The 4x4 simply adds, you guessed it, off-road vehicles to the rotation.			"

												Well first of all, i never write analisis of any game. But from this game, i can say that is so fun, so useful and also isn't a waste of money. Car mechanic Simulator is a game where you will start learning the basics, and it would guide you in part but most of all is your mind that have to process new habilities that are used in real life to keep your car in good conditions.When you continue playing and enjoying learning in a fun way, you will discover the function of every piece that conforms a car, then is when the interest of being a real Mechanic comes. You will start replacing/changing the same parts of a car, but this time you will like the best quality and functioning a car can give you by adding the best parts, this is known and tunning and isn't hard, only you just have to be interest in it, and see the awesome things you can make. One of the best programs ever done. That's it! Thanks to the developers.			"

												It can be fun at times, but two main things totally RUIN it.1. The camera Oh my lord, the camera. It is so limited that you can't see what you want to look at. You're basically limited to half of the engine to see. It's Terrible.2. The lack of a tutorialTo its credit, there is one, but it only covers the brake pads and only teaches you basic controls. The next order (after the tutorial) gives you NO location of the parts you need to replace. How am I supposed to figure out where an exhaust manifold goes when I don't even know how to mute the audio?			"

												Ok, imediatelly when you start career mode and you look around the shop, one detail will instantly let you know that game is not realistic. Nothing to do with real life. :)How so?Well, did you spot that calendar on the wall? Any decent mechanic would know that calendars should be calendar of some nude chicks.... and not some... errr oldtimers...duuhhh!There you go. Review finished. Case closed, game needs upgrade.Developers, be quick to fix that. I suggest some Playboy DLC's with regular updates. :D Oh, yeah, for giving you that idea, I'll settle for 80% of cut in extra revenue after content providers share... seriously, I'm not joking.

I bought this 'game' soley because of how happy the man in the thumbnails looked fixing his car. I wasn't as happy and the main reason is due to me not knowing much about cars. If you're a mechanic this is for you, but you'll probabloy be fixing cars or something. If you like cars, Need For Speed is slightly, just slightly more fun. Be warned!			"

It's probably based on the old Gearhead Garage game, but unlike the original, this just feels like a waste of money and time.The last ""update"" from the team was a kickstarter asking for more money for an online version, despite the fact that this game is clearly not finish in any way.Not only can I not recommend this game, but I advise you to keep away from it.

												For the first couple fo hours playing the movement of the camera actually caused vertigo. By slowing it down I was able to begin t enjoy this game it IS a modern update of Gearhead Garage but without the ability to buy cars to fix up and sell. You start out in this great one car greasy little garage that fits like old jeans, and after doing innumerable repair jobs you transition to this beautiful spotless three car garage whose floor you could lick. No warning no congratulations, just boom, you're there. I find the game terribly lacking in direction or helping anyone who doesn't know much about cars. You're on your own pal. No tips, suggestions, arrows, manuals you can check, nothing I found. I also wish it offered more advanced repairs like total engine repairs not just sub-assemblies. The game is a good start but needs a lot of improvement. More variety of cars and parts, American cars, hints and tips. It's a good time for $10 but mybe the future holds improvements. Thanks for reading.			"

												This Game Is Great! 8.5/10!A Simulator Where You Run Your Own Repair Shop! We've Been Waiting For Something Like That For A Long Time and Here It is.This game is great for anyone who likes working on cars (Duh its in the name.)The realism is a little off example you can run a car into the test track wall at 100+ Km/h and not get a penality for that action you did, You have to buy new rims each time you change a clients tires! Why couldn't you just buy the tire and then place it on the rim you already have? Like I said the realism is a little off. But for the most part the game is really good, The sounds of the cars is pretty good and the with over 150 parts to repair/replace you will get the feeling of a Car Mechanic.This game will need a decently good computer to run on good settings.PS: This game as a sequal coming out around April or July 2015 so be on the look out for that.

												Some people may remember a gem of PC gaming history called Gearhead Garage.  This is basically that game, but much, much better.And I have to give Gearhead Garage props, that game sucked me in for hours when I was younger.  It was incredibly simple, and can probably be easily converted to a flash game at this point.So you can imagine my elation when I saw this game.  Since it was indie, I didn't want to pay full price.  I've been burned by too many boring, broken, or incomplete indie games in the past on Steam.  I can say, knowing what I know now, I would definitely pay full price for it.At this point I am addicted to it.  For me, that is being stuck at work, and looking forward to getting home and playing th is game to unwind.  I usually play for an hour or so at a time (I'm a casual gamer).  That's pretty rare for me, only other games to do this are bigger hits like GTA V or The Last of Us.I'm a huge car nut, so I very much enjoy this game.  I've tinkered in real life.  Granted, the game completely simplifies all the repairs, but it's still satisfying and doesn't feel mundane or boring.I also really like the fact that you can ""learn"" things such as increasing profits, reducing parts prices in the catalog, or increasing the speed of removing bolts.Each scenario feels like a puzzle, and a few times I've been stumped and had to look something up online.  If you have any automotive experience, some of the jobs are easier for you to tackle, since you've probably experienced it in real life; e.g. tires are wearing out fast (suspension), car shuts of randomly (fuel pump), etc.  If you don't have experience, you will probably learn a thing or two, that is pretty cool.As far as graphics/sound/controls.  The graphics seem slightly unoptimized, FPS can dip down once you're in the shop, but the graphics don't look incredibly detailed.  Sounds are average, nothing amazing there.  Controls aren't too bad, the camera can be annoying sometimes with how it zooms.  But after a while you'll get to a point where you're flying through all the interactions and whatnot, so it's easy to get the hang and feel of.If you're a car nut like me, and have actually worked on cars before, this can be a fun romp for you.  I'd definitely recommend trying this game out, it is well polished, and well executed.  Big kudos to the developers!			"

												I bought this game in a steam sale a while back but never had a chance to play it. Now that I have had a chance, I'm going to not recommend it to friends.The gameplay is simple and easy enough to follow for any mechanic enthusiast or hobbyist, and it is fun. Those are the pros.The cons however are that this game does not support ""Windowed Fullscreen"" mode, which is something 99% of games today have. On top of this, when fullscreened the game does not block your cursor from leaving the game window area which causes the game to minimize constantly if you have a setup with more than one monitor. The windowed mode doesn't minimize, but the game locks up.If these issues are resolved, I'll likely change my stance as the bits of the game I could play without it minimizing every 2 minutes were nice. However if you have more than one monitor, you'll need to give this one a pass.tl;dr1/5, gameplay was nice, but terrible programming and lack to common features in most modern games make it unplayable.

												Well, being a real life mechanic I don't even know where to start with how frustrating this game is at times. But I'll just say I can tell whoever designed the vehicles has never touched a wrench, and decided against having someone who is a Mechanic or at least mechanicly inclined to assist in even naming parts, yet alone on how some parts come off the vehicle. I have to remove the rear differential to remove the drive shaft? Uh, no. And 90% of theparts you have to access from the wheel well can be accessed from under the vehicle, without even removing the wheels.All in all, I actually would recommend this game amazingly, but that's because it's still a work in progress and has time to improve. Only advice is don't take mechanics lessons from it, you won't learn anything. And real mechanics beware, it'll drive you nuts.			"

												VERY SUPRISED by how awesome this game is! Feels like a finished product for a change, not like other simulator games! Great sounds, great graphics, easy keyboard layout and generally fun to play, learning about different parts and problem finding. Starts off telling you how to move around and using the action key to interact with your environment, then it lets you do your own thing; completing jobs, buying books to learn more (to level up), test driving the cars etc. Levelling up through the game gives you bigger garages and better tools! Definitely worth the money and would recommend to anyone who loves cars and simulation games.			"

												Where to start.. As someone who used to do this for a living, this game could have had it's uses. Unfortunately it does not reflect any of the work a mechanic actually does, i understand that it can't be too complex but there are mountains of things missing from the actual cars, (water pump but no radiator, hoses heater core etc etc) inlet manifold comes off like it's a toy while the exhaust manifold uses 4 bolts per exhaust port  and bolts to the block not the head, wheel bearings, brake pipes, you name it. Silly stuff like making you remove the entire exhaust system from the back to let you remove the exhaust manifold. or the intake ducting and the air mass meter to be able to remove the airbox to change the filter i can only assume was done to make it drag out the career mode.Get someone who actually knows about cars to design the parts and it could have been goodEvery chassis is identical so it just turns into a grind.some of the explanations for the faults are complete gibberishCheck the oil for some reason becomes change ittelling you to change individual brake pads or do the discs but not the pads, changing oil without the filter and only individual spark plugs etc etc. This could get people thinking the real thing is a breeze and why you will find people doing a DIY port and polish job by tipping sand into the intake of their running engine...one to avoid IMO			"

												The game is very limited in the types of repairs you can perform, thus it gets borring very quickly. I know I've spent a lot of time on this game, but the only reason for that is because it's easy to pick up and put down very quickly. Sort of a mindless time-waster. If they spent time on making the car's systems more complex (adding an interactive cooling system, a/c, maybe as far as engine break-down) I would like the game more.			"

												I run an automotive repair and customization shop and am an A.S.E. certified tech and I love the concept of the game but the execution was terrible. It is obvios that they did not employ anyone in the staff that is a mechanic. There are a huge amount of things overlooked (like where are all your tools?, theres a red tool box that is smaller than anything that could hold any usable amount of tools) Or how you buy brake pads individually(4 per car) (irl they are sold as a set per axle), and why is it harder to find parts in the game then it is in real life? It is also more frustrating trying to navigate the view and be able to click the parts then it is to do it in real life. Also the OBD scanner should be better than a $100 scanner since it is just a simulation....For the most I wanted to love it but just couldnt, 1 star all the way			"

												DO NOT GET THIS GAME! I bought this thinking it would have some gameplay to it. It is the most shallow point and click adventure ever. Even if you are a car mechanic, do not get this! It will make you feel♥♥♥♥♥♥about your life. As soon as I started playing, it felt like I had wasted money, so I Alt+F4. I feel sick to the gut about how much money I wasted on a half finished, boring concept. Even if you have watched videos on this, and think it would be even the slightest bit fun, heed my warning.     My problem with this game is that it has 3 inches of gameplay. You get a car, you buy some parts, you take parts out, you put some in, then you assemble the vehichle. It's like a 3D jigsaw. What seperates this and a 3D jigsaw, though, is a 3D jigsaw does not guide your hand every step of the way! If the person giving you the car has not already told you what it is, then driving it once around a track or sitting in the car will tell you. I really hate this, as it removes any concept that this game once had. It drops from a puzzle with depth to a point and click. You get a lot of the same car in this game, and the cars aren't even real, so it's not like a lack of license.      The controls are clunky. The camera slides like it's on a demonic rail from hell sent to bite you in the f*cking♥♥♥♥♥♥ The mouse lags, and the head-sway would make you believe that you downed 3 bottles of painkillers before each job (I certainly thought about doing so). I understand that you can turn headsway off, but if you do that you feel like you have had a neck brace put on. The music is so loud and abrasive to my ears. It's not licensed, and I know that you can turn the music off, but that's boring. This game has NO middle ground!     I haven't even started on the mechanics. You can only access certain parts from certain angles. That part makes sense. My problem is that some parts make no sense as to where you extract them. You should take the gearbox out from the bottom, but no! You take it out through the top. Through the engine! Don't get me started on the nuts! You should unscrew nuts diagonally, but this doesn't matter, acoridng to Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. For a game specializing in CAR MECHANICS they don't know anything!     You can buy second hand parts from a dodgy website, but there is almost no point as you can either repair the parts, or buy them new. Second hand parts are never good enough. You could repair them, but that takes extra time, and it's a lot easier to just buy new ones.      To cleanse my ways, I am going to donate £13 worth of toys and stationary to the bravery box in a cancer ward. It's the only thing that my £13 could be spent on to justify spending so much on a game that made me feel sick. I do agree with funding indie developers, but only if they have good concepts. I was stupid to buy this in the first place. Learn from my mistake, or donate £13 to a teenage cancer trust. Your choice. http://www.clicsargent.org.uk/ "

												I find this game great, like what others have said, this game isnt in depth, its a very general game. The reason i'm giving this game a 4 out of 10, is because on many different occasions, the game tells me the order isn't complete. I've completed the order, replaced all the parts to green, yet the game still tells me i messed up. So, after many hours in this game trying to figure out what i did wrong, the conclusion is this: the game was wrong. I wouldn't pay full price for this game, i'm glad i got it on sale. One more thing, i can get motion sick in some games, this game is one of them. There is actually a setting that lets your character ""bob"" his head up and down. The windows in game shouldn't be bubbly, make the windows clear, i want to see the outside clearly, there are also little white dots floating around constantly in the game that serve no purpose.			"

												The person who created this game has clearly never seen an engine in person. There are several parts in the wrong locations and dependencies that make absolutely no sense, such as removing the air flow meter in order to change the air filter. Riddled with bugs to the point that I have had to either delete my profile and start again or reinstall the game in order to advance. Both expansion packs are poorly thought out. The 1/4 mile add in particular makes absolutely no sense and the engine sounds in the dyno were horrible. This game is a waste of money and time. 0/10			"

												Didn't expect much from this game at first and bought with the summer sale.  That being said I have enjoyed playing it while I work.  It does not have a lot of indepth gameplay.  I find it relaxing and more of a puzzle game than anything.  They're on the right track, reminds me of Farming Simulator.  I look foward to more development with future titles if they are able to make them.  At the moment I recommend buying the game if you can get it on sale. It is not worth spending over $10 bucks on it. But will fill your time nicely if you are looking for a change in your normal genre.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 starts off in a garage as you take on the role of the Mechanic. The goal is simple: perform the tasks on the work order using your trusty wrench and diagnostic tools (including test drives), not to mention your two eyes to find and repair the various parts and make a profit.The game itself isn't terrible, the graphics are quite good and the gameplay is fluid enough, but the repetition and free-roaming aspect of the game can become tedius if not completely irritating at times. To give an example of this, take a work order that simply says ""The car pulls to the right sometimes."" You'll find yourself pulling the car apart to find the problem, then you need to walk to the computer to buy the new part, walk back, put everything back together and move on. Sometimes the simplest problem becomes a headache because you have to remove several parts to get to the part you need to replace.Walking around the car and having to work on it section by section can be a bit of a pain, but for simulation sake is pretty accurate enough to real life that it makes sense. Although, in a gaming aspect can just be viewed as a bit of a waste of time and makes some jobs a bit too long to be enjoyable. The fact that you can't create and build your own cars and sell them off is a bit of a letdown as well.All-in-all, if you want to remove bolts and replace parts all day long, this is your game. I would recommend getting it at a discounted price if you can. Although a nice little past-time game, long-term and replayability is definitely not on the books for this title. The potential is there but unfortunately it falls just short of a good simulator.Rating: D+ "

You get a quick overview where youll find the different parts on a car and you learn how to read the hints that a broken car gives you.Real car freaks might be disapointed, but Im sure that for most people this is a enjoyable way how to learn a little bit more about your vehicle and have some fun!

												This is a really cool indie game. The extensiveness of the kind of repairs you take on if you were a mechanic is awesome. I don't know if there are other games like this but I think this one could go far. They can just keep adding on more and more content for a new game down the road. What I really mean is that there is so much more that can be done with a mechanic simulator. But please, oh god please... just tune down the dubstep a little and offer an off switch... I can't find it on the radio :C			"

												Great game, if you really like cars. You won't find much pleasure in driving the car, it's really a car mechanic simulator like the name states. The interface is very nice and simple, easy to learn quickly. Pros: -interface is nice and simple-gameplay smooth, no bugs really-puts you in the shoes of a mechanic.cons:-should have more ""buttons"", keys to do things (eg: press Q to view task, press TAB to switch between assemble and disassemble. I've done some coding and I don't think this is very complex to add, but would be nicer!-Test driving the cars is rather useless as it doesn't tell you much about what's wrong!-Of course, this is a new game, but it could have more cars, parts. More complexity would make the game even better, but I think and hope this comes with time.			"

												For myself, I enjoy this game, speaking from a non-mechanic view.  Always have liked vehicles in general, but never learned much on how to fix things. So this gives me some shear fun learning. Excited to hear about the 4x4 add-on coming out later. Who knows, maybe they will make my day, and whip out a Semi Truck to work on !  Anything is possible, thank you CMS 2014 developers. I appreciate your time and efforts.			"

												Only two serious problems, one is fixable, set ""Clip Mouse to Window"" in the Other Options menu and restart the game if you have more than one monitor to stop it from clicking off and minimumizing, the other isn't so fixable, you can't rebind the keys to your own liking. Beyond that, it's damn fun to play. :D So I would recommend it, just be ready to be forced into using WSAD until, hopefully, these guys will fix the unbindable keys.			"

												I'm on the border of recommend/not recommend for this game.This game is made only for a very select group - one that wants to learn all of the basic mechanical components of a vehicle, and to learn associated problems with parts.If you don't enjoy taking things apart, sometimes painstakingly, you won't enjoy this game. The jobs range from really easy to complex. Sometimes you have to take apart 5 parts just to get to one.For those that do enjoy the reconstruction aspects, it's a lot of fun. There are still a few flaws, IMO. One annoying thing is trying to figure out which side of the vehicle to approach a problem. Do I raise the car, or fix it from the hood? This can be annoying trying to figure out from which angle the game wants you to remove parts. Another annoying aspect is camera movement. There aren't enough variables to really move the point of view to where you want it. This makes things unnecessarily frustrating.Still, I recommend this game becaue it's a concept that's new, using a video game to actually learn car mechanics realistically! They could one day develop this more into becoming a full training tool for those of us unfortunate enough to not have a garage :-( "

												For the first mechanic simulator I have played it isn't bad. Its more like a puzzle game. Although there are only 2 different insides to the cars 4 and V6 all the parts are in the same exact location. I would have liked some changes. But as the game goes on, the orders become a little vague and more difficult to check. I would also like to have to repair the radiator, and the actual engine block. But as long as they keep updating it like they are, its pretty good for the money! I have played a few hours and I am happy with my purchase!7/10 due to the guts of the car are all pretty much the same.			"

												Speaking from the view point of one who had zero knowledge about car mechanics prior to buying this game, I found this game to be very helpful in learning the different parts of a car, where those parts are located in, on or under the car and what some of the problems are that are associated with certain car parts are. Could this game be improved? Most definitely but for learning basic car mechanics knowledge, I loved it. The game does get a little monotonous proceeding from one repair order to the next and eventually it does get boring but the learning value for mechanic NOOBs like me was well worth the money I paid for it.

												This game is a great concept, but it's a bit unfinished. If you don't really know much about cars, you're not gonna know what to do. the game doesn't offer up much in hints if you get stuck, and it's not really the best in telling you exactly what it wants you to do. That taken into account, yeah, i enjoy this game, and i recommend it. it's pretty fun, nothing mind blowing. and if you can stumble through it, you might learn a thing or two.my main gripe is the lack of fluid lines. Usually how i'd try and feel out an unfamiliar car is i'd tract the fluid lines. In this one, you have no real way of knowing the fuel filter is in the rear, Also the camera is pretty bad. Like really really bad. You can only tilt it, and you can't morve or pan it. If this game got an update fixing the camera issue, it'd be really really good.			"

												Its a good game and concept but there should be more interaction with the car.  I have played car simulation games with bad graphics back in the day and had alot more stuff to do, like going to the auction to buy a car in some shape or form to rebuild and resell, on top of working on customer cars.  Like being able to tear down an engine all the way to the crankshaft, removing interiors such as seats and exterior body parts if the customer were to get in a fender bender.  If you want ideas you should check out the game called gearhead garage if it will even run on any of the new computers I can get it to run on mine but it takes alot of tweaking.  I would like to see somemore in depth engine repair and body mods and some more vehicle choices			"

												Wouldn't recommend it, could do with a little more realism. Not sure about the rest of the world, but here in Australia, we use air tools for most things, ie; taking off wheel nuts - not wheel bolts. Also, the exhuasts on a car usually come in 3 parts from the cat back, and to replace one bit, you don't have to entirely remove the rest, just saying.Perhaps adding the ability to customize the cars that come in would add something to it. Like fitting a turbo and intercooler setup to a car, etc.I know it's still early stages, but it could be a lot more than what it is.			"

												This is a interesting game. It's not a shooter, a racer, a builder, a platform jumper. Instead, you repair cars. The game genre can be considered in the puzzle catagory, although these are not mind-bendingly difficult puzzles. It definitely would help if you know something about the inner workings of a car, however this isn't really necessary as it's possible to figure things out as you go along. The game consists of a number of scenarios or missions; in this game they are called ""orders"". You receive an order to fix a problem on a car. The description given to you may not be completely comprehensive or even clear; that is part of the puzzle. Your challenge is to diagnose the problem and figure out how to fix it. The graphical interface the player uses is mouse driven and is fairly straightforward and obvious. There are some peculiarities with the camera control; the camera is focused on an object and the player has to click on another object to move the focus. It's not really very difficult and most folks will figure out quickly and intuitively how to move the camera to the best position. There are a few minor bugs but the developer Red Dot has been very supportive in providing updates quickly; about a half dozen in the first three days the game has been available. There have been several fixes, but also some user enhancements and other tweaks to improve gameplay. This is most commendable compared to some other developers that push a game out the door and then disappear. It is hoped that Red Dot continues this excellent support and responsiveness.The game, not withstanding the few bugs, is in excellent shape. Few crashes have been reported and I don't believe I have seen a single mention of issues with different Windows versions. No guarantees are intended, just my opinion based on observation. Your experience may differ. The game, for being fairly simple in presentation, is graphically very nice. The videos and screenshots don't really capture how pretty the game is. Be sure to verify that your video card is up to the specs listed on the Store page. Having a video card myself that is on the lower end of the spec range, I am pleased that even though I have had to turn down all the video settings in the game to their minimums, the game still looks very nice and there is no detriment whatsoever in the gameplay.Another plus for this game is that it is something that adults can play with children; there is nothing shocking or disruptive and since almost the entire game is presented in visual rather than textual format, it would be easy for children to enjoy.This game is NOT recommended for those seeking a deeper, complex challenge. Those folks would probably find themselves bored and frustrated. Also, this game involves some amount of simple repetition; many of the ""orders"" (missions) involve removing and reinstalling the same parts the player has removed and reinstalled in other, previous missions. Some might find this aspects offputting, but for others this will be rather theraputic; there is a certain relaxation and comfort in the familiar.Overall I would recommend this game to others, with the caveat mentioned in the above paragraph about the difficulty of the challenge. I would compare this game to Euro Truck Simulator 2 or Farming Simulator 2013; it is not difficult to play, but can be rewarding, satifying and relaxing. And the price is very reasonable as well.

												It´s a beatiful game. Great idea, but... After some hours of playing this game it is stall the same. Only descriptions of defects are different - this is nice. But the solutions are the same and still repeat. You can try add some part or wire connection. For example corect the body of the car after some accident.Types of car are amazingly textured. But there are a few types of cars. You can try add some ""old"" car without to much of electronics like VW Golf I, or some bigger van like Ford Transit, or just add more types of car... After I repaired about 70 cars, I started to be bored a that´s a shane, otherwise it´s a very nice game...The next is a garrage... Maybe it would be nice, if you can buy some equipment separately. Or if you can start the car, and see some blinking lights on dashboard... But maybe is this too much, but try it a little better... :)			"

												I like it for $15 but the game feels a bit rushed in development. For instance when someone brings a car in that has a leak, you can't ask what color the leaked fluid is.The grammar in the repair notes is really bad.A lot of the times the notes are so vague that you have to disassemble the entire car to find the problem.That being said I didn't really know anything about what goes on under the hood and this did help me a lot, I wish they'd spent more time on it and made it more realistic.

												Too simplistic. There is no real challenge in diagnosing a car's problem, as the game does everything for you, and some of the supposed tests do not offer enough feedback. (The test track.).The economic model is too simplistic, and yoou always have enoght money on each order to fullfill it without using spare parts, repaired parts or needing a loan. Each order is budgeted for you so you never overrun costs uless you buy the wrong parts, and you can run all the tests on all the cars because they hav eno cost associated, nor your manual labor time.On the good side: The GUI is fast, fluid and has no performace problems. The few things the game does are well thought and executyed.Not sure if it's worh full price. It's good when its on sale.			"

I did a few times put in enough in game money, to repair thier car, to place a down payment on a new car for the client but its was all in good fun. I wish it was a bit more complex with more engine configurations and cars in general, but overall I had a blast with this game. I do automotive work on my friends cars for food and this was a very similar albiet simplified experience, but it gives you an idea. I would recomend it for you to get your mind in a problem solving state, and just enjoy something that for the most part is a bit expensive in real life.			"

Then it finds its way into the folder labeld ""My Faveourite Games"" then you think it was worth 20 Dollars!			"

												though I recommend this game for general fun, it is not a true auto mechanic simulator nor should it be considered a learning tool for becoming one.  Their is no engine block disasembly or removal of pistons, crackshafts ect nor can you adjust the throttle.  The engines in all the cars are exactly the same, and if you work on a rear wheel drive car, the engine is mounted like a front wheel drive which is NOT how engines in RWD are monuted. The drive shaft comes out of seemingly nowhere and even if it's rear wheel drive the gear box has shoulders for a FWD.  The only engine configuration is the fuel injected I-4 and V 6 no uniquness or difficulty based on unfamiliarity, in fact, anyone can work on these cars, very basic stuff.  I took automotive service technology in vo-tech and know something about cars, this is totally inacurate.  However, I think there is a lot of BASIC stuff that can be learned from this game, as there is a lot of detail and work on suspension, though that is where it ends. No engine work some clutch assemblages to work on at times. The ""test"" driving is nothing of the knd, I never use it unless an order calls for it, the cars handle exactly the same whether you change out all the old parts for new or not. There is no performance gain in test driving.  Basically, you do a work order, then go to the next. There are three garages each more advanced than the last, however little difference besides a few diagnostic tools you rarely use anyway, most people just want there tires changed and their spark plugs replaced anyhow.  I like the game just to pass the time but there are more advanced games of this nature and it is not a true simulator.			"

												Well, what can be said about Car Mechanic 2014. It a reasonable simulator where you can repair customer's cars and make some cash. It's basically a point and click game. If you have played Gearhead Garage in the past and are looking for a decent successor, then it's debatable if this is it. It's a good little game to get into if you have 20 or 30 minutes to kill, but it does get boring. Word of the wise, I started playing this game with a Radeon R4 graphics card, and it was very sluggish. I found that surprising to an extent, as this isn't a 3D intensive game like Call of Duty or Skyrim. Once I upgraded to the GTX 960 4 GB, I didn't have any frame rate issues.  It maybe the polygon count. Something to keep in mind.			"

												With a passion for all things mechanical; I find myself enjoying this kind of simulator. This simulator offers BASIC information of replacing no longer functioning automotive parts such as: Spark plugs, oil filters, alternators, brake pads, brake calipers, etc. This simulator is a fun little passtime, and it might teach you a little bit of auto repair, however, it obviously won't teach you anything about how gas combustion engines actually function. Anyways, if you find automobile maintenance interesting like I do, you might want to look more into this simulator.			"

												FIVE POINT SYSTEM REVIEW WARNING!!!* I've got a five point system review, in that it scores a point if it seems to achieve what it's going for, this is by no way, shape, or form good nor bad. It simply means, I personally felt that it achieved what it was going for and nothing more. Graphics, music/sound is self explanitory, Gameplay refers to controls and functionality. Genre refers to if it achieves it's actual Genre, if it's a simulation, did it achieve being that? Genre is broad, but can be fudged up by developers. Overall fun, refers to if I had fun or if maybe I think you'll have fun with this title. With that in mind, onto the review. *Graphics: 1 Point = Yes, graphics were decent, but could have been slightly better.Music/Sound: 1 Point = Yes, though the music could have added more tracks to seem less repititive.Gameplay: 1 Point = Functions well, felt very natural from the very start.Genre: 1 Point = Tis advertised as a Car Mechanic Simulator, and in many degrees it achieves such.Overall: 1 Point = It's very fun, HOWEVER, latter levels seem more of a chore.Total: 5/5My first impresions of the game were quite fond, everything was new, and I had to figure out, A) What was wrong with the car, and B) How to get it out, and replace it. For some levels, it took me a few trys, like figuring out where the spark plugs were and how to get to them. Mostly, it was pretty easy once you get the flow of things in the game. Replacing parts I've never replaced earlier felt exciting. Rear Axel here, 4 wheel drive there, replace muffler ect.It wasn't long before I mastered this game and quickly was gaining cash. It's here were fun started to turn into a bit of a chore. Everything was too easy towards the latter levels of the game. I knew how to do everything and beat all 75 levels within 2 days. I even replaced one cars whole parts just to stop the game from being mundane. To say there isn't enough to do is an understatement, while the early stages are fun, there really isn't much stopping you from plowing through this game. Latter stages are repitive, but are still fun in their own right.I'd still recommend this title, and see that it has potential, however, I think you should wait till the DLC and content updates come for this game before buying. It's a good game, just not as good as you may hope.			"

												Very interesting idea, poorly realized. Graphic is rather mediocre, driving simulation is awful. No real challenges apart from the need to know how a car is built. Unfortunately it cannot be learned from the game itself, the tutorials cover only the basics. The game becomes boring quickly, the orders require tedious and repeatable work. Perhaps it the only realistic thing in this simulation, however disqualifying it as a game, because gaming is fun, or at least should be. Buy only at a huge discount.			"

												Surprisingly nice little game. You might think of it as a puzzle game that can help you learn how cars are built. Yes, it's not 100% accurate, but it will give you a pretty good general idea. The mechanics (pun not intended) of the game are pretty simple, you have to find the broken part and replace it. Very simple idea, but it can be quite fun and relaxing, and netting you some car mechanic knowledge in the meantime. There is nothing competitive here, you will not be judged or measured against others, so you can just chill out and fix those cars.			"

												very unimpressive, i stay away from most simulator games cause more often than not they fail to provide you with a reason to play longer than 15min, i should have stayed away from this one too, i expected to work on a variety of cars not just 2-3(4?) brand spanking new cars in different colors, i dont understand the reason for the test course, it doesent matter if you take a car thats down to 30% condition on everything or one thats tip top, it runs equally crappy(first time i tested that luxury sedan i thought i was driving my old nissan cherry 1L on 2 cylinders again). i had hoped to see classic cars too, work inside the engine and gearbox, this is just a plain joke, what you do here is mostly what the average person can do on his own. camera sensitivity is horrible, maybe you can change it in a config file but not adding in the option was plain lazy. the way the camera snaps back and forth when you interact with parts is especially annoying, why no just let people zoom in as much as they want and leave them alone? there is more id like to complain about but likely noone wants to read this much as it is.

												I would recommend this game but only with warning: Only a specific type of gamer will enjoy this! I enjoy it as something to pass a little time on another games update or a few missions at a time. The game is decent but flawed IMO. I'm on a order in the 2nd shop and the complaint is something about ""engine wont start, need it tomorrow"" or something...However I have replaced the damaged engine components and have even TEST driven the car but I cannot select ""Repaired"" to complete the order.....WHY WOULD I BE ABLE TO TEST DRIVE IT WITH THE ENGINE ""NOT RUNNING""....simple things like this kinda ruin sims for me. But Overall I would give it a 6/10 rating for that certain casual gamer not looking to shoot an aliens face or run and gun gerbals in a 10x10 map.			"

												I am still uncertain about this game. The whole idea and the high level of detail is highly appealing. However I am struggling with the controls. There's room for improvements:* Camera rotation in assembly mode is just odd with keys: very clumsy and unintuitive. The mouse would be a much better idea* Ordering parts is hell on earth: So many items without a quick search or filters. Buying many things will end in a click orgy for confirmation. Why not use a checkout mechanic?* Options not available in game mode* Quick menu is a nice idea, but it should make available especially buying stuff. * Where are the parts I have to examine/repair/replace? I like to learn something about cars and I don't know for example where the oil filter is. This may be fun for trial and error, but can leave you at a loss in some situations. Some guidance if needed should be implemented. Could be manuals and with upgrades, even augmented reality.* Head/Camera swaying while moving around. Please make this an option, I feel seasick. When I look at things in real life at least my head is not moving around unvoluntarily.* Mouse wheel not working in game browser to buy stuff* Funds are covered by browser window "

It's not as in-depth as gearhead garage was, but a good step in the right direction. Minor issues such as not locking the mouse to the active window resulting in the game losing focus with multi-monitor setups at times. Other than that, a very solid and stable game.The little bit I have played of this, I have really enjoyed it and will be playing more in the future.			"

												You know, it's an interesting game. I didn't have a clue where any given part was in a car before I played this, definitely learned something, but I suspect if you're a car person, this will have a severe lack of authenticity. The game also gets a bit tedious after you complete the first garage, and there's no long-term replay value. You get everything you're going to get out of the game in a day. That said, I don't usually learn much in a game and I did here. I'd say worth it if it's on sale and you don't know anything about cars but you'd like to learn how to maybe change your oil.			"

												very unimpressive, i stay away from most simulator games cause more often than not they fail to provide you with a reason to play longer than 15min, i should have stayed away from this one too, i expected to work on a variety of cars not just 2-3(4?) brand spanking new cars in different colors, i dont understand the reason for the test course, it doesent matter if you take a car thats down to 30% condition on everything or one thats tip top, it runs equally crappy(first time i tested that luxury sedan i thought i was driving my old nissan cherry 1L on 2 cylinders again). i had hoped to see classic cars too, work inside the engine and gearbox, this is just a plain joke, what you do here is mostly what the average person can do on his own. camera sensitivity is horrible, maybe you can change it in a config file but not adding in the option was plain lazy. the way the camera snaps back and forth when you interact with parts is especially annoying, why no just let people zoom in as much as they want and leave them alone? there is more id like to complain about but likely noone wants to read this much as it is.

												A kick back to the era of gearhead garage. If you loved that game, you will find some enjoyment out of this. It's not as in-depth as gearhead garage was, but a good step in the right direction. Minor issues such as not locking the mouse to the active window resulting in the game losing focus with multi-monitor setups at times. Other than that, a very solid and stable game.The little bit I have played of this, I have really enjoyed it and will be playing more in the future.			"

												I would recommend this game but only with warning: Only a specific type of gamer will enjoy this! I enjoy it as something to pass a little time on another games update or a few missions at a time. The game is decent but flawed IMO. I'm on a order in the 2nd shop and the complaint is something about ""engine wont start, need it tomorrow"" or something...However I have replaced the damaged engine components and have even TEST driven the car but I cannot select ""Repaired"" to complete the order.....WHY WOULD I BE ABLE TO TEST DRIVE IT WITH THE ENGINE ""NOT RUNNING""....simple things like this kinda ruin sims for me. But Overall I would give it a 6/10 rating for that certain casual gamer not looking to shoot an aliens face or run and gun gerbals in a 10x10 map.			"

												I am still uncertain about this game. The whole idea and the high level of detail is highly appealing. However I am struggling with the controls. There's room for improvements:* Camera rotation in assembly mode is just odd with keys: very clumsy and unintuitive. The mouse would be a much better idea* Ordering parts is hell on earth: So many items without a quick search or filters. Buying many things will end in a click orgy for confirmation. Why not use a checkout mechanic?* Options not available in game mode* Quick menu is a nice idea, but it should make available especially buying stuff. * Where are the parts I have to examine/repair/replace? I like to learn something about cars and I don't know for example where the oil filter is. This may be fun for trial and error, but can leave you at a loss in some situations. Some guidance if needed should be implemented. Could be manuals and with upgrades, even augmented reality.* Head/Camera swaying while moving around. Please make this an option, I feel seasick. When I look at things in real life at least my head is not moving around unvoluntarily.* Mouse wheel not working in game browser to buy stuff* Funds are covered by browser window "

												To use the word simulator for this game is spot on.  There are no hints to tell you where the parts are, as you should know if you are a car junky!You can test drive the cars and the spacebar is an unlisted button that you can use to use the handbrake of the car during test drives.A must have for car lovers.Bad points:- The camera view controls are a bit tricky, not only you must rotate them but you should click on the part you want to focus on while you rotate.- Adding on, big/long parts like the exhaust will center on itself even when you are unbolting the bolts at the end, so the camera will not focus on the bolts and it can get out of view..- I do wish there were bikes too..- There should be opening hours, so that there is a better and more realistic feel of a workshop./			"

												A game that tries very hard to be the next gearhead garage, but fails to notice; people don't want to be limited in their exploration of these magnifique machines. Sure, it's cool for the first two missions that you have to walk to the correct wheel to get the wheel off. But this charm gets lost after minutes of gameplay.Big improvement suggestion: Get rid of screw-turning time all-together. You could better call this: bolt-turning simulator. Even with the level 10 upgrade, it takes AGES to take off a wheel. And there's no drill you can use to make it easier, everything by hand.			"

												For myself, I enjoy this game, speaking from a non-mechanic view.  Always have liked vehicles in general, but never learned much on how to fix things. So this gives me some shear fun learning. Excited to hear about the 4x4 add-on coming out later. Who knows, maybe they will make my day, and whip out a Semi Truck to work on !  Anything is possible, thank you CMS 2014 developers. I appreciate your time and efforts.			"

												Only two serious problems, one is fixable, set ""Clip Mouse to Window"" in the Other Options menu and restart the game if you have more than one monitor to stop it from clicking off and minimumizing, the other isn't so fixable, you can't rebind the keys to your own liking. Beyond that, it's damn fun to play. :D So I would recommend it, just be ready to be forced into using WSAD until, hopefully, these guys will fix the unbindable keys.			"

The game does have a good sense of realism and is really fun, you do learn alot of stuff from this game either your a mechanic by trade or have an office job. Made for all types of gamers. The few things that i would of liked to have seen intergrated into the game is, the ability to be able to build your own car from the ground up, customisation of the workshop by the player.			"

												This game is NOT like Gear Head Garage if anyone reamembers that game. But it is a lot of fun. But it does certainly has room for improvement. But I higlhly recommend playing the DEMO first before blindly purchasing it based on players reviews. I sort went into this game thinking cool another Gear Head Garage game, but sadly it is not that in any shape or form. First off you are given jobs, and given a certain amount of how much the job cost. It is up to you to pin point the problem based on what the customer said or by test driving, or doing a test tech in bigger garages. One thing I learned while playing is the vehicle will have a lot of red parts, but you won't have enough money to buy/fix them all, just buy/fix what the person wanted and send it on its way. Buying/Fixing the red parts will put your shop in a early grave, so while tempting. Just DON'T do it.One job that really threw people off was the fuel filter job. While having replaced the fuel filter in my car recently. I knew it was in or near the gas tank, so I went there right away. But other's stumbled on this job for a long time. Now I said this game has much needed improvements.Like jobs, they need to be rewarding or graded on how well you did also if you missed something major. They should of done a story line or something to make the game interesting, but there really isn't any voices. And if you shut music off it's really really really quiet. Other than the occasional sound of the nuts coming offAlso the ability to just build a vehicle from the ground up and they paint it cool and sell it. While this isn't technically what mechanic does, this game based on the jobs, isn't technically what a mechanic does either, I never been to a shop where the customer pays for the job first, unless it's routine maintenance.  With that being said it should have the option of adding parts in case there is a bigger problem than originially thought.Also there needs to be more parts. Able to fix more parts. More second hand parts,, in much better condition. Since most of those parts are bit of a rip off.  Also the parts cost a lot. I mean A LOT. Oil Filter costing 50 bucks.The camera angle is something to be desired. especially in the back of the vehicle. I had a hard time viewing the vehicle. Sometimes the WASD buttons would reverse. How do you get to bigger badder garages, by doing jobs, that is how. I am not sure how long I played but didn't seem like very long and I got my 2nd garage pretty fast. Changing oil is pretty routine. But changing oil in the 2nd garage is odd. You have put it in this catch oil pan and you have be very percise where it is or you lose 100 dollars. The first garage wasn't like that you just drained the oil and that was that. Just seems to be a step back, instead of a step forward. And in the 2nd garage for sure, why can't you now fix tires? One of the tires in the game cost either 1600 or 1700 for one tire, I could see if it was all 4 tires. But this is just one tire. Jobs don't pay a lot, so replcaining one tire is really expensive. On the plus side of things there is going to be FREE DLC. So perhaps some improvements in game play as well more things to do. While I do reommend this game. I really recommend playing the DEMO first. Here is hoping the Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 is taking the ideas of the fans and making EVEN better than the original.			"

												Well. What can I say??I've been wanting to play this for a little while, and I've now managed to have a little blat..First impressions? Well, as a mechanic by trade, I really wish it were that easy to remove bolts... But that's not the name of the game here is it? Granted the tutorial is 30 seconds long, but that, to me, sort of adds appeal, as it means you have to think about what you're doing. This isn't a mindless shoot em up. You have to think logically, especially when it starts getting into replacing a clutch and so on.What needs to come off first before I can get to the real issue. Pretty much like a normal car. As a really nice touch, I like the fact you get money returned for recycling!! Granted, there's not much variation in the vehicles, like RWD, 4x4 etc, which would add more dimention to the game, but as it is, is has what a good majority of cars now are. Front Wheel Drive.I'd like to see more parts to be added, and get down to the real nitty gritty parts, like circlips and split pins, you know, all the little fiddly bits, or even having a seized stud which you've got to use oxy-acetylene to warm up to get out, even a snapped bolt..Maybe I'm being too traditional there, but these things happen!!One thing that IS missing.. Girly calenders. Sorry for being sexist here ladies. I have yet to come across a garage that doesn't have a girly calender somewhere. And who in the world had an FSO Polonez poster on the wall?? hehehe! (1st garage, behind the lift control) Yes, I know RedDot are a Polish company before you start!Ah! another good point.. A PROPER lift would be advantagous here. One where you specify the height or at least have complete free wheeling, instead of using a scissor jack??  Do garages really have lifts like these now? Be nice if the lifts were the double poster type, just so you could work at the height you want, not either on the floor or in the air.Again, being picky because of grease monkey.. =)Overall, if you want to learn a little about cars and like a little challenge, then this game is ideal.To me, this is a fun game, not a sim, but I enjoy it enough to keep playing.

												This simulator sits on an odd waypoint; likely too difficult for those who know nothing about cars, but too easy for those who do. As a result the game quickly becomes a tedious follow through of removing bolts in to replace certain parts. The only real difficulty lies in establishing what the customer actually wants done sometimes.If you're looking for an updated version of Gearheads Garage, this aint it, thats for sure. The game could have done with perhaps trying to be more educational if they were targeting the non-mechanically minded. For example, instead of having someone remove a trailing rod, it'd have been clever to have a brief description available as to what this part does, symptoms of when its gone wrong and so on.As it stands, the cars all look the same, you're limited to just how much actual work you can do on a car and it lacks the realism of your typical garage in that you can't half♥♥♥♥♥a job then overcharge the customer.

												Brief: Gameplay: 8/10, Graphics: 8/10, Sound: 8/10 Replayability 5/10.In depth:As far as simulators go, this is a very good one. Graphics are great especially the wireframe view, and the controls are fairly easy and intuitive. Sounds are pretty good also especially the main menu soundtrack. Going through career mode is enjoyable but I can't imagine myself playing it again for quite a while.As far as gameplay goes, it looks to be aimed at a fairly beginner mechanic to a hobbyist. If you know how to strip an engine down and rebuild it I probably wouldn't recommend it. I know the main concepts of how all the parts of an engine work, however I still learnt a bit from this game, and it is still keeping me entertained. There is a few annoying things (like having to remove the airpipe, then 4 bolts and the airflow meter, then another 4 bolts for the air filter cover, before being able to see the air filter) but this is minor.It starts off where all the engines are 4 cylinder front wheel drives, then after about 15 or so missions it slowly introduces you to more (4x4's, 6 cylinders) and it starts from basic problems ""replace my brake pads"" to ""my boss told me to bring the car to you but i have no idea what you need to fix"" type jobs. After playing about 40 missions, I'm still enjoying the game (especially the dyno-tuning mini-game) and i really hope they bring out a more detailed and more complex version next year. I'll definately buy it. I would like to see the ability to ""hear"" and ""feel"" problems (ie: when driving around the test track) or being able to negotiate my own price with the customer (maybe ringing them up halfway through a job saying ""this is also broken, want it fixed?"" or ""i can do this cheaper if i use 2nd hand parts"". I would also like to see more types of engines (maybe trucks, rear-mounted engines, motorbikes).All in all, its a good game, and i'm stopping this review now so i can go and play it more...			"

												to add to the ""ima mechanic myself,"" i acutally do electrical work for cars and trucks so i have found this game to be a bit of a fun novelty for myself. there are some inaccuracies but other than that its alot of fun and has a good base for people who dont know alot about cars to learn from.

												This is an awesome beginning to what I hope will be come a long running series!A few things that you need to understand,1. There is only about 50% of the car to take apart when comparing it to a real car. The big pieces are there but not all the little ones 2014 focused on suspension, exhaust, and drivetrain.. However, for that 50% it is actually accurate on what is on the cars today. Thats why I hope they keep up with the series and by the end get full 100% accuracy and maybe even customizability of the cars.2. In this game its easy to learn about all the peices of your car while not getting covered in oil. It is very repetative but it is still pretty fun, and the best part is that you don't have to do it in person to learn about how to take your car apart. I have done this in real life, I own a jeep, it can get very dirty. So I highly recommend this game if you like those dinner dash kind of games and also to people who want to learn a little bit about how a car is put togething and what is under the hood as they say.The only cons to the game is I wish they would spend a little more time in updating or fixing the ""running a garage"" aspect of the game. However it is obvious that they are focusing on the ""car and parts"" aspect which I'm fine with too. Again, hopefully later in the series they will fix it.Best price, buy it if they have a kickstarter campagn! They had one for the new 2015 game and it was 10 bucks to buy in and get a copy and you know you are supporting the developers directly. The 2015 game will have a lot more detail, so far I noticed that they are focusing on the engine block (2014 focused on suspension, exhaust, and drivetrain.)			"

												A fun ""simulator"" for gear heads, and non gear heads alike. Well worth the $5 price tag. My only complaints are the lack of condition information on Used parts, no real guidance on some repairs that I can't figure out on my own. I'm not a car mechanic, so sometimes I don't know where to look for some parts. Just a guide saying ""part x is located in the rear"" etc... Also, the controls are awful, and extremely touchy. For less than the price of lunch, its well worth the $5. I wouldn't have bought it at the full price.			"

												It's a very nice idea and mostly well made.But a few horrible things make the game unplayable for me. Graphics and sound are good enough, but the interface is very lacking.Main problem: the way way camera/mouse behaves. It's hard to describe, but you have to move the mouse VERY carefully or you end up swaggering - every time you move the mouse, the camera moves too.Another problem is the game doesn't really help you - I'm no mechanic. I have no idea where the fuel filter might be (somewhere near the gas tank, I'd assume?).Unfortunately, the game doesn't even indicate where the item in question might be, unless you're already very close. (Case in point, until you think of lifting the car, you don't even know there's another place to tinker UNDER the car. All other options are constantly shown (hood, wheels, side door), but not the one below the car, even if it's directly part of your current job?A minor nuisance: to change game settings you have to leave the current game mode and get to the main screen again.

												Car Mechanic Simulator at its core is pretty simple, you point and click on the various parts of the car to remove/add them back on. After reviewing the invoices you can remove parts or order them from your computer. The directions on the invoices can be somewhat vauge at times and usually involves replacing parts you didn't need to. Overall I found it to be fun, if you go into it without a vast knowledge of cars it can be somewhat challenging, and there is definitely things you'll miss the first time around. (Example, I didn't know the garage had an oil pan and lost 100 dollars for oil cleanup.) I picked this up as part of the playway bundle for a dollar so I have no complaints, I've gotten my money's worth out of it, but your milage may vary.			"

Also camera is terrible (fuel pump?).Great starter for Car Mechanic franchise.During sale its a decent buy. Otherwise grab newer versions.			"

												6/10I got the game after they freshly released it and always waited for their little DLCs they've released but the game has some serious issues that are annoying but not a real death sentence.Positive things:- The job variety is alright. In the story mode you dont have to do the same thing twice in a row, you get to see different approaches.- The graphics are ""alright"" for a studio like this.- Many parts to disassemble. Just had the fun on a mission to take a whole car apart and get it back together.- Tuning possible but very limited.- Car class variety from vans over sedans to sports cars.- Chance to order used parts and brush them up to save money.Negative aspects:- The tuning itself is set as a minigame that makes absolutely no sense. I am not a car mechanic, dont intent to become one but I cant imagine that you sit infront of a screen and move a damn flipchart of an EEPROM around until the percentage matches.- Very poor physics in the test drive. Every customer nearly needs the test drive to be sure that the car is working but like the game is made it just does not represent anything, the car feels like a fish in a god damn tank.- The DLCs dont really brought that much of content to be satisfied. - Credit is a one time thing in the whole game, seriously?- Double Monitor use always throws you out of the game when your mouse leaves the game, never have that happen in other games.- No customer wants to keep their car parts, makes the form and the difficult of the game pretty low.- The race track is just a horror with the physics as well.Potential that could have been used in my eyes but well...I still enjoyed it, nothing outstanding, can pay that low price for it.

												You know, it's an interesting game. I didn't have a clue where any given part was in a car before I played this, definitely learned something, but I suspect if you're a car person, this will have a severe lack of authenticity. The game also gets a bit tedious after you complete the first garage, and there's no long-term replay value. You get everything you're going to get out of the game in a day. That said, I don't usually learn much in a game and I did here. I'd say worth it if it's on sale and you don't know anything about cars but you'd like to learn how to maybe change your oil.			"

												very unimpressive, i stay away from most simulator games cause more often than not they fail to provide you with a reason to play longer than 15min, i should have stayed away from this one too, i expected to work on a variety of cars not just 2-3(4?) brand spanking new cars in different colors, i dont understand the reason for the test course, it doesent matter if you take a car thats down to 30% condition on everything or one thats tip top, it runs equally crappy(first time i tested that luxury sedan i thought i was driving my old nissan cherry 1L on 2 cylinders again). i had hoped to see classic cars too, work inside the engine and gearbox, this is just a plain joke, what you do here is mostly what the average person can do on his own. camera sensitivity is horrible, maybe you can change it in a config file but not adding in the option was plain lazy. the way the camera snaps back and forth when you interact with parts is especially annoying, why no just let people zoom in as much as they want and leave them alone? there is more id like to complain about but likely noone wants to read this much as it is.

												This is a interesting game. It's not a shooter, a racer, a builder, a platform jumper. Instead, you repair cars. The game genre can be considered in the puzzle catagory, although these are not mind-bendingly difficult puzzles. It definitely would help if you know something about the inner workings of a car, however this isn't really necessary as it's possible to figure things out as you go along. The game consists of a number of scenarios or missions; in this game they are called ""orders"". You receive an order to fix a problem on a car. The description given to you may not be completely comprehensive or even clear; that is part of the puzzle. Your challenge is to diagnose the problem and figure out how to fix it. The graphical interface the player uses is mouse driven and is fairly straightforward and obvious. There are some peculiarities with the camera control; the camera is focused on an object and the player has to click on another object to move the focus. It's not really very difficult and most folks will figure out quickly and intuitively how to move the camera to the best position. There are a few minor bugs but the developer Red Dot has been very supportive in providing updates quickly; about a half dozen in the first three days the game has been available. There have been several fixes, but also some user enhancements and other tweaks to improve gameplay. This is most commendable compared to some other developers that push a game out the door and then disappear. It is hoped that Red Dot continues this excellent support and responsiveness.The game, not withstanding the few bugs, is in excellent shape. Few crashes have been reported and I don't believe I have seen a single mention of issues with different Windows versions. No guarantees are intended, just my opinion based on observation. Your experience may differ. The game, for being fairly simple in presentation, is graphically very nice. The videos and screenshots don't really capture how pretty the game is. Be sure to verify that your video card is up to the specs listed on the Store page. Having a video card myself that is on the lower end of the spec range, I am pleased that even though I have had to turn down all the video settings in the game to their minimums, the game still looks very nice and there is no detriment whatsoever in the gameplay.Another plus for this game is that it is something that adults can play with children; there is nothing shocking or disruptive and since almost the entire game is presented in visual rather than textual format, it would be easy for children to enjoy.This game is NOT recommended for those seeking a deeper, complex challenge. Those folks would probably find themselves bored and frustrated. Also, this game involves some amount of simple repetition; many of the ""orders"" (missions) involve removing and reinstalling the same parts the player has removed and reinstalled in other, previous missions. Some might find this aspects offputting, but for others this will be rather theraputic; there is a certain relaxation and comfort in the familiar.Overall I would recommend this game to others, with the caveat mentioned in the above paragraph about the difficulty of the challenge. I would compare this game to Euro Truck Simulator 2 or Farming Simulator 2013; it is not difficult to play, but can be rewarding, satifying and relaxing. And the price is very reasonable as well.

												This was the first game I played that revolved around cars, and it's what inspired me to go take the air filter out of my car and learn more about mechanics! I only paid like two dollars for it just to give it a try. Who knew it'd make me love cars?It's a one-of-a-kind game, there is nothing quite like this one out there. While this game may seem a bit limited in concept or design, the sequel is definitely not. CMS 2015 is one of the biggest improvements in game quality that I've ever seen from a small game developer. I give this game a 9/10 for being remarkably original and replayable, and the sequel a solid 10/10. If you like this game, or want to know how cars work, buy the sequel. It's worth every cent! "

												This has a nice feel to it compared to previous car sims.Even more fun when you decide to take a whole car apart (as much as is possible) and try to reassemble it. Always seem to forget to put something back in it's proper place. :pIf you're an enthusiast and/or just want to get an idea of the workings, give this one a shot.			"

All the vehicles in game are fictious which is fine but getting to work on real vehicles and get to know their inner worksing would be fun. Licensing would probably make it cost too much though.			"

I went from knowing nothing about cars, to going into my relatives mechanic shop and confirming that I have learned a few things since playing this game.Lots of fun!Check it out! "

												First impressions were fair to good.  Graphics are reasonable and frame rate is good on my rig.The controls, particularly for the camera, are a little quirky.  Using WASD to manipulate the camera isn't ideal really in my opinion, the mouse is more appropriate for that function.As you would expect from a budget title, the game lacks depth.  I found I was really quite bored after an hour.  Endless unbolting of parts, which, whilst realistic, becomes very tiresome.  The vast majority of jobs you receive are simplistic and in all honesty, even with my limited knowledge of car mechanics, there was no real puzzle here.  There is no ""businesss simulation"" either.  A single click awards you with a one time bank loan.  That is about the only business decision you make.You can purchase upgrades which improve the speed at which you remove bolts, or a percentage increase in income per jobs, but there are few options besides this.Test driving the cars is exactly the same each time and even on repairs you would expected to hear an indication of a fault, such as a work order describing knocking from the suspension, I heard nothing.I found the gameplay very repetitive indeed.  There is not much to recommend here I'm afraid.  It might keep a younger person occupied for a few hours but thats about it.  Educational value is minimal beyond explaining the names of car parts and their rough locations although even these are only accurate on a very basic level.Cannot really recommend this title, it is just too lacking to be called a simulator.  Buy a meccano set instead.			"

												The problem with CAR MECHANIC SIMULATOR 2014 is the interface.  Even at the lowest settings (and you will want to set mouse moves to the lowest setting) the controls are mushy and awkward.  The main problem is the constant need to center the screen on what you are aiming for, rather than just using the mouse to point at it.  Also, too many things involve clumsy menus and mouse moves where keyboard shortcuts would work a lot better.The general gameplay elements are good, and I think the game would be enjoyable if the controls didn't make every simple task a chore and a nuisance.  It reminds me trying to accomplish anything in SURGEON SIMULATOR.  I have not tried other games in the ""Simulator 2014"" set, but if they share this interface, I won't be playing them.  I cannot recommend this game.			"

												I got this in a bundle, and this was one of the reasons I purchased the bundle. It might sound a bit dull and boring, but is better than I thought it would be, the game is also perhaps slightly educational. Only gripe is the viewing angles can sometimes be a bit awkard and diffcult to get to, and for someone with no experience of cars in a mechanical sense, some parts can be difficult to find and locate first time around. I did have to watch a couple of youtube videos of others playing the game to find where some parts were. The physics on the test track are also a bit poor. However the game can be played with an erection and I am sure I will return and play it it small doses a few levels at a time as even though you do click on different bits in the levels, it can be a bit repetitive. I would not pay the full asking price though, but worth picking up if its in a bundle or on sale.			"

												I came to the game not looking for an exact mechanic representation, but rather a Guitar Hero level of abstraction that would let me get more familiar with car parts. I feel this game does a great job of that. There is no time limit to complete the repairs, so it ends up feeling more zen than game, which I like.I think there is room for iteration in adding more business and customer interaction elements, but for the sale price I got this for, I feel it was well worth the 10+ hours I have put into it before it started to get a little tedious.

Both are great games. Newer one has more stuff you can do in it though, like car auctions, selling or keeping vehicles and upgrading your garage and ect based off how skilled you become and how smart you get.

												If you like to work on cars and finding out how things work, and want a game thats alittle more on the relaxing side then this game is for you. All in all its a good sim game, but can be annoying when you have to remove some parts just to get to another part that in reality you wouldn't have to remove to repair. My biggest complaint would be the camera system. when you click on a part to remove it the camera zooms in then you have to move your mouse around again to get back on the part. It messes up the view that suits you to make the repair. However this is a small annoyance, and can sometimes have you wondering why you can't find any bolts to undo untill you zoom out or readjust the camera. I'll give this game an 8/10			"

												I played a version of this game many many many  years (over a decade ) ago. It's pretty much the same except now there are work orders,a test drive section, a parts ordering mechanism,and a radio. Overall it's the same game. (but it was on sale for less than 3 bucks so what the hell I picked it up).Let me say this, as a simulator this game falls wayyyy short, I've never done a brake job that didn;t have caliper bracket bolts or a bracket for that matter so yeah not too realilistic there. The prices are very odd, there's no pressing out bearings (so far anyway) and one of the first 5 jobs i was supposed to test an alternator...well when I removed the thing it said 6% cheapest option was replacement, ordered part put it on, got the belt on, took the battery out (1%) cheapest option was repair (90 some dollars....what shop doesn't have a charger to  ""repair"" a battery for free?) put it all together went to close out the repair and low and behold it said to test alternator...what the ♥♥♥♥ does it matter now that i replaced it? and it wouldn't let me just check the condition of the old alternator... so ♥♥♥♥ that.Other things to note; the mouse is laggy in game, it has different speeds in different parts of the game i.e the menu, the game, the computer ordering , all different speeds incredibly frustrating. The test drive section is pretty pointless, I don't think I know of a single person who would want me to put their car through such strain after fixing it and it's clunky.In summary if you have an interest in working on cars but no knowledge this game is actually a decent tool to familiarize yourself with the components of the average automobile, the version I played so long ago went a long way in helping me memorize the main engine components of the average v8 of the era and this game is more advaned. But you're better off just working on cars to learn how. so yeah don't buy this unless it's super cheap and you have next to 0 car knowledge.			"

												I recommend this game with a caveat. Specifically, the caveat is the price I paid: $6.79It's definitely not worth $20. While it's fun, especially for someone like me who is pretty ignorant of cars and their inner workings, the game gets rather redundant after a while. I can see an experienced car guy be rather irked by this game after a few missions.One of the dumbest aspects of the game is the used parts store. It's completely pointless, as the replacement parts you buy will not let you advance forward in the game.So all in all, get this game if it's under $10 and you're a complete car newbie like myself. It's fun to learn some stuff about cars, but at the same time, gameplay and some gameplay mechanics are incredibly weak.			"

Could this game be improved? Most definitely but for learning basic car mechanics knowledge, I loved it. The game does get a little monotonous proceeding from one repair order to the next and eventually it does get boring but the learning value for mechanic NOOBs like me was well worth the money I paid for it.

												As a car enthusiast, I found the game to be overly simplified. The interface exaggerates the monotonous aspects of working on cars, while skipping entirely the actual difficulties and triumphs. The main workflow consists of getting a car with a job sheet. The sheet has a vague problem and a dollar amount you'll be paid if you fix the problem. The first assumption made here is that the person who wrote the job sheet knew what the problem was but failed to tell you. They also figured out how much it would cost for you to fix the problem and are charging the car owner that amount. If you fix exactly the problem, you will be profitable. This is a very flawed model since it gives no penalty for diagnosis. You can tear the entire car apart, find the item that has the most amount of wear, if that item can be replaced or repaired for the amount on the job sheet, then it's likely your problem. Rarely, the problem can be 2 or more parts that are marginal.There are several ""makes"" of car in this game, and several different configurations. Most cars and minivans are 4 cylinder, front wheel drive, suv's are all wheel drive, and a few performance cars are v6 (LOL) with rear wheel drive. All cars share most of the same parts. A front strut for the suv fits the economy car, performance car, minivan, everything. There is no confusion about parts at all. The air filter fits everything, as does exhaust pipes, mufflers, cats, brake calipers, brake shoes, end links, shocks, struts, fuel pump, fuel filter, spark plugs, ignition modules, and about a dozen other parts.The mechanics of the game are tedious. You get your car and job sheet. You have to figure out which part to replace, but some of the parts you cannot diagnose till you've taken other parts off. For example, if you want to diagnose any suspension component, you have to remove the wheel before you can diagnose anything else. Once the wheel is removed, you can diagnose a layer of components. Diagnosis consists of either selecting diagnose mode, and clicking on the part, or removing the part. Diagnosing the part makes it turn a color from green to red, with green being the 100% effective and red being 1% effective. It appears that anything below 30% is your bad part, with 17% being the most common threshold for failed part. Remove the part, go to the computer and buy another part, sell the bad part on the used part market, and then install the new part. Put everything back together again. Get paid, rinse, repeat till you're sick of it, which for me was about 2 weeks. One area in particular that bugs me is the brake caliper removal sequence. I have removed brake calipers many times, from many different cars, trucks and motorcycles. in every case, the brake pads stayed in the caliper when I removed the caliper. The game has the brake pads stuck to the rotors, so an additional step is needed to remove the pads. The problems encountered are textbook, and the solutions are also textbook. Anyone who knows about fixing cars will know immediately what the problem is when reading the job sheet. Could this 'game' be used to gain experience in fixing cars... maybe. One would understand more fully what each component was and how it fits into the whole, and how it's failure would impact the whole. The part about the actual work, I believe would only help someone by giving them a general idea of where on a car that item lives. The work portion is so over simplified as to be a great source of laughs for the first 100 times, then tedious boredom after that. There is no searching for the correct sized socket, then discovering you need the deep wall, and don't have one in that size, or picking the wrong size, and rounding off the bolt, so now you have to use a pipe wrench and buy a new bolt... or discovering you cannot fit your hand into the space provided so you make an elaborate contraption of extensions and universal joints only to discover you didn't need to take that bolt out after all. There's nothing about anti-seize, lock-tite, assembly lube, torque wrenches, impact wrenches, nothing at all about tools. I never had to dig out the welder, sawzall, hammer, prybar, gloves or safety glasses during the game, which makes it totally unrealistic. None of the bolts are ever stuck, rusted, or broken. They're always easy to remove, and install. I never burned my hand on a hot exhaust, or got shocked by a faulty spark plug wire, or got battery acid on my good jeans, or spilled oil all over the engine and had a smoke bomb when the car was started. Also, you cannot install parts out of sequence, so the all too common scenario of discovering you forgot to install the wheel bearing seal after you finished putting everything back together never happens. I cannot really imagine an audience for this game. Maybe servicemen overseas who miss working on their cars, or prison inmates... A teenager should have their own jalopy to work on and learn from. An adult inclined toward this will have a project car to work on, and certainly will be working on it instead of pretending to work on it with this game. Someone who is considering this line of work as a vocation won't get an accurate picture with this sim, but will get a very general idea of the workflow. Guys like me see this as a novelty and buy it to be disappointed. Perhaps someone with less hands on experience would benefit, or enjoy the simulation. The design and artwork for the sim is good. I will recommend this sim/game for people curious about working on cars. If you already know how to work on cars, pass on this.			"

												I don't know anything about cars, so this was a ""what the hell, why not"" purchase. When you get into it, it tells you how to interact with the game itself, then gives you your first task - something on the order of ""change the oil, air, and fuel filters."" There is no help beyond that point. None. And that is the best part about the game. Remember, I don't already know where these things are, so I had to figure out where each part was and how to take the entire car apart by myself by touching every piece, and testing every connection. I can imagine it wouldn't be as deep for someone who already has knowledge of cars, but man was each little revelation satisfying.I can't wait for the 4x4 and Turbo updates. The only thing I wish this had was a larger variety of engine and undercarriage setups, and would love to see a little randomization in the vehicles that roll into the shop - e.g. aftermarket products, missing parts (""my muffler fell off!""), etc.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2014, where gaming titles are concerned, sounds about as boring as watching paint dry but the game is actually quite fun and enjoyable. You dont have to be an expert in the field of automotive maintenance to quickly get a feel for the game either.You start out in a run down small neighborhood garage, a car will be brought in, a clip board with a complaint or two from the vehicles owner will be written, and tasks you need to perform to get paid for the job will be listed. It can be as easy as a quick oil and filter change to something as complex as changing out a 4 wheel drive transmission or having to inspect numerous parts of the car for defects chasing down an elusive ""squeek"" or ""squeel"". You can repair parts, replace parts, test drive the vehicle to help in your diagnostic... and as your experience and skills develop you can even chip tune vehicles.As the game progresses, you move up to bigger and better garages and begin receiving higher end automobiles from clients, There are some management aspects to the game as well... as in real life parts can be expensive, you might have to scavenge used parts, or repair existing parts to save money while meeting the customer's needs. Additionally, each job is worth a total cash value, if you get too carried away or start repairing every little minor thing on the car you could end up spending $1,500 bucks out of your own pocket to complete a job worth $1,000 so certain repair vs replace aspects have to be kept in mind.This is not going to be one of those games that keeps you on the hook for months on end like some fast paced shoot em up might... however, I am well into repairing my 50th vehicle and have spent nearly 10 hours playing the game over the last few days as i write this review and i still want to play more, and with the potential for add ons and expansions, the entertainment value is certainly there.PROS: low learning curve, easy to use, straight forward interface, excellent graphicsCONS: camera movement and clicking icons can feel a bit clunky but it is not really a major distractionWhere i would like to see this title go: supposedly there is a 4x4 Offroad edition in the works. But i think a great direction to take this game would be an expansion for off-road and sporting and performance accessories. in other words a customer comes in not with problems, but wants to have a high performance exhaust and a supercharger installed. Or another customer wants his truck to have a roll bar, off road lights and a lift kit installed or any number of countless modifications. Additionally, i think an expansion for aircraft maintenance would be a great addition... periodic inspections of the airframe and powerplant, overhaul of engines and components, repairs etc.In the end, Car Mechanic Simulator is a fun title, and a great way to learn a few of the basics of how cars work if you dont have much of an understanding of cars, and it is a great way to kill time if you are a tinkering type			"

												100% Recommended at the $7 sale price. $20 for the regular price and I still think it's worth it. I'm 61/75 on the normal orders and still have 20 left on the offroad add-on.Gameplay is smooth on ultra settings, except I have OA and DOF disabled because of my old GeForce 9600 GSO and running 1600x900 native resolution.Game still looks very good with those settings.The camera can be bothersome at times, but you can click on any part near the part you actually need to focus the camera quickly. The only downfall is the repetative gameplay itself but it's still engaging and pushes you on to complete the order, and the next, and the next.Personally I wish there was more depth, like being able to actually delve into the engine, or replace U-Joints and smaller stuff. But I understand this game is meant for everyone and people that don't know a lot about cars could get lost.I would just like to see difficulty settings. Normal and Hardcore where Hardcore is much more mechanically inclined.All in all, I recommend this title.			"

												So this game is sort of a neat premise with not enough effort put into its execution. It is, as many have already pointed out, somewhat limited in scope. You click to unscrew bolts, you inspect the condition of the parts, you order new ones from the computer and you replace the old ones. Done. Occasionally you test-drive the cars on this one small ugly test course. So far, the insides of most cars I have repaied looked the same! If you get to work on a muscle car then the setup does change, but basically the insides only differ per type of car and not per car. All the major parts of a car are there but don't expect to be replacing some small stressed screw somehwere or repairing a crack in the windshield. This game does not go that deep.But since I know almost nothing about cars, it did teach me a thing or two about them so mission accomplished I guess.I recommend it but only if it's on sale. 20 euros is a bit too steep. The only thing this game really has going for it is its uniqueness, which is a shame because I think an in-dept car mechanic simulator would be an interesting game.			"

												For a game that calls itself a ""simulator,"" there are several aspects of this game that fall far too short of the real-life experience of working on cars.The first mistake I noticed is the missing human element. In this game, you will find no blank stares or slow mumbles. There are no memorable answers to simple questions, such as people claiming to own a Honda Elantra. The customers usually know what's wrong with their cars and leave understandable notes on the work order, which allows you to quickly find and correct the current problem. I cannot begin to explain how far from reality this actually is. The another jab to the title of ""simulator"" comes from the ease of installation or removal of parts. As any grease monkey will testify, parts just don't come off that easily. I was also sad to find that there was no way to curse at the vehicle for being difficult. The mechanic you play as must be a ghost, as you'll find that starters, located next to the transmission, are installed and removed through the engine bay.Lastly, the cars are all clean. There is no grime to wash off, there are no fingernails lined with black grease. You will not find bandages on your arms and fingers because there are no impact or puncture wounds to heal. No mud, no oil, no antifreeze, no blood. It's all so easy.God I wish it was like this in reality.			"

												Does not correctly support multi-monitor setups.  The mouse cursor frequently goes outside the game window onto the second monitor - clicking then causes the game to minimize and return to Windows, which loses the immersion.  This game would also be more fun if it had options to span multiple monitors to show the objectives at all times.Also, the mouse camera swivels around WAY too fast and the keyboard controls are too awkward.  Maybe this would be fun to play on a console or with a controller, but I'm too lazy to set that up.  Controls are very sloppy.  No keyboard shortcuts to switch modes.  There needs to be some options to control what plays on the radio and songs should cycle rather than play the same thing over and over again until it is manually changed.			"

												Too simplistic. There is no real challenge in diagnosing a car's problem, as the game does everything for you, and some of the supposed tests do not offer enough feedback. (The test track.).The economic model is too simplistic, and yoou always have enoght money on each order to fullfill it without using spare parts, repaired parts or needing a loan. Each order is budgeted for you so you never overrun costs uless you buy the wrong parts, and you can run all the tests on all the cars because they hav eno cost associated, nor your manual labor time.On the good side: The GUI is fast, fluid and has no performace problems. The few things the game does are well thought and executyed.Not sure if it's worh full price. It's good when its on sale.			"

												Sure it over-simplifies much of the ""business"" under the hood and in the chassis, but this game has made it relatively fun to go about fixing a car.  And many of the things that you replace in this game are legitimately as easy as jacking up your car and replacing it (tie rod for instance).  I'm not pretending like it is nearly as easy as the game makes it, but hey it's a good start for someone wanting to get a basic understanding of how to wrench on a car.  Now to add a beer simulator for realism...			"

												This is a really cool indie game. The extensiveness of the kind of repairs you take on if you were a mechanic is awesome. I don't know if there are other games like this but I think this one could go far. They can just keep adding on more and more content for a new game down the road. What I really mean is that there is so much more that can be done with a mechanic simulator. But please, oh god please... just tune down the dubstep a little and offer an off switch... I can't find it on the radio :C			"

												Great game, if you really like cars. You won't find much pleasure in driving the car, it's really a car mechanic simulator like the name states. The interface is very nice and simple, easy to learn quickly. Pros: -interface is nice and simple-gameplay smooth, no bugs really-puts you in the shoes of a mechanic.cons:-should have more ""buttons"", keys to do things (eg: press Q to view task, press TAB to switch between assemble and disassemble. I've done some coding and I don't think this is very complex to add, but would be nicer!-Test driving the cars is rather useless as it doesn't tell you much about what's wrong!-Of course, this is a new game, but it could have more cars, parts. More complexity would make the game even better, but I think and hope this comes with time.			"

												I enjoy this game's simplicity and relaxing nature but I think it could also really do well with some big expansion. They could add in body work (odd when cars come in with trashed engines but immaculate paint), some more variety to the actual cars (4x4s are a good start). I would also enjoy some more customization, such as upgrade parts for the vehicles rather than just OEM. Overall great game 7/10 really nice to play when I'm tired or to relax.			"

												As people have said before, it's rather a basic guideline of understanding car parts and how to go about with repairs. There are a few things that I find odd (like what condition ""used"" items are in and no ability to change keys) but if you bypass these small things, this is actually quite fun and a bit of a learning experience as well.

												Great visuals, good music and sound.  Easy controls make it quite accessable.But after 3 hours of playing I've found it lacking in variety and the gameplay is too simple.Despite the name, this is a car puzzle game, not a detailed simulator.For me, someone who knows very little about cars, I got what a paid for - a learning game that has taught me more of the basics;  the names of various mechanical components and how they fit together, but I imagine anyone who already has that knowledge will lose intrest in this title very quickly.  Different vehicles in the base game all have the same components inside.The main challenge of the game is a real world one - where is the part I need to pull out? and what else to I need to remove first to get it out?   Figuring this out is rewarding.  But there's no need to pick the right tool for the job, simply click a part to remove it or click repeatedly to unscrew it.There's no time pressure either, no countdown clocks or waiting customers.  Having this as an option after the first few jobs might have spiced things up a bit.Your camera can fly through the transparent body of the car to give you a better view of what you're removing, which is fine except when, despite the fact you can see a part, you can't remove it because you entered this view from the engine rather than the wheel.  This is a little frustrating because the game lacks feedback.  A simple audio cue of your 'character' saying ""Uh.  Can't reach that from here""  or ""Whoops, no room under the car to pull that out.""  might have prompted me to open the hood or raise the car on the lift rather looking around fruitlessly for a  prerequiste part to remove first.  Parts that are visible but inaccessable should have better visual cues, ""greying out"" when you mouse over them, etc.As the career progresses, you get access to better garages, I hope this will allow me to remove engine blocks and pull them apart.If you have children and you'd like to share your motorhead passion with them, this would be an excellent place to start, but if you tinker with real engines, this won't fire you up. Still recommended for the quality of the production but I'd love to see a ""pro"" mode that increases the complexity of the engines and other components.			"

												It's a great passtime.  Being from an indie developer there are some bugs but it does a decent job of approximating (not simulating) the average repair garage.  The camera angles can get a little funky when you're tyring to move around the car but I chalk that up as an attempt at realism.  Since parts on real cars are often only accessible from certain areas but can be seen from others I can give it a pass.  The reparis are somewhat general but if you have a basic grasp of auto mechanics you'll enjoy this game.  Sometimes the programming fails, however, and forces you into a narrow order of operations that is less about reality and more about how the game is coded.  Don't expect to get your ASE certification from the game it's not that specific but the game will challenge you to figure out problems with little more than a customer complaint that says, "" It won't start""Be sure to enable the cursor clipping option or the game will randomly dump to the desktop on a scene change.  Other than that it's just a great timesink for a gearhead.  I got it on sale and feel it's worth what I paid but not the regular price.I'd recommend the game to people interested in automotives that would like to get a basic understanding of what it means to do basic repairs and the thought process behind them.

												It reminds me of those old Street Rod games from when I had a 286. It would be great if not for the camera bs; it is ridiculous. Its like trying to force your way through a gelatinous blob that has you in a headlock. It would be acceptable if i could just easily point and click and do what I want when I want to. I turned the music off, that helped. Turning the graphics to maximum low while retaining desktop resolution helped. Apparently it has some seriously advanced graphics my computer cannot handle. I just keep yelling at it. It makes me long for the 286. I want my 6.99 back, but I am too lazy to RMA for it. Maybe I will play this again for another frustrating hour in a year or two.Why did I buy this? I knew better before hand. I knew it was going to suck.

												I have made the questions up and the answers are my personal opinion....Does it look good? It is alright.Is the music good? NoIs it a car mechanic simulator? No. It is a car themed point&click in the right order exercise.Will it teach you anything about cars and mechanics? Very little, but if you really have no knowledge whatsoever about cars than you might able to learn something. However, Civilization will not teach you about how to rule the world either but it is still a good game.Is it an enjoyable game where time is flying while you are playing? Definately not. I`ve found a rather frustrating experience to play this.Has it got anything else than a car themed point&click in the right order exercise? No, at least not for me. I could not figure it out, if there is. Is there at least a hint of business strategy element? Nope.Is the way how you have to fix the cars in the game intuitive and challenging? Nope, unless clicking the mouse on various parts of the screen without much thinking - as long as it is in order - is intuitive and challenging....Is there anything you have liked in this game? Nope. Well, I do like the idea of a car mechanic simulator (hence I have bought it), but personally I don`t like this particular game.Who is this game for? No idea, but it has received a lot of positive reviews so I guess they like it.Would you recommended? No. I would recommend to spend that money on something better, which I wish I would have done instead of buying it.			"

												The game feels very ""rough"" as it's not a true simualtor. It's very basic mechanics. In real life you don't need to remove the entire exhaust system just to remove the headers. You don't need to remove the entire intake system just to remove the air filter. As a real-life mechanic, the part removal process is just unbearable in this game. I shouldn't have to keep the car on the ground to remove the tire and work on the upper suspension and then raise the vehicle to work on the lower suspension. Much of the processes are just painful to do. It's still fun.If you don't understand mechanics then get out a notepad. Otherwise just blow through the game.			"

												Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 starts off in a garage as you take on the role of the Mechanic. The goal is simple: perform the tasks on the work order using your trusty wrench and diagnostic tools (including test drives), not to mention your two eyes to find and repair the various parts and make a profit.The game itself isn't terrible, the graphics are quite good and the gameplay is fluid enough, but the repetition and free-roaming aspect of the game can become tedius if not completely irritating at times. To give an example of this, take a work order that simply says ""The car pulls to the right sometimes."" You'll find yourself pulling the car apart to find the problem, then you need to walk to the computer to buy the new part, walk back, put everything back together and move on. Sometimes the simplest problem becomes a headache because you have to remove several parts to get to the part you need to replace.Walking around the car and having to work on it section by section can be a bit of a pain, but for simulation sake is pretty accurate enough to real life that it makes sense. Although, in a gaming aspect can just be viewed as a bit of a waste of time and makes some jobs a bit too long to be enjoyable. The fact that you can't create and build your own cars and sell them off is a bit of a letdown as well.All-in-all, if you want to remove bolts and replace parts all day long, this is your game. I would recommend getting it at a discounted price if you can. Although a nice little past-time game, long-term and replayability is definitely not on the books for this title. The potential is there but unfortunately it falls just short of a good simulator.Rating: D+ "

												Not a bad way to kill time but don't expect anything too challenging here. If you know a little about cars and like to tinker is it good fun and easy to diagnose and repair the cars. Real car mechanics / enthusiasts shouldn't expect much in the way of accuracy or simulation.  Some things are a little strange like when you take a brake caliper off and the pads are still there floating beside the rotor, or how you have to take apart an entire air intake all the way to the throttle body just to replace an air filter.But, it still is a good time waster.The test drive mode should have either been not included or it needs to be upgraded, badly. Every car drives the same no matter what the issue. I even took a car for a test drive that supposedly wouldn't start! Ok.. sure if you listen you can hear the brakes squeak on some cars but that is the only difference i have ever heard so far. The test driving just feels like a chore and the element of fun has worn off by the third or fourth time you have to do one.All in all, I'll play though it. I'm around 4 hours in and about 1/3 completed with the career.Final Thoughts: It's hard to call this a game. There isn't a lot of game aspects to it. If you like to teardown stuff and put it back together, this is a good diversion for what it is. The graphics are good, but I can hear my vid card run like it has never ran before, which sort of tells me that it could be optimized a little better. There are only a handful of cars and most of the time it will not matter which car it is because they all share most of the same components, so when you are tearing them down, there isn't much different between the cars.I know that is a lot of cons, but I still enjoy playing it.. It reminds me of when I was a child and wanted to take apart all of my own toy cars. For that alone I will give it an 8/10			"

												Fun and exciting game, this game can deffently teach kids and/or older people that you can repair your car yourself. And that it isn't as hard as you believe. Most of these things i knew how to do. thats what comes out of owning a Audi.  "

												This game is one of the most fun games I have ever played. It's easy to get into and is just realistic enough to be enjoyable to someone who is a mechanic themselves. I would prefer a higher level of realism, but I understand that there are limits to what can be accomplished via programming due to certain variables (budget, time, staff, etc.) I honestly have nothing bad to say about the game and hope that it is continually developed into the ultimate car mechanic sim. Very unique game with lots of features. I would definitely recommend it! :)			"

												Overall I liked the game, but it's not great.  I think I got the game for $10 when I bought it.  The game is definately not optimized, it runs my computer at 90%.  Its more than any other game I have, so its just bad coding there.  I was hoping this game would help me learn more about the inner workings of cars.  But, it really didn't.  I guess if you knew nothing about cars at all it would help.  I like the problem solving aspect of the game which is what saves the game in my opinion.			"

												While not a super technical gearhead game, Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 is a fun enjoyable light take on car repair.  Some knowledge on cars definitely helps, but even areas so far I wasn't knowledgeable on I was able to figure out merely by wrenching around for a bit. If you approach this game as if it's a puzzle and just keep a laid back attitude, you'll definitely get some fun out of it.			"

												I found it difficult to recommend this game and equally difficult not to. I finally settled on recommending it because it seems to succeed at what it sat out to do. It is a competent simulator. You should plan on reading the steam forums a lot if you are not mechanically inclined or not familiar with what makes an automobile work. That being said, you also don't have to be an ASE Certified master technician to enjoy the game. You have an economy system with progression in the form of better equipment and money boosts. You do have to purchase the parts you intend to use so there is a failure state if you are not careful (you can reset scenarios though). During career you will advance from a small repair shop to a state of the art complex. Parts that you can interact with are highlighted and show colored “health” represented by a percentage meter. Some parts have to be removed to be examined. The parts that can be removed are usually highlighted and if you are required to remove a certain part to get to another they are shown in red to make things easier. An example would be removing tires to work on the brakes. There are also different views you can choose from removing the body rotating the camera and showing “health” of the parts. Graphical fidelity is competent but could have been better. Since this isn't a AAA title though I can accept it. It is not without its problems though. I do have experience and education behind me for automotive service and repair so I didn't really get hung up on any of the scenarios that I played. I can easily see where this game may be too advanced for beginners wanting to learn about cars and it is a shame that there is no hint system to speak of (or at least that I was able to find). My biggest complaint with the game is the navigation. I had to exit the “wheel” section, for example to access the “engine” area (like the transmission bell housing) which was clearly in view already. It made it unnecessarily convoluted and drawn out even though I knew exactly what I had to do.I would have liked to have seen more choice in tools and a way to torque bolts to the proper specs as well as some tire changing/balancing stations but that may just be because I’m really into this kind of work in real life. I would recommend this to anyone with a strong interest in the game but if your interest is only passing you may want to wait for a sale. "

												I don't see this game as a real simulator. It is more a puzzle game in my eyes. Searching for the broken parts and how to take some parts of it is really fun. I also like the texts that appear when you have a repair order sometimes they are just fun. I have bought this game and i don't regret it is a very nice game i'm looking forward to the DLC. 9/10 from me			"

												Game Sucks, Unrealistic as all get out. Prices for parts are outrageous and then the cost you charge the people doesn't even allow you to make a profit. And what car has an airfilter that requires the removal of eight bolts to change? For being a ""car simulator"" it is really lacking. You'd learn a hell of a lot more just by playing F12014 and tinkering with your car setup, or doing the same thing in Dirt. In conclusion, only buy this game if you are too stupid to realize that this is not how a car actually goes together. Save your money, buy some tools, tinker with a real car.			"

												Cool game I love working on cars so buying this was close to the top of my wishlist the game is solid has a nice soundtrack everything is good the graghics etc the only complaint i have is the lack of enjoyment like when you really work on a car you get to use a rench or a ratchet etc and you can move the tires and all but in this game you only must point the mouse at say a bolt and click on it for to remove it and then after taking all the bolts off say 5 for a tire the tire or part will then disappear other than this i'm fine with the game :) i give it 4/5 stars for missing those features			"

												Found it interesting, as a car enthusiast I always wanted a good idea about suspension and what not is thrown together, I do recommend as I played it 12 hours solid. What would have made it more interesting for me would be being able to get into the engine block. At least being able to change out the cams and crank and even the pistons, 3 extra components wouldnt have been hard to implement surely?The turbo dlc should make things more interesting if you can set psi and add boost controllers and such.I think what would make it perfect for me would be customers asking for performance mods. Since whats a good remap and chip tune without some breath mods to go with it like performance exhaust and filters. I think adding performance parts and see how they affect the car performance would bring more people to the game.			"

												I got this in a bundle, and this was one of the reasons I purchased the bundle. It might sound a bit dull and boring, but is better than I thought it would be, the game is also perhaps slightly educational. Only gripe is the viewing angles can sometimes be a bit awkard and diffcult to get to, and for someone with no experience of cars in a mechanical sense, some parts can be difficult to find and locate first time around. I did have to watch a couple of youtube videos of others playing the game to find where some parts were. The physics on the test track are also a bit poor. However the game can be played with an erection and I am sure I will return and play it it small doses a few levels at a time as even though you do click on different bits in the levels, it can be a bit repetitive. I would not pay the full asking price though, but worth picking up if its in a bundle or on sale.			"

												Well, how do I say it... I recommend it if you can get it really cheap, like I did.This game is considerably detailed and can give a hint on car mechanics, specially for those not really aware of it (which I doubt there will be many, since if you bought this or is thinking about buying it, you probably like car mechanics a lot). The major issue for me, is that most things are simplified and worst, all cars look the same ""under skin"". Yes, you have the 4x4 that adds some differences, but I don't think there are that many. There is a nice touch of discovery on some of the missions, like ""My car won't start! Please fix!"" but the missions end up being a lot like one another, which for me is a drawback. There is not enough complexity to keep things running for too long.Now, the major and most disappointing thing: the 1/4 mile Add on. I was hoping to get some real nice parts, to be able to exchange pistons and crankshafts, play with gear rations and stuff, but it ended up as a simplistic ""this part gives 8% power"" and you just change it as it was done on the ""fix it"" part of the game. Ok, small ""click until right"" tunning session and finish.Like I said in the beggining, if you like mechanics and can buy it cheap, do it. It will entertain you for about 4hs.			"

												100% Recommended at the $7 sale price. $20 for the regular price and I still think it's worth it. I'm 61/75 on the normal orders and still have 20 left on the offroad add-on.Gameplay is smooth on ultra settings, except I have OA and DOF disabled because of my old GeForce 9600 GSO and running 1600x900 native resolution.Game still looks very good with those settings.The camera can be bothersome at times, but you can click on any part near the part you actually need to focus the camera quickly. The only downfall is the repetative gameplay itself but it's still engaging and pushes you on to complete the order, and the next, and the next.Personally I wish there was more depth, like being able to actually delve into the engine, or replace U-Joints and smaller stuff. But I understand this game is meant for everyone and people that don't know a lot about cars could get lost.I would just like to see difficulty settings. Normal and Hardcore where Hardcore is much more mechanically inclined.All in all, I recommend this title.			"

												So this game is sort of a neat premise with not enough effort put into its execution. It is, as many have already pointed out, somewhat limited in scope. You click to unscrew bolts, you inspect the condition of the parts, you order new ones from the computer and you replace the old ones. Done. Occasionally you test-drive the cars on this one small ugly test course. So far, the insides of most cars I have repaied looked the same! If you get to work on a muscle car then the setup does change, but basically the insides only differ per type of car and not per car. All the major parts of a car are there but don't expect to be replacing some small stressed screw somehwere or repairing a crack in the windshield. This game does not go that deep.But since I know almost nothing about cars, it did teach me a thing or two about them so mission accomplished I guess.I recommend it but only if it's on sale. 20 euros is a bit too steep. The only thing this game really has going for it is its uniqueness, which is a shame because I think an in-dept car mechanic simulator would be an interesting game.			"

												Great game, if you really like cars. You won't find much pleasure in driving the car, it's really a car mechanic simulator like the name states. The interface is very nice and simple, easy to learn quickly. Pros: -interface is nice and simple-gameplay smooth, no bugs really-puts you in the shoes of a mechanic.cons:-should have more ""buttons"", keys to do things (eg: press Q to view task, press TAB to switch between assemble and disassemble. I've done some coding and I don't think this is very complex to add, but would be nicer!-Test driving the cars is rather useless as it doesn't tell you much about what's wrong!-Of course, this is a new game, but it could have more cars, parts. More complexity would make the game even better, but I think and hope this comes with time.			"

I would also enjoy some more customization, such as upgrade parts for the vehicles rather than just OEM. Overall great game 7/10 really nice to play when I'm tired or to relax.			"

												I'm really enjoying this game for getting my head around the basics of how cars are put together. I'd really enjoy levels of detail that it just doesn't have yet and I hope future versions are able to continue getting even more realistic, actually tracking particular car models and better understanding of how the individual bits fit together, maybe even 'building' one from scratch.The driving simulation leaves a lot to be desired, but it is far from the key point of the game. Also the navigation within the garage could take advantage of better right-click functionality for camera manipulation. Other than that quite a solid offering and the content more than makes up for it.			"

It's even difficult to get out of the game.If you have a macbook pro don't waste your money. It's a real shame: such nice game hasn't been developped enough to work on Mac.... I have lost £5...			"

												I came to the game not looking for an exact mechanic representation, but rather a Guitar Hero level of abstraction that would let me get more familiar with car parts. I feel this game does a great job of that. There is no time limit to complete the repairs, so it ends up feeling more zen than game, which I like.I think there is room for iteration in adding more business and customer interaction elements, but for the sale price I got this for, I feel it was well worth the 10+ hours I have put into it before it started to get a little tedious.

												THE GOOD: Reasonably accurate car anatomy, varied missions, minor management (focus is on the car)THE BAD: If you don't know roughly where to look for some things, you may struggle.If you have a remote interest in cars, and want to learn a little more this game is great.  If you want to manage a business, this isn't quite it.  Most of it is pulling cars apart an reassembling while doing some minor money management.			"

												I love cars. I love the idea of working on cars.Cars and 'missions' become more complicated over time, and the garage becomes more elaborate.Unfortunately, this game locks up for me constantly - computer crashes and I am forced to reboot.Red Dot's support offers me nothing other than a brick wall.Despite really enjoying the game, I cannot recommend it as even Red Dot cannot provide support and although I can run Skyrim without issue, inexplicably this game seems to crash...often.If Red Dot can actually support those that buy their games, this review is subject to change.

												Well, how do I say it... I recommend it if you can get it really cheap, like I did.This game is considerably detailed and can give a hint on car mechanics, specially for those not really aware of it (which I doubt there will be many, since if you bought this or is thinking about buying it, you probably like car mechanics a lot). The major issue for me, is that most things are simplified and worst, all cars look the same ""under skin"". Yes, you have the 4x4 that adds some differences, but I don't think there are that many. There is a nice touch of discovery on some of the missions, like ""My car won't start! Please fix!"" but the missions end up being a lot like one another, which for me is a drawback. There is not enough complexity to keep things running for too long.Now, the major and most disappointing thing: the 1/4 mile Add on. I was hoping to get some real nice parts, to be able to exchange pistons and crankshafts, play with gear rations and stuff, but it ended up as a simplistic ""this part gives 8% power"" and you just change it as it was done on the ""fix it"" part of the game. Ok, small ""click until right"" tunning session and finish.Like I said in the beggining, if you like mechanics and can buy it cheap, do it. It will entertain you for about 4hs.			"

It isn't that hard to get used to this game so I recommend you go out and buy this one. I would rate this game a 8.5/10			"

												I played a version of this game many many many  years (over a decade ) ago. It's pretty much the same except now there are work orders,a test drive section, a parts ordering mechanism,and a radio. Overall it's the same game. (but it was on sale for less than 3 bucks so what the hell I picked it up).Let me say this, as a simulator this game falls wayyyy short, I've never done a brake job that didn;t have caliper bracket bolts or a bracket for that matter so yeah not too realilistic there. The prices are very odd, there's no pressing out bearings (so far anyway) and one of the first 5 jobs i was supposed to test an alternator...well when I removed the thing it said 6% cheapest option was replacement, ordered part put it on, got the belt on, took the battery out (1%) cheapest option was repair (90 some dollars....what shop doesn't have a charger to  ""repair"" a battery for free?) put it all together went to close out the repair and low and behold it said to test alternator...what the ♥♥♥♥ does it matter now that i replaced it? and it wouldn't let me just check the condition of the old alternator... so ♥♥♥♥ that.Other things to note; the mouse is laggy in game, it has different speeds in different parts of the game i.e the menu, the game, the computer ordering , all different speeds incredibly frustrating. The test drive section is pretty pointless, I don't think I know of a single person who would want me to put their car through such strain after fixing it and it's clunky.In summary if you have an interest in working on cars but no knowledge this game is actually a decent tool to familiarize yourself with the components of the average automobile, the version I played so long ago went a long way in helping me memorize the main engine components of the average v8 of the era and this game is more advaned. But you're better off just working on cars to learn how. so yeah don't buy this unless it's super cheap and you have next to 0 car knowledge.			"

												It's a very nice idea and mostly well made.But a few horrible things make the game unplayable for me. Graphics and sound are good enough, but the interface is very lacking.Main problem: the way way camera/mouse behaves. It's hard to describe, but you have to move the mouse VERY carefully or you end up swaggering - every time you move the mouse, the camera moves too.Another problem is the game doesn't really help you - I'm no mechanic. I have no idea where the fuel filter might be (somewhere near the gas tank, I'd assume?).Unfortunately, the game doesn't even indicate where the item in question might be, unless you're already very close. (Case in point, until you think of lifting the car, you don't even know there's another place to tinker UNDER the car. All other options are constantly shown (hood, wheels, side door), but not the one below the car, even if it's directly part of your current job?A minor nuisance: to change game settings you have to leave the current game mode and get to the main screen again.

												Pretty sure this was a glitch on Valve's end, but I got this game in the PlayWay's Sim Bundle for $0.99. This was while the game was still on sale for $5.49 0.o. 6 hours later, (no sales rotations have occured, mind you), and that bundle price has risen to $16, with CMS2014 still being $5.49. Now then...Having got the game for $1, it's really great. I'm learning basic car parts really rapidly, and still having ""fun"" at the same time. However, the game's not perfect. The starting menu is all flashy and fancy, then you get in-game and everything looks rather bland. The way your character moves around is a little clunky, and the first few hours are spent trying to figure out everything with NO TUTORIAL beyond showing you how to change the radio station, raise the vehicle platform, and order parts online. No interactio with the vehicle is taught; you must figure it all out on your own.Overall, for $1, or even $5.49, it's a pretty nice deal if you're wanting to learn car parts, and what a mechanic job might be like. Entertainment-wise, however, your time would be better spent in Euro Truck Sim 2, Skyrim, or Cities Skylines :)			"

												This game caught my eye from the moment I saw it, as vehicles have always intrested me. Now, I have only have the motor knowledge of a common man, like changing oil, changing air filter, replacing fuel filter, ect. and I found this game intresting to learn about vehicle upkeep and repair, and found out alot about the anatomy of an automobile from playing this. I won't lie, this game is challenging as it doesn't really give you a tutorial on how to do everything that is asked, so I mostly learned from completely disassembling the vehicle at times. Overall, this game is really good. The graphics are pretty good and the game play is defintely intertaining, especially to those with an intrest in vehicles, and you can't beat the price of 99 cent with four other games!Overall rating: 8/10			"

												I wanted to like this game, being a fan of simluators in general.  And having worked on more than my share of cars in my day.  But it just falls short.  The tutorial is woefully inadequate, especially if the player has no prior knowledge of car anatomy so to speak.  Silly things too, like who changes a starter from the engine compartment?  Or since when is an oil filter on top of the engine block?  But I could forgive those things, if there was some challenge to the game, besides playing hide and seek with the parts, but diagnosing problems is limited to examining items, the test drives offer no actual benefit, yes, I wanted common mechanical issue sounds, thunking of a bad shock over bumps, clicking of a bad CV during turns etc.  Overall I'm giving this game a 3/10.

My biggest nonrealstic beef is that when you replace the oil filter you don't need to also change the oil...If there was a game like this, that was more realistic and featured actual car models, that could be rather fun. Start off with 5 car manuals for a few common cars, occasionally getting a model your knowledge doesn't cover and either fixing it or buying the appropriate manual, and upgrading as you go along.

												The game feels very ""rough"" as it's not a true simualtor. It's very basic mechanics. In real life you don't need to remove the entire exhaust system just to remove the headers. You don't need to remove the entire intake system just to remove the air filter. As a real-life mechanic, the part removal process is just unbearable in this game. I shouldn't have to keep the car on the ground to remove the tire and work on the upper suspension and then raise the vehicle to work on the lower suspension. Much of the processes are just painful to do. It's still fun.If you don't understand mechanics then get out a notepad. Otherwise just blow through the game.			"

I find it relaxing and more of a puzzle game than anything.  They're on the right track, reminds me of Farming Simulator.  I look foward to more development with future titles if they are able to make them.  At the moment I recommend buying the game if you can get it on sale. It is not worth spending over $10 bucks on it. But will fill your time nicely if you are looking for a change in your normal genre.			"

												I liked this game, it is a very good time consuming puzzle game. I also like this game due to the fact that it educates you very well on how a car functions. Honestly I had no idea how cars explicitly worked before this, but now i know things like, if your engine isnt perfoming right it could be numerous issues like, starter is bad, spark plugs are shot, bad chips, filter could be bad, or even the belts.

												With a passion for all things mechanical; I find myself enjoying this kind of simulator. This simulator offers BASIC information of replacing no longer functioning automotive parts such as: Spark plugs, oil filters, alternators, brake pads, brake calipers, etc. This simulator is a fun little passtime, and it might teach you a little bit of auto repair, however, it obviously won't teach you anything about how gas combustion engines actually function. Anyways, if you find automobile maintenance interesting like I do, you might want to look more into this simulator.			"

												Mechanic Simulator is about as close to simulating a mechanic as Goat Simulator is at making you a goat.  You're forced to use WASD and mouse look instead of right-click and drag to move your view.  It's archaic and cumberome to use.  There are some very big issues with the interface and movement of this game let alone the gameplay.  One of the first jobs includes a fuel filter replacement but there's no indication where it is because there are no fuel lines or evap lines leading you to it.  You're left searching with a horrible 3D view panel for a little box where no fuel goes.  This game is nothing like working on a real car.  If you've ever worked on a car and know what you are doing then this game is definitely not for you.  It has great potential to be a mechanic simulator but it needs a ton more work especially on the way you look around and select things.  Is it worth $5?  Barely.  I'd think $3 would be a fair price for a game that feels like it should still be in alpha development.			"

												I wanted to like this game, being a fan of simluators in general.  And having worked on more than my share of cars in my day.  But it just falls short.  The tutorial is woefully inadequate, especially if the player has no prior knowledge of car anatomy so to speak.  Silly things too, like who changes a starter from the engine compartment?  Or since when is an oil filter on top of the engine block?  But I could forgive those things, if there was some challenge to the game, besides playing hide and seek with the parts, but diagnosing problems is limited to examining items, the test drives offer no actual benefit, yes, I wanted common mechanical issue sounds, thunking of a bad shock over bumps, clicking of a bad CV during turns etc.  Overall I'm giving this game a 3/10.

SHORT VERSION:If nothing else this game serves well as a casual time-killer. It doesn't offer very much in the way of a compelling narrative, nor any real progression, but the basic game mechanics are sound if a little repetitive. A basic working knowledge of cars is helpful, but in no way neccessary as the vehicle components are condensed and simplified.Overall I wouldn't reccomend this game, unless it is on sale. I don't think it's overy poor but I don't rate it as a game you should rush out and buy for being triple-A quality - in terms of gameplay OR graphics.EXPECT:Generic unlicenced vehicles, repetition, simple interface, solid graphics, lots of unbolting.DO NOT EXPECT:To feel blown away, variation, memorable moments, longevity, replay value, quality DLC, overly helpful job descriptions, absolute realism.LONG VERSION:For the first time since I started writing Steam reviews for games I find myself genuinely at a loss. The games I reviewed up to this point invoked something - whether it be emotion, nostalgia or a general sense of achievement. It's hard to convey feeling in analysing a simulator - by their very nature simulators are as far detached from human emotion as possible. They are clinical in their execution, even if they are not an entirely representative experience of their subject matter.This is the problem that I found with Car Mechanic Simulator 2014. While it is different (in the sense that most simulators deal with the operation of vehicles, with maintainence being a one-click afterthought) this game suffers from intense repetition which far outweighs the initial novelty value. Throughout the 'career mode' you are presented with vehicles in varying levels of disrepair. You are given some hints as to the problem (this is where a good working knowledge of what components do what in a car comes in useful), but in the end you have the tools to examine a car top to bottom and it all boils down to 'replace everything that's red'. There are diagnostic tracks and an on-board diagnostics tool, which are useful in quickly assessing the car's health or finding what you've missed. You can also test drive the car, though the car physics are pretty dull and listless, and a vehicle with inferior components seems to handle the same as one that has brand new parts rendering the whole process entirely useless.In terms of progression, you start in a tiny dingy garage with limited facilities before you automatically get upgraded until you have a full-size facility with the opportunity to perform brake/suspension tests and ECU tuning. You have no say in how and when you upgrade, it just seems to happen. There is also a series of 'skill upgrades' which makes parts cheaper, gives your more money per job, get automatic analysis on random parts or unbolt faster. All in all, the game's progression does not stand up to most others in the genre and seems quite limited - you can't buy other garages, hire other mechanics or do any sort of empire-building which would enhance the experience or, in the very least, give it some lasting appeal.It seems unfortunate that the gameplay can be condensed into two paragraphs, but honestly there is nothing else there. There are DLCs, which are thankfully free, which give a small extension to the experience. The 4x4 DLC will add the Bolthorn Wanderer (what appears to be an unlicenced Jeep) with some associated themed repairs (i.e. customers who've been off-roading and royally messed up the suspension) and the 1/4-Mile Drag DLC which adds jobs to make cars achieve a certain time over, you guessed it, a quarter-mile drag. That's it. The same dull physics plague the 1/4-mile test drives making the whole DLC uninspired (I got bored after 3 jobs).Lastly I will touch on the graphics, which are fairly decent and do the job without any serious excitment. The interface is simple if a little clunky. The camera is nausea-inducing at times, moving around as you select and remove/replace parts making keeping it focussed on bolting/unbolting somewhat infuriating. That's it. Nothing else to report.FINAL WORDThis was tough to write. There is so little content spread over a long game span with a lot of repetition. It is very easy to fall into the trap of the 'just one more job.. just one more job' mentality, but you won't feel any more accomplished than when you started.This is very much a borderline game - I really wish there was something between Reccomend and Not Reccomend because this game embodies that grey area. It isn't offensively bad to play but I wouldn't urge you to go out and buy it either. Just wait until it's heavily discounted - your wallet WILL NOT forgive you. In that sense I will NOT reccomend this, if only to stress the importance of patience.			"

												Let me preface this by saying that I love this game; I wouldn't have played it for this many hours if I didn't. I should also mention that I used to work as an apprentice mechanic. I tried my best not to nit-pick every minutia of the game, but it will probably seem otherwise to people with no automotive knowledge. Trust me; even if some of the details I mention seem small, they are still significant. This review is intended both as constructive criticism for the developers and as a cautionary tale to any would-be purchaser.This is a great little puzzle(?)/simulation game and in my eyes, it's worth every cent of what I paid for it. That being said, there are a whole host of kinks that need to be ironed out of the ""clunky"" and sometimes-infuriating gameplay:- My inventory filled up with crap really fast, since I didn't get around to selling all the junk parts until I had the next car apart and new ""green"", ""yellow"" and ""orange"" parts mixed into the inventory as well. It would have been really nice to have a ""sell all junk parts"" button.- Sometimes it's ""fiddly"" to get to small things like spark plugs (the issue was compounded by the fact that I don't have a top-shelf gaming PC, so the game always lagged a bit.)- Sometimes I couldn't stamp the car as ""repaired"", even though there wasn't a single red part on it. I soon figured out that I had to put the EXACT PARTS IN THE EXACT PLACES they started in. It was really annoying and I had to start several levels over because of this. I can appreciate that without this, the used parts system cannot work. However, if brake pads and bushings were sold in ""sets"" like in real life and brake calipers were separated by right/front, left/front, etc, the issue would be entirely eliminated with the used parts system intact.- I have to unbolt the entire exhaust system, starting at the muffler, just to get to the manifold. WHAT THE HELL? The exhaust pieces should be ""independently"" and not ""sequentially"" removable...- The cursor does not centre after moving to a menu (it stays centred when moving around, but jumps to a corner when you enter a menu or work on the car... This gets reeeeeeally annoying after a while.)- Transmission extraction from the top of the car, seriously??? I have never, ever, ever, EVER seen that done (unless the engine is coming out with the transmission, which is not possible in this game.) This detail is especially annoying on rear- or all-wheel drive cars. You have to take three extra unnecessary steps, walking over to the lift button, lowering the car, walking back to the hood before finally taking the transmission out, rather than simply taking the transmission and starter out from the bottom of the car, like any normal person.- Switching between ""assemble"" and ""disassemble"" is another great time-waster. I'd have loved to just have them merged together, with an outline of the part to be assembled appearing in the place of the part that was removed. Heck, it would also be nice not to have to move the camera around while you're working on the car (sometimes the camera spazzes out so badly with its zooming-in-and-out business that the bolt you want to loosen flies clear off-screen and you have to move the camera around some more...) A complete view of all the parts, à la ""Street Rod"", would have been a lot easier.If you're willing to look past all of this minor to moderate awfulness, however; by all means, buy this game right now. You will spend many joyous hours planning, diagnosing, analysing and just plain screwing around.			"

												6/10I got the game after they freshly released it and always waited for their little DLCs they've released but the game has some serious issues that are annoying but not a real death sentence.Positive things:- The job variety is alright. In the story mode you dont have to do the same thing twice in a row, you get to see different approaches.- The graphics are ""alright"" for a studio like this.- Many parts to disassemble. Just had the fun on a mission to take a whole car apart and get it back together.- Tuning possible but very limited.- Car class variety from vans over sedans to sports cars.- Chance to order used parts and brush them up to save money.Negative aspects:- The tuning itself is set as a minigame that makes absolutely no sense. I am not a car mechanic, dont intent to become one but I cant imagine that you sit infront of a screen and move a damn flipchart of an EEPROM around until the percentage matches.- Very poor physics in the test drive. Every customer nearly needs the test drive to be sure that the car is working but like the game is made it just does not represent anything, the car feels like a fish in a god damn tank.- The DLCs dont really brought that much of content to be satisfied. - Credit is a one time thing in the whole game, seriously?- Double Monitor use always throws you out of the game when your mouse leaves the game, never have that happen in other games.- No customer wants to keep their car parts, makes the form and the difficult of the game pretty low.- The race track is just a horror with the physics as well.Potential that could have been used in my eyes but well...I still enjoyed it, nothing outstanding, can pay that low price for it.

The tutorial is woefully inadequate, especially if the player has no prior knowledge of car anatomy so to speak.  Silly things too, like who changes a starter from the engine compartment?  Or since when is an oil filter on top of the engine block?  But I could forgive those things, if there was some challenge to the game, besides playing hide and seek with the parts, but diagnosing problems is limited to examining items, the test drives offer no actual benefit, yes, I wanted common mechanical issue sounds, thunking of a bad shock over bumps, clicking of a bad CV during turns etc.  Overall I'm giving this game a 3/10.

												its alright for a few hours. Starts to get a bit tedious after a while and the unskippable, pointless, time-consuming tasks get annoying. You might learn some basics about car mechanics if you didnt know anything before hand.The 1/4mile add-on is a bit more involved, but re-trying the drag race involves going back to the garage, then going back out to the track. why??I'm sure the later editions of this game improve some aspects of it, so go for them.

												The game is nice. (If you are not a mechanic by profession)But in order to truly simulate being a mechanic includes jammed, rusty bolts, time waiting for THAT one itty bitty part that isn't in stock and (is being shipped across the globe and you've to wait). Also getting an entirely wrong part is occassionalAlso the customers in IRL tend to be really, REALLY vague about what is wrong with the car""It just sputters/jerks when shifting/makes a funny noise/stops"" or rant that their uncle's wife's godsons half-brother's car had the same problem fixed with WD-40 and a hammer instead of a $500 new part. Also the pricing is sometimes a bit weird. a OBD check is about 40 bucks average in my hometown.I still like the game, it reminds me how i thought car fixing was easy when i was a kid.

But it is hard to find the problems when you have no clue what to look for.Overall it was an okay experience, and now I know what those scamming garagists do to my car when I bring em in. "

												So I thought it would be boring simulator, which has terrible graphics, terrible mechanics and is optimized patheticly. But it suprised me.So the graphics are looking pretty good. Attention to details are impressive. Even things on shelfs are high quality, high textured and not low poly as other simulator do. Car models looks like cars from real world, you can guess which car is which. Sometimes when you get mustang or other luxury or sports car, it can make you go around car and look at details.Game controls and mechanics have been done very good, and it doesn't get in the way. Game is very enjoyable because of that.But it would be more awesome if this game had more car models, more car parts and more locations, but I think game creators tried to experiement if this game will work or not, so the second game (car mechanic simulator 2015) has more things going on.Also, I didn't knew where most of the car parts are, how they called and what damage they cause, so it was fun for me, but it may not be as fun if you know everything about cars.

												I got this game at a 90% discount during a sale.All biases aside. It is fun, and as you progress you do get more out of it, but as you begin in the career mode, it starts off smoothly and easy but then the second part comes in and it feels tedious. Albeit. I had high expectations that were soon overruled.The game does state that you are starting from the bottom to the top and I completely ignored that once I bought the game. But like any game, when you give it the time or enough love you wil most definately be able to enjoy it in the long run. But here are MY cons. In all honesty, it does not fall in a modern first person enviroment where you'd believe you'd have complete freedom - such as the ability to pick up stuff with hands and inspect them that way or even be able to punch tangible objects and blast them across the room. Music is good. But filled with so much electro dance music (I enjoyed the ones which were chill), and some rock (which I enjoyed). For me, I want driving music like 80s influenced or originated songs.I'm just disappointed that they don't have a crouching feature, let alone the player model having hands in a first person enviroment. I just want to grab and throw stuff around. I'd still recommend this game, for it is the complete edition of the title - so you still get a lot out of it, but I still feel it has so much more potential. And unlike its successors, it does not feel at all like a simulator that demands more (money) from you, so that's good.Note again. I got this during a sale - and if you do see this on sale, try it out but don't let your expectations drive you. Its not in its entirety close to replayable fun.			"
