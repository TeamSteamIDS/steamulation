												I wrote a very critical, barely positive review for EAW six weeks ago, when I had only about 32 hours played on version 1.0.  In that review, I complained about the game's counterintuitive attack/defense outcomes, inscrutable casualty calculations, supply system flaws and ahistorical patterns.In the meantime, I have played through the game twice and racked up over 200 hours played.  Additionally, patch 1.1 was released during this time.  In the light of these new developments, I am happy to adjust my review from ""barely positive"" to ""strongly recommended.""Patch 1.1 made great improvements to the game's overall playability.  Almost as soon as I downloaded the patch, I noticed that combat outcomes seemed much more in line with historical realities.  Entrenched infantry with artillery support inflicts extremely heavy losses on the enemy, while suffering comparatively little if well prepared.  This rewards good deployment and unit organization/choices (ie, GHQ creation, associated corps, combined arms + recon per stack, etc).  As a digital commander who ""attacks with a view to defend and defends with a view to counterattack,"" this warmed my heart.  Supply issues are also much improved this time around.  In my first review, I bemoaned the AI's ability to penetrate deep into the interior, get cut off and suffer no ill consequences for its overextension.  Now, the realistic supply system allows me to cut off enemy armies and starve them out.  Supply is a crucial part of the game, and it cuts both ways.  On the one hand, it allows you to cut off enemy armies.  On the other, it limits your own offensive gambits, since armies more than a hex or two away from a large city or depot quickly run out of supply and must cease offensive operations.  I find this forces you to really think about when and how you will launch offensives, giving as much thought to purely tactical considerations as logistical ones.  It takes time and study to learn the supply system in EAW, but I found it absolutely rewarding.  Supply  realities make it as possible to win victories simply by manuever and good positioning as it is by brute force.I found the abstracted diplomacy, decision-making and research system to be easy-to-grasp and fascinating.  I won some very interesting diplomatic victories in my second playthrough.  For instance, as the Central Powers, I kept the USA far from supporting the Entente, lured Bulgaria and Romania to my side, and even got Holland and Mexico to join the struggle against the vile French.  As someone who loves history and pondering ""what-if"" scenarios, these results really made me smile.EAW does a great job rewarding innovative gameplay.  There are so many ways to win, either by outright military aggression or slow-play attrition.  The National Morale system is a simple and effective way to mirror a Nation's slow disaffection (or enthrallment) with total war, and monitoring it during the game is both fascinating and rewarding.  It makes you realize that often in modern war, the object is not to seize capitals or destroy armies in set-piece battles, but simply to convince your opponent to give up.Leadership is one of my favorite things about EAW.  Every general has unique strategic, offensive and defensive capabilites.  Some commanders are better attackers than defenders.  Some are better army group leaders than field commanders.  A well-led stack makes the difference between victory and defeat.  And for those who are somewhat familiar with the scintillating historical personalities at play in WW1, shuffling around your favorite generals--and watching them win in battle--is oddly inspiring and emotional.Yes, EAW takes time to learn and to play.  But if you are really interested in this historical era, it stimulates like no other game I've played.  You will find yourself watering at the mouth to plan your next moves, and you won't mind the 4-5 minute turn times as your brain processes all the fascinating things that are happening (or might happen) on the map once the CPU finishes its move.Needless to say, the game offers immense replay value, too.  You can play as a different alliance, or you can choose from a host of alternative initital warplans.  With each game lasting up to 100 hours, what you have is a game that will keep you entertained (and educated!) for a very long time.My only remaining complaints are minor: Sometimes the game crashes on complex turns; and the Serbian army is a real pain in the neck, next to impossible to fully kill.  Also, I would love it if the game had an original, epic soundtrack, and some more WW1-specific battle sounds.I am happy that my opinion changed on this game, and I encourage serious-minded strategy lovers to give this game a whirl.  It is worth your while.Final score: 90/100.PS: Devs, would you mind buffing General von Falkenhayn a little??  He's acknowledged by many historians as being one of the world's first ""modern generals,"" equally at home on the defensive and the offensive.  Yet in the game his numbers are pretty weak!  Let's show him some love!			"

												To End All Wars is the digital equivalent of a board war game. You are taking sides on the Great War, the global conflict between vainglorious European nations that happened some 100 years ago. There are three alliances initially: the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary), the West Entente (France and possibly Great Britain), and the East Entente (Russia and Serbia). I said ""possibly"" for GBR, because how quickly the United Kingdom can join the Entente may depend on the war plans each and every nation will choose, in case you as a player want to investigate an alternate reality war plan. There are 4 for each side, including the historical ones if you simply want to reenact WWI as the masterminds of the era envisioned it.The players are in command of their alliance and try to win the Great War the best way they can, using warfare and diplomatic pressure. Aspects such as important historical decisions, R&D, and the armaments war effort are also abstracted. It's up to the player to decide which units (from simple independent brigades up to the General HQ) to engage and when. Logistics, weather, and terrain are parameters that are taken into consideration by the engine. Each turn is two weeks. Being a turn-based game is a virtue, not a vice. It will allow the player to think considerably about the pieces to move and how to achieve his/her overall strategy. Naval and air warfare are also abstracted. Certain important battles led by brilliant Generals will also give the option to select a tactical plan that can change the battle result even when the odds are saying the opposite.The game is portraying mainly the Great War in Europe, but most colonies and satellite nations that were involved are also there. The engine is smart enough to considerate the historical tactical division between trench war in the West and relatively mobile war in the East. It's up to the involved protagonists to use decisions and diplomacy to influence (historically or not) different nations in their alliance. For example: what would have happened if Italy entered on the side of the Central Powers? What would have happened if USA was convinced to stay out of the war? It's up to the player to investigate these aspects...Last, some notes about multiplayer. As with all AGEOD games (that I strongly recommend you investigate), there is a very interesting multiplayer option. Playing such a game with human players is the outmost challenge! Albeit I bet the AI will give you a hard time in single-player, the cunning and genuinely unexpected moves of a human player will surprise you every turn.This is arguably the best title of a WWI strategy game currently available. Once you master its details, it will keep you entertained for many many hours. Hit the AGEOD forums for more specific advices or to read some interesting after-action reports.			"

												To be completely honest, I've only recently been introduced to the likes of titles by AGEod, the developer and publisher of To End All Wars. Having been eager to play their other title, the ambitious looking Civil War II, I decided to hold off on purchasing that one because I discovered that To End All Wars was to be released soon, which seemed like a title that was a little bit more up my alley. As a history fanatic and appreciator of the massive scale and scope that the real WWI exhibited, To End All Wars seemed like a title that appeared to reflect that to some degree. Boy, is that a complete understatement!While other WWI titles on Steam such as Making History: The Great War have done a rather credible in delivering an overall WWI experience, To End All Wars chronicles the more minute, although vastly important, details surrounding the conflict itself. From arranging the chain of command of units, production and supply chains, alliances, and the historicity surrounding actual hisotrical leaders, the game envelopes you into a world in which every decision has to be carefully calculated and where slight errors in preparation for a battle are equally, if not greater, than the actual battle itself. I've spent more time in this game just preparing for a battle than ACTUAL battling, and this is certainly not a negative aspect but rather a highly postive one in my opinion!The slow pacing of the game is where I find true enjoyment, in which I actively have to plan and strategize my moves in the most careful of ways. For this reason alone, To End All Wars may not be a game for everyone, especially those gamers who like quick paced gameplay and actually controlling their their armies in the battles they participate in. To End All Wars is more of a stat-driven game, where you are looking at the numbers surrounding your involvement in the war conflict and calculating how to utilize them in the most efficient matter possible. This might seem boring to some, but it is actually more accurately reflecting upon the realism of what actual war is like, where statistics and win probabilities are the main driving force behind any warring conflict. Because of this reliance on stats and probabilites, the game does take quite some time in between turns, often times taking minutes for the AI to calculate their next move. While this is perhaps the most noticeable downside to the game, considering the massive amount of information that the game has to forage through given each turn, it's somewhat understandable. While I'm certainly not being apologetic (I myself would like to see a decrease in time in taking turns), I am simply being pragmatic when it comes to how much information the game showcases!This adherence towards realism is where To End All Wars brilliantly shines, and where I wholeheartedly recommend it to any gamer wanting a true, authentic look into WWI. It is simply incredible in what AGEod was able to do here, bringing about a game that has certainly moved to the top of my list of WWI titles that do the conflict justice. Those gamers wanting to actually participate in real-time battles need not apply, but for those wanting to focus on the internalities of how WWI was more accurately fought and playing campaigns that will last you months, then  To End All Wars is the game for you.

												This is a superb military strategy game.  It might look expensive and clunky, and you might hear some complaints about turn times,  but if you're interested in a deep, thoughtful game which reasonably accurately mimics the Great War and has a great deal of replayability, this is the best I've come across.Unlike other titles I'm familiar with (e.g. Commander: The Great War, Making History: The Great War), this one captures a lot of the feel of WW1, in the sense that battles become increasingly horrific in terms of casualities, you will find yourself scrabbling for every tiny advantage, and, the longer the war goes on, the more worn out your faction becomes.  That's not so say it's all trench warfare, indeed, it can be quite open depending on how the war plays out, but you cannot play this like just another war game.The game takes account of different troop types, reinforcement, attrition, terrain, weather, commanders, blockades, diplomacy, logistics and chemical weapons.  You are able to reel and recover from gigantic losses if you're smart, but may see your offensives broken up by the harsh reality of industrialised warfare.  The manual is not well written, and the game can be opaque, but the forums have a lot of helpful tips, and just playing the game to learn it is part of the fun.  This game is rich, and it *will* take you hours to get to grips with it, but it is complex in a way unlike other wargames I have played, and, as a WW1 nut, relatively faithful to the period while still allowing for alternative histories.Highlights- cutting Gen. Rennenkampf off in the Prussian woods- spending 2 years chasing Serbian guerrillas around the Balkan mountains and blowing up their depots- starting the 3rd Boer War- invading Belgium before Germany does- having the US army deliver a railway gun to a port with no railway access, so it can't be moved- attempting (and failing, three times) the Gallipoli landings- sending the British Egyptian Army across the desert and forgetting that they need water, food and ammunition- sending Zepplins to bomb London- not attacking Verdun- GAS GAS GAS!Buy this if you want the next step up from Paradox titles, and are interested in historically detailed games.

												AGEod is a great strategy engine and WWI is a forgotten war in videogames. So this is a very good combination. Honestly, it's not easy and not easy to learn. We need much time to understand the mechanism - even if you play with American Civil War for ages - and we need time to set everysmall details in the turns. But it worth the time. Oh, and this is an another 'one more turn' wargame.			"

												Fantastically detailed, complex and dare I say, realistic, Wargame, if you, like me, are into this sort of thing :) Only problem is that version 1.0 does not have any ""single theater"" game mode (they are fortunately on their way), let´s say: just the western front or just the eastern front etc. The jump between the tiny Battle of Tannenberg (the only ""battle"" scenario as of yet) and the huge grand campaign is way too long... There is very little room for learning how to manage a single front, and you are expected to take control of the entire war, like... right away? x) Otherwise it does look great so far, with it´s detailed decision, research and battle systems and calculations etc. Great sequel to ""Civil War 2"", a game that managed to make the most over-analyzed war in history interesting as hell, but still, good to be back on European soil (or should I say mud?), fighting as/with or against Fredrick the Great´s ancestors x)			"

												This is truly an outstanding simulation.  The scope is wide as all Powers are represented in the conflict.  The map is large, captures the ""feel"" of the terrain and is visually pleasing.  However the real masterpiece is the game engine.  It is the same as CWII and comes with the same high level of support.  The power users ""know their business"" and share tips/knowledge liberally on the forums.   This reminds me of the great board games from the 70s and 80s - something I have not often seen.  And like those board games, EAW is complex and not a game that can be played in a couple of hours.  It takes commitment and patience, however rewards the user with both great simulation and historical education.  For those of us who have dealt with complex ""to hit"" and ""penetration"" tables in the past, the learning curve in EAW is not all that steep.  The engine does the work.			"

												To End All Wars is a new grand strategy game released by Ageod. The game allows the player to take the full command of the Central Powers ( Germany and Austria-Hungary ), the Western Entente ( France, the United Kingdom and Belgium ) or the Eastern Entente ( Russia, Serbia and Montenegro ) during the Great War ( which we talking a lot recently since it happened a century ago ). One you've picked your side, you are in charge of the supreme command of your alliance in terms of military, politics and research. At the start of a game ( depending on the game mod you play ) you have to decide a long term plan for the war. It can be realistic (.e,g.  Schlieffen plan for Germany or Plan XVII for France ) or not. Then it's up to you to find the strategy to take down your enemy. When you play To End All Wars, you could perfectly imagine yourself playing a board game. The map and graphism are actually close to what you would have playing on a table. Talking about the map, some will like it but others not. It's not as nice as the lattest Paradox Interactive map but EAW's managed to display a clean map of Europe and the Middle-East, very detailed. The rest of world, with the colonies or other nations, is represented by boxes on the sides of the map. The game has a huge pool of units, for each nations ( Cossacks, Foreign Legion, Scottish Highlanders, Cameroon colonial troops,...etc ) with each their abilities, strong and weak points. Naval and aerial battles are also present, allowing the player an insane amount of possibilites. To End All Wars is a turn based game with each turn simulating 15 days. The player must prepare all his moves and the enemy will confront it and make his moves during the switch of turn. It works very wellthat way. Speaking of turn, the "" end-turn time "" can be a bit long. I understand the AI ( which is quite good ) has a lot to do during its own time but maybe some update could try to reduce this time.The music is also a strong point in the game. Real military music from various origins are present in the game, for amateurs, it's a huge plus in the ambiance. Strong points of the game :The difficulty !The AI !The music !The insane amount of various details !The detailed map !The "" board game "" ambiance!The tutorials !Weak or weaker points of the game :The end turn time !Too much time between the musics ( actually, there is an option to determine the delay betwenn songs, thanks to Eawamp for telling me this )Too confusing for new players, the possibility to control one nation and not its entire alliance could help this (playing only France for example and not the UK and Belgium with it )!Some parts of the interface could be better and less confusing. In general, I highly recommand this game !			"

												I bought the game a week ago and I've gotten into it quite well. I had no previous experience about AGEoD engine. Lemme tell you my honest opinion about the game - no pun included.I love the concept and look of the game. I like how clean it is with it's main pressure on actual war and doing this all-aspects-in-mind made mechanics. A war strategy game with clear pressure on war and strategy, so simple and effective. However there are some clear mistakes made with this game and it isn't actually the game itself but the way they give it out to the player.First of all, tutorial isn't the best. While it tells every basics about the game, I find it extremely hard to follow. The instructions to do things didn't always help out and wasted some tens of seconds looking for the right button (the interface ain't the best either). The text box sometimes bugged and the text went out of the box and mixed up with the map behind, giving hard time to read the text.The tutorial didn't include things about researching either, though the timeline of the situation in the tutorial explains that. Still, it's negative thing.Another major negative side of the game is the manual. I tell you - been playing rpg-book games like Stormwind and tabletop games like Warhammers and Blood Bowl I have seen some tough rulebooks to learn and these guys go far beyond. It is bad! It includes all the info there but it's clustered under too many different paragraphs and sections! The order they present their things isn't the best either and to be honest, those two who wrote it didn't have the best written-english.The gameplay is enjoyable right after you get used to the interface and I find AI quite good for a beginner. It isn't a fool and can certainly surprise you. I haven't tested out the multiplayer yet, but Im sure it's really good. Only odd thing being that it works through email or another file sharing method. It's really different to compared to other strategy games in the market. Maybe it's due the fact they wanted to give players time to think their moves well. I find it positive and negative feature - go figure out yourself how you feel.Cut in short - game in itself is nice and I believe I find myself around it for some hours. But the game suffers from bad manual and mediocre tutorial, giving players a challenge to learn in the first place. Forums seem a bit dead too. So why negative review? It isn't worth it's price 36,99€. I bought it with -10% discount and still find that quite tough price to pay for this.If you are ready to use time to learn the game before even playing a minute and don't mind the multiplayer as it is - you can enjoy this game.

												Now they release a 20 € scenario-package for a game that still doesn't care for an accurate manual. AGEOD doesn't care for new customers being unfamiliar with their franchise. Ripping off another 20 bucks for a game which apart from looking nice, leaves the new player completely in the dark, is a matter of bad taste-This game looks awesome and lures you into buying it. But it's mechanics, the GUI and mainly the documentation are nothing but annyoing.Their forum ist full with threads adressing issues which solely came up due to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ manual and vaguely explained features.EDIT:A note to the meanwhile ""mostly positive"" reviews:As soon as AGEOD realized all the negative response and the ""mixed"" reviews, they alerted their long time fan base which of course has only good to comment on this game. You can find the request of the AGEOD Lead Developer here: http://www.ageod-forum.com/showthread.php?39015-These-missing-12-UPDATE-missing-4-now-!Since in their view their engine is so divine, all the negative reviews must be ""biased"", is that simple? So they appealed for the fanboys to even convert their non-steam installations to steam-keys, to tell you (the unbiased reader) that this game is so wonderful. If you read the positive reviews carefully, you may notice there are many long term AGEOD fans among them.Nothing against fans. But the voice of customers who are completely new to this franchise, is obviously nothing AGEOD wants to count on. Which I can understand because of this glutinous game.So think twice if you buy this, if you want to trust shady practices like this.			"

ENG: Nothing unusual, another masterpiece from AGEod! :)  First, you will be scared away by the game interface, then the overload of the game screen, but after a couple of hours you will realize that this is a great wargame with a very decent simulation of military operations during the Great War.  AGE engine well managed Civil Wars of Rome, gave a wonderful atmosphere of the Civil War in the United States and is now offering to try the First World War. Unlike other series of AGEod wargames, this one is really hard. We're offered to lead three great factions - Entente in the west, Entente in the East and the Central Powers. Managing so many units is not an easy task, but very interesting and challenging (for example: playing as Western Entente, from the start of the game you manage France, Great Britain and Belgium, for a person unfamiliar with wargames in general, and in particular with AGEod - it's hard to master in few minutes). Music, style of the game interface, wonderful drawn map and authentic portraits of the leaders provides unique experience of the atmosphere of early 20th century. Military operations on land and at sea are equal, which is very pleasing - blockade, naval raids, bombing the coast from the sea and the waves of infantry, endless machine gun rounds, cavalry raids and volleys of thousands of guns on the ground. Presence of little things such small things as the Communication Corps, field hospitals, Engineering Corps, balloons and etc. together very strongly enriched gameplay.  AGEod engine perfectly combines mobile war in the east and trench warfare in the west.By the way, colonial warfare wasn't ignored too. All these elements together give a great dive in the First World War, no matter which faction you choose at the beginning (You'll play each of them, - I'm sure (:) If you are interested in the period of the Great War, and/or you have tried AGEod wargames before, then you will not regret acquiring To End All Wars. What is really missing for a smooth immersion in the game - it's a couple or even two couples of small scenarios (5-15 turns). But I think it's a matter of time. Personally, wargames from AGEod has never disappointed me.Will definetly recommed this wargame. ;)RUS:Ничего необычного, очередной шедевр от AGEod! :)Сначала вас отпугнёт интерфейс игры, потом перегруженность игрового экрана, но через пару часов вы поймёте, что это отличный варгейм с очень достойной симуляцией военных действий периода Великой Войны.Движок AGE отлично справился с гражданскими войнами Рима, замечательно передал атмосферу Гражданской Войны в США и теперь предлагает опробовать Первую Мировую Войну.В отличии от других серий игр AGEod, тут действительно тяжело, т.к. нам предлагают 3 огромные фракции - Антанта на западе, Антанта на востоке и Центральные Державы.Управлять таким количеством юнитов не просто(для примера:  играя за западную Антанту, со старта  вы управляйте Францией, Великобританией и Бельгией, для человека незнакомого с варгеймами в целом и с AGEod в частности это тяжело осилить с наскока), но очень интересно. Музыка, стилистика игрового интерфейса, замечательно нарисованная карта и аутентичные портреты лидеров передают атмосферу начала 20-го века на отлично.Военные действия на суше и на море равноправны, что очень радует - блокады, корабельные рейды, бомбардировки берегов со стороны моря и волны пехоты, бесконечные пулемётные очереди, кавалерийские рейды и залпы тысячи орудий на земле. Так же радует наличие таких мелочей, как присутствие бригад связи, полевых госпиталей, инженерных войск, аэростаты и т.д. Такие мелочи в совокупности очень сильно обогащают геймплей.Движок AGEod отлично сочетает в себе мобильную войну на востоке и позиционную на западе.Так же без внимания не оказались и колонии стран участниц.Все эти элементы вместе дают отличное погружение в Первую Мировую войну, не зависимо от того, какую фракцию вы выберете вначале(всё равно вы сыграйте за каждую, я уверен (: )Если вас интересует период Великой Войны и/или вы пробовали раньше варгеймы от AGEod, то приобретая To End All Wars вы не прогадайте.Чего не хватает для более плавного погружения в игру, так это пары или даже две пары маленьких сценариев на ходов 5-15. Но думаю, это вопрос времени.Лично меня варгеймы от AGEod ещё ни разу не разочаровывали, надеюсь и вас тоже.			"

												This is not a strategy game for casuals nor the faint of heart. If you by some crazy notion think the Europa series, Crusader  Kings, or Hearts of Iron is complex you have not played an AgeOD game yet! This feels like the spiritual sequel to WWI: Gold, and it has definitely improved on previous games quite a bit. In all honesty, it's a blend of WWI: Gold and ACW, which means it's flat out awesome. You can start off in 3 different scenarios: the East Prussian Campaign (which is essentially the battles of Tannenburg and Marsuian Lakes), the historical WWI start in August of 1914, or an earlier one which give you more options for managing your nations. You get to choose from 3 sets of powers: the Western Entene powers, Central Powers, or the Eastern Entente powers. Neutral nations can be persuaded to join either side, and some can have a serious effect on the outcome of the war.The start of the campaign is where the complexity and steep learning curve kicks in immediately. This game goes right down to the minutia. You will need to take your time and view the many overlays in game before even thinking of any actions. Individual regions have a certain amount of space for troop deployment, known as ""frontage"". Worse terrain like forests, mountains and marshes severely limit this. Also, what's the weather like in said region? Is it raining? Foggy? Bad weather can be a blessing (providing cover for an advance) or a curse (bogging down tanks in the later years). Supplies & unit cohesion are absolutely crucial too. At the start you'll need to inspect your nation, find your supply depots, where your supplies are produced, and figure out where to build infrastrucure to funnel them efficiently to the front. Logistics and cutting enemy supply lines can literally win the war as an army without supplies can starve to death if cut off. There's also hundreds of other factors all taking effect as well. Each unit has different stats & abilites, as do your generals. The biggest improvement by far is the addition of battle plans. You can finally decide what your troops do in individual battles, so the war isn't just won solely on the campaign map anymore. Sometimes a human wave assault might be just what the marshal ordered. Or maybe a double envelopment or crossfire is needed. You really feel like a general trying to guess what the enemy is doing and the best course of action to take. The game also uses the Army & Corps system from ACW, which functions beautifully for a WWI setting. Having your corps' properly place in a line of trenches is awesome to witness, as they will intelligently ""march to the sound of the guns"" and reinforce other units of the same army that are under attack.The biggest flaw in my opinion, is that the ""off-map boxes"" from WWI Gold are still in. It's still confusing trying to figure out how some of them intersect, and I can't quite fathom why something better hasn't been put in place yet. I understand AgeOD doesn't want to go into the excruciating detail they went into with Europe, but something like the Africa box would have been just fine for other sectors too.In conclusion: if you're ready to break out the manual, maybe even some pen and paper, and dive into a seriously complex WWI game that encompasses the whole globe: To End All Wars is for you! Once you start getting a handle of the game, you'll get a real sense of accomplishment and only get hooked that much more!			"

												I'm going to give this game a recommendation for people to own. But with reservations. This is not going to be a straight hex wargame like many of you are used to. If you cannot get your mind around that, then you will hate this game. If you can be open-minded and strive to understand this game, try and understand that the army cards/icons have men truly modeled inside that army,, then you will enjoy this game.I did an AAR of this game over on the Ageod forums. http://www.ageod-forum.com/showthread.php?36936-To-End-All-Wars-AAR-Western-Entente-against-the-AI-of-Central-Powers!I am almost an amateur with these games, but I understood it well enough to write an AAR. My AAR is tailored for someone new to Ageod games. If you like perusing over generals and trying to decide who would be the best person to command an army, who would be the best to promote, who would be the best to spearhead an attack for your offensive, this game is for you. If you like a game where you can recruit/purchase an actual, historical unit to be represented on the field of battle, this game is for you. It brings a lot of the pageantry that hex wargames sometimes kind of lose. Do you think you know something about WW1? And have suggestions? The producers of this game, Ageod are open to that. Be prepared to back your suggestion up with facts and figures, because there will be a lively debate over whether your opinion holds weight or not. So, if you like a game where the producers are open to your ideas and suggestions, then this game is for you.If you like having a static line with a bunch of hexes facing off and do not like any other type wargame, then this will not be for you. It is an ambitious look at WW1 and really all of their titles are ambitious looks at the conflict they try to model. Pros:1. Captures the pageantry (if you can call a brutal slog that killed millions a ""pageant"") of WW1.2. It lets you drill down deep into your armies and look at individual regiments and what type of soldier makes up the regiment.3. It can be a very fun, medium type wargame with lots of options to make the game easier as you learn the game. For example. I played my AAR on easy supply, because I like playing it where I tell the people in charge of supply to get it done. I feel that part is better automated. Cons: 1. Well, the cons I have with this game is that it really does have a steep learning curve and people get turned off by that. It happened to me on some of their games. This one was the easiest for me to ""get into""2. The manual is hard to follow and many times does not tell you everything you need to know. You have to go to their forums and ask. Sometimes people don't like to do that. They expect the manual to cover everything.3. The interface is somewhat older and not intutive. Once you have used it for awhile, though, that is all old hat.			"

												This is a complex and deep strategy game that I recommend for those that feel games like EU4 or CKII or HoI3 are too simple or too high-level. This is not quick wargame, and people that expect such a game will be disappointed.It is turn-based, and because both the players turns are executed simultaneously, an additional layer of complexity is added. It gets better if you turn the realism options on, because common sense then helps to understand what happens in the game. There are so many factors to consider that ""gaming the system"" is difficult, and that's a good thing.The AI is challenging, for me at least.The dualplayer is Play By Email. It can take hours to issue the orders for 1 turn if you're a control-freak, and while a game-server of some sorts to coordinate games might be easier, emailing is easy enough.I've played their Civil War game (AACW) and Rise of Prussia for many hours and I'm enjoying myself in TEAW. Once you get over the learning curve, you'll find one of the better strategy games out there.			"

												A glorious WW1 historical strategy made by AGEODS. Whether you are looking for just a small scenario such as the Serbian War, or Gallipoli or a MAJOR campaign such as the entire war you can do it here! I have tried to start my own central powers campaign, I wonder if I can succeed in changing the course of the War.

												I own most of the Ageod games out there. I was frustrated in the beginning, as most people are jumping in head first. Fortunately, and with the help of a couple of Play-by-email MP matches (Which for me are Play-by-Dropbox really) I figured things out. As the base engine does not change, I got access to games covering most of the interesting periods of history. TEAW is no exception; steep learning cure, a couple of things to figure out, but once the code is figured out it is very rewarding. There are three base factions in this one, so there is room for a lot of fun and replayability in MP. Do yourself a favor, once you got the basics down, yank up the boni to the AI or look for human opponents on their forum. It's AI after all. The real thrill comes from trying to beat the human mind, not a piece of software.For 40 bucks, you get 100's of hours of gameplay, the satisfaction of Grand Strategy and a publisher that, even years after, seems to have people assigned to patching and improving products.Now if that isn't enough, go and pay 50 bugs for Assassins Creed Unity or some♥♥♥♥♥♥like that to frustrate yourself with blockbuster-crap even further.

												Possibly the best WW1 war game on the market currently. I have played a lot of Commander the Great War and Strategic Command ww1. Each game has it's own merits but personally I find that TEAW really gives you the biggest sense of scale out of the offering of ww1 strategy games currently.If you have played other AGEOD titles then you will be able to pick this up pretty much right away. If like me however you have never played an AGEOD title (Did dabble a little with Pride of Nations) then you will find the learning curve rather steep. The tutorial is kinda garbage, explaining little and leaving you to learn for yourself. There are however a number of good tutorials on YouTube for this and other AGEOD games so you can learn the game pretty quickly. Being a grand strategy game focused on warfare these games aren't quite as deep as the Paradox games out there but it does offer the real feeling of commanding tons and tons of troops. There is a technology aspect to the game however this amounts to putting money into aspects of research then a background dice roll determines if you gain a level or not. A number of the mechanics of this game give a feeling of a boardgame. Personally I love the boardgame style parts of the game, others might not feel the same of course.Combat in this game is based off of whatever units are initially involved in the combat, the terrain, the stats of the commanding officers and any reinforcing units. Combat is off hands (Apart from a tactics selection that can be turned on)  so you don't get involved during but rather the planning initially with troop placements, stances of stacks and picking of ground. there is an oddly therapeutic feeling when reorganizing armies after the initial mayhem of 1914. This is where a big part of the game lies, having your forces in the right place at the right time. In conclusion if you enjoy Paradox games, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you are looking for a ww1 strategy game, you will enjoy this game. If you like the AGEOD series then you will love this game as it's more of the same but on a larger scale.			"

												If you want a detailed and overwelming experience of WW1 this is the game for you. You will have to learn the game mechanics and read the manual, cunsult the ageod forum, but once you get the hang of it, you will be addicted :). My steam time on TEAW is low coz I play mostly the non steam (standalone) version. The game is pached frequently (open beta for new builds) and the developers have a great communication with the fan base.			"

												AGEOD does a great job of presenting historical military stratagem games.  For some time playing different games I have been wishing they would make a WW1 version, and I am so happy they did.  Their game engine (while a bit dated and not perfect) is ideal for this genre.  It creates a very realistic, fun, and historically accurate game.  I like that you can play the game exactly as it played out in history, or you can make several different changes to create an alternate history.  This has become my favorite AGEOD game!			"

												i have 81 games and i think this is the first one that is worth a few seconds for a review.to start, this is the best ageod game, hands down, i've played every one of their games (except the roman ones) from their first civil war game to the russian civil war to the cossacks. in my opinion they pale in comparison to this amazing game. PROS:its fast, way faster in processing turns then any other ageod game, max time is 4 minutes and that was near the end date in 1918, for the amount of ""moving parts"" in this game i am quite impressed. it's detailed, the units are accurate and the events add flavour.it has an insane amount of replayability, for example, if you play as france you could choose one of 4 initial army setups, you can invade belgium, defend, attack through the ardennes or attack through alsace-lorraine but, the germans could pick one of their 4 warplans as well, some can counter others, they can invade belgium, attack through switzerland, attack russia or have a balanced defense. austria could choose to focus on russia or serbia, bide its time and not commit to a certain front, or a mix of those first three, russia can charge at berlin, attack galicia, do both, or bide its time too! the game is never the same twice, the ai will choose a different strategy and set up each time! you can randomize all generals abilitys too! in one game i wrecked the serbians and russians with my overpowered austrian generals while germany barely held with her 1-1-1 generals. you can choose different battle strategys too, most options have counters so for example, you could be attack with 250,000 against an equal force and either lose 100,000 men to their 15,000 due to them countering you infantry assualt with mass fire or it could go the other way around! more and more strategys become available with both time and general level. there is so much more then i can describe in this review.the AI is very intelligent and punishing, yet it is still almost human because it makes mistakes too, the detection system actually works for them! they dont have the usual ""all seeing eye"" that lets them know everything about you and your troops, they will make costly underestimations but not at an insane rate where it becomes too easy.very few bugs, unlike other ageod games this one has NEVER CRASHED! CONSrussia is overpowered, even from the beginning if they attack an equal german army that is entrenched with high cohesion troops and support they can still win even with a countered battle strategy.it can be very hard to win, in one of my first games i got rebel in alignment in britain to 100% and nothing happened, they kept fighting, same with the russians, rebel alignment was 80% and national moral was at 35 in january 1917 and they kept going... this is more of a neutral but it doesnt have too many other campaigns, none of them are ""unique"" and they are really short...OVERALL.definitly worth the time to get in to, especially if you've played ageod games before, if you are a new player i'd be more likely to reccomend pride of nations (mixed review only because it takes 5 minutes to process a turn) which is a very good introduction to ageod and easy to learn, although to end all wars would be my second choice.i was only planning on writing a really short review but got carried away obviously... thanks if you read this, please rate my review! :D			"

												This the best AGEOD title to date. The First World War is beautifully recreated with AGEOD's usual attention to historical detail. The player begins by selecting from a range of different strategic war plans that were either actually chosen in real life (e.g. the Schlieffen Plan for the Central Powers) or were real life  alternative plans. Of course once the war begins (on the first turn) the plans can be altered just as they were in real life to respond to ongoing developments. For me the true star of all AGEOD games is the WEGO simultaneous turn system. The WEGO system is by far the best and most realistic system for a wargame. You plan your moves at the same time as the AI or human opponent and then get to see how the move unfolds over each 15-day turn. Diplomacy and economic aspects are represented by an easy to use system that leaves the main focus on the military aspect. This is where To End All Wars really shines with every general's stats researched in detail and impacting significantly on the game. Each nation's units are also present from divisions to Corps and Armies. There are strategic objectives that must be captured and held and, along with winning battles, these contribute to the morale of each alliance: you can play as either the Central Powers/ The Western Entente/ or the Eastern Entente. Other nations can join your side according to the diplomatic and military choices that the player makes. There is careful balancing to make sure that the actual historical outcomes are likely while still giving the player room to manouver and change history in certain cases.Naval warfare is also represented although some aspects are abstracted. Submarine warfare will be important as the technology develops and the blockades that existed in the war are well represented without the need for too much micro management. In addition to covering the entire European and Middle-Eastern theatres the game also includes African/ Asian and even Central American/ South American off map boxes to reflect the all encompassing nature of this first truly global war.But it is in the land battles where TEAW really grabs you. Pressing that 'next move' button and seeing how your carefully laid plans play out over each turn as your forces interact with the enemy is one of the highlights of AGEOD games for me. As in real life it has been observed that ""no plan survives contact with the enemy"" so the player will learn what it felt like to be one of the real WW1 commanders who were often not fully informed about the enemy's positions/ force size and composition. The fog of war is well represented as are units such as cavalry, balloons, aircraft and zeppelins which can contribute to removing the fog of war. Technology also plays an important role as it did in the real war. The game takes the player down a fairly structured path here where it is possible to influence development but where very unrealistic outcomes are not possible.If you are looking for a real wargame where the other aspects are included but do not result in much micro management then I would highly recommend this game. There have been a few minor bugs in the initial release which the developer is usually very conscientitious about responding too but the game is already in excellent shape and very solid and very playable.Warning: this game can be very addictive.., fighting the campaign that covers the whole war can take a lot of hours but it is time that will be richly rewarded with many entertaining moments. AGEOD just keeps getting better as one of the few quality wargame studios out there. Can't wait for Napoleon's Campaigns 2, hopefully next year!!			"

												It could be just me not understanding the game mechanics, but so far despite my best efforts to understand and mastering them, the game develops in very awkward ways. For instance, during the initial invasion of Belgium and France, I can't even take Antwerp. I set up an experiment in which I tried to achieve nothing but that. I hauled all heavy guns to Antwerp, established military control of the region (so the city was under siege, I suppose), bombarded it, assaulted it, caused breaches, but could not take it. In the next turn, all the breaches were gone and the defenders (although under siege, I suppose) grew in numbers.I ask you, what is this travesty? I have given up. If I'm doing something wrong and someone wants to tutor me, I'll be willing to give it another shot. Until then however, I will maintain that this game is broken and will dissuade people from purchasing.			"

												I'v recently found out about the AGEOD games and I have to admit that I've completely fallen in love with them. From Alea Iacta Est through Thirty Years War, Napoleon, American Civil war, Spanish Civil War to WWI all games use the same engine with some variations and fluff to really make the time period shine.To End All Wars is no exception, it plays like an excellent WWI Grand Strategy Game and I for one can't recommend it enough. A classic and instant buy if you love these type of games.			"

It is up to you how detailed you decide to go, but for those that simply love strategy, you can focus there. For those that want to dive into details, you have that option as well. To End All Wars is no exception, tackling WWI, an era that, in retrospect, had a more profound impact on our world today than I ever realized. "

There are lots of very important mechanics in the game that are either not explained very well or not explained at all in the manual or the ""tutorial"". You'll find yourself constantly on AGEoD's forums trying to find an answer to something. Oh, and be prepared for random crashes that could ruin your campaign 10 hours in, but that's par for the course for AGEoD games. It almost hurts to do it, but I do recommend this game.

												Once I understood how this game works, I found the game an excellent game. I really like how detail of decision making within the game can be. Also, I like the way the Army Groups are broken down to form smaller army groups all the way to korps. There are so much in this game, I could go on and on. Maybe it is just me about this game, (alittle shocked about the mixed reviews) I really like detailed games like this one. Yes, I have all the other games made by this company, with the exception of Napoleon and Prussia Rising, and those games (I have) are just as fun. Now, I really believe if you are true fan of military games and the level of details within a game, I would recommend this one and all the others that are similar to this one.			"

After many hours of playing it gets a bit boring to hear always the same songs. But of course this does not approach the suffering of the poor blokes in the trenches betwee '14 and '18! ;-)			"

												First World War has not been as popular as WWII in wargames. The idea of a static war doesn't seem very interesting. But WWI was more than that: the trench war was more a story of offensives and counteroffensives rather than fixed positions; other fronts were very mobile (from Russia to Middle East); the naval war was even more crucial than in WWII... And Ageod has accomplished bringing the very nature of this conflict to a game immersive, deep and challenging.In addition to what I consider the main strenght of TEAW (a warfare system suited both for trench and mobiles battles, which I didn't think it could be possible with Ageod's engine but... it's working), there are other interesting features, like a naval system which represents quite well the struggle for blocking the other alliance, or the implementation of diplomacy, research and even some political concerns. Don't expect in these fields complex dynamics like in Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron but... they're effective, they're integrated in the game (they're not mini-games inside the game) and they're interesenting, adding new strategic layers to your decisions. Anyway TEAW core is warfare, and how you manage your troops and leaders, grant an effective supply chain and build a powerful alliance of countries.Immersion is accomplished thanks to the highly precise databases of leaders and orders of battle, the very detailed after-battle reports and also because of graphics, music and overall design, as well as little but flavorful features like colonies or events.Finally, developers are releasing new content for the game (not just fixing bugs), improving game balance and, what is important, also game performance. The main problem of TEAW, the turn processing duration, is in its way of solving: new beta patch has reduced time between turns drastically, so after that I can only recommend strongly this game to all people loving wargames and looking for something different.

												Do not often contribute for reviews but thought I would say something about To End all Wars.I had been looking for sometime for a good WW1 strategy game.  I find most do not capture that deepth of the period.  They play more like a WW2 game with old looking units, using ""blitz"" tactics in a period when it would take weeks to move.TEAW captures that slower non mobile, entrenched feeling.  This game is not a repackaged WW2 clone.  In my current game I am playing the Western Entente, the Germans swept into Belgium and through Luxemburg, the french where pushed back (nearly to Paris!!) but then things just jammed up and litterly bogged down.  The French/Britsh forces have pushed the Germans back to the Ardenees, with a line of trenches going to Ypres in the north and all along the French Border in the south.  The fighting is slow and brutal, with a single German attack against dug in French lines costing over 120k troops! The feel of WW1 is there.  You cannot rush troops around nor do reckless quick attacks.  You must find soft spots and plan attacks or your troops will suffer the consequences.Diplomcy is interesting, have Japan and Portugual on my side and working on Italy.  Oddly the US seems to be swing toward the Central Entente, now that would be a problem if they joined germany.Technoogy is well managed, Gas attacks by the West (my side) where used in early spring 1915 and I am expecting retaliation by the Germans soon.The interface in clunky and needs work but once you figure it out it does become easier.  The map is amazing, really like the detail.  Improvements could be the ability to search.  I am constantly trying to find units or generals and there is no real easy way to search, for example you cannot type in a name and find where it is.  Also, the command structure is confusing, but maybe command in this period is supposed to be confusing.Overall, really enjoy the game.  It will take you a few starts and restarts to really get a game going.  Recommend you print , read and have the manual next to you when you are playing, it helps alot as this game has a lot of depth to it.If you are looking for that WW1 game to fill the hole in your collections, I do recommend this one.

												To End All Wars – the first major world conflict that even today we still feel the effects of its devastation. AGEOD has a great global game engine, and this games world map brings the entire war to life across the globe. World War I has taken a second seat to the plethora of World War 2 games. However, the Great War was by far the most upheaval world changing war. The collapse of great empires, changing of world power, and social revolutions are a few of this wars result. To End All Wars is a game I have been waiting for, Pride of Nations goes to WW1. The turn times are long, but the developers are continually working to address this issue. Much faster than the first release of the game.I find myself engulfed in this game for hours and thoroughly enjoy the challenging AI, world map, and grand strategy of the Great War. AGEOD/Slitherine continue your work to improve this game as you have built a great base!von Braun     "

												Impressive, detailed, visually appealing and a whole lot of fun. One of the most in-depth wargames on WW1 currently on Steam. This is also one of Ageod most modern era game besides Espana 1936. So I am going to write this review on why I like this game, and it heavily involves RUS: Revolution Under Siege. Sometimes after a good chunk of time playing the Russian Civil War and playing a tug of war with the REDS, WHITES, GREENS, and Anarchists, sometimes I fancy to play To End All Wars to experience the professional armies during WW1 to take a break from the rag-tag ""army"" the russians managed to slap together during the Russisan Civil War. Sometimes I like to play as the Eastern Entente as Russia to try to change history to try to minimize the possiblity of the civil war by making tactically sound decisions. The best I can really do is keep the amount of soldiers lost below the historical levels, and I really never got far enough to see if the Civil War really is preventable. But nontheless I stil build industrial complex of Russia trying to make the army more advanced than it historically was, maybe to faintly hope to prevent the repeat of the amount of losses suffered during the great war. Occassionally I follow a different warplan or play defensively than offensively. Others it is just a random affair of both with just one goal in mind, prevent the Russian civil war...			"

												I purchased To End All Wars for an extravagant price but at the time did not mind since I thought that it would be worth it.I’ll keep my summation short. The gameplay is over complicated, the tutorial takes too long and the graphics are not great. But the worst and most frustrating part of this game is the time it takes to complete a turn. When you played your moves and you hit the end round button the frustration steps in. Each round covers a period of 15 days to complete while the other nations make their moves. There are no animations as conflicts happen and the turns “takes” ages to complete. It literally takes minutes … hit end turn and do some chores and hopefully when you’re done, the round is complete and you can start another frustrating period of staring at the screen or do some more chores. In my humble opinion this game is overpriced.So if you're not patient and willing to really wait, this game is not recommended. There are better and faster grand strategy games available.			"

												This is the most realistic WW1 game I've ever played. I have no idea what I'm doing, tons of people are dying, and the frontlines look more or less the same as they did a month ago. 10/10 would order infantry wave assaults on entrenched positions again.In all seriousness, this game is on the A.G.E. engine. If you've never played one before, it will overwhelm you. I've logged hundreds of hours in Pride of Nations, so most of it was familiar to me, although the sheer scale of WORLD WAR ONE is still a bit difficult to comprehend at first. A good deal of the complexity of Pride of Nations isn't there, such as the ""managing everything from fish to timber to automobile exports"", plus most of the world other than Europe and some of the Middle East/North Africa is condensed down to hotzones. However, that complexity is more than made up for by the fact that you are, again, managing ALL OF WORLD WAR ONE.No real buildup time, no ways to delay the war...boom, it's August 1914 and the Hun is basically already in control of Belgium. Plus you're controlling ALL OF either the Entente western or eastern front, or ALL OF the Central Powers...it would have probably been better if you were at least allowed to say ""I will play Great Britain, AIs will control France, Belgium, the US, etc."" The fact that all supplies, unit mustering, etc. are pooled between the nations is a bit offsetting, plus a rather major issue in the AGEOD engine that may not have been a big issue in previous games, but comes to light here in the war of the trench. Fortifications are a factor of the unit occupying them, rather than a terrain piece, and basically vanish when said unit leaves the region or goes on the offensive. There are ways to work around that, but it still destroys a big part of the First World War: the enemy taking a trench network and immediately being able to turn it againt its previous occupants.Overall, though, it's mostly just small issues. The BIG one is whether or not you enjoy this level of complexity. If you do, welcome to the front. If not, play literally anything else.			"

												Bought the game based on some positive reviews in this area. Paid £30 for it. Game will not run at all. I get ""Cannot locate compatable Direct3D Device"" error, no option to repair it, no access to a ""settings"" area on the launcher, and then it closes. I've tried finding technical help - only the forum links on the actual game for Tech Support are broken. After a bit of digging, I find it, and found out that the company provides extremely poor tech support for the game. There are requests for help dating back to March 2016 that haven't been looked at. The Steam Forums are equally neglected. I cannot find any work-around for my problem, so I've been forced to uninstall the game. A total waste of money.			"

												Unfortunately the ame runs really badly. User interface is so slow that makes it unplayable. The computer I'm using is powerful enough, I have no issue playing any other game (I7, 32 GB ram, 3 SSD in RAID etc)I only managed to run half of the turorials and tried twice the frist turns of the simplest campaign (for 20 min each).I do not enjoy putting this bad review, but there is no way I can recommend anyone buying this. Too bad for such wasted work from developers, the game looked promising.I have tried to get a refund from Steam but they refused, claiming that I have played the game for 20 hours. It's not impossible that I left the game running overnight, but I definitely didn't *play* it because this game is not playable.			"

												Lovingly created with bags of detail.  Is it playable, not really sure, look I'm the first to like complex, deep games but I think this game, for me just lacks a bit of soul, after 60-odd hours with it my instincts are to fire up another campaign game of GWIE and forget about this.  I realise a lot of work under the bonnet has probably gone into it not being the case but it feels like the Civil War 2 engine has been re-skinned with new detail and options added and that's what we have.  I like CW2 but doesn't quite feel like it works as a medium for WW1 simulation.			"

												I don't have much playing time on this game for a reason, if you read the full review you will understand why. I have a love hate relationship to this game. I cannot believe how many good reviews this game have. these reviewers must be very booring people. it is a turn based grand strategy game, it looks beautiful, it have some dept and is insteresting in the historical perspective, it does have a very steep learning curve, this is one of those games you have to learn for quite some time before you know how to play it. what's wrong with this game is the time it takes to wait between turns, and it really is a game braker, which is a shame because the game otherwice really is a great game in all other aspects, and it doesnt matter how fast computer you have, after you push the turn button, you can just go and take a brake, drink cup of coffy, and when you return the turn is still not compleated, that is how bad it is, this makes the game incredibly booring to play. in the begining it takes about 5 minutes between turns but the more you dive into it and the more complex it gets, it just are going to take longer and longer and longer. the developers seem to use a somewhat outdated programing language or they are not just capable of fixing this problem. simply, the Aegod game engine is outdated. and this is a problem running across all! the Aegod games more or less. hint: Aegod, there are skillful programmers for hire! because of this, I can not recommend it, not even if it comes on sale. in fact I don't recommend any games coming from Aegod because of this reason, they are all slow because they all run on the same engine, when and if ever Aegod will come up with a new and improved game engine, I will re-write this review and probably be recommending it, but for now, definitely NOOO!. if you don't mind waiting forever between turns? then don't hesitate to get this game.

												Terrible GUI that you have to touch in order to feel how bad it is, the videos are misleading. Tutorials are cards filled with microscopic text and everything is totally counter-intuitive to me. The map is full of units that I can't figure out what to do with and turn ends take their sweet time.There's no tactical combat but some tedious ""select your cards to suck or press the button to have AI select the best ones for you"".  Research is hidden in Russia deep map (figures) and diplomacy is there somewhere but who cares since you can't fight the war in the first place due to the staggering ammount of meaningless detail being thrown into your face.If you got several days to study this game hard, then maybe it'll rock, but again maybe it'll stay the as bad as it is for me. I have neither the time nor the gumption to invest so much time into a non-intuitive engine. Hey developers, this is a game, not a professional piece of software. I feel that many professional database tools have better and more intiutive GUI than what you managed to produce.I'd definitly recommend to not buy this game since I feel cheated of 35 Euros for something that I'm going to shelf now and for good.

												This game provides a very deep simulation of the Great War. It exploits the solid AGEOD engine to reproduce all the military aspects of the period. In addition, the diplomacy is covered with a simplified but effective method. The learning curve is rather steep, but very rewarding. The game uses the WEGO system: all the sides issue orders for the following turn (two weeks), then orders of the different factions are all executed realistically at the same time. The time needed to the pc to process turns is one-two minutes, one of the shortest in AGEOD games. In conclusion, I strongly recommend this game.			"

												I want so badly to love this game.  Great historical simulation; they've done their homework on geography, history, and troop composition.  This game will teach you the horror of war from feeding your troops and keeping their magazines stocked to drafting new 18 year olds to man the trenches each year.The game accurately characterizes the leadership challenges faced by the lesser powers and the hopelessness of the Western Front.HOWEVER, getting the stupid, clunky, 100 year old AGEOD engine to function is a war of attrition in and of itself.  I have now spent 4 hour trying to get the August 1915 turn to resolve without an error, apparently inherent to the AGEOD engine.  If you have more than one disk drive that you use, DO NOT BUY ANY AGEOD games!!!!!!!   The turns in this game take 100 years WITHOUT the stupid errors.			"
