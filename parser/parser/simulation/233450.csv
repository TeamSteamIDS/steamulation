Early Access Review
								This ""game"" ruined my perception of the human soul. Let me explain. I had a prison going, a real human rights violation if ever there was one. 300 high-violence inmates crammed into a single holding cell like animals. They had 10 beds to share among them. Two (working) toilets. Three showerheads. Constant shakedown searches, armed and k9 guards every twenty feet. A 25 square foot exercise yard where they were forced to spend most of their days crammed together like sardines. At lunch time, most of them didn't even get to eat. They were hungry, smelly, and angry. But they never rioted. They kept to themselves and just walked around all day complaining.So I sold the prison. And I built another one. This was a utopia. Most of the offenders were normal risk. I had adequate housing, food, staff, showers. It was clean. Every cell had a TV. Most of their day was spent in free time. I had GED classes for them, substance abuse programs. And THAT wasn't good enough for them. It all started with one inmate. ""Fish"" was his nickname. He goes to his alcoholics class and within a matter of minutes, he beats the therapist to death right in front of the other inmates! What a jerk. The other inmates must have become stricken with terror because as I'm locking the guy in the hole, another inmate stabs a new arrival to death right in front of a guard. The new arrival hadn't even been booked into processing yet and there he is bleeding out on the shower room floor! As the guards are dealing with stabby mcstabberson, two more inmates start tearing the beds out of the walls in their cells so they catch beatdowns from the guards too.At that point, the other prisoners decide they want no part of any of that and go off to their cells. The murderers / violent offenders spend 48 hours in solitary.I guess what I'm trying to say is that this game is awesome, especially considering it's Early Access.			"

								If you think you are going to like this game, you probably will! Prison Architect is pretty much exactly what it sounds like it is going to be. It's a prison simulation game where you manage a prison. But it does that very well!There are different ways to play but in one way you get a certain number of minimum, normal, and maximum security prisoners dropped off every day. You need to make room in your prison for these guys, you need to keep them happy, and you need to make sure they don't run away or kill each other.To start off you can either build a large holding cell or smaller individualized cells (the individual cells are much more expensive but it keeps the prisoners happier). Each prisoner has needs like the need to shower, to eat, to sleep, to go out to the yard, to talk to their family, etc. You can see these stats on a per prisoner basis or as an overall stat at the top of your screen. The more unhappy your prisoners are the more likely they are to try to escape, to cause a riot, to kill people, etc.The other thing you need to keep in mind is money. You are running a for-profit prison after all. You can get money from grants at the start of the game (they are kind of like mini quests where you get half the money up-front and the other half once you complete the objective) and you also get money depending on the number of prisoners you have. You spend money every day on things like food, guards, other staff members, etc. You can hire less staff members or reduce the quality of the food but there are risks to doing those things.So what's the endgame? Once (and only once) you decide your prison is profitable enough, you can sell it. The game gives you a monetary score depending on how well you did. You can use this money to start your next prison and make it even better.			"

												Thank you for this wonderful game. I have created many prisons and I shared it in the workshop,(Walking the Mile) this is definately one of my best. I have to say the game has got my full attention, the way you have created each individual prisoner  keeps it real interesting. There are a few  thoughts I have that these should be in the game always, such as a medical ward, much like the protective custody. Some prisoners are insane and should be labeld that way, then they could serve there time in the medical ward. A gang rehab class, trying to remove the gang label. a confession room for the chapel. Maybe a prison cemetery for those that die in prison and have no family. Other levels of death penaties, gas chamber, lethal injection based on what he arrives in prison and the judge appoints which penalty! The sniper towers are great, these sould be used indoors as well, makes you think there is an upper level.I do not use the mail room, the prisoners dont work it fast enough and I get piles of mail bages in storage, also it ties up guards picking up where they left off. I also dont use the forestry, piles of wood are everywhere, in conjunction I dont use the carpenrty tables or programs, it takes forever for a prisoner to learn and produce, but the time they do this the get released. I think the library should be open regardless of education levels, so I dont  use this feature either. Overall this game is great. I recommend it it to all that enjoy building population of any sort.			"

Early Access Review
								If you're interested in this game, just buy it. It has workshop integration with an active modding community. Earlier tonight I changed the theme to star wars with a press of the button. This is a very addictive game where real time begins to speed by in a blur. 5 minutes becomes 5 hours and you only noticed because you need to use the restroom. There is a wonderful charm about it and the fat little characters. There is a lot of micromanagement so if you're the kind of person that hates to think, can't oil your brain because it hurts, well then you should pass. It's not overly complicated but the game doesn't hold your hand starting out. It's like bam build a prison. The only downside is struggling to figure out why things aren't being built, or populated. This may further confuse someone since it is alpha which makes it difficult to distinguish between a bug and something you aren't doing correctly. Other than that you should enjoy this game.			"

												Prison Architect is one of those games, kind of like the sims, with which you occasionally have the brief moments of clarity where you realise that you're wasting your time scheduling and organising the lives of simulated people and you get the sudden urge to do something productive in real life like build some furniture or take a cooking class or raise a family.Thankfully these moments pass and you can go back to playing the game.

Early Access Review
								Spent three hours planning,Had my first set of prisoners,Forget to enclose prison,After yard time they all just walked off to freedom.10/10After many let downs with other Early Access games this one gives me hope. Constant updates and enough of a full game to feel complete make this worth of a purchase. Edit 3/21/15:With over $13,000,000 these two ""developers"" made off this game so far --- and note, Heavy Rain's budget was $25,000,000 --- I'm pretty sure they're directing your money right in their pockets. -And you're mad they are keeping the money you paid them when they have been up front about their plans? I mean, if I was selling burgers for 3 bucks and people kept paying me for them I would pocket the money too.And the apologists who think devs these days have good intentions, are on a completely different planet. Instead of getting a dev team and a tester team up and ready to push this game on the shelves-Its their product and sadly they can do what they want with it. We paid to play an unfinsihed product and be the testers. EA is not so we can get our greedy hands on games before they are ready, its so we can be involved in the creation. These devs have actually listened to their players since day one.they're shoving that money right up their noses.-Thats just mean.This could have been a complete, possibly addictive and fully polished game by the end of 2014-Not with the way the people who made the game were going with it. We're talking about sprites for god sakes.-Earthbound, ChronoTrigger, Secret Of Mana, FF<6......This game has added so much on the macro and micro level that if all you see are sprites you need to go back to COD.

												This game is insanely fun. But it does have it problems.I'll talk about what I love about it and then I'll talk about what I hate.1, Gangs.The fact you can get gangs in your prison is great. They'll work together to escape and to kill/fight during a riot or skirmish.I find it perfect that I can section off gang members between cell blocks, And one day open up the doors and watch the murder spree insue, Before sending my armed guards set to free-fire in to crap on the resistance.2, Mods.With this game you can see almost anything anytime with mods, I once had a mod that is sadly out of date now, Which set the base agression of the prisoners to near-riot at all times. Me moving one prisoner to another cell set off the entire prison into a rampage. Total death toll was over 400 prisoners, 300 guards and the 5 admins, Whom, Got rushed by gun-weilding gangs.3, Armed Guards.The fact I can turn my prison into a DPRK Political Prison is just great. Putting guards in the canteena with free-fire on is possibly the best way to maintain order in my prisons while keeping the quality as low as it can possibly go. No janitors, No health care, NOTHING.Those were the things I like about this game, Time to get into the stuff I hate.1, Workers.The workers get stuck far to often for their own good, It seriously calls into question what the level of education required for their field of work is. I once had about 50 workers stuck behind a wall, and 20 more in another. The sad thing is, When i tried to free them, The oposite set would be assigned to free the other. This lasted 20 mins before i hired 100 more.They also have a tendency to shove their faces into the edge of the map once you buy a gate, Its annoying.2, Easy to trigger prisoners.Now, I did say before that I had a mod that triggered them, But it seems the mod is useless now, The prisoners in this game seem to be like their personality was taken straight from forums dedicated to complaints and petty ♥♥♥♥♥. The prisoners can be set off for litterally walking to far. Its rediculas when you have to kill half your prison beacuse they hate WALKING.3, Cell Quality.This is a prison, Not a luxury hotel. Enough said.I hope yall found this review usefull, At all. Probably not.			"

												I received a low-threat prisoner, so I didn't pay much attention to him. How wrong I was..It was a normal, average day. The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.He attacked from the shadows.Prisoner ""Leeroy jenkins"" viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty. Then I realized..LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEENKINS!54/11 would plastic fork again.			"

Early Access Review
								Where do I begin with a game like this. Well for starters this game was made by an indie company, no big publisher backing Introversion, they have done an amazing job getting this game to where it is at this time. In short, buy this game it is an amazing experience.For those who wish to read, I will now go over the pros and cons of this game in detail.Pros:Build just the way you want:There are very few contraints when building. I'd liken it to Sims 3 from a top down perspective in terms of building. It's great fun.Cartoony but realistic at the same time:The game has a very distinctive art style that is unique to the game, but it deals with serious topics such as if you will execute a death row prisoner or not, or if you will keep a prisoner locked up for virtually all of his day. This game makes you think.It's tough, but only if you want it to be/You can go at your own pace:The aim of the game is not to amass one billion dollars, but to have the lowest reoffending rate for released prisoners, and every in game day can be marginally relaxing if you want it to. For instance you can run a low-security, generally free environment where the aim is to rehabilitate your prisoners through the use of classes you can run, or you can run a max-sec environment punishing the most hardcore of criminals. It's all up to you.A dedicated team:I have watched nearly every alpha video that has been published, and I can clearly see that Introversion software is very passionate about the project. There were (As of writing this it's about a day off offical release) new features each month, and it was a pleasure to watch each and every video.If you enjoyed Sim City you'll love this. There are features very soon to be released I haven't gone over yet,  as well as features I missed,but you'll see for yourself.Cons:Somewhat gruelling at the start:After putting a good 200 hours into the game as a whole, this is probably my most major complaint with the game, is that in the beginning you start with 30K and the only way you can make money is via grants, but selling your first prison is practically the only way to make cash when you're still learning the ropes.Overall a solid 8.5/9 out of 10, certainly one of the best sim and strategy/managment games I have ever played. For $30 you will get a lot of fun out of this. Strongly recommended.			"

								I first played Prison Architect during one of its earliest alpha stages. The game was buggy, limited and filled with core problems but the base idea was still really interesting and I saw a lot of potential. Over the years the game has been polished little by little and I'd say, at this point, the game feels incredibly solid. It's refreshing to see indie developers who legitimately care about making a good game and aren't just focused on appealing to a huge audience and making money.You play as a warden, build a prison from the ground up, and get regular paychecks to keep inmates locked away. You need to make sure the prisoners have basic needs met like food and entertainment, otherwise they'll get rowdy and start trouble (like murdering each other, or breaking things). The concept is very straight-forward. As someone who enjoys games like Sim City and Dwarf Fortress (as well as prison movies) this was very up my alley.You can min-max the perfect prison, or you can just have fun with it and design a chaotic madhouse that's destined to fail. My favorite prison design, my own invention of course, is to have every single part of the prison connect to one center room. That center room is the ""warden's office + shower"" combo. Watch as the warden lives a constant life of fear while the 50+ maximum security prisoners cram their way into the showers meant for no more than 10 people at a time. The warden is sitting there with lamenated paperwork, crying, trying to get something done while all these ruthless thugs wash up. The previous warden is floating, face down in the shower water, right next to the new warden's desk. Yep. Good times.Rating: A			"

								I whole heartedly recommend this game.  At the time of review I have 210 hrs of game time in.  Far behind in my library at #2 is Kerbal Space Program with 105.  This game is perfectly paced, completely open to infinite designs and has so much depth I can easily see hitting 500hrs.  After the latest update (alpha 31) this game is packed with content and the workshop offers massive expansion and awesome mods (Imperial architect being my current fav.  Star wars prison!).Pros:As big as you wanna be!  Want to make a small 25 person prison  that runs efficiently and makes money with minimum security bluecollar criminals?  Go ahead!  Want to make a 500 person Max security only iron curtain that can hold and control intensely volatile and psychotic madmen?  Sure can!Well designed!  The UI and indicators for things like prison heat, tech tree, controlling and managing intake and regime of the inmates and hiring and firing staff, as well as prison programs is easy to understand and impliment.  I've played plenty of games that after opening them up and fiddling with for 20 minutes I can hardly make heads or tails of the UI or it has infinitely frusturating menus to navigate or item info to memorize.  Not so with PA. Entertaining!  Set up phone taps and learn a prisoner has set up a time for someone to throw booze over the wall into the garbage area?  Watch them toddle over into the area and as they head back inside stop them and counter their contraband!  Initiate shakedowns to find inmates who have dummys in their beds and are digging tunnels!  The excitement of unearthing a tunnel they have been digging for days that NEARLY reached the outside but was thwarted is always satisfying.  Recruit confidential informants to reveal persons who have knives, needles, poison SHOTGUNS in their cells.  Use sniffer dogs to inspect incoming food and items to ensure they are poison and piano wire free.  The combinations and implications are endless.No two prisons are ever the same!  One prison may be full of raging alcoholics, another may be a mix of volatile angry inmates and ex law enforcment or snitches that must be contained and seperated or death ensues!  My last prison had 3 legendary prisoners, each capable of disarming and killing guards in a single punch.  Not only must you constantly learn to streamline your prison and improve every aspect of the design you also have to adapt and keep tabs on your current and incoming prisoners, keeping the troublemakers at bay and keeping your staff running smoothly.Cons:Still early access.  This isnt necessarily a con but something to be take into consideration.  This game has all the content and playability and optimization of a full release but as new features ar implimented new bugs invariably creep up.  In the most recent patch my cooks tend to randomly pile dirty trays in the cells of my supermax and solitary prisoners.  Later in the day they pick them up and wash them.  On occasion I will assign a block to eat in a specific canteen, and then assign a specific kitchen to feed them.  Later on suddenly I will check my prisoners needs and some are starving.  I will check my food distribution screen and randomly the kitchen and canteen to cellblock link is totally gone.  Its not perfect, but none of these bugs or issues are anywhere near game breaking and are fairly smalltime.In conclusion get this game.  The developers are awesome, the game is amazing, and its not even complete yet!  I look forward to future updates and features and the workshop community is actively making new mods regularily that add even more to the experience.  98/100			"

												All these reviews talk about how much fun it can be to create a draconian panopticon of hell, but I find it much more profitable to push on rehabilitation. You get money every time you take in prisoners, so it pays to be constantly taking them in, and you get a nice bonus whenever you release someone on parole and they don't reoffend. And while housing them in constant terror can reduce their will to re-offend, it's rather difficult to get that bonus check from a dead man.And the great thing about this game? Both philosophies are perfectly valid. They each have benefits and flaws, and it's your job to strike the balance between the two to get your desired result. Go on, experiment; it's just the lives of criminals you're tinkering with, after all.			"

												I don't normally comment on games I own, but in this case I will make an exception. Its not a review of the game, the game is about building a prison and managing it and the prisoners in it. Does that sound good? Then buy, if not then watch some youtube videos and judge for yourself if its the kind of game you would like to spend some of your time on.The reason I am commenting on this game is that for me its an example of Early Access done correctly. The Devs released a game in a playable but basic state and have consistently updated the game with new features, whilst listening to feedback from the community. Nothing was rushed, no hyperbole that left early buyers feeling short changed later, just a consistent, honest approach from a team of developers that both care about the community the game has created and the quality of the game they have produced. Its been a pleasure to play it and watch the game grow into the 1.0 launch and it means I have a connection to the game that I wouldnt have developed if I had just bought the game at 1.0.Introversion have shown what a beautiful thing Early Access can be.

												Years ago, I worked in a prison... Northern nevada Correction Center and Warm Springs Correctional Center located in Carson City Nevada. That being said, a few games have come out over the years trying to emulate running a prison. Prison Tycoon 1 & 2 were the first that I tried. Both failed miserably. This game has a long way to go, but it is trying... improving... and actually comes close. Riots, gang wars, contraband, escapes and even a death row. Real rehabilitation, if there is such a thing. Not all inmates go back to prison whatever the reason.This game is evolving, getting better and feels real on some levels.A critical review should be just that, critical. So while I give this game a thumbs up, it is not perfect. It has bugs, Some new, some old, but many are recognized and others have been fixed. The developers are working to improve it both in game play and fixing that which is broken. I have not seen a game breaking bug.An active community of posted prisons and mods, the spread of ideas and again active developers have made this game more real than it's predicessors and a bit fun.My 1 suggestion is to add race tension. Race wars are alive and well in the US prisons. Segregation could be implemented as it is in many prisons. However, Gangs do add an interesting aspect that mimic this, but recruitment is rampant in prisons and should be added as well. Gun towers, a better way to implement sally ports (1 door can not open until the other closes, linking doors together in some way of added user defined rules) and so forth. How about a bit of staff corruption? All of this would make the game more real, challenging and fun.			"

												The Campaign (which also serves as the tutorial) opens with a prison that isn't quite finished yet. And you are told by your boss, the CEO of the ""For Profit"" Prison, that you have been given the task of executing a murderer. And this order comes from the state itself.The game then turns towards teaching you how to work the basic construction tools, explaining power, water, foundations, interior walls, and room basics in a straightforward and clean manner.Then the game shows you exactly why your prisoner is guilty.It is not a pleasant experience to watch as a tiny cartoon man walk into his home, find his tiny cartoon wife ♥♥♥♥ing a tiny cartoon stranger in his bed, and then tearfully shoot them both in the head.This gives us the biggest lesson of all: Prison Architect is not a happy game.Prison Architect is a top down management game where you run your prison company exactly how you want it. As far as the state is concerned, it doesn't matter how high your rehabilitation rate is, all that matters is that you have no escapes, keep the deaths to an acceptable low, and you keep the prisoners in line by any means you deem fit.Once you finish your campaign, which takes you through the systems of the game, explaining core concepts quite happily while also telling you tales of loss, pain, murder, ambition, hope, and sheer murderous rage. Of course, the problem is that the game ONLY explains the core mechanics and leaves more complicated ones for you to figure out yourself. That said, while there is a Wiki and many a guide for you, the point of the core game in sandbox mode is mostly to see what works best. To adapt to problems and overcome even of it must be done through trail, error and blood.The game provides security measures such as cameras, remote doors opened by a button or a timer, stab vests and tazers for your guards, and even heavily armed maximum force response teams kept on site with shotguns, full body armor, and the will and means to paint your prison red with blood at your command. Along with this the game will provide schedules, assignments, patrols, and even resticted acess zoning, all of which is designed to keep your prisoners under control so they do not kill each other.Along with this is provided many means to turn your prisoners into peaceful members of society if you so choose. You may provide basic education, as many prisoners lack even a child's reading and writing skills. And some of them cannot even read at all, let alone write. Give your prisoners trade skills as carpenters or metal workers. Teach them how to be cleaners or work a laundry. And then set up security systems to prevent prisoners stealing hammers or making crude knives.Prisoners may come with medical issues such as addiction, alchoholism or violent pshycological instability. Build a common room for AA meetings, an office for one on one meetings for professional mental help, an infirmary for chemical treatmeants to help with addiction and minor surgery when the prisoners try to kill, and a mourge when they do kill.Your prisoners are humans, with desires and needs, thoughts and feelings, and intelligence. Prisoners need to be fed, and you may give them things to do. Build a common room with tables, television sets, and phones. Provide meals at preset times, as many times as you want, in large quantaties and variety if you want, or a simple bowl of vegetable soup once a day if you don't. Prisoners with many things to do are less likey to cause trouble, and giving them these things may make them very happy indeed.This does not mean you may treat them like sane members of society. You are running a prison. They are prisoners. And Prisoners are not in the habit of obeying the rules. Prisoners steal, fight, and even kill in your walls. Make no mistake, you and your officers are the only order inside the prison. Without your constant watchful gaze and omnipresent guards the prisoners will fall upon each other like wild animals; killing, fighting, and breaking.If your prisoners are exceptionally angry, and if your prison is weak enough, the prisoners may decide that they can do whatever thy want and there is nothing you can do about it. They may decide to riot. Or you may subdue them, show them that any antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated, and make them docile through fear.Problems may arise in your prison, and of course these are optional. Make it so that he game throws problems your way at random. Maybe a highly contagious disease is rampaging through your prison and killing your prisoners. Perhaps a water main has burst. Maybe a generator has overloaded, causing a fire and a blackout. Or maybe the mayor has bowed to political pressure and decided to implement reform without consulting you.If you feel particularly brave, allow the game to generate gangs, and watch as your prison becomes split by three gangs into territories, and attempt to usurp your authority. And then spiral into gang wars, burn your prison down, kill your guards, and extort prisoners.Prison Architect, ultimately, is exactly what it says it is, with a remarkable and well made game that most will like.  BUt do not expect to laugh because of the cutesy graphics. They mitigate the horror, but only make it bearable.			"

												my greatest prisoner everHe comes one day with the other 4 prisoners i ordered, all max secI look at his stats and see hes a gang member with strong, quick, and very deadly attributes on him.At this point I had just finished my new cell block and say hey he should go there since i have lots of guards there.At this point hes just chilling normally when he breaks into sudden outburst killing a snitch with his bare hands in one hitGuards on on him, they have tazers and guns and batons, he stands no chance. He punches one in the face killing the guard and he goes on rampage now with a baton killing everyone in sight. All the guards that fought died. He is murdering the prisoners. He escapes to the death row room where i have built several protective walls. He breaks down 6 solitary doors to where he can get inside the 10/10 room with tv and such. He is in there and i send 3 armed guards to get him and put him downhe kills them and he tried to run out and gets tazed. I built a Fenced off area for people like him, The MAx Sec no way hes escaping no way he can even kill here. He is put there for his stay of now 400 years from all that murder. After while all the people who have killed more than 3 guards are put here with him. The Ape goes crazy and kills all 7 of his kind and is sent to solitary where he breaks out and kills 15 guards. He is unstoppable i think as he barrgaes to the prisons end to escape when out  of no where BAM a single shot is put into his as he goes downThe Ape is dead with now 1000+ years of murder Rip 911/420 would have pshyco prisoners again			"

Early Access Review
								I hope this game will one day leave early access and grace my account as a fully released game as it’s now been out over a year and feels very much complete. There aren’t many games under 150Mb these days that can give you as much entertainment as the likes of Prison Architect, and it really stands out amongst the ever growing crowd of top down, Theme Park types. Prison Architect flourishes with character and challenges the user with real choices in designing, running and planning a real prison environment. You truly do feel like god in this game and the real challenge comes from managing the character of the prisoners. Social anarchy amongst the prisoner is your biggest threat, but also the most amusing part of the game. You will forever be teetering on toppling your social structure and punishing prisoners for disobedience. It’s a fine line to walk and keeps you engaged & thrilled continually during your campaign. Only con’s so far is the steep learning curve and the price. Definitely a little over valued at RRP by about 30-40% but hopefully will reduce when it’s fully released so more people can enjoy the hell out of this game.  "

Early Access Review
								I absolutely love sandbox building games that aren't a cosmetic tea party.  This game has done nothing but amuse me as I've tried and failed to manage a prison properly probably a half dozen times now, but that's really the beauty of it. I could probably read a guide and get a lot of ""I win"" information, but games like these are just big ant farms slash chemisty sets where I like to be forced to evaluate my choices and try to balance a ton of factors into the plan. The best thing about this game is that everything is staged and nothing is instant. Your plan has to work from A to B and it's up to decide what you build or research next, but once you do you've sacrificed something and opened a hole somewhere. Eventually you have moments of stability where things seem to be going ok, but another wrench is thrown and the whole thing can spiral into chaos quickly.If you glanced at this and thought it would be a cheap imitation of something that should be labeled ""Tycoon"" and thrown in a bargin bin, then you are sorely mistaken. This is an OCD stress test of micromanagement, choice making and logistics. It feels like everything matters and sometimes it feels like  everything you do is 5 steps behind the thing you should have already been doing 10 steps ago. Of course you can pace the game at your choices and even play in full ""free"" mode where you have lots of money, but even still...you aren't inviting kittens into your Barbie Dream House that you are filling up full of cheap furniture. You are inviting murderers and thieves into a house full of other murderers and thieves and it's up to get a TON of variables to play nice with each other.  They are not stupid. They will revolt. They will try to escape. They will steal from the kitchen and try to stab people, etc etc.The scope to which this game has expanded is more than impressive and for a game that started off mentioning Dwarf Fortress as it's inspiration, it's created something even more unique that casts it's own shadow. Of course there have been other prison games, but this one has nailed so many concepts perfectly and given the track record for upgrades and patches, there will be more. I have found some bugs and the foundation system took me a while to really get my head around. I have to say the ""Planning Mode"" is something that every single builder type game needs to embrace right the eff now as well.This is a solid recommendation from me even in Early Access state. If you don't like to support that kind of thing, completely understandable. The devs are active and the game has had over 20 patches full of content and fixes just since I've bought it. I actually turned it on just to see how it was progressing and I'm sucked into it and hopeless trying to figure out how last more than 30 minutes without someone dying.  (I know I could read a guide or something but who the heck plays games like that?)			"

And as you watch your dying employees beg for a god or devil to save this from the horror you created, as you watch your life's work crumble before the sounds of gunfire and the screams of these lost souls.

TL:DR? See ConclusionNOTE: As an Early Access Review, this will be subjected to change and editing as newer updates are released.INTRODUCTION:Prison Architect is a 2D top down prison building and management simulation game made by Introversion Software being financed by crowd-funding, pre-orders and Steam Early Access. Since it's initial release on 2012, the game has undergone several major updates (an average of 4 weeks per update) and has raised nearly $10 Million in revenue.PLOT (No Spoiler):The player takes on the role of a Prison owner, architect and governor who's objective is to create a prison from an expandable open world map. The player may choose the purpose of their prison either focused on reforming criminals, severe draconian punishment, or a mix of the two. Build the prison from scratch, hire guards and officers, staff and maintenance crew to keep it functioning, dog patrols to keep watch and many more. There is no end to the game, the player just needs to keep building and keep expanding until they decide to sell their prison and build a new one, or, have it burned to the ground because of a riot and find yourself in prison (seriously, your character can go to jail if you're grossly negligent in its management, ironically, in the same prison you built).PROS:+ Great 2D Art Style+ Good Tutorial: Comprehensive and easy to understand+ Vast variety of Characters (Staff, Officers, Prisoners, Guards etc)+ Expanding World Map: (Buy the adjacent lot to expand)+ Detailed Micromanagement System (Prisoner Regime, Guard/Dog Patrols, lock downs etc.)+ Detailed Construction System (Buildings, water systems, electrical wiring, computer controls etc.)+ Easy to install and uninstall MODS (Steam Workshop)+ Monthly Updates from the devs+ Old Computer friendly+ High ReplayabilityCONS:- Severe Performance Drop when the prison becomes very large (in size, prisoner and staff)- Lacking in Soundtracks- Occasional path-finding problems- No main menu (minor annoyance and not a deal breaker)- No Steam Cloud Support- Prisoners are released Naked sometimesCONCLUSION:GREAT EARLY ACCESS GAME. Prison Architect is what all Early Access games should try to be; it has constant updates, great art style, solid core gameplay, stable & playable and most importantly, easy on the pocket even at full price.WORTH IT?:MUST TRY, whether the game is at full price or sale, it's worth every penny and I fully RECOMMEND it specially if your a City Building / Simulation fan. To be honest, the game is technically finished in my opinion (just need a bit more bug fixing and performance improvements) and has more features than some of the other fully released games I've seen.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

								Prison Architect is a mind-broadening experience, a game about building a prison, planning out cell blocks, balancing budgets, arranging schedules, maintaining peace, quelling unrest and thwarting escape attempts. It’s a not finished gaol-management sim that, despite still being under development, is currently available to purchase and play on Steam...and you should.Here’s how Prison Architect plays: you’re given a plot of land and a metric wodge of cash with which to build a prison. About a dozen men found guilty by a jury of their peers turn up once a day expecting the bare minimum of care afforded to them by the state. You can click on them to see their criminal records, but you have no direct control over their movements. Instead you plot out the foundations of buildings, which a team of workmen then construct, before designating functions to the rooms you’ve made. Hastily cobbled together holding cells will accommodate a few prisoners while you construct dozens of smaller individual cells. Showers must be hooked up to plumbing, cooks must be hired to work in kitchens, cafeterias must feed prisoners, guards must open and close locked doors in order to escort inmates, staff and visiting families to and from their destinations.A 24 hour clock ticks along, turning the day to night, with your prisoners adhering to a configurable schedule of sleeping, eating, yard time, work time and free time. The idea is to construct things in such as a way as to keep the largest number of inmates moving efficiently between their cells, showers, laundry rooms, workshops, yards and back to bed, all while keeping the system secure enough to detect smuggled contraband and deter escapees.Accountants and psychologists and security chiefs can all be hired and supplied with furnished offices to unlock new menu screens and information about your prison population. You can take on government grants, which offer you a cash advance in exchange for meeting certain criteria.Besides these grants, Prison Architect is a sandbox balancing act in which happy prisoners require costly amenities and unhappy prisoners will eventually riot, using contraband weapons such as screwdrivers stolen from workshops to stab up their fellow incarcerated. It’s a virtual delinquency ant farm in which you tread the line between your prisoners’ happiness and the prison’s efficiency and safety.et up metal detectors and order extensive searches of every cell and tensions will rise, but neglect to de-shiv your inmates in favour of a feel-good prison atmosphere and those happy prisoners will end up all stabbed to bits in a bodybag.Introversion are not shy about advertising Prison Architect’s in-progress state and their promise to you is that you are directly funding the ongoing development of the game with your purchase, in exchange for monthly updates and, eventually, a copy of the finished game.Prison Architect is a good game in its current state and pretty much the only early access game that hasn't disappointed so far.

												Prison architect is a prison simulator with a grid building system and an in depth prisoner needs system. Prison architect starts with the player immediately thrown into the game with hardy any tutorial. The real tutorial is the campaigns objectives. Once the player starts a game, they start with a small sum of money and must build a prison with the tools at their disposal. The player will build buildings for various rooms such as dormitories, cells, canteens, staff rooms, storage and other such necessities for the future prisoners and staff. The prisoners come in all shapes and sizes, as well as various security levels; minimum, medium and high security. These prisoners act like real prisoners, if there is a shortage of food, a heat wave, power outages, or even a death can cause a riot to break out. Prisoners can be kept happy by having visitation rooms, recreational rooms, time in the yard, or an increase in variety of food. Should a riot break out, riot police and firefighters are available to help put them back in line, and medical centres or morgues are available for the wounded or fatalities. Prison architect also has variety of options available when starting anew map, you can have weather as a factor, chose to have a large or small starting map, with our without trees, lakes or pre-existing buildings. Events are an interesting option, which can range from a power generator exploding, or a massive amount of prisoners arriving from another prison. Gangs can be turned on, which makes riots happen often, and if a gang leader is sent to your prison, the gangs can increase in size, and have wars over territory. Fog of war seems to be the most notorious of options. It prevents the player from seeing any prisoner unless a guard or camera is in the room, making it difficult, for the player to spot assaults or other such crimes. Overall prison architects objective is to rehabilitate prisoners through reform programs, such as school, culinary or workshop programs. These, if passed, provide the prisoner with valuable work skills reducing the chance of reoffending, boosting your prison grade. Prison architect does have a few things wrong with it.Some lag when laying wires or pipes on lower grade PCsLack of realism in the riots or fightingSlow to start for new players The ""campaign"" lacks real story or drive The names and descriptions of prisoners don't fit the actual crimesPrison architect does a lot right.Has a fantastic workshop Has relatively easy achievementsSatisfying gameHas a surprisingly fun escape modeArt and sound design are solidGood animations Fantastic in-depth needs system  Is prison architect worth the $32.99CAD? If you enjoy city builder type games, pick it up. Honestly if it goes on sale everyone should get it for their collection			"

												I would recommend this game since I really like the concept and it's fascinating to see your prison run itself. It gives a bit of a Settlers vibe. However as they consider this game finished (It's not early access anymore), demand 28€ for it and announced the next update to be the last big one I cannot give it a recommendation.It just isn't done yet, and if you play for longer, the unfinished, unrefined and outright frustrating parts - none of which will be fixed by the update - will hit you in the face like a train. I'll list a few of those:- The temperature system is a complete afterthought and not done well at all. You can only lower temperature by having windows, and raise it with radiators. If your kitchen isn't adjacent to an outside wall, it will overheat constantly, and windows are always open, leading to your prisoners freezing in the winter. Radiators also can't be turned off in the summer. AC? Never heard of it.- The game rewards badly managed prisons over well managed ones. Prisoner deaths are not punished directly, technically they're even rewarded because they make room for new prisoners. Even if you have failure conditions activated, the chance of feeling actual punishment is low. What is punished are ""incidents"", which even a well run prison can barely avoid, especially with gangs activated. I can only say that I tried both, and the prison where I stuffed 300+ prisoners into a 120m² holding cell certainly rolled in dosh.- The calculations for dormitories have been broken forever. A dormitory with 3 inhabitants and 1 TV doesn't count as ""1 TV per 4 prisoners"". You have to have at least, I think, 5 prisoners in a dormitory for the calculations to hold up, which of course increases the chances of the inmates shanking each other.- Click, click, click, click. This game requires so much ♥♥♥♥ing clicking. The scroll speed is brutally slow so you have to click and drag with the middle mouse button to get around. And the developers apparently never heard of hotkeys, because you have to click to do absolutely anything. There are thousands of management and economy games that did it better. This game will murder your carpal tunnel.- Prisoner behaviour is disappointingly primitive. You'd think putting the power generator somewhere isolated and under guard makes sense because prisoners will try to sabotage it - they don't. You'd think they try to sneak into the storage room to steal some tools - they don't. I once tried a huge prison full of security flaws - the armory right next to the canteen with no walls in between, power generators out in the open... nothing happened. Not a single prisoner stole a weapon, or did anything else but get into minor fisticuffs with the guards.- Room assignment is painfully broken. Basically, whenever you add a room somewhere, the game sees it as ""reassign EVERYTHING to Shared"" and then suddenly you have max security prisoners in your min security block, cells in unfinished wings being occupied and prisoners strolling around the outskirts of your prison. This is obviously a hyperbole but seriously, you will suffer at least half a dozen escapes from this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.- Deliveries will mess you up. More specifically, mail deliveries. If your prisoners can't keep up sorting the mail, it will at some point just overflow your delivery area. And what does the delivery driver do if there's no more room for his mail? Why of course, he will just stay there and block the road for everything else - like food deliveries or prisoner buses. Solution for this? Click on a mail bag, click dump. Click on a mail bag, click dump...- The prisoner intake is convoluted and counterintuitive as hell. Something extremely simple like ""Give me 1 delivery of X medium security and Y maximum security prisoners"" can't be done. Instead there are ""Fill to X"" and ""X per day"" settings where the security level is determined in percentages. This has lead to me forgetting to close my prison and ending up with way too many prisoners so often I lost count.- The way patrols work is frustratingly idiotic. When finished with its shift, a guard will simply leave its post without waiting for its replacement, leaving your prisoners unguarded.- Maximum security doors can be destroyed. Fences can't. Your prisoners will outright give up any escape attempts if there's a fence surrounding your perimeter.- The game barely explains anything. I once tried to dismantle an object in a common room - the button just didn't do anything. Only later I found out that this room was occupied by a gang.- There's no borderless windowed mode.- And last but not least, the game - or at least the campaign - implies that you have a choice between running a prison based on fear and one based on making the inmates happy. This dualism may make sense IRL but in this game, it doesn't. If you have a prisoner with a certain set of traits, it becomes outright impossible to contain him. In real life, you'd put someone with 300 murders in his portfolio into a small room with no window and a massive steel door, but in this game, someone can destroy such a door with a single punch of his bare fists, then resist several tazer and shotgun hits and take out half a dozen guards. Then get healed up and do it again and again and again. The only way to avoid this is by making this demigod of a man happy, which in turn means that your SuperMax wing becomes the SuperLuxury wing. If this isn't counterintuitive to you, I don't know what is.			"

Early Access Review
								Ever watch TV shows like Oz, Prison Break or Orange is the New Black and want to run your own prison? Now is your chance! Prison Architect is a simple, fun, top down, real time strategy, management, building game with a lot of depth yet it is so easy to pick up and play. While it is still 'Early access,' it feels complete and polished.Prison Architect is not like the Sims. You are just building a prison. Everything is not instantly done when you place it. You have workers that take time to go through your prison to carry out what you want. Not just that, but the trucks with the items need to arrive. It is a really nice system and the workers are fast and efficient enough to quickly carry out things. Your workers can die and if things aren't getting done quick enough, hire more workers. Every staff costs X amount to hire them, and Y amount to keep them employed every day. You have funds and a daily budget. Your daily budget cannot be in the red, that becomes the limitation and challenge of the game.Since this is a prison, every 24 hours new inmates arrive. You need to get ready for them. So you build walls, a holding cell, dozens of private cells, a shower, a yard, a kitchen and a canteen. Then you hire staff and place objects into each room to make them functional. Objects such as beds, benches, tables, kitchen cookers, freezers, a wide sofa for your staff room, desks for your offices and of course a variety of doors. Jail doors, large jail doors, staff doors, solitary confinement doors. These are all objects. Only guards can open jail doors so if one of your worker / laborers needs to get through they need to wait for a guard to let them through.When you start a game, you can select different things to make your game different, such as having randomly generated empty rooms and landscape. You can select whether or not to have 8 normal prisoners per day or a random number of maximum, minimum or normal security prisoners. This adds a lot of variety to each time you start a new game.The game lets you do whatever you want, but as a guide, it gives you optional objectives. You can only do 2 objectives at once. That's the beauty of this game, you pick the objectives whenever you want at any time. You're not pigeon holed into a scenario. When you select an objective you will receive a money grant to carry out the objective. There is no time limit. There is just a money limit. Run out of money doing a project and you'll be stuck waiting until your funds build back up. For the most part you are given more than enough money and once you're done with the objective you get the other half of the money. The objectives have a list of mini objectives that benefit and grow your prison. Everything to build a cell block that can hold 15 prisoners to all the steps needed to have a functional medical ward, which involve offices, doctors, an intermarry and a psychiatrist that need to be unlocked in bureaucracy.Once you hire a warden, he will open up bureaucracy, which is the game's version of unlocks. You can unlock a slew of new personnel such as a security chief that can unlock cameras, an armory and other things. You can even unlock an accountant that leads to land purchases for when you outgrow your plot of land. These are all nice touches that really let the game feel like your own.Since you are an architect, you need to lay out pipes and wires. Not just that, but you need to place water pumps, generators and conduits. Every room needs to have wires to it, big items such as freezers and monitors need wires directly to them. If you use too much power for your generator and conduits, it'll result in a power outage and then chaos happens. When it comes to toilets and showers, you have small pipes and large pipes, small pipes lose pressure the further they go, so you need to have large pipes, but the catch is inmates can use large pipes to crawl in and escape. So never have large pipes near inmates. There are other ways inmates can escape, such as tunneling, walking out if they break a door lock and go over an unattended wall.The game has emergency services so if you get uncontrollable riots, you can send in an emergency swat team and tell them where to go. If you have a fire, then call for the fire department and you'll see their hoses strung through your prison. EMTs can also be called in, but for the most part your medical ward / infirmary should handle things.You have a lot of control over the prisoners including their schedule, how much free time they have, when the have it, when they eat and when they shower. It is helpful for big prisons that have small facilities, you can have the minimum security prisoners eat when the maximums are showering and when the normal prisoners are in the yard. You can unlock restricting certain levels of prisoners to certain areas. On top of that you can even sell and buy stock from your prison.There is also a lot of unintentional comedy such as a K9 patrol using a broken toilet, workers getting cemented into walls, inmates killing guards with spoons, and of course the names of inmates and why they're in prison. On top of that there are mods and prison downloads, the game is really about having your fun the way you want to have it.In all the game is probably worth $30 and I rarely say that, but its been on sale plenty of times. You can sink a lot of time into the game and enjoy every second of it.			"

												I was hesitant to buy this game  at first as I was worried this game would be too complex for me, I could see that there is a lot to learn. A bit confusing at first with a steep learning curve. I reccomend playing through the story campaign mode which is also a tutorial. Playing through that helped me alot and enabled me to understand how to build my own prison and what is needed to keep it viable and running.This game is deep and well thought out.  Though it's a bit complex at first, prisons need to be planned carefully. There are too many bland, boring and lacking simulations. Fortunately this game is not one of them, it will keep you playing for many hours.I never get sick of building things and can always come back to this game when Iam not sure what else to play. I have played for over 200 hours at the time of writing this review and have not had any trouble with bugs or any crashing.I don't satisfy all prisoner needs as I like drama and having my prisoners riot regularly is fun.Otherwise it's boring if they behave and don't do anything wrong.So far I have sold 2 prisons and am building my third prison as it costs quite alot to build the prison you want. Though you can opt for unlimited funds, I built however I wanted, but my bank balance ended up being -2.5million in the red. Didn't like it, my prison felt worthless. You should first start out with getting all the grants you can, build along with what the grants require  and then sell when you run out of grants. Though what brings profit to a prison is workshops and a forestry.My second prison was a female prison and I did not like having a female prison as you get mothers who bring their babies with them and they need a much larger family cell as well as a seperate nursery area for them to eat with their baby, plus they have different needs than males, seem to have hygeine first, males exercise and aren't as violent as males.After 200 hours I ended up with a 1000+ prison valued at over 9million with 6million in funds without using any cheats.Escape mode seems like a tacked on after thought, not very exciting, quite boring. As the prisoner, you just damage things to get heaps of rep points, use points to skip punishment and repeat until you max out skills, it's rather quick to do. Then one hit punch kill guards and escape out the front door. I escaped when there was a riot happening, even though I was carrying keys, guards just ignored me as were busy trying to handle the riot and I just ran past them all and out the front door, when I ran out I had 3 groups of riot police chasing me, but the quick skill was maxed so managed to sprint and escape.Even though I like the game there are things that could be improved, but unfortunately looks like the developers are finished with the game, which is sad.Things aren't categorised well enough, objects in a object menu are a mess and can be hard to find unless you type out the name first, difficult for new players that may not be sure what they are looking for.I dislike that things aren't explained very well in this game, I was not sure how many cookers I would need or how many clothes a laundry provides, I had to look it up on a wiki to find out. That info should be in game, at least have it as a tooltip when you mouseover the object.But overall I recommend this game as I enjoy it mostly.Get this game if you love building, simulations and micro management.7/10			"

""I KNEW I'D CATCH YOU TWO HERE""Build and manage a maximum security prison. That's what Store Page says. But it's not said that it's such a fun! I don't even know. I'll be honest with you and you can help me. Is there actually any deep building simulation like this? I didn't play a lot games like these, so this one is really absolutely awesome. And I believe it's objective not subjective.I consider Story Mode more like a tutorial or some in-depth preparation for your sandbox rampage and getting you ready to be biggest prison manager that ever lived. Whole story is not important addition and it's there more just for the sake of being not having any relevant weight. However, it's well-made and over each missions it will really prepare you. Some of optional objectives are pretty rough for beginners. Escape mode will give you opposite insight how prisoners live at the place you're able to build. There is just ton of ways how to escape and it really gives me feeling of real prisoner. Nearly close to Prison Break. Game supports Steam Workshop which will give you really lot of ideas, inspirations or just new ways how to play Prison Architect. Steam Achievements are well-choosen, they didn't have need of stacking 300 of them while 150 of them being totally useless. They selected few and every of them is important part of the game so. Kudos for that.Now, the building itself is really entertaining, deep and genius. You have to think about everything. Security, food distribution, clean laundry, electricity and water, deployment of units, patrols, checking cameras, taking care of your prisoners and in general it's logical. And brilliant. Game will last you easily above 20/30 hours. Well, it all depends on how long you will be entertained by building the prison, or if you want the Workshop maps or getting all achievements. For me best game Introversion Software made so far. Great job guys. Bonus Point: D.B. CooperRating: 8.5/10 "

												I don't think anyone wakes up in the morning and goes ""I want to build a prison today."" Penitentiaries just don't have the same feel-good appeal as cultivating a city or a business, really. I think the developers behind Prison Architect had this in mind the whole way through development, because it never really dwells on the darker elements of incarceration. What it does do is give you a wealth of building options, so many that you won't even have time to question the ethics of your creations.Prison Architect drops you off on a flat piece of land with a road running through it, and expects you to build a house of corrections. You're given an initial grant of money and some builders, and from that humble beginning you build cells, showers, kitchens, offices, power plants, laundry rooms, exercise yards, chapels, armories, morgues, classrooms... Honestly I don't have enough space to list out all the facilities you can place. The big selling point behind PA that will become immediately obvious is that you can build EVERYTHING. No detail is spared in how the prison is simulated, and every phone booth and ironing board must be accounted for.This incredible level of detail extends to your prisoners and the handling of them, as well. Each of your little ne'er-do-wells has a detailed rap sheet and biography, specific incarceration needs including security level, moods and interests, and a laundry list of stats that can be tracked. Of course, you can't just throw such complex sims in a hole and call it a day (okay you can but it won't end well). Your prisoners have a schedule to stick to that includes eating, showering, working, playing, and sleeping. You can edit this schedule to your heart's content, even setting different schedules for different security levels.There's still a boatload of systems I haven't even touched on like advanced security and visitation and work programs and research, but surely you get the point by now. Understand that while all this may sound daunting, Prison Architect handles it in a very gentle way. Early on, prisons don't need hardly any of the complex amenities, giving you time to unlock and familiarize yourself with them. You also have a huge list of options for customizing your difficulty, allowing you to even disable certain systems if you feel they make the game too complex. It's a consideration that more in-depth sims should adopt, because it means casual players and experienced managers can all find a pace they enjoy.It's rare to find such a deep and detailed simulation that also allows you to dive just as far as you want, and at your own pace. You can tool along with a mostly functional prison just with the basic food and shelter services, explore additional systems at your pace, or go whole-hog in an attempt to build the perfect penitentiary. The 2D vector graphics might not be the most attractive but their simple lines and animations help keep the detailed interactions of your prison clear. Sound design is admittedly minimal, but it's not much of a drawback when there's so much more offered. No matter your skill or interest level, Prison Architect will find a way to capture your attention.			"

												I have been playing this game since way back in the early access days and I am still as in love with it as I was back then.  It's  a game that can draw you in and hours pass by without you realizing it.  If you like games where you build and micromanage things, I believe you will love Prison Architect.  You build a prison that hopefully reforms the inmates while trying to fulfill their needs and keep the peace.  Gangs and events really help keep the architect on their toes.  In a blink of an eye chaos can and most likely will ensue.  Keep your eye out for legendary prisoners, they really make things interesting.  If having gangs and events are not your thing you don't have to use them.  You can just not select those things when you are setting up your new save.  I love how the devs gave us plenty of options and everything is not mandatory.   "

								Way better than it appears on the surface. I was pre-disposed with the graphics making the prisoners look less realistic than LEGO toys, but once you start to play, it becomes a non-issue. Designing a prison which almost runs itself is very satisfying, especially when trouble happens but your design means even minor issues are handled automatically. Sometimes big troubles may come and the most interesting part of this game is trying to find a solution to these troubles. You may finally have to re-design the whole area to find a reasonable solution. The weakness of this game is also very obvious. Some small bugs may be annoying but the biggest problem is the game becomes repeptitive after you'd setup a prison with all the features after a few days, which is also a common problem in most simulation games. A lucky thing is this game is still in the Alpha test. So users will get free updates including new features automatically, which could have become a paid DLC separated from the original game after the complete version is released just like what most fcvking EA games do.

												Early Access done right. One of very few examples of such a phenomenon. From the communications the devs had with the community through both written and video updates, to the constant patching of the game which added significant changes and additions at an incredibly effective pace.Truly, this game deserves your attention even if you're not interested in its gameplay mechanics or ideas. Simply because we ought to support this kind of transparent, respectful and talented videogame development. We need to show the rest of the industry that hard work and good communication is in the end rewarded.Oh yeah, and the game itself is of course really good. It's like a more complex and more free-form version of Theme Hospital, chock full of intentional and unintentional humor. It's virtually replayable ad infinitum due to the smart integration of really complex systems and mechanics that are still simple enough to get a basic grasp on quickly. And then you add the solid Steam Workshop integration that's already been out for months and months, molding into a vast web of minor tweaks and major total convention mods to further extend your playtime. Like the mod that lets you take control of a prisoner, and use the game's own mechanics to try and break out of your own (or someone else's) prison! How genius is that?!You could pay all the salary you're ever going to earn in your entire life, and you'd STILL be able to get a whole lot of bang for your buck with Prison Architect. And I'm not even sure if that's an exaggeration.16 shivs out of 10.			"

												I've played this game since before it was on Steam, and let me tell you, it was 100% worth the price back in 2013, and even more worth it now. This game gives you lots of freedom; you can follow the campaign, go sandbox and do your thing, or even be one of the prisoners trying to escape. Plus, Prison Architect is just layer on layer of depth, with systems overlapping and mechanics interwining so well that it almost feels real.In short, there's no way I can't recommend this game... it's just too good.

												I would really love to recommend this game, but as it stands I simply can't do it for the full price. If you're able to find it on a good sale, go for it.The reason I can't recommend it is that I honestly believe that the devepeloper is moving on from this game far too soon. The recently released 2.0 is (in their own words) the last feature update, and the game will only receive bug-fixes from now on. I bought this game back when it was in early access because I saw a lot of potential in it, but sadly a lot of that potential will seemingly go unfulfilled. Guard assignments are a mess. Sure, they work, but the interface for it is awful and make setting up your guards needlessly tedious. The hourly schedule is one of the least intuitive implementations I can think of. The patrol routes apply to all guards, including dogs - so you can't have a dog patrol crossing a route that was meant for regular guards if you wanted to. You can get around that of course, but you shouldn't have to.You can't assign areas yourself. Areas are assigned when they're blocked off (like by doors). That means that if you're trying to make a fairly open prison you still have to put down doors to make these blocks. You have to do that because canteens and laundries supply these blocks, and if it's all one big block everything will go everywhere, which is obviously not very efficient. The gang system still seems very raw. It adds a challenge which is nice, but a lot of the mechanics seem very opaque. Non of the members will participate in any reform-programs (not even ones that aren't work related - such as spiritual guidance) and there doesn't seem to be any way that a gang member will ever leave a gang. Gangs can plan activities, such as planning a takeover of a yard, right in the middle of a bunch of guards, but there's no way of splitting them up or trying to prevent it from happening (you can prevent the actual takeover by having enough guards at the targeted location). Another curious (or lazy) mechanic is that gang members immediately know if their leader is being punished, even if the leader is in a different sector (or even another security level) with no gang members nearby.All policies are prison-wide. You can't have different policies for minimum and super-max prisoners. You can't feed them differently either. That means that if you choose to put gang leaders in super-max because you don't want them to interact with their members, you can't specify that they should never be put in solitary or lockdown (to prevent their members being mad when it happens, as mentioned above). This also means that you can't ask your armed guards in max-security to free-fire without armed guards doing it everywhere else too. The reform-program-page is lacking information. It shows number of prisoners in queue for a program, but it doesn't show which security levels they are. Once you get a big prison with a lot of programs running it also becomes a very long list to scroll, and a simple feature like minimizing a certain category doesn't exist.Power stations have limited power, and for whatever reason they can't be connected to each other. Again this makes for a needlessly tedious setup. Water pumps can supply unlimited water though.You can only hire one foreman. The foreman runs the workshop classes, so if you want to have multiple workshop classes (in different security levels for example) you either have to offset their work time or edit the savefile to hire more foremen. I have no idea why this limitation is there - it doesn't serve any purpose.The workmen aren't very bright. If you build (or dismantle for that matter) a long line of piping or electric cables each part seems to be assigned to seperate workmen, which means a lot of running for a lot of people. This will often slow down construction (especially as your prison, and by that the distances, grow), because a workman runs from delivery or storage to installation point and back again. Even if the material to carry out the order is right there he will run past it and let another guy run the same distance to do the job.Last, but not least, the game doesn't have a main menu when you start the game. No, I'm not kidding. Every time you start the game it just loads into an empty lot waiting for a prison to be built on it.Most of these things aren't really major, and the game works fine despite them. They are not things I would expect from a finished €28 game though. It was fine when it was in early access, and I honestly still didn't mind them that much when the game went out of early access. But I do mind that the developer now considers the game fully complete when I think there's a lot of features that point to the opposite. I don't regret buying it when it was on sale in early access, but I would regret buying it for the full price.Edit: I forgot to mention the complete lack of feedback messages when you can't do something. If a gang has taken over a yard, you can't build there. Unless you actually know in advance how gangs work, you won't know why. You just won't be allowed to build there. When trying to schedule a reform-program, sometimes you simply won't be able to because of lack of rooms or lack of personel to take care of the class. Again, there's no error message here telling you the problem - clicking the button to start the program simply won't do anything at all, and it's now your job to figure out why the game won't let you.

"" Inspired by Dungeon Keeper, Dwarf Fortress and Theme Hospital and with over 1 million players having spent time inside, Prison Architect is the world’s best lock-­em-­up. ""Prison Architect is a sandbox game where you're building and managing your own Maximum Security Prison. That's the whole point of the game, actually.PROS  Build your own Prison - Is it gonna be male, female specific? Strict Punishing or completely peaceful prison? Up to you!  Endless Replayability - Get creative! With lots of features implemented in that game, you can create hundreds of different prisons. No matter how ridiculous they look!  Story Mode - A Huge in-game tutorial where you meet yourself with various objectives. From building the rooms, to choking the riots. You will be facing with the emotional cutscenes at some time, too.  Simulation - Your prisoners can be either happy, supressed, addictive (to common additions), or even suicidal depending on your Policy, Regime and many other actions.  Escape Mode - An intense gamemode if the prison meets the criterias of High Security. Have you got what it takes to escape your own prison?  Workshop - Try out other player's creations. Not just prisons, by the way!  Name In Game [DLC] - With additional content, you could, for example, add your family members, friends, or even your enemies in your prison,CONS  Lots of Minor, yet noticable Bugs - During it's 2 year Early Access, the Prison Architect was in unstable shape. Even out of the beta state, the game still has some major bugs to fix.  The Collectibles - It's not a major thing, but the game features the collection of Polaroids and Bible Pages that are somewhat rare thing to find. It can become stressful for Collectors to find every single rare piece of Bible Page.I, honestly, never thought that I would find this sandbox game that entertaining.Recommending this game to anyone! Even with low creativity.			"

												Prison Architect is a fun, interesting, and unique Zoo Tycoon-esque game that is (currently) in it's alpha stage. If you are familiar with any tycoon games, the formula is very similar. Build a prison and it's facilities, get prisoners, micro manage everything, rinse, wash and repeat. That being said though Prison Architect, like many games of it's genre, never gets old. It is always fun to experiment with new designs and features (which are constantly being implimented) and to see how your prisoners react to them. Not to mention, the game is incredibly polished for an alpha. I would reccomend this even if the current build was the full game. So if you're looking for a game which you can consitantly come back to, Prison Architect deserves your time and attention.			"

Early Access Review
								2014-12-16Early access done right - Prison Architect is an early access game that is actually updating and has a team supporting it. There are consistent updates that actually add major features and improve the game, and this has been going on for a long time already. As it is an alpha, there are some bugs, which are actually being fixed. But aside from that, on to the game itself.Players in Prison Architect are set to manage a prison, which as the name implies they get to design themselves. Once the facility is constructed, in part or completely - Your choice, the player can allow in prisoners and manage day to day operation. Arrange for the prisoner's schedules for when they work, eat, sleep and so on. But keep in mind, the prisoners don't want to stay in prison. Some may not try it unless you just plain allow them to walk out the front gate, but others are more active about their attempts to escape or make life suck less. They arrange for tools and drugs to be thrown in over your outer walls, they take knives from the kitchen if they can get to them, and they'll try to dig tunnels to get out.Special attention is to be paid to the possibility of a riot. Prisoners can decide to start taking over, they can raid the armoury, knock down guards to take their stuff, or kill eachother. They aren't friendly people, most of the time.And you need to make sure they don't fall right back into their criminal habits after they're released.Teach them carpentry, send them to a basic education, treat their addictions...And make sure they don't think of your prison as a comfy hotel, it's not a vacation for them, it's a punishment. Time for the sentences appears to pass at a rate of one year per ingame day, and while this may not sound like it will have prisoners last long enough to do anything, many of them are in for 20 or more years, and some may show up with part of their sentence already done.Your income, as money does not grow on trees, comes from a few sources. A basic daily income, plus an income per prisoner, and income from the workshop. When you're teaching these prisoners a skill, you may as well profit from it, but of course, not all of them are bright enough to be able to learn workshop safety classes.I have mentioned money does not grow on trees, but that was only partially correct. The trees are money, as the wood is cut into boards and sold, or taken to the advanced carpentry stations for prisoners to create furniture out of. While probably not intentional, you can play Logging Station Architect instead. You just never take any prisoners and just plant trees to sell the logs. It's a slow way of earning money, and it is not anywhere near as fast or satisfying as running a prison, but the option is there. You can also sell off a prison you already made and use the money to start a new one, which allows you to continue playing the sold prison as well, though you can only sell it once.The graphics may take some getting used to, but they fit the game and make things easy enough to see what is going on and where things are. The graphics aren't bad, but they aren't shiny 3d models as most games use these days. In the end, Prison Architect is a great management/prison simulation game with great support by a great developper, and I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in management or simulation style games			"

												So, I built my prison, and decided to try out escape mode. I had an idea of what it was about, so I had a strategy planned out. I'd use my starting character to tunnel out (staying in medium security while doing so), and using tougher prisoners to do all my dirty work, like bringing tunneling materials to my cell. They'd go up to maximum security, which I would use to get more points to recruit more people, to bring more tunnelling tools. So I'm sat there, a guy called Cliefe, with basically no punishments. However, I recruit someone with the surname ""Redman"". He's a skinny guy, red hair, bumped up to maximum security. I then decided to try and use Redman to fight guards. At this point, Redman has been upgraded pretty highly. He can one-shot people, shrug off being tazed, and start riots. Redman breaks into the psychologist's office. He steals a lighter. Redman begins to burn the Common room to the ground. He kills every guard. The common room is burning to the ground, the fire has spread to other rooms. Half the prison is on fire, Redman has started a riot. Redman is unstoppable. Redman is carrying the team on his shoulders while Cliefe sits doing nothing in medium security. Redman has seen hell, and he doesn't want to stay. Redman stands while the prison burns to the ground - he's burning to death. But if he dies, he dies a maytr, a figurehead of a greater cause that is escaping prison. He sprints. The walls have burnt down. Redman is an unstoppable wild beast. The snipers have their sights trained on him, but Redman is too fast - he escapes. The prison that I worked hard on, spent hours on, poured huge amounts of effort into running has been totally destroyed, alongside nearly all the guards, prisoners, and staff that worked there. 10/10			"

												I've been in prisons (worked, not a resident) and let me tell you, they're no fun. It's not just the company, it's the smell. The smell of body odor. It's always there. It never goes away. It creeps into your hair, your clothes, the concrete. Even the food starts to taste like body odor.And someone is going to make a game of building a prison? This is an  idiotic idea. It can't possibly be any good.Yet somehow, it works. It is good. I've spent many hours planning and building my little lovely facilities to keep some virtual peeps In Her Majesty's Service. It's great fun designing and executing a plan while ensuring the little delinquents are fed and happy (well, as happy as they can be). It's even more fun to then take away their toys and watch them become miserable lunatics while painting the walls crimson. Look, the game is simply one of the best builders you can find out there. It's wonderfully executed and it's wonderful to execute someone. 10/10, would do slave labor again.			"

								From the makers of Darwania and multawania series comes a game about creating a prison for inmates, your goal is to create the daily schedule for thier life, start by building a prison from ground up, stop prison riots, and plan out the execution dates, also see why they are in prison. So much is being added while this game is being worked on. Many things aren't working at the moment but create your ultimate prison sandbox until you got a full security prison running. I really enjoyed this game and I also backed it up, You can find my character IN THE GAME too ;)+Fun prison creation sandbox gameplay+Create your prison ground up, plan the schedules, plan the guards, stop the riots, executions.+Not at all hard to learn to play, very nicely explained tutorial.+PRISON RIOTS beat them down!- Game is not complete at the moment, so this - will change in due time- Bugs are being worked on, its still early access- Need more tracks to listent o.

												This is truly the best prison sim i have ever played.There are other PS's on the market but none come close to Prison Architect.One of the main things i hated about prison tycoon was the micro managment, Setting sceduals for each prisoner as they come in... Segragating gangs And if you have 200+ inmates it can be anoying as hell.But PA really nailed it, Just the right amount of micro managing, The GFX and anamations are kinda week when compairing to newer title games but i love it.And even tho we are out of alpha regular updates are still coming out.New fetures, Content and a grupe of ppl that really have made a wonderfull game.If you got the cash, Buy it!Ill admit i pirated it at first.. Back in like alpha 14, But after some time i started feeling guilty that i had this amazing game but wasnt supporting the dev's.. So i had to buy it.I still pirat games and movies and dont care, But prison architect is just that good that i do care.Thank guys you made a really great game here!!			"

Early Access Review
								Prison Architect is still in alpha - but you really wouldn't know it.  The game is as feature-rich as a complete product (moreso, if anything) and there are no game-breaking bugs. So, what is it?Prison Architect is a nod back to the micro-management games of old (I'm avoiding the word 'tycoon' because that has become a hackneyed term to mean simplified 'make lots of money' cartoon game).  It's pure sandbox so don't let the first 'mission' put you off.  It did me (I didn't find it interesting) and didn't then play the game for a year or more, but that first mission is pure tutorial just to show you how the very simple tools work.  You are then left on your own with a blank canvas and all the tools you'll need for designing your own prison.How complicated is it?It's not at all - but it can be if you want it to be.  It's genius in design for that.  You can be in the game and designing your own prison very quickly indeed without needing to be bogged down in all the minutiae of prisoner and roster management, but the beauty of the game is that, if you WANT that level of micro-management, you can.  You can set individual punishments and such for prisoners, but you don't have to.  You can schedule different daily timetables for each level of security prisoner so there are no clashes and inevitable riots, but you don't have to.  You can individually manage reform program scheduling, but you don't have to.  You get the idea.  The game automates all these things by default, but allows you to override them if/when you want to.Of course, getting a prison off the ground AND making money is that usual tycoon balancing act.  You have to start building foundations, but you can't go too large too soon otherwise you will be bankrupt overnight (and game over).  You can't expand one area too quickly (e.g. cells) unless you have the infrastructure in place to support them (bigger canteens, showers, and more utilities).  And not everything is available to you right away: you unlock  specialist staff and services as you go, providing a feeling of achievement on top of the creative aspect of the game.  The fun is in finding that balance and making your very own Alcatraz (or Reform Centre if you feel like being a benevolent architect).  The game scores you on the overall effectiveness of your prison (determined by how many riots and escapes you've had versus reformed and released prisoners unlikely to reoffend).It's a PRISON game - how is that even fun?!Oh, but it is!  If you like designing and tweaking 'something', then this is your game.  Maybe you played Rollercoaster Tycoon, or Transport Tycoon, or even Simcity or Theme Hospital.  Bear in mind that it's pure sandbox (right now at least; I vaguely recall reading that missions might be added later but don't take my word for it).  You have a planning tool that will allow you to freeform-design your layout without committing any money, then build on top of your design after.  The fun is in creating a layout you want, and balancing it to make it work well (no good sticking a dining hall at the other end of the map if prisoners cannot reach it in their allotted mealtime slot).About that 'alpha' thing...Yeah, it's not even beta, but don't be fooled.  This is in a better state than any other beta game I've tried.  There are elements still to be finished (the execution chamber does nothing I believe, despite its appearance in the tutorial mission, and some things don't seem to have much effect on environment yet), but Introversion have been updating the game very regularly over two years.  I joined the alpha at its earliest stage and still the updates come.  Even if they didn't, this is a complete and playable game exactly as it is right now, and I have close to 160 hours recorded in the Steam version alone.Mod supportThe game has an incredibly open mod support scheme and there are plenty of popular mods in the Steam Workshop right now.  I've tried the Women's Prison mod and it is easy to activate or deactivate each mod in the game.  An excellent design.  Of course, with the game changing periodically there is no guarantee that mods will continue to work for each iteration, but their easy removal means no worries.In summaryPrison Architect is a game that most certainly doesn't feel like an alpha (or even beta).  Get past the somewhat awkward-feeling introductory mission and you have all the tools needed to design your own prison.  It's a micro-management sandbox simulator that's easy to get into, fun, and will inevitably sink far too many hours of your time!  Highly recommended, and a great example of crowd-funding at its absolute best.			"

								I love tycoon/building games, like Sim City, rollercoaster tycoon, etc. This game doesn't disappoint. In fact in some ways it's better.PA offers you the fun of building something, i.e. a prison, but with the details of running it as well, which you don't get with every game. You get to decide a lot more then some broad overviews of the world. You can deicde how everything works, when it works, cut cost, spend more, care for the prisoners — or don't it's up to you.The game does have some issues, such as on MAC I don't see any of the proper icons/graphics when I play the game outside of SAFE mode. It loads into your save fast and then fromt here your fine. Occasionally something breaks in the game and the devs are fast to respond and deploy a fix or include it in the next update.Personally this game could be released now, however I understand and don't want people to buy the game and it have some bugs and think that it was hald-♥♥♥♥♥ because of a a few minor problems.EDIT (3/13/2015): As the game has develoepd the features of the game have only gotten better, and more detailed. The Devs. tend to be pretty good about helping players fix any problems, even if it's a ""Yes we know about it, and are working on it."" kind of response, and I've found that means it's either coming in the next patch or major update. There is also the constant addition and tweaking of the minor details one might want. Liek the ability to tell prisoners they can use this Yard area only, and not this one. To deploy gaurds, or to now add a library/chapel to your prison.			"

Early Access Review
								This Review is written at the time of Alpha 15Did you ever want to build a prison? Taking care of locking the scum of society away and setting them on the electric chair? *  Well then Prison Architect is the game for you. But the first few hours you play Prison Architect, you will be overwhelmed by it’s options and features. It has a very steep learning curve and currently no real tutorial that explains how every mechanic works. You are playing an Alpha. Prison Architect is exactly what you want it to be. Do you want to build a prison, where no one will ever break out of? Fine.Do you want to make your prisoners so angry that they will start a riot and flee once they get a chance? You can do that, too.Your prison is divided into different rooms. Each serves a special purpose. A cell to lock a prisoner away, a kitchen to cook food, and many more. It is your job to plan a layout and build those rooms, while managing your money and the needs of your prisoners. Those needs range from very easy to satisfy ones, like hygiene to ones that require special rooms to satisfy like clothing. Keeping up with the needs of your prisoners is the most important thing in a good prison, if you fail to do so you prisoners will eventually start a riot and injure or kill your staff.Once you have run out of land to build on, you can either expand the land you own and your prison, or you can sell your current prison and start a new one with the value of your last prison added as bonus cash. Steam Workshop integration. It is very easy to share your prison with the rest of Steam. Two clicks and you have either shared your prison or already downloaded others from the workshop. So, where’s the catch? As mentioned before Prison Architect is still in Alpha. And there are still bugs and performance problems with prisons that have 150+ prisoners, but almost every month a new  patch comes with fixes and new game mechanics. *It is currently not possible to execute prisoners.

												This is a tough one. If Steam reviews had a neutral option, I'm sure I'd pick it, but as it stands, I can't recommend this game.I've played it a lot in a short space of time, so it clearly has some good things going for it. As a building sim, it reminds me of Banished - which I like a lot - in that things don't happen immediately, and that people (prisoners and staff members in this case, villagers in Banished) are your most important resource. Progress is slow but satisfying, which is how it should be. I also love that it has a campaign mode, something which is missing from many building games, but is present in the very best ones, like Zeus: Master of Olympus.The reason I can't recommend it is that it is still very, very flawed. The user interface is the biggest culprit. In the course of my campaign, I had to Google far too many things which just aren't explained anywhere in the game. It doesn't really contain a manual; clicking the help button takes you to a website - have fun playing offline! Here are some of my gripes, in whatever order they come to mind:- The campaign objectives are seriously messy. One objective is ""place a payphone in every yard"". Doing that didn't meet the objective, so I had to look it up. It turns out that you have to place *five* payphones in every yard. This information isn't present in the game at all, not even as a tooltip.- Objectives are also prone to reappearing after they've been completed. One objective requires all staff to be well-rested at the same time. As soon as that happens, even for a moment, the objective is met and the reward is paid, but any time a staff member gets exhausted afterwards (which seems to be unavoidable), it'll appear as unmet again.- Guard patrols can't cross one another without interfering, and all three patrol types - regular guards, armed guards and guard dogs - share the same patrol colour, which is ridiculous.- Selecting multiple people is needlessly difficult. There's no shift+click mechanism to select two guards; you can drag a box around them, but that's it, and if other people happen to be in that box, you'll select them too. And after you give someone a move instruction, they are immediately deselected, so you can't move them a little at a time. That's something that would be really useful when dealing with fires or recapturing a prison after a riot.- Connecting more than one power generator to the same grid results in neither of them working. Again, I found this online after I had already done it.- Right click should really deselect objects like it does in 99% of building games, but it doesn't.- Some prisoners are ""entitled"" to higher-quality cells than others. I have no idea why, and it never seemed to affect my prison population adversely that I made all cells the same quality (3). On the rare occasion when I made better cells, I couldn't figure out how to move prisoners to new cells manually. Such a mechanism exists, but it's not explained.- A lot of the objects are purely cosmetic. For example, staff need wide sofas for their staff rooms but they never seem to actually sit down...- On a related note, I never figured out which objects I actually did need more of. Cookers for the kitchen? It seemed like it. Washing machines for the laundry? Maybe, but I never saw more than one in use at a time.- The room size constraints feel very arbitrary at times. Why does a dog kennel need to be at least 5x5 tiles when a dog crate is only 2x1 tiles? What if I only want one dog? Thankfully, this behaviour can be changed with a mod, but it shouldn't come to that.- I had to save and reload my game to fix a bug where workers thought an area was ""too dangerous"" when it wasn't.- Prisoners don't seem to need much sleep at all. I started off giving everyone eight hours a night, and eventually brought it down to six, but even then, prisoners would be awake for half the time. And the lights never actually go out, even though the tooltip for the ""sleep"" regime component says that they do.- It gets very dark outside, though, which is a pain when it comes to building. Many simulation games allow the player to toggle daylight while building without disrupting the actual clock, but not this game.- Prisoner movement in general isn't simulated very well. I was very careful to restrict which areas my prisoners could go to, but my ""intelligence"" suggested that all sorts of illicit trades were taking place in completely off-limits areas. Even when I had guards patrolling them, I never, ever saw any prisoners in those areas, yet they were apparently rife with drugs, weapons and luxuries.- Speaking of luxuries, why do mobile phones not set off the metal detectors? My shakedowns usually turned up only a handful of most items but dozens of phones at a time. Somehow my guards never noticed a single phone in use though. Guards seem pretty useless in general. They're mostly just glorified doormen.- I also couldn't figure out how to search an individual cell without its resident prisoner being there. My confidential informants told me where to find drugs but I couldn't do anything about it except order a prison-wide shakedown. Great.- The confidential informants also do nothing except arouse suspicion if you don't have a security office, but that's not explained either.- When I first booted the game, it went straight to the campaign, which was strange, but acceptable. What I found really poor is that whenever I subsequently re-opened the game, it would jump directly to sandbox mode, not the campaign mode that I had just been playing, without presenting a menu or asking if I wanted to load a save file. Another quirk is that closing the menu unpauses the game if it was paused before. Such a simple bug could easily have been fixed, but no.- Opening the language menu always seems to freeze the game for about ten seconds, presumably because it was loading community language packs, including about fifty Russian duplicates, which I'm never going to need.- One of my biggest annoyances: there is a single volume control for the entire game rather than separate controls for music and sound effects. I ended up playing with the whole game on mute.- The time lapse function is hidden away in the menus. Some games, like Mini Metro, automatically record a timelapse which can be played back at the end of a stage, but this game doesn't advertise it at all, so if you've already built your ultimate prison and want to look back on how you got there, it's too late.- There are lots of floor options but they're almost all ugly. The text overlay seemingly can't be switched off and is often placed really poorly.- The objects dialog should really be sorted by room type, but instead, it's all a big mess. I often had to resort to searching for what I wanted by typing it in.- There should have been more deployment options. There's ""min/med/max security prisoners only"", but how about ""everyone EXCEPT max security prisoners""? Guards can also only be deployed to entire blocks, which is pretty useless if you try to keep things ""open plan"", minimising the number of doors, since they slow people down.- It's very hard to determine if you've allocated enough laundry and canteen services. There's no direct indicator; you have to follow prisoners' needs and see if they start complaining about it.Honestly, there are more problems, but this review is character-limited. I had fun with the game because I was willing to look so many things up myself, but I could not, in good conscience, suggest it to an inexperienced player. Luckily I picked it up in a bundle, because I'd feel pretty ripped off if I'd paid full price for it. It simply feels unfinished. Good building games have a level of attention to detail completely missing from Prison Architect.Not recommended.			"

 Heist, anyone? Ok, although you can't perform heists in this game, you can pretend that you where taken here for failing one. - Pros  Extremely detailed gameplay The implementation of temperature is cool (pun intended), but sometimes seems like the game could just do without it (it can be disabled) Great fun to play as the prisoner either in your own prison or one for the Steam Workshop -Cons  Sometimes it gets a little frustrating when you cant cross over power cables coming from different power generators, but it is something I can live with It takes a reasonably long amount of time to collect all the Bible pages and Polaroids which is annoying because it is an achievement to collect them all, meaning that achievement will take a while to get In Prison escape mode it is sometimes easy to slip past metal detectors which takes some of the challenge away from the game, but again it is fixable by not doing it -Features I'd like to see  Multiplayer!!! Specifically in the prsion escape mode as it would be great to tag along with a friend and escape a prison together As temperature was added a little while back it would be nice to see A/C to cool the prison rather than just windows (not the operating system)Now unfortunately no free cake or other confectionaries are included with this game, but it is a small sacrifice to make with such a well developed game.Download size: ~300mb   -maybe less because I have prisons and stuffTrading cards: 8        -all roughly around 6p (in GBP)Achievement count: 18   -at the time I wrote this reviewAchievement difficulty: Easy-MediumRating:9/10Recommendation:I personally highly recommend it especially if you like games such as Simcity but with a twist, but without the city building bit but like the economy and stuff is similar...to some extent.

												Long-time player here, I've been supporting the game and the team for a few years now. For starters, this game has a huge mod database, and mod community continuing to produce for it. Developers see this and notice that some mods need to become supported by an official patch, and they are implemented. These guys have worked their asses off to prove the Early Access system wrong, and they did. This game is a sucess and proves what backers can do for developers who put their heart into their game.Game has minimal, if any bugs with vanilla base game. When you put in mods in any game you run the risk for bugs, thankfully the base game experience provides a simply incredible game, one that doesn't actually NEED modifications, but if you want them, plenty exist.Must buy for those who enjoy city builders, or simulation games.

												Prison Architect has the potential to be a fantastic game.The gameplay is incredibly addicting. You will experience the same urge that something like the Civ series will give you, except ""just one more turn"" becomes ""just one more room/building"". Once I had begun the third iteration of my prison with $500k in funds, the fun was really getting started as I had the ability to build what I wanted instead of what I had to do to get by.Or so I thought.Once my budding prison complex reached ~175 prisoners, I noticed something; the frame rate had begun to drop.. Surely this game with its 2D sprites wasn't slowing my gaming rig down...or was it? By 250 prisoners I was down below 30 FPS.Upon further inspection, it wasn't just the FPS that had dropped; the actual pace of the game seemed to be tied to the frame rate. What was 3x game speed had now slowed to a stuttering 1x game speed. A quick search of the internet revealed the root cause of the issue (and that I was far from alone).Prison Architect is a processor-heavy game. This is expected and normally not a problem; there are a lot of things happening at once when you reach the point where 500 entities are ""thinking"" and moving simultaneously in your game world. However, what IS a problem is the fact that Prison Architect only runs on one of your processor's cores, with no hyperthreading. The 3.0 GHz eight core beast sitting in the case next to me might is about as useful as the Celeron in grandma's laptop. This means that EVERYONE who plays this game, regardless of their rig's power, is going to experience the same slowdown once they get to ~200 prisoners - which is RIGHT when the game has sucked you in and you are ready for the long haul.Prison Architect is insanely fun. I spent roughly 16 of the last 48 hours playing it. Unfortunately, it's so poorly optimized that it will eventually become virtually unplayable if I continue to feed my new addiction.I cannot recommend Prison Architect to anyone in its current state. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for letting this issue exist for so long. If things change in the future, I will edit my review.Edit: After 4 months and 4 more updates to the game, this is still unfixed.			"

												Finally, it is fully released. What can really be said about this game that hasn't already been said? It's an amazing tycoon game and I, daresay, the best Prison game I've ever played. The core concepts are simple, you build a prison with the intent on making money. You make money by accepting grants, getting more prisoners and having a bigger prison. With more inmates, comes more issues, thus requiring more money. Excess money is spent on research, salaries, expansion and general upkeep. You can build your prison however you want within the map size and I've seen some crazy prison layouts from other players (the Enterprise prison and automated prisons come to mind). They have even added in a campaign mode and you can take control of the inmates and bust out of the prison. This is a damn good game and I highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in Tycoon-esque games. Word of advice, don't leave any doors open and get metal detectors as soon as possible.Gameplay Footage:

												I received a low-threat prisoner, so I didn't pay much attention to him. How wrong I was..It was a normal, average day. The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.He attacked from the shadows.Prisoner ""Leeroy jenkins"" viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty. Then I realized..LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEENKINS!10/10 would plastic fork again.			"

								Made a prison with the starting budget and grants. There was a lovely riot (20% prisoners dead), and I decided to sell and let the feds run the place.Used the not insubstantial funds to build another prison. This was much better. When I had a riot, half of my prisoners died. I sold the place.I then built a third prison with almost a million dollars. I nurtured it up to 500 inmates, and then something amazing happened.There was a riot, and a war ensued. In the great battle for the kitchen, 456 prisoners and guards lost their lives.Thank gabe for freefire. Thank gabe for Prison Architect.			"

												I have a fairly large sandbox prison, plenty of guards, and extremely harsh punishments of solitary for up to 40+ hours just for having a spoon in your pocket.

												An inmate is attempting to escape my prison. He's running along a path between two cell blocks, with a baton wielding guard in pursuit. As I pan the camera to follow the prisoner, I notice some activity at the front gate. A couple of workmen are carrying building materials for my latest construction project. The guard closest to the gate opens it to allow the workmen to enter, and I watch with a mixture of horror and embarrassment as the prisoner times his run perfectly to pass through the open gate, and out to freedom.This anecdote perfectly illustrates everything you need to know about Prison Architect, the simulation game where the player has to build a prison and manage its day to day operations. The main sandbox game mode doesn't have a scripted story (there is a basic story in the tutorial mode), but there's lots of potential for each player to talk about unique events that happened to them. You'll spend alot of time discovering problems and figuring out how to fix them (I solved the above hole in my security by extending the outer fence and adding a second ""inner"" gate so that anyone coming in or out has to go through both gates). And unlike other management games, there's a constant feeling that your ""customers"" are actively trying to ruin all your hard work, and at any moment it could all burn down around you - literally.Each prisoner has a list of needs, such as sleep, food, hygiene, exercise, family and recreation. If you don't fulfil these needs, the prisoners will get angry and eventually start a riot. So you have to make sure you've got a big enough kitchen to keep everyone fed, build showers, hire janitors, give prisoners some yard time, let them meet family in a visitation room, and relax by playing pool or watching TV.As you would expect, inmates will sometimes attack and kill each other, smuggle contraband and try to dig tunnels to escape. To combat this you can hire normal guards (equipped with batons, upgradeable to tazers) and armed guards (guns) and select which areas of the prison to deploy them. Guard dogs are good at sniffing out contraband and detecting tunnels. You can place CCTV cameras and metal detectors. In the event of a riot you can call in special riot police and firemen. Prisoners caught breaking the rules can be punished with solitary confinement.If you choose to try to improve the lives of your prisoners, you can give them training so they can work in the kitchen, workshop, library or laundry. You can give them treatment for drugs and alcohol addiction in the infirmary, let them seek religion in a chapel or give them an education in a classroom. This all contributes to ""reform"" which influences the chance that they commit another crime after being released from prison. This ""reoffend rate"" is the closest thing the game has to an overall goal. The lower the rate, the better your prison is performing. Or you could just ignore the prisoners' well being and try to make as much profit as possible. The player has complete freedom to design their prison how they want.I do have some complaints. The tutorial campaign is quite basic, and there's alot of stuff that isn't explained. Once I started building my own prison from scratch in the sandbox I had to find answers to lots of questions on the forums. And the framerate starts to die when your prison gets quite large. My framerate was a constant 60 fps until I reached around 300 inmates, but now I've got 500 its just barely staying above 30 fps. Its still playable (framerate isn't as important for this kind of game as it is for a fast paced action game) but I'm not sure I want to go for the 1000 inmates achievement because I expect it would get even worse. Overall Prison Architect is a really fun, extremely deep game. There's a ton of more complex systems I've not even mentioned here, but at the same time its not overwhelmingly difficult to learn how to play. I definitely give a strong recommendation to Prison Architect. I've played almost 30 hours just doing the tutorial and building one prison, so there's easily enough playing time to justify a full price purchase.			"

Too much freedom behind bars?Prison Architect is a great little simulator in the mould of Theme Hospital/Park, where you have to build and look after your own private institution.It starts off at 100mph as you uncover the reasons behind a brutal double killing and a prisoner's subsequent execution.Before long, an intuitive interface and design means you quickly pick up the basics and can run a reasonable establishment.As you progress, more options of how to deal with your prison population become available.You'll need them too; that cosy institute of placid inmates diligently counting down the days to their release and reintegration into society will soon morph into a violent cesspit lurching from one crisis to another.Right under your eyes inmates will be arming themselves and hatching plans to escape - before you know it a huge riot is under way and a gang armed with drills and shanks are making a beeline to the exit, armed with the keys of a guard they gutted in the corridor.I predict a riotBut more often than not you can quickly rectify a problem when it arises by chucking money at it; spam a few guards in the canteen when Dragos and his buddies kick off and the uprising is quashed.You won't be sort of money either; it's easy to get very generous grants by fulfilling the meagre criteria needed for most of them.Coupled with a very short campaign (which is really a tutorial), you run out of 'things to do' fairly quickly and you're left with the sandbox mode.This might be ample for some people, but as someone who likes a challenge, building a prison free of any real pressures or targets is quite boring.Yes, you can make things more difficult for yourself by doing things like accepting the maximum amount of prisoners on each intake, but it's an artificial goal with no benefits or consequences.And, of course, you're playing alone.A multiplayer option putting prisons head to head, for example, would be brilliant, or rival players trying to break out/take over a prison is another opportunity missed.That said, this is an excellent little game well worth a buy.Pros:- Slick design and interface- Easy to learn the basics- Absorbing gameplay- Brilliant prison escape mode- Good mod integration- Sandbox modeCons:- Very short campaign- No multiplayer- Too easy/lack of challenges in sandbox mode- Can become repetitive Overall 8/10 "

												This game is glorious.The graphics/artstyle is quite amazing.The music.....well so far I can only hear it in campaign mode and during riots, once I listen to the whole soundtrack, I'll share my opinion.And the gameplay is so much fun like it's the best ""lock'em'up"" game you have ever played; From seeing the workmen building the prison to inmates arriving and get on with their lives. Although once you finished building your prison, that's pretty much it other than trolling your prisoners or play Escape Mode.Ah yes, the Escape Mode is also my favourite aspect of the game (probably better than The Escapists) you get to play as an inmate and you can start ♥♥♥♥ing thing up in the prison including starting fights, set objects on fire, kill everyone (including visitors....even those who are under 13! Inb4 PA gets controversy complaints)You can play Escape Mode on someone else's prison on the Steam Workshop although I wish that we have needs in the game (Food, Sleep, etc) including interactions to furniture....you know, instead of trying to escape, you should follow the regime. Oh and able to join gangs manually.Also mods, there's mods everywhere in the Steam Workshop.Examples like texture mods, object mod, campaign (experimental) and more. Ever wanted to make your own Fallout Vault instead of a prison? Ever wanted to complete more grants for more money? Ever wanted to improve the game's sprites? Ever wanted to force the game to have a riot because.....for fun? Ever wanted to change the warden into a loveable Gaben? Well whatever the case you want....This game is so addicting,This game is definitely worth your time.This game is for you.9/10One of the best indie games I've ever played[Also I bought this game just one day before the release of V1 so....can I still have my early supporter badge, IV? :3]			"

I'm a Time-Travelling DictatorI have to ration how often I load this game, as I'll start playing it and then wonder how I've invented time travel, 6 hours passing in the blink of an eye. It also made me realize I'm a bit of a cruel dictator when it comes to human rights. I build the smallest possible, cramped yet efficient rooms, give the bare necessities in visitation and entertainment, lock up prisoners who complain and make the rest work 10 hours a day, all whilst banking fat cash into my account and cackling maniacally.An In-Depth SimulationThis is a somewhat realistic simulation of the basics of human life in a prison. Each prisoner has needs, and you have to meet those needs by building a variety of rooms and filling them with objects. It sounds simple, but the gameplay is fairly complex, with emotional, psychological and physical needs all coming into play.The mechanics are straight forward seeming, but it's easy for riots to start and things to escalate wildly out of hand. Oops, turns out people reeeeally don't like it if you don't feed them. There is a deceptive amount of strategy and forward thinking required that makes each prison you create more efficient as you build up your knowledge. My first one burned to the ground and resulted in a few dozen guards getting shanked whilst the prisoers escaped... yeah okay, not only should I have fed them, I guess I should have built prison walls too. Live and learn (unless you're a guard in Prison Athravan, RIP!)Add to this research trees, staff management, educational and recreational programs, managing addiction, guard rotas and pathing, shakedowns and security, visitation, resources and financial stress and you have one hell of a deep simulation game.Modding CommunityOn top of the pretty much endless simulation, the modding community for this game is fantastic. Thousands of people have poured their heart into prison and object design, as well as scenarios and additional features, and it's all available free. The game was great to begin with, but kudos to all those who have submitted to the workshop, and to the developers for providing the tools for the people who are way smarter than me to share their creations. All I can do is scroll through page after page in awe of their dedication and skill.TL:DR A game that may look simple on the surface but has an absolute ton of depth. An extremely well built simulation game; with the added bonus of a very active and creative modding community to boot. Big thumbs up! "

												134 hours of play. 134 hours I will never get back and I regret NOTHING! Prison Architect is one of those games you can't stop playing. I always think, maybe I can do it this way or, what about this. Everytime, and it's just as fun every time. Give it a shot you won't regret it either.			"

								It's like Theme Park but all your guests spend the night, every night, while trying to kill each other and the staff you spent all your money hiring. Sometimes they will just start riots and kill all your dogs. Sometimes they will kill all your cooks and then riot because they are hungry. Sometimes they will dig an escape tunnel from Solitary all the way back to their cells, because you gave them a bookshelf. Other times they will just set fire to things. When they are not doing such, you can build them classrooms and hire teachers for them to murder. You can setup yards, give them jobs around the prison, learn new tech and issue your guards with tasers and such devices that keep them alive slightly longer, when the prisoners break down all the carefully placed locked doors you spent time planning out thinking it was foolproof. Enjoy the hilarity of having every guard in your prison delivered to the morgue you built, and having to call in emergency services in riot gear to retake the prison. You can also cut down trees for cash, make prisoners into slaves that build furniture, and generally rip off the taxpayer with 'grants' that give you thousands for nothing, just like real life prisons. This game is excellent.			"

												Surprisingly deep game with a cartoony art style that makes the grim reality of prison more palatable. Every Early Access update was a nice step forward, and the 1.0 release definitely feels like a complete game.Best thing about it, in my opinion, is that this game is incredibly balanced. You can be as harsh as you want, or build luxury suites for your drug dealers and murderers. You can build your favorite prisoner his own home and have staff bring his meals to him while he watches TV all day. All of these are valid playstyles, and will perform well on different metrics.There are so many different game mechanics going on, but they're all intuitive, and the game's timescale control gives you all the time you need to figure out what to do. The campaign mode also breaks down a lot of the features one-by-one, which makes a great introduction to the game.			"

												This might be Early Access game, but it reminds me when we first started in Early Access with our Starpoint Gemini 2. Community is everything. Prison Architect has a fantastic and helpful community and that's really something. The game itself has so much charm that I can just praise them and compare them to golden Bullfrog times when Molyneux released hits like Theme Park and Theme Hospital. It's fun, it's complex, it has spirit. I didn't had any bugs or crashes whatsoever in almost 15 hours of gameplay so I can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who loved old Dungeon Keeper, Theme series and was watching Oz or Prison Break. :) Graphics:  ★★★★☆ Sound:  ★★★★☆ Gameplay:  ★★★★★ Potential: (EA) ★★★★★   Overall:  ★★★★★ "

Teal DeerDevelopers: Introversion Software Publishers: Introversion SoftwareInitial release: Oct 2015Genre: Simulation, Strategy, Management, Builder#Worth/NotWorth: #TotallyWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationPrison Architect is a planning, building and management simulator.The main draw of this game is the sandbox mode though there is a short, interesting and well done campaign that more or less serves as a tutorial. Though the nitty gritty is not that well explained in all honesty. I should mention there has been an announcement of a version 2.0 with vast improvements roughly a month out regarding this and many other issues. In sandbox mode, you're charged with building a prison and making sure it stays operating swimmingly throughout its existence. You'll prevent escapes and cater to state grants in order to receive funding. Events, such as fires and riots take place and measures need to be taken to mitigate exposures to such things. You'll schedule the day for the prisoners and draft work/reform programs and work on security as prisoners use exploits to bring in contraband, either from workshops or familial or conjugal visits. What's interesting about this is the game is very loose and because it doesn't prevent you from or discourage any behavior you'll discover why something is totally broken or some aspect you've looked over that is causing greats strife within the prison. You'll hire workers, doctors, accountants and handymen; Psychologists and security guards. When you start your prison, you'll be given the options between male/female prisons and the warden themselves as well as any specific challenges such as having to deal with things like weather and temperature within the prison. Each warden gives specific perks; Such as mitigating the amount of violent prisoners being brought into the prison.There are many systems to build; Such as providing electricity and  water. Rooms must be given an assignment, from the canteen to the shower room. Shout out to that feeling when you build a really nice starter prison and forget to install drains and water goes everywhere. Once you get the basics down. You'll be able to build the requirements for a maximum security prison which are much more intense and robust. From the riot team armory with guard dogs and CCTV monitors; You'll need to hire guards to watch the cameras that you installed. You'll need to even wire those cameras, which may seem daunting at first as it's a separate system than the electricity but that's what makes the game so interesting is the allowance afforded to what you can do. The game almost encourages chaos as a learning mechanic. The game also has steam workshop and mod support. Including more popular things like the gangs mod which has obvious connotations. THE GISTReally great building and management sim and the devs continue to add more and more content. With the version 2.0 announcement, this is a package for anyone that pines for the days old Bullfrog management games you shouldn't miss.Follow my curation for more "

Give one person power over everything and they will unleash their true selfThat's the test this game forces you to take. Being the overseer of a prison, you have access to anything, from building new facilities to designing a daily routine your prisoners must follow. At first, you probably will be kind to your prisoners: you will buy them sofas, TVs, have them live in large, comfortable cells and feed them well. And then, they will respond with riots, fires and schemes while your guards have their backs turned. After this, things must become a little bit more ""rough"".Think of the prisons in this game like cities in other popular city building simulators, like Stonehearth or Cities: Skylines: they are smaller-scale versions of ""ecosystems"", where everything must work in harmony and the wheels must always spin, or else everything fails and disaster follows.First of all, the building system is nice and well-designed, but a little bit clunky. Let's elaborate. Planning a building means you have to set up foundations, furniture, electricity and water pipelining. More often than not you will mess up the dimensions of your building, meaning you have to start from scratch, or realise you needed something bigger to satisfy your prison's needs. However, all systems work: one large building for everything or smaller ones for each specific need.Players that won't prefer to waste time on the tutorial (in the form of 5 mini-campaigns that cover the basics), will realise that they will need guides and the wiki to keep their prisons going forward. The game is so complex that you will feel lost in the beginning, and it's gonna take a while before you manage to reform your prisoners instead of incarcerating them. You have many needs to cover, from space and proper bedding to psychological support and community service. Keeping your prisoners content is not easy, and no matter what you do they will usually ask for more. Failing to give them what they demand, means that they will riot and try to bring down the facility. Personally, I like to slam them in solitary with barely any food and rest to drain them from the energy to revolt again.Keep in mind your prisoners have many ways to escape. They might steal stuff like knives and wires, dig tunnels, smuggle drugs etc. The prisoners' AI adapts to a certain degree to your actions, so if, for example, you start using patrol dogs to find their tunnels, they will start digging in a circular pattern to confuse them. Clever stuff indeed.It's a nicely addicting game and its content will keep you hooked for quite a while. If you ever wanted to dictate the lives of a bunch of criminals that noone will shed a tear for, start unleashing the sinister punisher from within you with this game.RATING:Gameplay: 8.5/10Presentation: 8/10Story: 8.5/10Unique Factor: Simulation: 9/10OVERALL: 8.5/10 "

												I was lucky enough to purchase this game for $5. I have owned it since the alpha days and really appreciate the hardwork the developers put into making this game. I have called in sick to work just to play it. I waste maybe 12 hours sometimes in front of the computer and although I know I might die in what would be a short amount of years this makes the time pass faster so its ok. I do not fear death or time passing when I am immersed in this game. I try everything to make prisoners happy. But the game is so challenging eventually something surprising happens. First time I played Iw ill not forget. Things were going good. I go get snack. I come back fire has been set in a library. over 80 casualties. Never a dull moment. I fall asleep playing game sometimes. :] thank you one more time <3			"

												Best building game i've played. Great graphics, gameplay is fun and unpredictable which makes it really nice.Now, let me tell you about my experience.about i'd say 58 days in game time, i finished building my prison and started bringing in prisoners. I noticed this one prisoner, his name was Nathan... (dont remember his full name but whatever).  he was the only minimum security i had so i figured, he's not gonna do much harm. and boy was i wrong.He started riots and kills making him very lethal. So I figured, okay, lets make him Super Max.Couple of days have passed and not much has happened. I added lots of sniper towers, armed Guards, and guard dogs.One day Nathan LITERALLY started a large riot/ escape attempt. Of course he was one of the few that made it to the exit/ past the reception.But with all the sniper towers and armed guards that i added days earlier.It was at this moment that Nathan knew..... he ♥♥♥♥ed up.

												This game has the potential to be a fantastic game; however, at current state I cannot reccommend it.  If you're looking for a casual, small to medium prison game, then this is a fantastic game. What I was looking for was to be able to create a super max high capcity prison.  After playing ~12 hours with small prisons and learning the mechanics of the game, I was ready for a 3000+ capcity prison.  This is where the game struggles.  I have a high end system (SLI GTX 970s i-7 3820 @4.2GHz) and this game cannot operate past 1000 entities in game.  I was extremely let down, my GPU usage was less than 15% and my CPU was around 30%.  My hardware wasn't even being used.  The game is very poorly optimized for very large prisons.  I read that it only uses 1 core of your CPU.  Once I can build a gigantic prison, this will possibly be one of the greatest games ever.  But, at current state the gamne becomes unplayable for large prisons.If you're not looking for a large prison builder, then this is the game for you.  But, if you are, then I can't reccommend it.

												This game is, in my honest opinion, the crowning achievement of Early Access. Not only is the game more than feature complete, but it has also been in a fully playable and enjoyable state since the earliest of days. The monthly dev logs are a joy to watch and kept players informed about changes along the way in a very excellent fashion.Not only that but even after leaving Early Access these devs continued working and improving upon this game. I can only applaud their work ethic because there are companies releasing 60$ titles that have never even dreamt of putting in this type of sustained effort. The game is also really, really good and you should just buy it really.			"

												I've been playing Prison Architect for about 30 hours per alpha release for the latest few versions that came out before the final release came out. An early access game that not ONLY has relesed new versions on schedule for a long time, and now actually has reached version 1.0, is, sadly, something to celebrate on Steam.Aside from the fact that the devs have used the Early Access platform the way it was meant to be used and that should be commended, it's also a pretty damned good managment game. Prison managment has been done before, but not for a long time, and never well, and it's a change of pace from the usual town managment sims. Now your ""population"" is the enemy, as well as your source of income.The number of systems that works togheter to form the complete simulation is very impressive, and even a small change can shatter a very stable system. For example. I had a prison with 750 prisoners, running very smoothly. Then a gang leader arrived on the bus one morning and started organizing the red gang, one of the three gangs in my prison. I had never had a gang leader before so I let him work for a bit before sending him to my supermax facility, so I could experience how running a prison with an organized gang was like. In supermax he lost his temper, and ended up in solitary. This angered his gang enough that they started a riot. A couple of hours later when the dust settled and the riot police left there were 54 dead, over 60 injured, and 200 prisoners who were up for solitary for their actions during the riot. The rioting prisoners broke into protective custody, where snitches and former policemen who ended up in prison are kept, and killed half of the protected prisoners. I was put on notice, and risked ending up as a prisoner in my own prison. Luckily my lawyer got me out of that... A prison is a delicate system, and care needs to be taken when introducing anything new.There is now added a story mode, to work as a guide for new players, and an escape mode, where you get to play as a prisoner, as well, but I still feel that the sandbox mode is the meat of the game. You learn some new tricks each time you build a new prison, and as you can sell your old prison for an extra cashboost in the startup phase of your next one, you will get more and more funds for each prison you build. My only problem with the game is that it starts to lag when your prison grows too big, depending on how good your computer is. I first start to notice it at 750 prisoners and roughly 350 staff, so at just over 1000 individual characters present in the same prison, but my computer is pretty damned good. I know that a lot of people can't even get 500 prisoners to work well.tl:drDamned good simulator/managment game. Buy it, play it, profit. A bit unforgiving if you make a mistake though, but that's the way in a prison.Highly recomended.			"

												There are a few reasons to recommend this game (It's novel and fun at first, if you're into planning and optimizing) and many reasons not to (Bugs, poor design decisions, it's far too easy/lacks complexity, it's not yet finished but ""released"" from EA, balancing issues, ...).I originally planned to write a detailed review, expanding on each issue, but decided against it as to not steal focus from the one big reason I'm writing this non-recommendation: MAJOR PERFORMANCE ISSUES Prison Architect produces a heavy CPU load to calculate its simulations, or the AI decisions of the game's agents. Unfortunately, it isn't multi-core capable and will only use two threads. This results in significant FPS and simulation speed decreases as the number of agents increases. My current prison - which I'm stubbornly completing despite it having become a major chore - holds 300 prisoners, employs around 350 staff, has slowed down to around 12-15 FPS and a proportional simulation speed decrease while idle, and a nigh unplayable 5-6 FPS while building my next cell block of 100 cells. System: i7 5930k, @2800MHz RAM.To put things into perspective: There are achievements for holding 500 and 1'000 prisoners respectively. The achievement here being patience and a tolerance for slideshows, of course.Which brings me to my next, and final point. As other games have proven, it's perfectly possible to have an agent based simulation maintain a smooth, stable simulation speed for most of the game's situations even without multi-core capabilities. The trick is to have a difficulty-induced softcap on the total number of agents the system has to handle. In PA, it's ridiculously easy to keep hundreds (or thousands) of prisoners' needs fulfilled. Once you have the money to build all the necessary facilities, you would need to purposely mismanage your prison for anything ""interesting"" like riots to have a chance of happening. If it weren't for the need to occasionally and manually check for and remove tunnels, or watch out for tagged snitches among new arrivals, you could run the game on full autopilot for days and the only thing that would have changed once you return would be your account balance.Prison Architect has (had) a lot of potential, but sadly, I cannot recommend it in its current state (A sentiment that should be reserved for Early Access reviews). Stay away from this (for now) unless you plan on only building tiny prisons, have a lot of patience, don't mind slideshows and screen tears, or have hypothreaded your CPU down to two virtual cores.

 Prison Architect, How Many ♥♥♥♥ Heads Can I Confine In a Tight Space? To make it short and sweet, this game is fun. I really liked it overall. However, it didn't take long before it got a bit boring since you experience everything it has to offer by the end of your first prison. Its not a bad thing I guess since it didn't overstay it's welcome. You have to be careful building around prisoners too because if they see an opening, they will say, ""Peace ♥♥♥♥♥es!"" and book it like hell while your prison guards handle the situation. Prisoners will die and the prison nurses will have trouble sleeping at night but at least the situation was handled. There isn't too much for the controls. It's mainly the mouse with the keyboard to either access the keyboard shortcuts or acts as a way to move around the screen. However, the UI works pretty well. Its easy to navigate, there's a search bar to search for certain assets you want to put into your prison, and you place it in as such. The assets include: Important human beings, not important human beings, chairs, vending machines, TVs, Cameras, automatic doors, non-automatic doors, and more for sure. This game has a surprising amount of depth to it in the building department since you have to build your own water pipe system and even wiring your electricty to certain parts of the prison so you can keep the lights on and get a good view of the prisoners getting brutally beatened or going mentally insane as you accidentally confine them to Solitary Confinement for 2 months when you meant 2 days. Yes, there's no way, that I know of, to revert that. Guess you're ♥♥♥♥ed, buddy. This game also features a ""Escape Mode"" (or something like that) where you can choose a prison you either downloaded from the Steam Workshop or one you made yourself and you try to escape it as a prisoner. The controls are pretty standard but they work for that. Its kind of fun since you can form gangs to help you in it and can even get away with murder if you're good enough. Its also a good way to test how good your prison holds up. You can of course get loans or grants if you fulfill certain tasks given to you so you can keep these unlawful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in longer where they're heavily mistreated. The grants work against you since some of them require that you treat the prisoners good. Why do they need a TV?? ♥♥♥♥ them, they murder someone, here's a ball and some string, have fun, ♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can read up on what your prisoners did as well and they even have names. Some of the descriptions of the prisoners are pretty funny to say the least. There's so much to talk about, honestly, it'd take forever to cover it all. Just play the game if you're interested at this point but the review will continue.The game looks pretty good. Its a top down 16 bit looking game that belongs on a Playstation 1 or SNES, if you're optimization is good enough. It's really nice on the eyes and it works quite well since you can tell the difference between everything and that's always a plus! The small character models look weird though, they are like all related to Rayman or something because they have no arms or legs. They are just a body, head, and round hands and that's it. It works so whatever.The sound of the game works. This game is quite full of sound, actually. You can hear how angry the prisoners are when they are rioting against your prison guards and you can hear all the cooking and cleaning in the prison kitchen when they are serving the prisoners barely editable food. The prisoners, when they fight, have these cartoon-ish sound effects when they are punching each other God knows where. The sound in this game does make the prison much more alive and that is always much appreciated.As for replayability, that depends on how you feel about the game after the first full fledged prison you make. Do you want to make more stuff, or do you want to put the keyboard and mouse down and move on? I think this game has the potential of having several playthroughs. Its definitely a good game to revisit after you haven't played it for awhile. Its a fun game but I don't know if replaying it directly after your first prison will be quite as satisfying as the first so you may want to take a break then come back to get another bite. Overall, even though people have died and the prison inmates sleep comfortably with their hidden shivs at night, its still quite an enjoyable experience and is quite fun. I got this for almost full price but I can say that this is worth the full price, overall. Get this game if you haven't already. Its worth a playthrough or two.			"

												When I first started playing I only did sandbox. I had no idea you could adjust when you wanted your prisoners to start arriving so they all automaticly came on the second day, so the game went like this.-The prisoners have arrived: QUICK BUILD SOME CELLS-The prisoners need food: HURRY BUILD A CANTEEN-The prisoners are escaping; HIRE SOME GUARDS!!!It took me 20 tries before I learned you were meant to build a prison then add prisoners.That made the game slightly more easy.

								FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THIS GAME IS IN ALPHA (UNFINISHED) The game is what you expect it to be, a prison simulation game, where you design and manage a prison.You manage a prison, making sure the prisoners don't kill each other (Or your staff) or run away. New prisoners come in, so if your last prisoners killed everyone, put the new ones in their bloody cells, no problems, lolThe Developers are great and open to any feedback you might have and can only give you a better game in the end over this already amazingly fun game.The game isn't finished yet so you can see some glitches that are actually pretty funny but still really enjoy the game. By buying this you get the full version when it's out and help that full version happen.I will rate the full version when it comes out but I really recommend you get this sometime, I can tell you will probably like it.

								I built an open plan kitchen / canteen, a prisoner stole a knife then rampaged, killing a dozen inmates, several guards and a cook.  Before adding metal detectors, everyone who completed the workshop safety course came away with a shiv.Thinking sprinklers were not necessary in an all-concrete facility, I watched with horror as a vandalized toilet and poorly grounded metal detector caused a raging fire.  Only one prisoner in the block survived.  Accidentally toggling the armed guards to weapons free instead of calling in the riot police, a large riot was stopped very quickly.  It took a while to move the bodies and clean up all the blood. ...and the electric chair hasn't been implemented yet.  :)			"

												Okay, so I never write reviews but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game deserves. Before I go any further just BUY THIS GAMEFor those still not convinced I will list all pros and cons belowPROS:-Great for perfectionists, really easy to fine-tune your prison perfectly-Great for non-perfectionists, its not a ridiculously hard game, it's well balanced when it comes to the managment side as well as the building side-Its good for hours and hours of entertainment, you can spend forever building and managing a massive prison, or build many smaller ones, then when you need a break from that you can try the escape mode and then when you are done with that you can forever be entertained by the steam workshop support which allows you to not only play other peoples prisons in both modes (build and escape) but also get some of the countless mods to change up the game entirley.-It's a game where you can switch it off whenever and then jump right back in whenever-I rarely encountered any bugs in my many many hours of playtime and those I did encounter were minor and fixed pretty quicklyCONS:-This game will become your life			"

												Quite possibly the best example of how Early Access should work.  The devs had a plan, stuck to it and kept the audience informed.  It's refreshing and I applaude their work. Get past any issue you have with graphics because the gameplay far exceeds them.  They actually work well for the theme imo. Just playing games for decades this is a fun game.  Simple.  Well thought out and put together with strong community support.  It's a buy for anyone liking Theme <insert name> with a great layer of strategy tied in.   "

Early Access Review
								I decided, after a bit of consideration, to jump the wagon when the game was on sale. After spending some 10 hours or so on this Early Access title, I can't help feeling a bit divided about it.Right off the bat, the longing for a game like the good games of old, such as Theme Hospital, makes you feel right at home. The genre hasn't seen much since then, and that makes Prison Architect a very welcome sight. In my first sitting, I played 5 hours straight. Not a lot of games these days seem to be able to pull that off. Part of the reason behind this, I think, in addition to the mentioned longing, is the discovery of how things work. In fact, you are given very few hints about how to get started properly. There's a tutorial kind of thing, but it touches just a small part of the game (some which I read, are not even part of the game at this point).But, as I keep playing the game and learning more about the workings, I can't help but feel that the game is a bit ""fake"". The speed of the game is rather slow, stretching play time more than necessary (even though there are speed controls available). Then there's the graphics, which are unimpressive, but you would be able to forgive if the gameplay is very good. It's just that the gameplay is very basic. There's very little complexity in it, and nothing very new. In addition, many things don't seem to work very well. The visuals are sub-par. There's no soundtrack. There's no cinematics or voice recordings. There's no campaign mode.Even considering these things, I could be very forgiving. However, for a game that has raised considerable funding of some $10.000.000 and been in alpha for over a year, I would expect more. I'm quite amazed they haven't gotten further. Even so, I do feel I got my 7€ worth.Would I recommend the game? It's a very tough question. I feel I can't quite discredit the game, but on the other hand, it's not very impressive. Another factor is the rather stiff regular price to consider. In sum, I would have to give it a thumbs down. However, you might find it very enjoyable, and eventually it might turn out to be something great. For most people, I would therefore suggest waiting and see how things turn out.2014.05.06: It would seem my review is a bit controversal. I just want to stress the fact that I like the game. I keep playing it. I just wish it was so much more, and I think it could have been. I'd like to commend the developers for Workshop support by the way. Usually that's an afterthought.2015.02.03: I'd just like to point out I haven't played the game for a while now. There has been some additions meanwhile. I don't have a good enough basis to say much about them. I suggest you look at the release announcements if you want more up-to-date information. I'd like to say, however, that my opinion of the game hasn't changed much.			"

The dev team has truly created a masterpiece of a game that will challenge your mind and wits to deal with situations.Overall I give this game a 9 out of 10.Pros -Story mode that keeps you learning but having fun not just bored tutorial.layers and layers of depth that can be turned on or off based on your comfort with the game.Detail detail detail in a simulation strategy this is such as important part of the game that many forget to add, you can see how happy each person is or see how happy everyone is allowing you to control how things go.Workshop and mod support Cons -It can feel a bit repetitive if you don't like this style of game.Audio can be very repetitive and not enjoyable  "

═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEWPrison Architect is two games in one, you can either build and manage your own prison or try to escape a prison as an inmate but, the game is mainly focused on managing your prison. You start with an empty plot with workers and some money that you use to build mandatory buildings like offices for Warden and prison cells. Game itself is not really hard, so even if you make a lot of mistakes on your first run you will be fine. Art style and prisoner varieties are endless, prisoners can have special good and bad attributes that can make them faster, deadlier or even more likely to be killed by other prisoners or guards, to fight these you can employ guards that can either be armed with a more powerful gun or a K-9 until by their side or make the prison swarmed by CCTV cameras. Another interesting mechanic is that you can employ prisoners to do stuff janitor or chief does or you can use them as a manpower in workshop so you would earn additional money. In short, the bigger your prison is you will face more problems.   ═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONSPros:Lovely art stylePrison sound effectsPrisoner variety and attributes that will make your life harderIncludes everything you can think about when you say ""prison""Prisoners may form gangs that fight togetherMany community-made prisonsYou can play as a prisoner and:Make your own gangGain reputationSteal thingsBecome stronger and add attributes to yourselfTry to escape your own prisonmuch more!Cons:If your prison become too big you will face lagsThere are some bugs around building foundationsRarely prisoners may stuck themselvesConnecting stuff by wires is unexplained and new players may face difficulties with it═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATINGThis game is for everyone that loves management games like SimCity and wants everything to be perfect in their ""masterpiece"". I rate the game 10/10!═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here! "

												In my first prison while playing this game, I got a max security prisoner, I have had my fair share of max sec prisoners, that was until I figured out it was a legendary. By the time a found out it was a legendary, he had somehow got his hands on a lighter, he then proceeded to start a riot and burn down half my prison. When the riot guards came the legendary prisoner killed both pairs of riot guards. He basically owned the prison, and so after he killed the warden, forman, chief, cooks, lawer, accountent, and guards he then proceeded ( In Badasserary ) to walk out of my prison that was burnt to the ground. It felt as if he planted a bomb and detonated it as he walked away, LIKE A BAWS.			"

												Prison Architect is one of the best games I have played in years. I had it on my wishlist for ages as I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. I purchased it on sale and have currently played around 435 hours so finally getting to grips with my latest prison. Years ago I played games like Theme Hospital and this has all the best attributes of these types of games. I love building new prisons, the prisoners are quite comical but challenging to deal with so this game can keep your interest for weeks at a time. I do have a very good gaming laptop so am able to build vast establishments. I have not fully explored all the scenarios or challenges within the game but wanted to leave a review for anyone like myself that doubted the game - best money I have spent on steam this year! Currently I am challenging myself to stop escapes and get my statistics up and like all good games, this takes time, but is fun to do - nobody has escaped so far.....			"

												Prison ArchitectGenre: Strategy/Simulation - Real Time Strategy/SimulationRating: 9.5/10Personal playing period: Few monthsIs it worth a buy: Yes. Even at full price. This is a necessity for any strategy/sim players collection.Girl vs Game: I think there may have been a few times that I did in fact pick the game. Personal Comment:This is really a great game with a lot of depth and immersion. I have 80 plus hours and still have not felt a need to play the campaign yet. This is that game where you say just 5 more minutes and then 3 hours later you have your girlfriend and the police knocking on your door thinking you died as you were supposed to pick her up for a date 2 hours ago. This is a great immersive game with a lot to do. It is so much fun trying to design the perfect prison. Just make sure you have a lot of time or just have no job or girlfriend;)Short Summary:This is a prison building simulation strategy game. You start off with some money and a few construction workers and a open piece of land. You then need to start planning and building a prison to house prisoners that will be dropped every 24 hours. You can set how many prisoners must be dropped, what danger level they can be, etc. You are in charge of building the prison, managing the money so you dont run out of it, managing the prisoners and ensuring that they get reformed and that  they are kept happy and maintaing staff and cashflow on a day to day basis. If you like strategy/simulation games then get this.Online gaming:Have not played online but you can via steam workshop play other peoples prisons and also use escape mode to escape from prisons created by fellow gamers.Learning Curve and Gameplay:The learning curve to this game is quite intense. There is a lot that needs to be learned and understood. The utilities must be very well managed in order to ensure the prison does not run out of power and secondly to ensure the power stations and their lines don't cross. Then you have the whole physical construction and layout of the prison that you need to design and build. And then there is the management of the prison, the finances and so many more elements. The game just offers so much that you will spend endless hours on this without batting an eye. Fortunately there is an ""unlimited funds""game mode which I would recommend to start off with till you have the game play nailed. Then start a prison with limited funds and then the fun starts as budgeting and finance planning is added to the list of things to do.			"

												This game is full of originality~According to the name of this game we can know thatthe purpose of this game is to build a prison and operate it.you need to hire employees to make your prison runs properly,then slove the problems in operation you got,it is really interesting to experience that game.If you like to play sandbox game,this game is a not bad choice for you.You can observe the prisoner's every move,and see what they need then according to they need to perfect your prsion.Try more harder to make your prison more safety,make every prisoners got his job,make sure no prisoner can espace form it,and also can get enough profit from this prison.Your prison could be a large one,can keep 300~500 prisoners,or could be a small one,just keep under than 100 prisoners.You can make your prison become a small community,every prisoner got his job,make them live a good live(relatively),safety and comfortable.Or...If you like...or we can say..you are a sadism.you also can make your prison a slaughterhouse~Lock these prisoners into a enclosed room,then train a lot of armed police...Not to feed them,and not allow them to sleep,These prosoners will fight with other prisoners,and attack the police,if you allow these armed police to use they guns,they will shoot the prisoner who attack the police and kill him.after these...just watch them how to die one by one~(this is not the prison,this is nazi concentration camp!In the end, if there is no prisoner die in that day,you can sell this prison and use these money to start a new one.This creative game is worth trying~I hope... in the future,developers can make more games the same as this game into a series~like<Supermarket Architect> <Hotel Architect> or <Restaurant Architect>~I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT VERY MUCH~			"

												I had a solid prison up and running, I was still expanding but the prisoners I had were happy and everything was going according to plan. Shower time for max-sec when one of the guards operating a surveillance station gets tired and goes for his break. The showers go dark as his screens are unmonitored (no privacy here folks). Someone dies.I scramble the guards but it's too late, another prisoner has his sentence terminated before they arrive. They walk in to a scene of grisly prison r*pe gone horribly wrong. A full-scale riot is now underway with naked, wet and bleeding prisoners running everywhere. I enable free-fire and one of my armed guards wades into the fray barrels blazing, but his efforts are for naught as he gets shanked from behind- one of the naked prisoners grabs his shotgun and begins firing on the other guards. My armed guards arrive in force but the prisoners are angry now and they want vengeance. More prisoners secure themselves guns at a high cost to my guards (and their fellow inmates) and things are rapidly getting out of hand.You like tv shows about prison? They've got nothing on this.

												I original played this when it was release in early access and enjoyed the sandbox prison environment. Now that it has released the game has steamwork support to share prisons, lots of bug fixes a campaign and random events. There is still some roughness to the UI but the game is improved and enjoyable. There is also an escape mode, which I haven't yet played but looks to put you in the place of the prisoner and attempt to escape. If you enjoy building management games, this will be right up your street.			"

For a text review, the original script has been provided below.Prison Architect is a real time strategy game similar to city builders. You are in charge of building and running a prison. You get to design the daily regime, customize room sizes and contents to your specific likings, control what types of prisoners get in and out of your prison, and try to stay in business.The gameplay of prison architect is what you could expect from city builders. You can designate a certain amount of tiles to a room, place objects in that room to help it function and try to find the perfect size for each room and distance between them. You also have to design your travel-ways, as letting prisoners travel through tiny hallways can lead to a lot of angry shoving and death. Add customizing and caring for your own staff to that, taking care of scheduling, and dealing with gangs? You have a pretty in-depth simulator here. Not to mention there's another game mode where you get to play as a prisoner and try to escape. That game mode is admittedly lacking and completely lacks a tutorial whereas the main game has an entire campaign that serves as an over-glorified tutorial. Overall there's a lot to do in this game. And with all the options? It's very fun and very addicting while you're doing it. This is one of those games where you start up your first prison at 8pm and look up, realize it's 2AM, and think, just 5 more minutes...now oh look its 6AM.The story of the game is actually rather interesting even though it is just an over-glorified tutorial. Unfortunately it suffers because the game also has a lot of bugs, which surprised me for a game old enough that the developers have stopped regularly patching it. The third mission in particular has a nasty one where you have to move riot police around, and if you go the obvious closest route you fail the mission because your riot police get stuck in a doorway and stop moving, defending themselves, and just generally responding. Other than that though, the whole campaign was well written and really tied together nicely while teaching you what you needed to know for sandbox mode.The graphics and sounds are both really lacking. The graphics don't bother me, but the sounds do. This game lacks a lot of specific sound effects and opts for ambience effects based on where your prisoners are and what they're doing based on the regime. That's why the cafeteria clatters and reverberates with silverware and voices during dinner but you'll find your prison woefully quiet during free time and lockup periods. This all does a lot to take away any immersion the game could have had, which is unfortunate, but not the biggest deal for an title in this genre.This game is an amazing simulator, and it doesn't suffer from the same traffic issues most games in its genre do where you build bigger and bigger and suddenly you can't get everyone where they need to go because they all want to take one route instead of the many available to them. It DOES however have it's own critical late-game issue I think you should all be aware of. It's the fact that once you have one of everything and a prison population that suits it, you get to a point where all you have left to do is repeat what you've already done. There's no expansion of districts or ability to connect distant places to make this easier like in city builders though. You are after a certain point of expansion, basically forced to start over in one of two ways. You can continue to expand the same prison by doing the same thing over again in some other chunk of free space you have left, which then brings in the hassle of assigning certain rooms to only service certain parts of your prison and all your funding will come from your own original profits since you've already used all the grants that help you build your prison. Or you can sell what you have made and start in a fresh empty lot with the value of your prison in your pocket, sort of like a new game plus and with all of the grants once again available to you. This process is what eventually had me quit the game. I think this is one of the biggest flaws all district-less builders suffer from though.Overall though, Prison Architect is a fun game. It's definitely above average, but it's not the indie gem everyone says it is.  This gets a 6/10 from me. I definitely recommend you buy it if you enjoy this genre when it's on sale because $30 for something you can experience all of within eight hours is not a good price for your money. If you really love this niche, then you'll love this game, and with modding support and the ability to save and share your prisons, it even has it's own little community of builders you can become a part of.It could have been better, but it's fine as it is. You'll have fun with it.			"

								I put 8 High Risk prisoners in a 5x5 holding cell with 3 guards Surrounded by a perimiter wall and a fence. They had no food, no beds and nothing to do except poop and pee and sit on the bench. A few of them rioted but were quickly subdued by the guards. They lasted 9 days before they all died.RIP those prisoners Serious Review:~Great game, plenty to do. ~Even though it is in Alpha stages I rarely see any bugs. ~High replayability.~If you want it, buy it. ~Cant go wrong with this game. 10/10			"

												""Prison Architect"" is a business simulation game, except in this case, the business is a prison, which brings a few more factors into the equation, in addition to the base principle of income-outcome ratio. The name ""Prison Architect"" might be a little misleading, though, as the game is not just about building and planning the prison, but also about running it, managing it, and keeping everything in balance. You're not just the architect, you're also the warden.While there's nothing really fancy about the graphics or the music of the game, the gameplay mechanics are where it shines. As architect/warden, you have to find the optimal balance between the financial limitations and the needs of the prisoners. The fact that we're dealing with prisoners makes everything even more interesting, as unlike the standard business manager or city builder, your ""customers"" are criminals and your job is to make sure they serve their punishment, as decided by the court. Should a convicted murderer have access to a TV? Should a convicted child molester be able to play pool? Those are just some of the moral dilemmas the game brings to your door.After clocking over 200 hours, I can say with confidence that at least according to my taste, the gameplay mechanics are very well balanced, and make this game one of my all time favorites. Having that said, I must also mention what I consider to be the game's one major flaw, which is the lack of optimization. I have decent hardware (Quad-core i7, 16GB RAM and a Geforce GTX465), which handles much heavier and at least as complex games very well. I see no good reason for a game like Prison Architect to lag on such hardware (on prisons with 500 prisoners or more), while games like Civilization: Beyond Earth and Cities: Skylines run smoothly, aside from lack of optimization by the developers.All in all, I consider Prison Architect to be a great game, a must for any fan of the genre.

Early Access Review
 PRISONER'S LOG: DAY 31   I woke up extra hungry today... I think the Warden is trying to save a few bucks and cutting our food... which doesn't suprise me. Cell Block D has rioted 6 times in 4 days, and multiple guards and inmates die every day. The Chief placed more patrolls there than anywhere in the entire prison and it still does not work. There have been rumors today that the jail Lawyer is fighting off the feds, who are trying to close the prison down.    But today was different, we didn't hear any screams or gunshots. Everyone in my block looked to see if all of the inmates had died, but they all walked to the showers like normal. But then, everything wen't downhill FAST. We all stood up at the first gun shot. Everyone looked out of the doors but couldn't see anything. Then someone down the hall from me started breaking the door, along with everyone else in the block. I joined for this might be my chance to escape. After most of us broke the doors, we ran straight for the showers. I noticed that the other prisoners in different blocks had joined us. Everyone ran straight for the guards.   I looked around before running in, and could not belive my eyes. There were bodies everywhere, dead guards against the walls, prisoners beaten to death, and a few construction workers were lieing on the floor, bleeding everywhere. Then a gunshot made me jump. I looked up and saw a prisoner from my block with a shotgun from a guard he just killed with a drill... maybe from one of the workers. Then from one of the radios I heard the Police Chief give an order-  SHOOT TO KILL . Then the shots were fired. I looked up to see both Prisoners and Guards shooting each other, everyone dropping like rocks.    But wave 2 came. Prisoners from behind me came running with nothing to loose. Some were bleeding and some had stayed behind like I did. I rand with them right into the enemy.   After a few minutes I had gained a few scratches but was otherwise fine. Everyone came to a hault to realise that we had ended all of the guards lifes. The onslaugh did not wait though, people rushed, prisoners came running into the kitchen, and all you could hear was screaming. Then people ran into the office building. More gun shots were fired and more screaming was heard. I was sure that everyone had died. We heard sirens. Backup had arrived.   More armored guards and guards covered head to toe in kevlar came rushing in. I ran, I was not a killer but I did not wan't to get captured (Or killed). I turned into a hallway I had never been in before and looked around again. Dead cooks, janitors, construction workers, gardeners, medics, and of course- Guards. I rushed around another corner and there he was... the armed guard that ended my life.   ALL EVENTS CAN HAPPEN INGAME! DEFINATLY WORTH THE MONEY "

								One of those games that tugs at your mind long after you've walked away from it. And I couldn't wait to get back and try new ideas.I like ""systems games."" Games where one designs a complex mechanism or system and then watches it go, usually to the point of failure, and then modifies and tries again. Prison Architect did this handily.There are some aspects that were either unfinished (Early Access) or beyond my reckoning. E.g. I found myself ignoring the prisoner dossiers, partly because I wasn't sure if it mattered.However, my wife and I spent hours poring over the layout, predicting movement patterns, course-correcting, and scrapping to try again. We would chuckle about ""checking in on our prison"" while away from the computer.I may have put it down for now, but I'm anxious to see where it goes next and pick it up again!			"

												This game is very fun if you like the Tycoon/Simulation kind of games. It is still in alpha so the game is still improving with new features added every month. The only problem I have found with Prison Arhitet is that there really is no goal. After a while you run out of things to do in the game because you get to a point where there is nothing left to add to your prison except to make it larger. Adding some sort of a campaign would be a good feature.Post-Release Edit: Hey, they added a campaign! I would have recommened it in Alpha, and I'll recommend it even more now that it's out with even more content.Strong 9 to a light 10. "

												This game is amazing, simply put. The graphics don't look good at all when you first start playing the game, but as you become used to them they can actually be quite pretty at times. The sound is good as well, though it can become pretty loud if you zoom in on a riot or other large scale events. The gameplay is fun, and it's really satisfying as your workers make the foundations of your next building, especially if it's a large one. The feeling of it slowly coming into existence is just awesome. And then there's the community. This community is one of the best I've ever seen, and it saved me from leaving a negative review and never playing again. I hadn't played in like 5 or so months, so I forgot that I had some mods on, and since those mods had been downloaded while the game was still in early acces, they had a huge negative impact on my game. There was a game breaking ""bug"" happening in my save, where the guards wouldn't move prisoners from the Reception to the holding cell, and I was about to quit the game. I started a discussion on the community home page with just 2 screenshots, and then within 6 minutes I got a response from a very kind individual, who noticed that I had some mods on, which might have been causing the problem. He suggested I disable them and see if that helped, and lo and behold, I had been saved from my own dumbassry. So yeah, I really do recommend this game			"

Good ThingsThis game is very stylisticly simple, which makes it easy to understand, adding to the simulation/strategy goodness. I was immediately able to understand all of the menus and icons, and navigate it efficiently in a matter of minutes. I especially liked how in the female prisons they include the family cells and nurseries, understandably not in the male prisons because females are much more favored to have custody of children in the eyes of the law, which is a nice touch showing an understanding of law and order and biases inside of it. It also pays attention to the fact that rehabilitation over deturrance is what some people prefer, adding in the Pacifier warden and offering different schedualed rehabs like alcohol and substance abuse recoveries.Now, the story is much different from this simplicity. The first one is very driving and shows lots of different emotions, displaying at least some of the psychology behind murderers and the spirituality touch just made it even better, even though I am not a very religious person. I believe that this game should cost even more because of the sheer quality of it, the stories being amazingly well written and the polaroid photos for just that added visual effect onto the general mood.Bad ThingsWhile there are very few, I find the system for unlocking things such as legal action are too long, and a simple fine would be fine, pun totally intended. The reason is that those things already exist, and while I realize in actuality it would take at least some time to unlock those benefits, you must also understand that waiting in a game simply isn't fun. When amking one, you should assume your player is not playing any other game, while at the same time checking for things like alarming similarities with other famous games to prevent the online community from yelling at you. This prevents things like long wait times, but also overused game mechanics and carbon copy characters ripped from other games.OverallAn amazing game with quite the gameplay and a great story, just some elements might need to be touched up if it is ever changed significantly in the future. I don't know, I'm just some random reviewer. Go ahead, scroll past this, see if I care.			"

Prison Architect is a top-down simulation game like the ages-old Tycoon games on PC. You're tasked with overseeing all aspects of prison management. The developer, Introversion Software, truly has thought of everything in this regard, too. You build the prison from the ground up, lay water pipes and electrical wiring, hire staff like guards, doctors, and therapists, install surveillance and emergency countermeasures, and if you eventually have the prison running as it should, then you have to keep it that way. This is done by keeping the population of inmates fed, content, nonviolent, and within the walls and fences of the institution. Because you're also operating a private prison, the endgame is to also make money. The introduction to the game's many systems can be extremely intimidating at first. Thankfully, this feeling of being overwhelmed is largely undone using the game's Prison Stories mode that doubles as a structured narrative and tutorial. Using simple cutscenes across several different scenarios, the game slowly breaks down all of its confusing menus and options into something that becomes more familiar. It even has options to quick-build rooms like cells, kitchens, dining halls, and so on. Still, after more than 235 hours with the title, it felt like there was more to learn in Prison Architect.Prison Architect is a deep offering of gameplay elements, interconnected systems, and emergent storytelling, but if all this sounds like more work than fun, you're probably right; this game just isn't for you. However if you're a fan of simulations, Prison Architect is one of the best there is.My personal favorite.THE GOOD- Great gameplay- Emergent story moments and character backgrounds for all inmates- Building/management freedom- Great tutorial- Deals with sociopolitical themes surprisingly well and maturely- Freedom to run the prisons in many different waysTHE BAD- Minimal sound design- Lacks soundtrackDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE "

												So ive played this game pretty extensively and ive made over 25 successfull prisons, so finally i think ive had enough experience to finally write an in depth reveiw of this game im not going to be one of those guys who sits there like"" THIS GAME IS GUD!"" and when kind of recently the developers finished development on this game and so here we go.For once in my life i have found a sandbox building game which can hold your hand if you want ,it is easy to play and easy to master it perfectly mixes fun with complexibility weather if your just messing around or being serious no matter what kind of gamer you are caual, pro, a little 11 yr old who has rich parents and sits there shouting at things when they dont go your way, there is something for everyone now thets get onto the pros and cons.Pros:*its fun and complex*the AI is smart but also has someflaws which can cause some funny yet sometimes annoying bugs*the shear size of area you can have giving you almost no limits*the amount of items in the game as well as the hidden sprites*it has a campaign*the developers are still fixing bugs*you can activate unlimited money at the start of a game*it can be in 3D through an easter egg*the easy controls*ZOOM TO MOUSE*escape mode!*the modding and normal community*the difficulty its perfect*its easy to learn*and above all its fun to playCons:*the Ai can be stupid*the developers have stoped the production on the game*its FULL of bugs*you can only get a few hours of game out of a prison *the character sprites are limited*no multiplayer (could be fun?)*the campaign sucks at points*escape mode is easy if you know what your doing*all of the modders dont have any new ideas these are all that i could think of in a ten minute period. all though i have named a lot of wrong with the game it doesnt dispite the fact that i LOVE this game, maybe im a little biased however i definatly think that anyone should at leats give this game a shot, its like a simple version of dwarf fortress that i will remeber for a long time. anyway thats all i have to say on the matter, thank you for spending your time reading this review and goodbye!

								Why do I like this game so much? Seriously, can anyone explain to me why this game is so bloody addicting? Why I keep finding myself migrating back and starting over on a whole new map? I can't put my finger on what it is about Prison Architect that engrosses me so much.You're building a prison. You can design it however you like. Make the new Alcatraz; or create a low-security retreat for minor offenders, or a prison from hell for murderes and thieves. Will you build a labyrinth of terror from which they'll never escape (unless it's to the execution chamber) or will you develop a cutting-edge rehabilition center full of cats, books, and life-skills classes? It's up to you.TL;DR You build a prison. Wall, rooms, utilities. Then you fill it with prisoners, and try to keep things running smoothly, with the amount of money you have. Pretty standard.You can turn on/off rules (endless money, oh yeah!) and pause prison intake if things are getting a little too difficult. YOU ARE THE NEW PRISON OVERLORD AND YOU CONTROL THEIR TINY LIVES WITHIN THE WALLS YOU HAVE BUILT.			"

								So you make a jail in this game. Yey. Build buildings and rooms that are used for various purposes all to make your prison... however you want, actually. After moving beyond the premise that you are building this unpleasant place, the game gives you significant amounts of freedom to choose what sort of unpleasant place it is. Will you make a rehabilitation center with classrooms, gardens, and plentiful opportunities to help your inmates? Or will you make an abyssal hellhole of concrete, armed guards, and abusive authority? You can make both in this game, and everything in between. As far as simulations go, the sort of creative freedom this game offers the player is exactly what all games of this genre ought to have. You can adjust everything from deciding what your prisoners do each hour of the day, the types of inmates you have in your prison, to what sort of punishments you deal out when those convicts decide to do something naughty like punching the cooks or trying to dig an excape tunnel through their toilet (eww!). There are nearly an endless amount of possibilities! :oIt's still in Early Access, but the game is very playable right now. I'm looking forward to seeing what else they will add, because what the game already has is excellent. Even if this game is apparently unfinished, you can still have lots of fun with it as you create the jail of your... choosing. XDIf you like simulation games where you build stuff, like SimCity or Tropico, then this is certainly a game worth looking into. Have fun!			"

Yeah.It's fun though! If you just wanna build and not stress yourself out, you can remove things like weather, and random events,so your people are very quiet, and kind (mostly) while you build away.			"

								Original review still below. I just wanted to point out that after a year of playing they have added tons of new features. Cool. However they have not been able to make proper guard AI.Why skip something so essential to do things that you don't really need?Typical big-studio way of working, and that's exactly why I bought an Indie game. Because I want it to work properly. The other 95% of the game is still amazing, but working guards are extremely essential. This is also the reason I haven't been playing anymore. No real use if the entire game comes down to luck.I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they will fix it, but if this is not fixed by time of release this gets a negative recommendation.--It's all been said before, it's the best tycoon-ish game ever made and the prisoner behavior is very realistic. You can build a 300 people prison or you can build a small cosy hippie prison with reform programs and make sure everybody is in a healthy state of mind. Going big and right-wing will be rewarded with money and going small and hippie will be rewarded with very subtle visual clues that tells you about an inmates substance abuse problem and a low re-offending-percentage.Oh yeah one thing to keep in mind. At this point in the development it's quite easy to build a 150 man peaceful LowSec prison. But building MaxSec prisons is still quite hard for me after 180 hours. I've made some that work and I've made some that were hellholes and I'm not a 100% sure yet what the big difference was. It's not as easy as the Tycoon games of the 90's.Oh yeah one more thing... Big prisons are very demanding on your computer and you'll need 80 guards if you want 40 patrols. Not because they need so much rest, but because you have to put extra guards everywhere because they do not wait untill they are relieved of their duty by a colleague before they split. So sometimes you think you have 5 men patrolling in a yard but suddenly 3 walk away and you got a Fight on your hands. And of course every extra moving entity in your prison is more CPU usage. So for the majority of us a huge prison is nearly impossible because of the chaos and the CPU usage. Guard, Dog and Workman AI has some other big problems too like sometimes they refuse to lay pipes for absolutely no reason and Guard Dog's keep biting unconscious inmates untill their dead, lowering the value of your prison (temporarily but still). But building a 100 person prison is a lot of fun too and I'm guessing within half a year it should be possible for everybody to build a big functional stable MaxSec prison. The state of the game is much better then most Early Access games I´ve played.			"

Hours played when writing review : 35In Prison Architect you can run and manage your own prison, take in inmates, starve your prisoners and force them to riot, make mods and maps for the steam workshop, and so much more.Pros :+ Descriptive tutorial for newcomers. Very useful if you are new to building/simulation type games.+ Can pause the game, go eat a snack, and come back. Or leave it running to build something huge, whatever works best for you.+ You can experiment with an unlimited funds prison.+ Can work on new prisons without deleting the old ones. Just make sure to name your save file!Cons :- Has sounds, which is nice, but I wish it had a soundtrack.- VERY RARELY staff will glitch at doors running around in circles. (To fix this just save your game, close Prison Architect, re-open it and it should be fixed.) Yes, the game is alpha but I still would like to point it out.Overall :8/10 stars.I played this before it even got onto steam, and I must say I have loved it from the start. Devs are very good at upkeeping the game and fixing bugs, as well as adding in new content when needed.Even the community for this game is very helpful.Need new steam friends? Feel free to add me!* Please comment on my profile you found me from my review. "

								I spent all my money building my first prison and when my prisoners arrived I realized that I forgot to hire guards. Now all of my prisoners are standing in front of my giant prison gate and getting angry because they don't get anything to eat. But not one of them tried to run away yet. I'm curious how many of them will be left when I finally have enough money to hire a guard.10/10			"

												Don't let the art fool you, it's not an easy game! You have to build a prison, there is a story, they have needs!- Own cell, or dormitory.- Food.- Work.- AA meetings.- Visits.- Chapel.- Extra security.If you don't please them they will riot and kill all of your guards. They can smuggle in drugs, steal key's, dig holes, everything! Make sure they don't smuggle out any spoons out of the cafeteria, they will dig a hole with it.I've been playing this game for some time now but still ill trying to get the hang of it, they keep adding more stuff! Seriously, be prepared because hell will break loose!Now they even got introduced a female prison and they even seem to be more aggressive then males, they killed quite a few guards already.. @_@ Heck, the female even need special treatment while pregnant!Oh man.. I love this game.. 12/10 will let my guards get killed again just for the thrill.			"

												Have you ever wanted to mercilessly starve hundreds if not thousands of prisoners of food, beat them to death with a variety of weapons, and systematically eliminate the right to privacy throughout your prison?No? Just me? Huh.Well, NOW YOU CAN!Play one of the best games on the market, in which you... um. What do we do again?Oh that's right, WE RUN A PRISON.You could go about doing the nice guy run through, you know, giving them prisoners a way to go back to everyday life and whatnot, but why do that when you can essentially use LEGAL SLAVE LABOR?!Yes, you read that right, you get to force prisoners to work in your prison for as long as you'd like, heck, even until THEY DIE, just so you can make and sell a few extra license plates. Who wouldn't want something like that?So in all fairness, give this game a try, and be the most brutal dictator you can. Have fun, and don't forget: Prisoners never stop wanting things, so it's fine to deny them basic human rights in the first place. Hehe, ""Human"" ""Rights"". Still makes me laugh.			"

												Heres my thoughts on Prison ArchitectThe Positives*Prison Architect is probably one of the best maintained games I have ever played*The developers are amazing, they listen to the community unlike most other game developers.  *I love the videos the developers make every month describing what new things they added or changed to the game. *The game updates at a consistant monthly basis including a large amount of bug fixes or features each month. *They are always coming up with new ideas like escape mode which allows you to be a prisoner of your prison or other community made prisons. *The gameplay itself has improved massively. There are so many things you can build, change, add, etc... even during the end parts of the game where you have built a massive prison with every aspect of the game included in your prison, there are always problems that need fixed and things need changed.The Negatives*I don't want to be a fanboy here, but I can't think out of the top of my head any negatives to this game.The Bottom Line*Prison Architect is a great game with amazing developers. I would recommend buying this game.			"

								Normally, an Early-Access game would get a Thumbs Down from me however, this one is different!This game is still in Alpha and has been for about 2 years? Anyway, it feels like a complete title to me, they have done a load of ""Bug Bashes"" removing the annoying issues you'd expect, they've allowed full Workshop modding into the game( Every singleplayer game should in my opinion ) and they've also added awesome features to make the game feel personal to you!Now, Obviously, the graphics aren't amazing and they're not meant to be, they're simplistic and that's nice! the art style is beautiful and most importantly for me, this game supports 1080p. ( maybe higher, I couldn't say! ) ...There's only one thing that's annoying me about this game and I wish was fixed ASAP. When walls are knocked down, the Rubble pile won't go away, you have to click ""Clear indoor area"" and outdoor Rubble won't seem to go away!Oh, one last thing I love, You have different ""Classes?"" of prisoners, Min, Norm, Max, Supermax etc. This is nice as it adds  a bigger challenge to the game!Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys logical games and/or building games. You're getting something truely special and this game is another reason why PC gaming is evolving so nicely!			"

												I built an prison that was pretty well made and to challenge myself with the escape mode. It only took me an week to escape/destroy my prison. My weapon of destruction was a lighter! - I wondered the prison during it's hour-long freetime session and I sneaked an office with the help of am ingnorant guard who willingly let me into it and I founded an lighter.-The next day I was trying to dig myself tunnel to escape through when an guard noticed what I was doing, so I ran out of my cell and was chased by a group of them with one of the armed guards. I used the lighter to attack one of the guards and the armed guard started shooting. Quickly, I started hitting him with it and he dropped his shotgun.-I didn't know whether not I could use the shotgun, but I took the risk and actually picked it up. I started firing and moments later other prisoners were fighting the guards as well until a riot rosed up. I killed the guards with only two shots of the gun and then riot police came in.-With the help of other prisoners who helped me take out two more armed guards and they took their shotguns, holding the riot police at bay long enough to where the floor was covered in the bodies of the police. I wondered off to see if the lighter worked while they were fighting and I set an huge fire that engulfed most of the prison (by lighting a lot of things on fire). - I along with some other guys fled to southern staff hall of my prison, breaking through the staff doors to escape through the southern prison gate. The two armed prisoners managed to shoot down a lot of riot guards, I even took an screenshot if anyone wants to see. - I managed to escape from my prison with luck, though I don't know what was the fate of those armed prisoners.Hope you guys like my story, escape mode is rather hard depending on the prison. I only got lucky that I started an riot when I got that shotgun. I recommend this game because of that mode.			"

								My friend Roughneck keep posting those interesting picture of this game so i decide to give it a try. GOSH.. I got stuck playing this game for 7 hours straight right after the first get go.It's basic a SIM clone in prison setting. But it goes way beyond SIM/SIM City. For indie..The graphic is quite unique and simple. There character movements are really smooth.The music is a bit too simple for my taste but does give you a good feel of the game. The gameplay is great. Prisoner keeps on coming and you need to house them, Search them, Isolation them, Feed them, Clean them, Medical them, Entertain them and even execute them. You need to pause every once a while to check up on everything to see if you missed anything.So far the best i can do is reaching 50 to 60 prisoner then my game start getting out control and riots everywhere. I will play again try to do better.It's a never-ending sand box so there is really no story involved.The game is still in earlly access and there is no achievements yet so you cannot really brag your progress until it;s implemented.The workshop for this game is really active, i havn't installed anything from the workshop but i do see a lot interesting things.This is not a game to pass up if you are a good architect and Sim/Sim City Lover.8.5/10			"

												I find this game to be obscenely fun and have logged almost 100 hours of play time.  However, I can't recommend this game due to performance issues.  The game does not hyper thread and will only run on one core of your processor.  As your prison grows larger your game performance noticeably decreases until it is simply unplayable.  In my current game I have 570 prisoners, 140 staff and a prison worth $1.7 million and get about 2 fps.  I am able to run much more graphics intense games at far higher fps with my rig.  This is very disappointing.  Hopefully the developer will work to correct this issue, if so, I will adjust my review.AMD FX 8350 Eight Core 4GhzDual AMD Radeon HD 7900 3GB32GB Ram "

												Kinda got hooked on this game. I learned to play with bugs many of wich are fixed now but It is sometimes hard to tell because you need to do things differently to test if your workaround is still necessary.I'm building a very large prison wich I had hopes to implements all difficulties with counter systems to keep a good score.But my biggest hurdles are :- the lag (frame rate) it did get better but I guess the game was not intended to build big prisons.- the planning tool absolutely need a copy, paste, rotate, flip feature.- building take a lot of time and there is no way to correct mistakes or design adjustements, after spending 60 hours or more on a prison I hate the idea of starting over because I need to move the whole thing 2 rows to the left.Going through the challenge of design, building, managing, troubleshooting, learning the game is super fun.But once you went through it and want to test yourself on a bigger scale the process is just to long and design corrections are impossible.I hope version 2.0 will run faster and have options to facilitate creativity.W7, I5 8Gig Asus Hero VI			"

								Prison Architect is an extraordinarly addicting game. Each playthrough you learn the do's and don't of how to manage a prison. This jourey is definetly a rewarding process. My first playthrough saw 7 of my first 8 prisoners escape through the multiple staff doors the janitors and builders kept leaving open. I fixed this in my second playthrough but by that time I had taken in too many prisoners and riots ensued. This game definetly has that replayabilty desired in a game; each playthrough I improved with tweaks to the designe of the prison. Prison Architect is definetly a rewarding experience for those with the time to invest.			"

												It's a shame that they decided not to add anything new to this game, because it's lacking a number of things that would make it a really good prison simulator. Namely, the only way for your prisoners to escape (other than leaving the door open) is to dig an escape tunnel, something only certain prisoners can do. They won't try and attack your guards to steal keys, they won't try to climb fences, nothing. Prisoners also do not exist to each other at all, except as things to beat up if they go on a tear, or murder if they are randomly assigned traits like Snitch and Ex Law Enforcement. These are the only kinds of prisoners that will have hits called on them; they will never be called on any other prisoner. They do not talk to each other, they do not form bonds with each other, they do not band together or dislike each other except as part of the optional Gangs system. The problem with the Gangs system is that gang leaders will frequently be assigned traits that make them extremely volatile troublemakers, rather than subtle string-pullers that never get their hands dirty. They will murder your staff, and then the rest of the gang will riot when they are punished for it, rendering the system more of a nuisance than anything.The game reeks of unrealized potential that was cut short when the dev team realized they had been working on this title for 6 years and wanted to be done with it. It may be released, but it is nothing approaching finished. They didn't even bother to hammer out a flexible, powerful modding API before they ditched it, so these holes will never be filled. Despite this, it's still a very enjoyable, fun game that you should buy and enjoy. But when you've played it as long as I have, you will always have that niggling at the back of your head that it's lacking a lot of important things.			"

												This game is very easy to get into, and surprisingly addictive. I'm not sure how many times I've sold off my current prison to start another because the layout that I had build wasn't ""quite right"". The different objects, rooms and game difficulties mean there are a lot of different options and setups to keep gameplay interesting after your first prison. There's a lot of experimentation to do in terms of how you deal with prisoners, how many staff to have, where to deploy them etc. The game's main sandbox mode allows you to turn off the failure conditions too, so you can even purposely run a terrible prison just to see what happens!I didn't personally get into the escape mode. Not because it's bad, it just didn't really have any appeal for me because it's completely different from the prison building aspect of the game - but it is definitely worth a go.Overall, the game has a lot of depth for what is essentially ""prison tycoon"", and will definitely be one of my ""go-to"" games in the future.

								In the first, i think this game is simply easy and a little bit frustrating. well, i was wrong. This game is REALLY FUN and REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! let me give you a real deal advice: DO PLAY THE TUTORIAL FIRST BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR OWN PRISON. Because this game is similarly like Grand Age of Rome or Tropico, some buldings are requiring other building, or some buildings are requiring a blue print which this blue print won't uinlocked unless you hire a staff, and the staffs are won't unlocked unless you hire a warden, and a warden isn't working unless you build him an office, and that damn office won't functional unless you put some requiring stuffs!! what the hell, right?!! So i repeat, DO PLAY THE TUTORIAL, BECAUSE I PLAYED FROM 12 PM UNTILL 5 PM JUST TO REBUILD ALL OVER AGAIN, AND FROM 5 PM TO 8 PM JUST TO REDO WHAT I'VE DONE IN 12 PM TO 5 PM LOL. but i REALLY ENJOY PLAYING IT. 9 / 10 untill the final vesion come out.

								Excellent game ! It is still in Alpha and the game is playable since a long time. First of all, to see a dev team that dedicated to their game is a plus, they regularly release updates, bringing new elements to the game, correcting some bugs but of course creating news bugs ! But it's an alpha ;)In Prison Architect, you start with your piece of land, some workers and a low budget. You'll have to turn this no man's land into a working penitentiary. Working penitentiary ? No, in fact you need to turn it into an industry that makes profit. Little by little, you and your workers will build your prison. At first it is going to be small and empty but over time and with income, your prison will look better. Your choice, an Alcatraz or a luxuary hostel ? As long as there is a way to make money, all choices are good. Once the basic dentention building is made ( kitchen, canteen, cells, showers and staff room,..Etc ) you are now able to welcome your first inmates. What will you choose ? Calm and nice persons who only made a mistake ? Or the evil men making your guards' lives a misery but who bring a nice federal grant ? Your choice and your responsability ! Then it's up to you to improve your prison, making it safe for everyone, impossible to escape and profitable!Prison Architect is already a big game, with its learning curve but once you get the hand of it ( should not take long ) it lets your with your creativity. You can build the prison th way you want it. You can make it looking like a smiling face or like fortress. But they don't always work and may lead to bankruptcy or to a massive riot that your special teams will not be able to stop,ending with all your inmates to escape. More than that, the game still has plenty of room for improvement and new features. Some are lacking but may be implemented one day ( gangs, ...Etc ). There is already enough to do and hours have plenty of great games. About graphics, well not everyone can like this 2D style but I like it. The graphics are simple but well adapted to the genre. It runs quite well if you meet the required specs. Bugs ? Yes there are bugs! It is still in alpha, but the devs need to fix some of them, those that ruin a prison like delivery trucks never stopping to your prison! The pathfinding for your workers also seriously needs to be fixed and/or improved, it is a pain in the neck to see them stuck in the corners of your walls. Other than that, nothing too serious. If you buy it, keep in mind it is an Alpha, everything is subject to changes and tweaks and so far, the game only improved.Building and managing your prison! For the better or ( and ) the worse, it's Prison Architect.			"

												It's surprisingly good. In terms of Steam games that I began playing in Early Access, this is one of three (Terraria and Kerbal Space Program being the others) that I would readily rank ahead of numerous triple-AAA titles.So, let's get the main question out of the way immediately: I strongly recommend this game if you're really into the Tycoon/Sim style of game. I'd probably give this about a 7.8/10, to be honest, which is solid for $29.99, but is a steal if you can get it cheaper.Now to the rationale for my decision:---------------------------------------------GOOD : You can play it on a simple level, or on a complex one, and it remains just as fun. If you enjoy sitting and connecting up elaborate electronic doors, CCTV cameras, and making the most efficient-yet-safe use of space as possible while trying to never have an escape or death, you can do so and find it a genuine challenge. Or, alternatively, you can turn failure conditions and events off, use old-school patrol-planning and little else, and even give  yourself unlimited funds.And the prisoners behave in ways where you can act simply, or really think things through. At first blush, it seems so simple as to why a prisoner kills someone. But if you get informants and look at info, you'll notice that murders occur more often for pretty logical reasons: victim is an ex-cop or snitch... murderer has a violent reputation... murderer was dissatisfied with several of their needs (hygiene, nutrition, etc.). You can ignore all this and just beef up security in general and take 30 seconds just to re-route a patrol and add a guard, or you can form a protective-custody cell block that is more isolated and start putting snitches and other prime-targets in there away from the Max-security cons.And you have the logistical tools to actually do all this... you can set individual schedules for each security-level, lay down specific patrol routes, assign certain blocks to be used only by certain groups of prisoners, and hire staff that conduct reform programs. It's a lot of fun, and you can pick how you want to play. And in the mean time, you can go around clicking on prisoners to see what ridiculous things they did to end up in prison. Great fun.-----------------------------------------------BAD :There *are* issues, however.My main gripe is that too many toys are locked behind tech unlocks. Which at first sounds like SimCity, another game where the neat special buildings have to be unlocked and even then you have to wait a painful amount of time to build them (here, too, money comes in pretty slowly). But here the issue is worse, because I feel like really, *really* basic things are too expensive simply to unlock:Why do I need to unlock being able to assign patrol routes?Why do I need to unlock being able to take out a loan? (though grants do exist for building specific things)Why do I need to unlock janitors and gardeners?And as far as I know, even if I play with unlimited funds, I *still* have to manually unlock these things, which don't just unlock with the push of a button but take time. And, similarly, there's no option for insta-build... if I play with no failure conditions and unlimited funds, why not also allow me to build things instantly rather than having to hire 50 workers and wait for my mega-prison to be built over the course of real-life hours, hours that are added on to whatever time it took to actually lay out everything for them to build?These are fairly minor issues in my opinion, and the Steam Workshop is a great place to go for some pre-built prisons, but doing that takes some of the fun out of building it yourself. Yet when building huge prisons, building it yourself takes you a while to give all the build orders, and then even longer to actually see the place be built. Which is fine when going for realism, but when I want a sandbox mode experience, it slows things up.Really, this game needs a full-out sandbox mode where I can build instantly, rather than just a couple of options that sort of approximate a sand-box mode.Again, not nearly a big enough issue to really hamper the fun for long, but does make it hard to experiment with designs numerous times unless you stay a bit smaller in scale.---------------------------------AND THE UGLY:Tooltips and info are really, really sparse for this game. The info is all there, really, but sometimes it's in a place where you might not think to look, or is so briefly covered that a bit of clarification would have been helpful. Right away, you assign reform programs, but it says no time is scheduled for them. But it doesn't say *why*. So you have to go to the scheduler (under Regieme) and hover over 'Work' to find out that reform programs don't have their own slot but occur during 'Work' time for anyone who isn't working. Which is already obscure, but what's worse is that you don't have an intuitive need for 'Work' time until you unlock 'Prison Labor'... so you might have already removed the default 'Work' time slot prior to deciding your unruly cons need some reform programs. It's a mess, and one that could easily be avoided if it said on the 'Programs' screen that your reform programs aren't scheduled because there is no 'Work' time slot (rather than just saying there's no time scheduled for them). And similar issues, though not always to this scale, exist elsewhere. When a room needs furniture to function, the game tells you exactly what you need... but when the room fails to function because an escape tunnel entrance is in it (mostly in cells), it doesn't tell you this. Which is an issue because the tunnels can sometimes be partially underneath some other sprite in the game, usually a bit of debris a work left in the cell after not throwing out the dummy left in the bed,It's an issue that goes away once you play a bit and learn the ropes, but it's an unnecessary learning curve that could be removed by including just a little more info here and there.The other 'ugly' issue is that a few sprites are unclear as to what is forward and what is backward. TVs, Radios, and garbage bins look surprisingly the same whether looking at back or front. This isn't a graphics issue so much as it is a design issue... the TV screen looks like the TV's back CRT area. Just make the screen blue and white and keep the back part black. It's not an issue for too many objects,  but there are a few where just a slight change of color would distinguish the back from the front.---------------------------------------OVERALL: It's part SimCity, part 'Tycoon', and part 'The Sims Go To Prison'. If you want your convict-sims to be able to kill each other daily, you can make it happen, and if you want a genuine challenge to keep them healthy and alive, you can make that happen, too. If you're into any of the three games mentioned above, I'd recommend this.  "

								I've put a fair few hours into Prison Architect, simply because it's a good game.If you ever played games like Theme Hospital or Dungeon Keeper when you were younger then this should be the exact kind of game you have been waiting for. In fact, if when you look at the videos of the game you think to yourself 'I think i'll enjoy that' then there's a 99% chance that you will.With Prison Architect what you see is what you get.Despite the game being in Alpha it is still full of features and is completely playable if you don't mind facing some rather amusing bugs. The first time I played Prison Architect I was a little apprehensive because despite many games claiming they are Theme-Hospital-Inspired very few manage to capture that level of addicted I felt when I used to play it. However with Prison Architect I was pleasantly surprised. I must have put 6 hours into my first play, building, destroying, restarting, but mostly learning. The tutorial gives you the basic knowledge you'll need to play the game but like most games from this genre, how you play is completely down to you. You'll probably spend your first play learning why metal detectors are important and why you don't need to buy 30 guards the seconds you play. The gameplay itself is solid and enjoyable with enough content to make it worth the purchase and keep you entertained despite it's Alpha tag. The menus are all very basic, and can be a little temperamental (the developers focus on content rather than polish at this point) and the graphics of the game are easy on the eye.  The updates come monthly, and usually bring one or two major new features (at least) and a ton of bug fixes so you're never left waiting too long to know what is going on which I think is an important part of Early Access games.Overall, I think the game is 100% worth buying if you're a fan of MicroManagement style builder games or you have a love as strong as mine for games like Theme Hospital and Dungeon Keeper.

												Prison Architect is, well obviously a prison sim. You build and manage a prison which can be quite fun in both building the prison layouts and managing the prisoners as well.It's a great game if you are into management and building (tycoon) sims.The only problem which makes the game less appealing is the poor optimization of the game overall, the game fps drops over time as you build and reach ~300 prisoner capacity even on a high end rig. Frame drops can be noticed on less if you build on large maps or buy a few land expansions. Playing on 15-30 fps can be slow and painful to expand further. I mean why have an achievement for 1000 prisoners when the game simply can’t handle it.If they could fix the optimization issues {which I doubt will happen now), it has a lot of potential.Overall 7/10 "

								In its current state, I think Prison Architect is quite expensive for what you get. But it is indeed a good game. As of Alpha 25, maintaining a functioning prison where anything can go wrong is pretty fun. The chaos that could break out in a matter of seconds requires quick player response to the issue, and can lead to some amusing situations which the player can learn from to improve their facility. The want to expand is always present, and it is likely some players will create prisons that are too big for their own good. The attention to details (education programs, the needs system, contraband, etc) continues to surprise me. The fact you are able to tell where contraband comes from, how it got in, where it went, and where it was found is just one of many of the detailed features that can affect the build of your prison. All this said, it is pretty buggy (it is an alpha after all), but I reccomend picking it up when it is discounted if you are at all interested.			"

								I wasn't sure about this game, since it was in Early Access, but I took a chance. And I lucked out, this is actually a really enjoyable game (kinda feels dirty saying that about a prison sim but it's true), with a lot of depth to it. I played for four hours and I barely scratched the surface so far. The one ""con"" if it can be looked at as that: certain aspects of gameplay aren't exactly intuitive or obvious. You might fumble around in the attempt to do certain things, until you finally get it ""right"". There are wikis and such online however, so nothing is impossible to accomplish between trial and error and outside sources. But the tutorial in my opinion is far too short and I'm hoping it will be expanded to explain certain things better (in my case, I was stumped by how to plan out the power lines/plumbing pipleines).Still though, even at this point in the game's development, I wouldn't call it a frustrating game. Instead I'd classify it as challenging at times, but a lot of fun regardless. Overall, I'd highly recommend it. It's one of the most unique sims I've ever played, and definitely more than worth the $10 I spent on it already.			"

Do I have cooks in my kitchen?Enough guards?Metal detectors?An escape proof outer wall?Enough cells?Water and electricity?Hopefully, because you will be needing these things to manage the place, and make your inmates happy, or they might riot, and you might end up with your guardforce killed and your prisoners no where to be seen...(you didn't see that escapetunnel, did you?)This game gives each prisoner a personality, some are better fighters others quicker or more likely to    be violent. Your inmates aren't a bunch of strangers. Most even have a family that wants to come and visit every now and then. There are even some religious dudes in your cellblock, so you bettter asign those workmen to build a chapel rather quick or not only the prisoners but even your staff might suffer.When you think the place is perfection, no one has escaped, no prisoners nor guards have been stabbed to death for weeks, then it's time to change roles for a little while.The game flips around magically, and all of a sudden you find yourself being a prisoner in the prison you just built. Your one goal is freedom, dig a tunnel, cause a riot and escape or have your fellow prisoners do it for you. It's your decision.Enjoy.			"

												It it is very nice program to design prisons and simulate how they will work, and if the prison is corrupt. The only problem is, it shows up in my games tab instead of tools. Other than that, it is a great way to design and test a prison for holding weeaboos before their execution.			"

												Prison Architect is a game that allows for a bit of insight into how a prison functions. The game is a bit buggy but none the less playable if you follow some strict rules to meet grants. One bug that is annoying is a loan grant that restarts every time you re-load a saved game. Grants essentially are goals that you have to attain in order to receive a lump sum of funding.Game play includes ability to make kitchens, laundry rooms, prison cells, solitary confinement, guard outposts, offices for accountants/warden, close circuit television (if fog of war is on), woodshop (for prisoners to work in), classrooms, yard and a lot of other specific room types. Planning your prison is actually easy as the game let's you overlay a shadow zone for future rooms. When building certain zones such as prison cells, they need to be a certain size as well as need certain furniture to be considered of use. So, a jail cell would need a toilet, a bed, and at least a 2X3 (tiled) area. Variation in staff is also a consideration of the game as prisoners and guards alike can become hurt. Doctors need to be hired to ensure proper health of all pupils within the prison. Other staff is available such as chef's (to cook for the prisoners), accountants, and even K-9 guard units. The game can get pretty serious as shotgun guard units can be introduced. Guards can be given patrol routes or can be assigned to designated zones. This is actually a very nice feature in-game that helps you quickly cover zones that need an increase in supervision. Prisoners themselves need down time and rooms with pool tables, TV's, or telephones to entertain them. As the head of the prison, you are able to put it on lock-down and are able to call a strip search of each prisoner at anytime. They also need conference tables for when they have visitors! If you like small micro-managing things like this, you'll definitely like the game.The art style of the game definitely sets it apart from other games. Triple A graphics aren't here, but doesn't mean there is any shortage of differentiating between a sink and fridge. Sounds are decent; if there is a fight, you'll hear it.Game is fun but can be repetitive after a few times playing. RATING : 7.15/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B- "

Early Access Review
								An absolute gem of a construction/simulation game! Even if it's in Early Access, I would say it's better than some games which have been full released, though this of course, is very subjective. Still though, the concept is incredibly fun and amusing, even though... you're constructing a prison for some hardened prisoners? Particularly in Early Access, you can also come across some bugs, but that's fine, Introversion is doing a great job working on the game, and ironing out these bugs while also adding more new features.The game has a bit of a learning curve, with only a very brief introduction before throwing you into the deep end. Why doesn't this or that work? But that's fine, you can only learn from your mistakes after all. Your prisoners have escaped because you locked your doors open? You forgot to build a perimeter wall? Your kitchen is too small to feed your prisoners? Well, you've learnt from your first mistake, your next prison will be much better! It's incredible just how quickly time slips by when you're building your own prison.The sandbox nature of the game is incredible. Even at this early stage, you are given many options with which to construct and expand your prison. Do you allow or deny your prisoners comfort? Don't worry though, their cells must be indoors and have a bed and a toilet... But the possibilities are virtually endless. You can give cells bookshelves, or windows. You can make paths between different rooms and buildings of your prison. There are a huge number of different rooms and objects you can place to improve your prison, which only makes the game much more fun and interesting.But that's not all! You manage your prison as you construct it, hiring staff (most importantly, builders to you know, build your prison), keeping your prisoners contained and reasonably happy, and completing your To-Do List. It can take a bit of work to figure out what you're doing wrong and what is going right, but the path is always an enjoyable one. Something that is only made better by the Steam Workshop support, offering incredible replayability with mods if you so choose - not that you really need to in order to sink many, many hours into this beauty.

Don't worry about that, you'll learn the meaning and the use of it just seconds after you fu*k something up!""So... It's a prison builder. You would think that there would be nothing really to do, other than boss around the inmates, but you are wrong. IVSoftware has made it really, REALLY detailed. And they make you care about your prisoners, especially if you have less ~50 prisoners. This game allows you to manage prisons in the way YOU want, with YOUR political or ethical standarts. And that is what a sandbox should be: the ability to express your creations the way you want and not be forced to do otherwise.Has great mod support and a growing community to make sure, that, even if you somehow get bored, you will be able to find something new to try out. But that is also a negative. After 8-12 hours I have done everything: completed the campaign, built a functioning prison with 300+ prisoners, played the ""Escape"" mode (which is a LOT of fun at first, but after like your third or fourth prison, each new prison becomes a speedrun on ""How fast can I break the shower heads and toilets, stirl up a riot, grab a shotgun and run out"". But, as it's only found in the ""Extras"" section, I believe, that this bare-bone mode is not finished yet, despite the game being released). All that's left is to find those meaningless photos and notes, in which I can't figure out the handwriting.All and all, this is a great sandbox and the price is fairly cheap for a game, that gives content for atleast a day, plus mods, plus replayability with different playing styles. I rate the game with an 8/10- a MUST try-out, with a potential of stealing tens or even hundreads of hours, depending on your taste.			"

Penitentiary ProblemsPrisons, an imperfect solution to an imperfect problem.You know it costs an average of £40,000 per year to keep a convict imprisoned in the UK, that's double the average national salary.With regards to financially motivated crime, it’s ironic to think that the offender probably wouldn’t have committed a crime for financial gain if they’d had the money it costs the tax payer to imprison them in the first place.Subsidised HonestyBut what’s the alternative; pay the potential offenders to encourage them not to commit a crime? Whilst I’m sure that would be incredibly popular with the criminal types, even I can see that it’s an insane idea.Then there are crimes of passion, insanity and cruelty to be taken into account, but what is the cost effective solution?There’s always the option of the death penalty, that would help keep the costs down but it is a little on the permanent side, although with regards to re-offenders, the record excellent!Designer Pen... itentiaryWhether the prisoner is going to be walking “The Green Mile” or not, they’re still going to need somewhere to stay whilst they’re in custody, not to mention facilities, food etc. Then there’s the man power required to keep the infrastructure ticking over.Someone’s got to cook the food, keep the facilities running and most importantly, make sure that the prisoners behave themselves and don’t do anything inconvenient like escape.When you think about it, there’s a lot of resource management involved.Before you even open the doors to the wrong do'ers, you need to worry about the design and construction of the prison itself with its own costs and complications.Play Pen...  itentiaryWith the design aspects, people management and juggling of resources, it’s a concept that would make a pretty interesting game and that’s where Prison Architect an early access title in development by Introversion Software comes in.Clean SlateIt seems that the adage “Build it and they will come” doesn’t just apply to baseball fields but prisons too.You’ll start the game with a patch of land and a bus load of prisoners already on their way to check in.It’s time to get building.Fixtures and FittingsThe first thing you’ll need to do is recruit a prison governor, who’s going to need an office, so you’re going to need to design and build that. He’ll probably want some luxuries like a desk and chair in his office too, maybe even a window and a filing cabinet, but all these things cost money.You should probably have a few prison guards to keep the convicts in line when they arrive.The guards are going to expect a staff room to relax in; somewhere they can sit and eat their sandwiches whilst watching re-runs of prison break, so you can add some chairs and a TV to the shopping list too.The TV isn’t going to work without electricity so a generator is a must, then you’ll need to lay down power cables and maybe running water isn’t just a luxury either, time to call the plumbers.OversiteSo your plot of land has now turned into a construction site, the prison bus is nearly here and we’re missing something vitally important. A place to put the prisoners!All in it TogetherYou almost certainly don’t have the time or the resources left to build a wing of prison cells; hopefully a large holding cell will do for now, all the prisoners will just have to be squashed into the one communal room when they get here.Perhaps we’ll spoil them and throw in a bench or two for them to sit on and a toilet for them to...  err... sit on too.Another Brick in the WallYou might want to place some prison walls whilst you’re at it, just in case one of your guests decides to make a break for it.It seems the honour system doesn’t work that well with regards to prisoners trying to escape.Fresh MeatSo the prison bus has pulled up outside and your newly employed prison guard is leading the “fresh meat” to the holding cell, but there’s no rest for the wicked.You’re going to need showers, a kitchen, an exercise area, a cook for the kitchen, etc. and some corridors and security doors to join it all up.Family & FriendsThere will be another bus load of prisoners along soon enough and now you’ve got your first batch of orange jump suited guests, you’re going to get family members wanting to visit them.It’s best they don’t see their loved ones all crowded around the one communal toilet in the holding cell, so it’s time to think about getting the contractors back on site to construct a visitors building too.I Predict a RiotThere is always something to think about in Prison Architect, something new will always need building, improving or changing.You’ll need to employ and manage staff, from physiatrists through to janitors.You’ll need to build a host of different room types, along with connecting hallways, you’ll also need to think about where you want security doors and cell doors positioned, because sooner or later there will be an escape attempt.If conditions in your prison deteriorate too much your inmates will riot, if they capture or kill one of your prison guards, they could well steal his keys, giving them access to unexpected places and likely lead to the death of more staff, still there’s always the national guard to help restore order.The View from the TopThe top down graphics are crisp and the tubby little characters that waddle around the prison in orange jump suits are cute, the simple art style on show here is surprisingly endearing and certainly helps alleviate what could be quite an oppressive atmosphere, I guess orange really is the new black.Busy HandsI stated earlier that there’s always something to think about whilst playing the game and this is true, but after you’ve been playing for long enough, things will start to feel repetitive. Build more cells, hire more guards etc. It can all start to feel a little samey in the late game when you’re prison is fully built and the only challenge left is to trying to squash a relentless influx of convicts into your increasingly overcrowded prison.It’s also important to keep in mind that at the time of writing Prison Architect is an early access game.Having said that, it’s been in early access for a while now and most of the bugs have already been ironed out. It feels like a pretty complete title and one which I’ve enjoyed serving time with.Voyeuristic Micromanager Wanted!Despite still being in early access, Prison Architect is a perfectly playable, absorbing and rewarding simulation, whether you’re the creative type looking to design your own penitentiary perfection, a voyeur looking to watch little fat inmates waddle around prison or just want to wrap yourself up in a blanket of micromanagement, you’re going to find something to enjoy in Prison Architect.A crime is committed every 5 seconds in England, another prison bus is on its way...For the full review and others please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ "

												A lot of games in the (city) building genre tend to all have a similar theme - while Cities:Skylines and Planetbase are fundamentally different in terms of gameplay they still offer very similar objectives - building a systainable city/colony where everything works. I know Planetbase is not the best example for this, it does convey my point tho. Here is where Prison Architect enters the field: It offers a completely new take on building something. Rather than managing big-scale cities and traffic you manage a Prison with all it's contents - cells, cell quality, laundry, cleaning, health. The game starts small, as many others, but you can rapidly expand and create huge Prisons. It is one of those games where you inevetably need to take multiple tries before finally getting it right as you usually run into problems. It is entirely possible to build a decent prison first try, but to get it running better you will need more tries and experience. The game has a great pacing, you can begin expansion shortly after getting your first prisoner intake, but at the same time too rapid expansion is effectively limited by staff count and money. Overall I can recommend this game as it is good fun and really enjoyable because it offers a unique concept and implementation.			"

								I got this in the last Summer Sale and I got no regrets. So far one of the most fun games I've ever played.Pros: + Doesn't have many limitations when it comes to build, so set your imagination free.+ You can name a Prisoner :D+ Easy to play, if you think the contrary please replay the tutorial (I was stuck here as well)+ Every prisoner is just a different ""person"" so you'll never encounter the same guy+ Beware of spoons+ Does not require a high end PC to run.Cons:- Doesn't have a soundtrack but yet has very good quality of sounds (Footsteps, building noises, cooking sounds, opening and closing doors so on)- Buggy, after playing 10 hours I came across a few bugs, two of them gamebreaking.I totally recommend this game, but I hope it can get outta Early Access.

								I used to be a big fan of management games such as Theme Park/Hospital, Startopia, Capitalism, Transport Tycoon, RollercoasterTycoon and so on. Back to those days i really wanted 2 types of those: a school management and a prison management game. Introversion Software realized some kind of childhood dream here, just thank you for daring to cover this harsh topic!Prison Architect is a 2D prisoner management game. You'll be asked to give each wave of prisoners a place to sleep, to eat, to wash and eventually to learn as well as ensuring the atmosphere is safe enough for them to go out of there in 1 piece. There is always something to do in Prison Architect due to the pressure of the constant wave of prisoners coming. This brings good dynamics to the game.Each prisoner has its own personnality, a good warden will quickly split those petty thieves and those murderers into different level of security within your prison. Treat any of them bad, and they'll soon riot. Give them a place to receive education and visits from their families, soon your prison will be famous for putting criminals back on the right track.Most of the time in Prison Architect, you're buidling. New rooms, electricity, water, fences, the content is big concerning the building part. The gameplay diversifies when it comes to drug enforcement, establish a security strategy, tunnel digging counter measures... I really like the way  it densifies the game. You also need to research to get new features and get extra cash from grants when you achieve certain goals.It's deep and well done. Graphics are unique, check the video above and you'll immediately understand. No technical problems are restraining you from playing the game except for the biggest prisons, but it's no big deal..At the moment of this review (10/2014) the game is still early access. The team is working hard and keeps communicating with the community. I didnt want to play the early access not to waste the experience but at the moment the content is so important that you can really have fun with the game.I strongly recommend you to play Prison Architect!

Early Access Review
								I actually really like this game and I liked it even more when I saw there was a workshop for it. I won't write a review like this game is perfect, especially when it's still in development, but it was pretty fun. This seems like a cartoonish game but it's actually pretty graphic. Just in the tutorial alone there's already sex and murder in some pretty good artwork (so props to the artist for shocking everyone). I did think this would just be a fun cartoonish game at first until I started playing it, I saw that it was more expanded than that. Each prisoner has their own name, age and story on how they got there. You'll actually feel sorry for some of them and sometimes you just have to put them up for death row. The game is pretty glitchy every now and again. I tried to open the in game browser and came back to everything flashing white. All my objects and staff were deleted and replaced with white blocks. I'm sure it's just a small glitch I can fix but it's still something to be taken into consideration--the game will malfunction every so often. It'll just be part of the risk of buying it early. I should also mention that I got this on sale at Humble Bundle. I've been waiting for it to go on sale before I got it because I don't think it's worth the original price. It's a fun game and all but 30 dollars for this is way too much. I'd say 10 or 20 at the most. So wait for it to go on sale, or get it while it is still on sale.			"

Not really, but imagine that instead of managing citizens, you're managing prisoners.Instead of drawing residence and commercial zones, you're drawing cells and kitchens.Instead of having UFO's destroying your city, the ''inhabitants'' of your prison are doing the destruction themselfs with no UFO's involved.Now take all of these, and put them all together, and...Congratulations!

												I really want to like Prison Architect, it's the sort of game i usually enjoy.That said it just feels like the scope is too narrow, there are obvious, efficient ways to build a prison and the whole thing feels more like a puzzle game than a simulation game as a result. The starting setup is constantly the same as you work out what the game will and won't let you get away with the starting capital. The room system plays back into this as even though you can make rooms larger than strictly necessary your budget rarely allows for this as the number of inmates continues to grow. The result isn't really your own creation but a bland concrete set of rooms of minimum size often back to back so as to minimise patrol spaces and lighting. Unlike Dwarf Fortress, Simcity or other building games it doesn't feel to me like you're building to your vision of a prison but rather the hyper complex and efficient warren the developers intend you to build towards.

								Yeah, you build a prison and do stuff. And there is a lot of stuff to do. With the 1.0 release its also possible to play as a prisoner in a selfbuilded prison and break out.There are a few bugs. But the developer did good work und they will fix it.			"

												Where do I get off not recommending a game I've played for 240 hours... ??To be clear, there's plenty to like about Prison Architect. It's rated ""Very Positive"" for a reason, so obviously you won't be throwing your money away if you purchase it. So my cavaet here is, if, like -me-, you want a real challenge, you want to have to work hard with your design in order to prevent prisoners escaping, then prison architect isn't really what you are looking for. It's a good simulation, but not really a game in that sense.The initial concept was super exciting. I got in on early access and started playing, and looked forward to fresh updates each month. I'd try out different base designs, figure out the mechanics, and then do it again when it was updated. But over time I started to notice a pattern. The basic framework already in place, most updates involved ""features"", like new room types, that fleshed out what you could do. But I never felt that the game became much more challenging from then on.I was waiting for staff to be given personalities, like sim hospital. Maybe some of them secretly being corrupt and passing on keys and supplies. I was hoping that prisoners would work together in forming their escape plans, maybe one group making a distraction while another made a break for it. I was hoping that we would get an AI which could analyze the points of entry and exit, figure out what weakenesses existed, and try and exploit those if at all possible. Thats a tricky thing to do maybe. And to be clear, what the game -does- do, it does pretty darn well. But it's not ultimately what I was hoping for, so it has left me disappointed.--------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:As of March 2017 the game had been updated a bit since when I first wrote this review, so I thought I would jump back in and see if I could now recommend it. I played with a new prison for a few hours to see if my original issues with the game still held.Unfortunately it was much as I expected. While there are a bunch of nice new features, the core of the game remains an unchallenging sandbox where it is almost impossible to reach any kind of fail state. Seeking a challenge, I tried the following setup and house rules.1. Small map. No trees for selling.2. No grants. No workshops. The only money I would have is what I started with, and what I would be paid for looking after prisoners.3. Permanent intake. As per intial settings, that means mostly medium sec, a few min sec. Inevitably you end up with a few people reclassed as max sec after they turn out to be crazed murders. So basically a nice mixture. 10-16 or so per day. I hoped that at least with these conditions, I could force myself into enough of a challenge that my puzzle solving brain could have some fun. At the very least, when it all went down in flames it would be fun to watch....Well, that was the idea. 18 days in, I've hit a population of nearly 200, and have a daily income of 11 thousand. Then I also have an extra 5-8k per day bonus when the next batch of prisoners come. It looks likely I could easily continue on in this fashion indefinitely, so I quit in disappointment. No challenge here, even using harsh house rules. What happened? Basically, I kept the prisoners indefinitely in holding cells. You stuff a few dozen bunk beds in a single room, add some toilets and showers, and voila, you can stuff a hundred prisoners in there, no problem. As the prisoners can sleep when tired in their free time, it doesn't really matter even if you are hot-seating them. The prisoner to bed ratio was maybe 4 to 1. The shower and toilet ratios far worse. Without the need to build cells for your prisoners, you really don't have much in the way of expenses. You just hire a new guard every day, a new cook ever other day, and here and there build extra beds and stoves. Now and then you make a new room to house more people, or you expand on the canteen. It was mind numbingly simple.Through it all I never had a single real riot. Snitchers were getting killed at a rate of one per day or so, but that had no real negative repercussions, so I didn't mind. Two things were very clear.1. The game remains easy to exploit. And without even trying very hard. Prisoners simply shouldn't accept me keeping them in holding cells indefinitely without getting very angry. However they just don't care. This means the game is fundamentally broken, as it makes many other features redundant. Cells? Not needed. Hence money, abundant. And workshops? Also not needed at all. Grants? Unnecessary.2. Most other game features are also entirely unnecessary as far as keeping your prison going is concerned. Prisoners didn't care that I give them pretty much nothing in terms of services/education/family acces etc. etc. etc. You just put them in a box, give them food, beds, some clothing, heat, etc. and thats it. The only reason to have half of the features of the game (libraries, stores, classrooms, etc. etc. etc.) is for the heck of it. Because you want a better score etc.So, my original problem with Prison Architect remains. It's fine as a sandbox to mess around in, I guess. But it isn't much of a game. You can't really lose unless you massively screw things up, and over half the features aren't technically necessary. By comparison, you can't finish a map in Theme Hospital without carefully and judiciously using all the rooms avaliable to you. You have to be clever to win at Theme Hospital. Prison Architect is maybe more like keeping some gerbils, and giving them some wheels to run in, and little plastic houses, and other fun little decorations for your own amusement. That's fine I guess, but it's not a game. Losing is fun, as they say at Bay12. But the opposite is also true.			"

												Well, Prison Architect is finally released. I've been with prison architect for a while now and let me say. They haven't let me down. The game used to be really bugyy, filled with little loopholes, AI problems, or simply backed up supply coming in. The core game was always there. For that I stuck with the game. I'll give you a little bit of a summary (?) on the game in general.Gameplay: As you can clearly see, I've played this game a LOT. Built tons of prisons, messed around with prisoners, built a sandbox prison. I did almost everything. Thing is, I'm still into it. This game is BIG on replayabilty. Honestly I think I've built near identical prisons and they never end the same. The game has been lately centered on randomness of the AI. You used to be able to run the game overnight and nothing would happen. The game has now made it that you will have to pay attention to everything that happens in the game. Riots, drug overdoses, escaping prisoners, angry prisoners, tired guards, you name it. Mechanics: The game has quite a few interesting mechanics on it. One being that prisoners actually work togethor on trying to escape, or they will constantly try to get contraband. You can choose to let the prisoners sit in thier cells and have the guards deliver food to them or you can let them run around in the yard and potentially get their ""goods"" from the fences. Good food, high costs? Small cells or big cells? Armed guards or normal guards? Lockdown or solitary? The game has a lot of choices for you to make for the prison, and a lot of them have a long lasting effect on your game.Asthetics: The game is very pleasing to the eye to view, eveyrthing is smooth, and they have worked on getting the graphics to work with each other. The prisoners and guards are different from each other; making them not a stereotypical guard or prisoner. Overall I would say that if you are for some reason worried about the graphics/asthetics or whatever you want to call them; you shouldn't have a problem wiht it.Humor?: Yes, I won't say too much, but once you see some of the prisoner's stories you will get a good number of laughs.Realism?: I would say this is a pretty accurate simulation of a prison. Prisoners have basic needs, as well as some extra ones like religion or drugs. Metal detectors detect metal tools and not medicine (duh) while dogs will help you with the actual drugs.Community: The community is a very funny one, and is overall accepting. No infamous sour community calling you a newb or anything. Most people offer their ideas of a ""perfect"" prison, and are usually open to give help or get tips.Sounds: Well, I would say that the sound effects of the game are pretty accurate when you get near a partifcular room. (Eg. Near a cafeteria you hear eating or silverware when near a prisoner working out you hear him working out) I would say they payed attention to detail but I wouldn't honestly expect stunningly amazing music.True Sandbox: Definetly is a true sandbox, variety of starting options as well as giving you unlimited funds.Too Easy? Too Hard?: This one game honestly lets you modify your difficulty. If you want difficult you tell yourself only max prisoners and conditions of losing. New to the game? Take in small amounts of prisoners that are maybe minimum and turn of conditions. It is really up to you how hard you want to make it. If lets say you do ""medium"" difficulty then you might find that its more difficult if you messed things up early on or are new to it. It may be easy if you are a pro at sandbox games. I would say if its too easy or too hard its probably you and not the game.Last comments: Thank you all for reading this review I know it was a lot to take in. I would strongly suggest that you buy this game. The devolpers have worked so hard on this game, they've created hundreds of hours of joy for people and have realeased updates pretty regularily.Rating: 10/10 I will definetly suggest this to someone else and look into their other games.

								If you always wanted to command people around and randomly punish them, by that start a Riot and get killed - This is the game for you!Seriously though, it's great and gets an update with an entertaining video to it every motnh on their YouTube channel too - At least as long as it's in Early Access.So, if you're in doubt if you should buy this game - do it! In my opinion it's already a full game, which you could release like this right now, without a doubt.			"

								One of the best games i have ever played! I have played over 100 hours of this game only because it is so unbelievably good. And it is also updating every month with new cool stuff. My prisons have changed a lot. When I was playing in the beginning, everything I mean literally everything was hard but after an hour or two I understood the basic content of the game! After that I just played hour after hour.			"

												I bought this gamewhen it was in Early Access, and.... damn is it fun. The mechanics are perfect, and there are a suprisingly small amount of glitches (when it was in Early Access, there were tons of them). They consistently came out with new updates, and everytime they did, I came back to the game and started playing again.Pros: Fun but simple aesthetics Interesting story mode Lots of materials/objects to try, which leads to a very diverse aesthetic in every prison you make. Unlike every other tycoon/management game ever, the game doesn't get easy after you get far into it. There are    random events and gangs that will screw you over no matter how far into the game you are. VERY balanced. I think this is my favorite part about this game - it's not ridiculously hard (like Dark Souls), but it's also not ridiculously easy. Replayable. No matter how many times I start a new prison, I always feel like it's new and different. I'm always excited to see where the game (and my brain) will take me.Cons: Buggy (it's not too bad, but you definetely still get them on occasion). Poor optimization. You would think this wouldn't be a big deal in a game with 32x32 graphics and small-scale prisons, but once you get up to a prison with ~500 prisoners, it starts to get very noticeable.  Incredibly easy escape mode. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, get this game because of the escape mode. You will be VERY dissapointed. The escape mode is a small, side-addition they added at the last-minute for a bit of fun. It's not something you will spend more than 10 minutes on at a time. You can escape any prison, very easily, by just following a simple recursive process:  Destroy > Surrender > Upgrade > Rinse & Repeat. Then you become a god because you have a 40% chance of insta-killing any guard. The only time I use escape mode is to see what my prisons look like from a prisoners POV. Sometimes I try to be as normal as possible when I do it - I just wanna see what it's like. Not much info on women's prisons. It's a relatively new release, but it seems rushed, and there are very few sources that actually explain how it works (wiki needs a LOT of updating). Small (and shrinking) community. Most people bought this game, made one prison, enjoyed it, and then deleted the game. I've been noticing this more and more now, as every time I come back to the game, I see less and less news about it that's not directly from the developers.9/10, would recommend to every single person who has enjoyed a management game sometime in their life.

												I once had a prisoner stab a man with his shank in the shower. Don't know how it got in there but whatever, later I put him in Supermax and executed him because no man should ever be murdered in the comfort of a warm and bubbly shower. (and because I was testing the feature)On a more serious note, I think I entered the alpha in Alpha 2 or 3 and from here, its progressed on a lot. Prison Architect is a fun cartoonish style management sim but with a twist. Every riot, murder, assualt, escape attempt, and execution brings you a step closer to building a more perfect prison. Yes, it's just only been released but its background has come a long way and the developers are very engaging with the community which really can't be found in the Gaming design industry. I applaud Introversion for their hardwork and dedication to bring about such a great prison sim.God it sounds terrible talking about a Prison simulator, but deep down, we all want to lock someone up lol.

												This game allows you to build a prison in any form or shape you want and then house the criminal elements of the state for the duration of their sentence. You can be strict and keep your inmates on a short leash. Constantly watching their every move and disturbing their nightly sleep with shakedowns and routine searches. Alternatively you can create a prison where it isn't actually all that bad to spend the next eight years. A place where inmates may work or go to school. A prison where your prisoners get good meals and loads of free time. The choice is yours.Your goal in the game of course is to earn money through your intake of new prisoners to make room for even more prisoners. You need to avoid the 'avoidable' deaths and preferably avoid anyone escaping your prison before their time has been served. Eventually though you probably feel that you have a pretty lean prison with no easy way out and this is when you test out your prison in the escape mode.Once you get into the shoes of an inmate, having to navigate the prison halls that you built, you suddenly get a feeling of how secure your prison actually is.I found that my first prison, one that I was extremely proud of until this point, was far from secure and I could basically trick myself out through the front door and then just make a run for it. I made some tweaks but in the end I decided to start over. My second prison was created with my own escape attempt in mind and I tried to prevent all the things that I had managed to do when I escaped from the last one. I still haven't managed to get out... I do excuse myself with the fact that I have to do it without a mouse though :SSeriously a great game!! And it runs on a MacBook Air of all things!			"

								Prison Architect (PA) is a brilliant village management / logistics game with unique game mechanics and an intuitive user interface. A new patch comes out at the end of each month which is accompanied by a humorous and informative YouTube video. The game feels rather polished at this point, though a few bugs persist and some systems could use expansion.There is a moderate learning curve, but grants (PA’s quest system) point you in the right direction in the early- to mid-game. You can select the order to attempt them (somewhat) and they don’t ever expire, though you can only have 2 or 3 at a time so it’s wise to plan ahead. The menus are easy to navigate and there are several overlays for displaying different types of information. You can pause and accelerate time freely, allowing contemplative or frantic gameplay as the player wishes.Prison layouts are quite malleable due to clear visual cues which make it simple to understand where the bottlenecks in your system are and correct them. Entirely redesigning sections of your prison is easy and enjoyable to accomplish. I’m not saying it’s a simple game; on the contrary, setting up a successful & profitable prison which is able to reply to situations automatically is quite difficult and rewarding.The logistics element is very robust. Many types of things arrive or leave via truck and need to be moved around your prison (e.g. prisoners, food, exports, garbage, laundry, etc.) and streamlining these processes is engaging and fun. However, there are some types of things that workers can pull out of their pockets, which is a minor quip that I hope will eventually change. Once you have several hundred prisoners distributed between the three security types (min, med and max), creating separate regimes so that they can utilize your facilities at different times is an interesting and fun challenge. Simply watching your prisoners and staff go about their daily business is engrossing and highly enjoyable.I started playing it in Alpha 01 (which was a mess compared to now) and have continued to play on and off since. At 200 hours of play time, it’s literally my favorite game. PA is fun at every phase of play; you are never short of projects to work on, even after the grants run out and you start making your own goals. Fans of city-builders & logistics management will enjoy the detailed interacting systems. Since there are no pre-set building / room structures, PA allows the player to be expressive in their layouts. Creative gamers will enjoy making interesting prisons and publishing them on the Workshop, and a recent patch improved Workshop mod support so it will likely blossom with complexity in the near future.Subscribe to “Fin Lake Correctional” (find it in the Workshop), to play my highly tuned 500 prisoner multi-security facility.

The rest of these features must be coming in later updates and then this game will be totally awesome!""What's that?These other features can be easily accessed through research in the bureaucracy menu?Are you flipping serious?!?!Looks like someone's going to be up late tonight!10/10  Would skip tutorial again.

Early Access Review
								You have installed a new metal detector at the exit of the cafeteria to curb the theft of cutlery, inmates are irate at the unnecessary search this yields and just as their anger hits boiling point all of your guards have decided it’s time to take a break or patrol some far flung region of your prison. If managing the incessant needs of digital prisoners sounds like your idea of a fun evening then Prison Architect may have you covered.Prison Architect, from developer Introversion Software, is in early access on Steam and is looking to bring a new edge to the management-sim genre. Now, before we start you are going to have to realise something pretty quickly: The first prison you build is going to be a horrible mess. A horrible, bloody, mess. While I thought I got the hang of the basic controls once I had played through the game’s introduction tutorial, I soon came to realise that actually I had only scratched the surface and my first prison mirrored something similar to the film Bronson – a violent, unmanageable mess – rather than the Shawshank Redemption vision I had in my head.But what sort of Prison Architect will you be? The game leaves that decision entirely on your shoulders once you’re settled with the basics; Prison Architect allows you to feel good about yourself, you will be able to build reform programs through education and enable prisoners to learn vocational skills through a workshop system that improves their morale and ability to reintegrate with society upon release. And, of course, if they step out of line you can chuck them straight into solitary to separate them from the main body of your population and leave them to rot which, in turn, provides a deterrent to the other prisoners who may be thinking of stepping out of line. Each prisoner you take in to your prison provides a revenue stream for you to continue improvements and is, of course, offset by the amount of danger an extra man or overcrowding your prison may cause. This delicate balancing act is how you’ll spend a lot of your game, earning some extra cash to improve but not wanting to throw too many inmates in at once.There is a simple tech tree which allows you to slowly introduce new ideas, staff members and rooms to your prison. You may desperately need an infirmary in your prison due to a riot that injured inmates and your staff or you have had a sudden intake of high-risk prisoners which means Patrol Dogs and Armed Guards are in order. Whatever type of prison you decide to build and how fast you need to expand is all down to how you set up the game to begin with. For a more challenging trial you can set it so you have a prisoner intake every single day at 8am and this means you’ll be focusing on some rapid expansion and introducing new cell blocks constantly while having the ability to switch off Prisoner Intake means you will be able to sit back and think about your prison design and put something together that makes sense and works far more efficiently and safely for your staff. You may have prisoners in with your main population that are awaiting execution – these are the most dangerous and likely to revolt because they have nothing to lose and need direct intervention by your guards on a regular basis. You can decide on the level of management you want on individuals and ensure they’re kept separate to the low risk, short stay offenders who may not need as much of your staff’s time.Prisoners will try and escape or smuggle contraband into your prison, they’ll walk around and take every opportunity to skip out on you by utilising any minor flaw in your prison’s design. But, once the day is over and their time is served, your prisoners will be released, reformed and hopefully willing to contribute to society once again. You can drill down and even micromanage every single need of your individual prisoners. You’ll see how long they have left to serve and and whether they’re likely to reoffend once they are released. You can hire a psychiatrist who will help you manage these needs and build the prison’s daily schedule to ensure everyone gets what they need from their day.

Early Access Review
								You have installed a new metal detector at the exit of the cafeteria to curb the theft of cutlery, inmates are irate at the unnecessary search this yields and just as their anger hits boiling point all of your guards have decided it’s time to take a break or patrol some far flung region of your prison. If managing the incessant needs of digital prisoners sounds like your idea of a fun evening then Prison Architect may have you covered.Prison Architect, from developer Introversion Software, is in early access on Steam and is looking to bring a new edge to the management-sim genre. Now, before we start you are going to have to realise something pretty quickly: The first prison you build is going to be a horrible mess. A horrible, bloody, mess. While I thought I got the hang of the basic controls once I had played through the game’s introduction tutorial, I soon came to realise that actually I had only scratched the surface and my first prison mirrored something similar to the film Bronson – a violent, unmanageable mess – rather than the Shawshank Redemption vision I had in my head.But what sort of Prison Architect will you be? The game leaves that decision entirely on your shoulders once you’re settled with the basics; Prison Architect allows you to feel good about yourself, you will be able to build reform programs through education and enable prisoners to learn vocational skills through a workshop system that improves their morale and ability to reintegrate with society upon release. And, of course, if they step out of line you can chuck them straight into solitary to separate them from the main body of your population and leave them to rot which, in turn, provides a deterrent to the other prisoners who may be thinking of stepping out of line. Each prisoner you take in to your prison provides a revenue stream for you to continue improvements and is, of course, offset by the amount of danger an extra man or overcrowding your prison may cause. This delicate balancing act is how you’ll spend a lot of your game, earning some extra cash to improve but not wanting to throw too many inmates in at once.There is a simple tech tree which allows you to slowly introduce new ideas, staff members and rooms to your prison. You may desperately need an infirmary in your prison due to a riot that injured inmates and your staff or you have had a sudden intake of high-risk prisoners which means Patrol Dogs and Armed Guards are in order. Whatever type of prison you decide to build and how fast you need to expand is all down to how you set up the game to begin with. For a more challenging trial you can set it so you have a prisoner intake every single day at 8am and this means you’ll be focusing on some rapid expansion and introducing new cell blocks constantly while having the ability to switch off Prisoner Intake means you will be able to sit back and think about your prison design and put something together that makes sense and works far more efficiently and safely for your staff. You may have prisoners in with your main population that are awaiting execution – these are the most dangerous and likely to revolt because they have nothing to lose and need direct intervention by your guards on a regular basis. You can decide on the level of management you want on individuals and ensure they’re kept separate to the low risk, short stay offenders who may not need as much of your staff’s time.Prisoners will try and escape or smuggle contraband into your prison, they’ll walk around and take every opportunity to skip out on you by utilising any minor flaw in your prison’s design. But, once the day is over and their time is served, your prisoners will be released, reformed and hopefully willing to contribute to society once again. You can drill down and even micromanage every single need of your individual prisoners. You’ll see how long they have left to serve and and whether they’re likely to reoffend once they are released. You can hire a psychiatrist who will help you manage these needs and build the prison’s daily schedule to ensure everyone gets what they need from their day. It is usually the silly things that tend to foil me in Prison Architect – the prison had expanded so rapidly and I had not thoroughly expanded my kitchen to an appropriate level and, therefore, half my prisoners weren’t eating during the one hour of meal time I had allotted which caused the starving to push back against my guards who struggled to control such a large rabid mob.Prison Architect’s simple two-dimensional art style feels crisp and responsive and allows the game to run on just about every PC or laptop you may have opening up the (Usual resource intensive) management-sim genre to a whole new crowd.

								Personal Rating: I didn't expect so much fun playing PA, happily impressed.Classic Rating: ★★★★☆Main reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is because of Early Access. Game is awesome but I had some issues in my last playthrough, so I'll wait the end of this year for full release before starting a new prison (and I already miss it).Suggestions for developers:● The plan tool should be improved letting us mark utilities too, being those a critical planning's characteristic.● Some events, like Bureaucracy unlocks, should be notified via text message, just like cash flow.● Side scrolling speed is way too slow when the visual is zoomed-in.● The clone tool should be able to select a wider area, because copying and pasting piece by piece is not comfortable at all; also I do not understand why RMB copies and LMB pastes, but there will probably be a good reason..Bought this game on Summer Sale 2015; it comes with Trading Cards, a nice Badge and Emoticons but it doesn't have Achievements (not that I do care much about them). Recommended? Absolutely.			"

												Someone tell Patrick McGoohan: turns out I was Number 1, not that monkey.This is a great management sim. It's not the game I wanted, but that's on me. I still won't recommend it, though, because as addicting as it is, it's never cathartic.I had fun blue-printing and building my prisons, but maintaining them was a chore. Every aspect of the game is needy, like a nest full of baby birds, gaping their ugly, naked faces at Mommy. Yeah, sure, that's management games for you, but there's meant to be some kind of nirvana when the juggling and plate-spinning all come together, and you impress yourself. Instead, I was the ultimate prisoner, chained to a never-ending series of wants and tasks that only existed to occupy me, not entertain me.By the end, all I wanted to do is exercise every cruel fantasy I have upon a population held captive inside a dystopian nightmare complex, but that's not this game. It's frustrating that is comes so close, but perhaps that's just in my imagination.			"

								I love this game. First thing I did once I had my simple prison was use bureaucracy to let my guards use tazers. I then Hired 100 armed guards, and had all 18 riot police on sight at all times. This made the prisoners very angry and made them riot. I then enjoyed watching the naked prisoners in the shower room get tazed in the nuts by my guards while they were rioting.9/11 would bang Jerry (the hot black one)-Kworr's Professional Gaming Reviews.

								A really good game, it allows you to build and organize your very own prison from scratch, abit like the sims cross between theme hospital, and it also requires you to gain and look after inmates and staff and make money to allow your prison to grow, the size of your prison can be pretty endless and at times it can be hard to look after.As you play the game you need to make sure everyone is happy, and has the right amount of sleep and food etc otherwise you can run into trouble with things like riots, property damage and deaths, which all has an impact on what you earn and lose profit wise, you also have to maintain water and electricity throughout the whole of your prison.Overall an excellent example of a modern day theme hospital style game, with alot more flexibility and fun.Note: At the time of writing this the game was in Alpha stage so there was a lot of bugs and issues.

												Excelent Game! The first chapter, that tells a typical history of a man that kills his wife and her lover when he catches them making love at his home, it's a great beginning of an addictive game that make the players spend hours and hours playing.The basic concept of the game is a prison (as is obvious from the title). You have to create a prison starting from nothing! You just have the help of the grants provided by the game that are four and help you with cash to build the basics of a detention center. With the time you are able to do many more things including put the prisoners working for you, earning and saving you money!And if you are not happy because you don't understand english or because you think that is very difficult to build the prison without the money provided by the grants or even if you want new textures to make the game look better you just have to go to the workshop and download(subscribing) some mods!Overall, the game is exciting and addictive. A perfect strategy and simulation game.  "

												Don't get me wrong by the ""Not recommended"" that the game isn't fun.  It's a very cool game.Problem is, it's broken.  I've been trying to play it for 3 days now, and can't.  Once I get my prison so big (40+ prisoners) and my staff gets pretty big...... the AI just pukes and dies....The maintenance workers and janitors cease to function.  They just pile up together and vibrate erratically.And thus with no maintenance or janitorial services, the prison falls into chaos.It has done this with every attempt.I have gathered this game was programmed by a couple of dudes...  and given the installed game files consist of about 8 files total (a couple dll's, a few dat's and an exe), it is quite obvious.This is a very amature piece of software.   It may play fine for some people, but not for me.I'd probably recommend this game, if it were $5 (about the max price it should be)...  but it isn't, so I'm not.It's just too much money to pay for something that has such bad AI.

												I like to start off with MinSec prisoners just to get me started, then bring in MedSec once I get going to replace the MinSecs that get released. Normally this works.Normally.My first MedSec prisoner was Simon Lane. I thought it was funny and went back to messing about on the other side of the prison.Then the riot warning pops up.Simon was Volatile.... and an Instigator.He just convinced everyone in the canteen (~300 MinSec prisoners) to be his personal army.My guards got zerg rushed by video game pirates before I could do anything. The spawned reinforcements died just as quickly.  They were about to breach the last door between them and freedom when I spammed armed guards and hit freefire just as they broke through.There were too many. For every weed dealer and flasher that went down five more took their place. Too many died and escaped.GG42/10 would massacre a horde of internet pirates led by a dwarf again.			"

								I've put 50+ hours into Prison Architect so far, and I'm incredibly impressed by the amount of content and general stability.First of all, despite being in Alpha, it does not give the impression of an incomplete or unpolished game. Gameplay so far has been smooth, apart from occasional lag when the game has been running for a long time, and I have yet to experience any game-breaking bugs or crashes.What makes Prison Architect unique is the prison-building system. Walls, floors and furniture are not enough; one has to carefully plan out their layout to accommodate for electricity cables and water pipes, all of which have to be laid out by the player - perfect for anyone with OCD-like tendencies like myself. You also have full control of guard patrol routes, prisoner regimes, meals, contraband searches... to name just a few.Integration with Steam Workshop also allows players to show off their prison set-ups, and anyone remotely interested in the game should definitely take a look at the layouts I have linked below, which were inspired by the Star Trek Enterprise and the Tower of London.Updates and fixes are released frequently, and I found the developers to be very responsive. The best thing about Early Access is the opportunity to pitch suggestions and feedback directly to the team while the game is still in development. I've played released games with more bugs - please don't let the fact that it's still in Alpha put you off.It's very exciting to be part of Introversion's new project, and I can't wait to see what will be added next!P.S. Make sure you add the character I submitted (Andre ""Snake"" Silva) to your prison!			"

												This has to be the best builder to date. You build then manage any type of prison to your liking! Manage or even micromanage right down to the quality of food your prisoners eat. Be fair though, otherwise they will Riot! Get bored an become a prisoner in your own or someone elses prisons. Give it a 9 outta 10, only flaw I see is the AI security an even doctors give the impression theyre working blindfolded. To many times you see injured prisoners and 14 doctors doing nothing!			"

								 I've tried a lot of Prison Tycoon games, but all were failures. But this is a true architect game.  Not a easy game to pick up and learn. 6 hours in game and I'm still kinda learning. But very potential game when you manage to make it work. The game was very well developed. I like the fact that i can check the file of each prisoner and see the crime that they did.It's also fun to see them roaming around on their free time, getting some exercise in the yard or suddenly charging out of the prison for an escape. I can say that this game so far been very technical on my brain. But very challenging. The utilities mode is very fun as well, installing electric cables, and water pipes to supply the shower room and toilets with water. It's also fun to watch the prisoners fight the guards.All i can say is that the game was very well thought of and very well developed. Up to date, there are already #13 updates since the launch of Prison Architect. Developers really looking into making this the perfect prison game. Keep it up. Looking into more game time with this game. "

												Prison Architect is something of a tycoon game that requires the player to build and manage their own security facility.The player is focused on creating a healthy environment for both prisoners and staff. Hiring management staff unlocks new programs through the bureaucracy menu that promote business, health, and security inside your facility. I would compare this game to something like Zoo Tycoon where you're essentially caring for profitable pets.The true beauty of this game, in my opinion, is the vast amount of options and room for creativity. Build a supermax hellhole or build a Scandanavian resort prison. Punish your prisoners relentlessly or spoil them like children. Crowd them into packed cells or build them modular apartments. On and on and on.Included in the game is ""Escape Mode."" In Escape Mode, players take the role of single inmates and must work toward gaining a reputation by starting fights or destroying equipment to recruit team members. Steal tools and supplies to help you escape. Hatch elaborate plans with your recruits and make a break for it.The Workshop content means the game never ends. Escape from your friends' prisons or take on a challenge from the community. Workshop is also endlessly great for use in management mode.8/10			"

												So before I go into depth with why you should buy this game, let me just summarize it all in the beginning. 10/10, simple as that.Now this may be a tad biased seeing as I have a HUGE interest in law enforcment and such, but honestly this game is amazing. Believe it or not, there is a story mode. And its really, really, REALLY, heavy. Like seriously, theres no sugar coating. The story mode also serves as a tutorial, where for 4 ""levels"" you have to build certain aspects of a prison, and in the final ""level"" you have to make a prison from scratch and meet a set of goals. The building mechanics are really well done and create a sense of immersion, while still allowing the game to flow. All of the prisoners enter your prison with different traits that determine if they are a force to be rekoned with, or someone's b*tch. There is a gang system, which creates prisoners that have specific gang affilitaions. Sometimes you will get a gang leader in your prison, and if the leader is punished, the members of that respective gang will become upset. Not to mention, there is a WORKSHOP PAGE for this game! So if you were in fear of it being one of those games where you play for an hour, get bored, and never open it again, have no fear! There is constantly new content coming out on the workshop page. Everything from user made prisons, to mods that change the game completley! Anyways, I could ramble on forever about all the little cool features and extra content, because there is a ton of it. But for the price, this game is without a doubt worth the money. If you love creating something from nothing, and watching it grow and earn money, yea, this game is for you.			"

Once you get to that point it might lose some of it's appeal, but hopefully once it's out of early access you will have more challenges and more reasons to keep going. I've encountered no gamebreaking bugs, and very few smaller ones which I could plan around quite easily. If you like to plan and build, get it ASAP. If you don't like to plan and build, still consider giving it a chance at some point.			"

								Some say I have an over active imagination and that the power has gone to my head.I never thought I could have so much fun running and building a prison. , But I say ..Hold on...NO convict Burke deserves 3 hours in solitary for trying to sneak alcohol to his cell.Convict Jones 8 Hrs lockdown for trying to sneak a spoon out of the canteen !!! Prisoners work hours increased to 14 hours a day and Yard time down to 1 hour a day !!!!Do we have enough funds to build that new wing yet ? I have 28 more scum shipping in tomorrow !!Rehabilitation is what they need NOT 3 meals a day ??? WHAT THE HELL ?? THIS is NOT a holiday camp!!!AND WHY IS MY ELECTRIC CHAIR NOT WORKING YET !! ??   ARRGhhhh !!Where was I . . . oh yes, great game once you get into it, loads of fun but don't get carried away like some people I've heard about ;)Warden SgtGadget.			"

								I have had this in my library since it came out on steam; its one of the few games I keep coming back on PC for and that means alot considering it's an early access game and I own a shelf full of triple A titles on console.While there may be a website to help IVSoftware keep up with the bugs and glitches (Mantis Bug Tracker) the developers take an alpha out of the calender to keep on top of the bug database, making the game playable - despite having the odd prisoner getting caught in a door - but llets face it the games only in alpha so bugs like that can be ironed out.This is an amazing example of what indie developers can achive. Buy it now and help it progress if you don't mind bugs and glitches but I must say: make sure you buy this when it's been fully released.- Owen Marshall 13/12/14			"

								Its being sold for 2 bucks on sale right now but i do not regret buying it earlier for a full price. Its one of the few early access games that has been updating constantly and at a steady pace. Each version brings something new, better UI, deeper gameplay, extra features and bug fixes. They listen to suggestions and complaints and try to address them asap, they add features when requested and polish everything over and over again until its acceptable to players.At the moment this has to be one of the most intricate simulators, with a lot of micro and macro managing features out there. Every little aspect of your prison population like meals, sleep time, work, study and contraband can be managed.I do wish they added female prisons and multi-cells though. Other than that - its almost finished.This, kerbal space program and craft the world are the prime examples of how early access games should be done and how players should be treated.			"

												I have had this game for a while now and have loved it! Although the concept is rather bland the way the developers incorperated so many features is great - I feel like the dificulty is a great level for all ages however there is some blood and death scenes so I would advise 12+. I also love how the installation of mods don't change the game, but add features (more callouts, riot makers, etc). I found this game very satisfying and will be playing more, a lot more! For the £20 it is worth it, honestly. If there was a star system it would be five star to you! Good job, keep the work up!			"

Early Access Review
								--------------------- Intro--------------------Prison Architect puts you in charge of: designing, building and managing a prison.You can build anything from cells for your prisoners, offices for your staff, kitchens, canteens, power generators, solitary confinement to yards, work shops, infirmary, CCTV and so much more.Conduct research to gain access to higher tech, new staff and facility types.Make daily profit from your prison and cash-in big when selling it off for a bigger balance to start your next prison.--------------------- About the Game--------------------While the game is easy to learn and after a few attempts you find yourself doing quite well, it is hard to master the bigger facilities and the many prisoner's needs.The game has a great tutorial which nicely introduces you to the game mechanics, how to build and manage a prison.Ones you passed the tutorial you are placed on an empty map you can start your prison on. You can either just go ahead and build a small prison you are comfortable with or expand and take on the challenges of high security prisoners and high security techs to help you overview you prison.During the game you can take on ""grands"" which are sort of like quests. You get a certain amount of money upfront and upon achieving the outlined tasks get a further monetary reward. You make money every day from the difference between the money you make from housing prisoners and the money you spend on facilities and staff.You also can do ""research"". Some staff when hired or some facilities when build unlock the ability to research new staff roles, facilities or techs which allow you to even further expand your prison and ability to control it.If you get bored of your prison you can, after some time, have it evaluated and sell it for a nice sum of cash you can use when starting your next prison.--------------------- Early Access Note--------------------Personally I have not yet come across a major bug in the earlier stages of the game and the stability of the game is very enjoyably. The only minor bug I came across is when you build a door on a wall before you build the foundation, the foundation will build a wall over the door and you need to remove/re-add the door again but that's nothing to even worry about.I believe only at the higher end of facilities and staff are there bugs/missing features, such as when hiring lawyers and such, they apparently don't do anything yet for you. Though that is so far beyond the starting point of the game that you will have many hours of fun before you even get there.You always can sell your prison before you expand to that level and start again with more cash on your next endeavor until the next game patch/update fixes those issues.

												After spending many hours building a prison, I decided to take a test run as a prisoner and see what damage I could do. This was the result:Have you ever been trapped in an insane asylum, surronded by brutal savages waiting to rip your throat out at any given moment? The only thing protecting you is a small green door that could easily be broken down in a matter of seconds?This is the case of Officer BlackLady (BL for short).The prison was running smoothly on a fine sunday afternoon, all was calm. The prisoners had just gotten off of their three hour work period and were going on a break for lunch. BL and the other staff members chit chat in the cafeteria, but BL steps out to use the ladies room. In the cafeteria, all the prisoners line up to get their daily slop. The newest inmate (lets call him Brick), sits down to eat his meal. He goes to reach for the salt, but as he goes to pour, the lid pops off and all the salt pours onto his meal, ruining it. ""Who the ♥♥♥♥ did this...""Brick's salt levels reached an all time high, never before had anyone seem this form of salt. He leaned over to a snickering inmate, and ripped him in half. His blood spilled onto the ground as the other inmates look on in terror. One of the guards attempts to subdue him, only to be pummeled to the ground. This display started the unforgettable riot. The entire cafeteria exploded into a hellish war zone of flying fists and meat chunks. The guards were all blitzed and had all their weapons taken. Some were brutally beaten into an unconcious state, while others had their heads dipped into the boiling pots of water. They prisoners exploded out of the cafeteria in a hellish manner, inciting others to join the riot. Within minutes the entire prison was being overrun by prisoners with tons of illegal contraband either stolen in the raid or hidden from earlier points.On her way back to the cafeteria, BL saw the riot, and quickly took shelter in the infirmary. There, she saw all the patients assaulting the doctors who were working, some being stabbed in the neck with syringes and others being gutted by scalpals and knives. One young doctor (lets call her Cherry), was being cornered by one especially unruly inmate. BL jostled him down, grabbing Cherry and rushing her into the morgue for safety. They locked the doors behind them, turned off the lights, and hid in a corner, hoping nobody would see them.The riot went on for what seemed like hours, hundereds of guards were murdered, multiple prisoners escaped, even the cooks and janitors were gutted and hung out to dry in the yard. BL and Cherry were the only two survivors in the onslaught. After the noise calmed down, BL looked out of the window to see the horrid landscape. Bodies laid in the yard. Prisoners and Guards alike. Other prisoners simply walked over their bodies, carrying weapons and looking for any survivors. BL knew that some of the more insane prisoners would stay behind, waiting for backup to arrive, just to claim more lives and shed more blood. These were the sick and the deranged, the ones locked up in the basement always forgotten about. She gave Cherry her gun, told her to use the emergency phone to call for help if she didn't return, grabbed her baton and stun gun, and exited the morgue, locking the door behind her. She carefully snuck around the prison looking for anyway for her to safely get Cherry out of the prison. As she turned the corner to the cafeteria, she was ambushed from behind. As she fell to the floor, she whipped out her tazer and electrocuted the man on top of her. Pushing him off she made a dash for the exit, hoping to find someway to save Cherry afterwards. As she turned each corner, she could hear the roars increasing behind her of prisoners out for blood. She bolted out the front doors and headed for the hole in the fence to freedom. With each step she heard them closing in. 20 meters. 10. 5. ""Almost there"" - she said to herself. Only three yards from the hole, she was tackled to the ground. She tried to fight off the inmate, but was quickly surronded. It was no use, she was dead. The prisoners began their assault, kicking and punching her. The life was about to leave her body when she heard the gun fire. A prioner dropped dead at her side. The back up SWAT team finally arrived, and swiftly shot down all the prisoners. They grabbed BL and brought her into the back of their van. She told them about Cherry, before finally falling unconcious.When she awoke, she was in the hospital, Cherry sitting at her side. On the TV she saw that the prison had finally been secured once more, but the body count was in the thousands. BL looked over to Cherry and smiled. That was when the knife had entered her gut. She looked down to see the blood, and looked back up at Cherry. That was when she remembred, the hospital had a psych ward attatched to the infirmary. Cherry was no doctor, she was an insane inmate looking for a way out. And now that BL was dead, there would be no loose ends. Cherry walked out of the hospital, bloody knife in hand, and walked off into the sunset.Prison Architect 8.5/10Would ruin my own prison again.			"

												Prison Architect is a breath of fresh air in today's video game industry which is oversaturated with annual releases and rehashed concepts. Prison Architect puts many current AAA development titles to shame by having lots of replayability. The campaign alone has a lot of meat on it, I've spent 9 or 10 hours on it before going into free mode to build my own prisons (you can do this at anytime and don't need to finish the campaign to do so). While Prison Architect is obviously a game where you can construct prisons, it is also a game where you can play as a prisoner and try to break out of prisons (either your own or one of the many available from the Steam Workshop), this was a welcome surprise to me after being disappointed by The Escapists. The architect mode is a delight as well, you have a whole slew of options when it comes to prison building and management. You want your prisoners locked up 24/7? Go for it. You want to have reform programs such as woodworking, laundry washing, and/or kitchen duty? You can. Want to build a death row and pull the switch on your prisoners? You can do that too, you sadist :P If you like managing, building, or destroying things then this is likely the game for you. While Prison Architect isn't quite my game of the year so far, it comes close and the developers have more plans for the game on the way. Prison Architect is a solid 10/10 in my eyes and is well worth the price tag.			"

								So I was building my first prison, then I found out that I could expand the land so I started over with a new prison. Then I found out about something else and started building another new prison. It keeps going on and on and on and now I'm currently building my 9th or 10th prison. I'm quite satisfied with the current unfinished prison but I might start over again.Good game, hope there will be 10x more objects & materials added, at least.As its current state, this game really has potential.7.5/10			"

												OMG i cant believe i never reviewed this game!! This is very Fun addicting and with Mod support it will be playable for many many years! I got this when it first came out and keep coming back usually when i cannot get online i load this on up.If you enjoy management sims and watching your game grow and grow as you add and take care of needs this is for you. Reminds me of the days when games were made to be fun not just flashy pretty things that you will be bored of in two hours then they will sell you Expansion pack after expansion pack.			"

												Short story:I had to buy a new video card to play this game as my old one couldn't handle it. It was the best $230 I've spent on a game in my life. Long story:8:00pm - You think to yourself, ""just one more room. I'll just build a canteen and stop. My prisoners have got to eat somewhere!"" But you don't stop at the canteen. To supply the canteen, you need a kitchen. But to power the kitchen you have to put down power lines. While waiting for it to build, you notice that the floors are dirty, so you hire some janitors. They're struggling to get through the cell doors, so you replace them with staff doors to save time. By now you've run out of money so you open up to your grants. ""There's a grant to build a hospital and hire doctors,"" you see. You were going to do that anyway, so why not get paid for it? Now you're scouting out a good location for your hospital. How many hospital beds to you think you'll need? Two? Four? A hundred? You get your workers started on the foundation for your hospital. Shoot. You need more guards to patrol the new hospital. Hire a few more guards. The staff is complaining that they're overworked and in dire need of a staff room. Got to keep the staff rested so that they work at top speed! You figure out where you're going to put the staff room and get the workers on the foundation. By then, you're able to go back to the hospital and route power to the new area, not to mention adding the beds and other requirements for a hospital room. You've overtaxed the power station with the new area, and get the workers to add some capacitors to increase the power.  All of a sudden, in the real world, your sister tells you that it's 1:00am and that you should probably go to bed. Rinse and repeat for every session I've played of this game since I installed the new video card. This game is very engaging and there is always something to do. Highly recommended!			"

Early Access Review
								Throughout the course of playing this game right from it's early alpha in October it has been a blast, forcing 20 prisoners to shower in a 4x4 room and finding men in jail cells who had a facial expression I could only describe as 'bench' was the highlight of my day for at least a month solid: but I had to progress. The world of maximum security prisons is a dark place. Guards recieved a shiv at least 3 times per day and I was would have been frankly unsurprised to have seen a large amount of comlaints of destroyed sphincters rolling through my psychologist; by the end of this period, my sphincter actually felt empathy for those smaller prisoners only in for larceny who had come up against homocidal 3 metre tall 400 pound Tyrone the  wife beater in my 4x4 showers. Morale of the story is, this game is a blast, but just stick to the orange prisoners...			"

												I can't believe I've not reviewed this game. It's amazing. Graphically simple, but it doesn't bother you. It's a really nice game to play.The pesky criminals are always trying their luck... I'm a nice warden as well, I give them nice cells and lots to do and how do they thank me? By murdering my guards and beating my doctors to death.It's really cozy!The developers are great. They've been involved and active from inception to delivery. I bought this as soon as it came out, more to do with loving Uplink that actually wanting it. But when I started playing I was hooked. It's a time stealing game that you will definitely love. Plus, when you get tired, you can mod the hell out of it.			"

												I find it very hard to find a game that I enjoy. Prison Architect however is my most played game and one of the few games that I seem to be able to keep coming back to. I love it because I can play it in a more passive way. I can sit there building a nice prison while watch a stream on Twitch, or watching a tv show/movie. Of course it is not all passive, and things can get pretty intense during a riot or when fights break out. I intentionally will treat my prisoners a little poorer so that I earn more spending cash, but also so that fights happen more often.I have had this game for a long time (Sept 2014) and have followed it through all the progress through the early access into the full release. It is crazy how much they have updated and how much they have fixed.Also the performance in the game has greatly improved and old prisons I had with LOTS of prisoners that used to give me a lower FPS now no longer do. Overall this is a great game that you can sink as much time into as you want. It is also easy to add mods using the steam workshop, and you can check out other people's maps and even try to escape from them.			"

The game is like any sim city builder but in a prison ! much more intresting.Pros: - Amazing devs that keep working on the game and make it even better then it allready is.- Great campaign that also works as a tutorial but is really fun to go through.- Intresting addition with gangs and the way other prisoners work together really makes you feel like you are fighting to keep your prison alive- The devs keep adding new content to play with and enjoy- Overall great game would recommend to everyoneCons :- Can be laggy when there are too many prisoners ( 800+ ) - Sometimes workers glitch out a bit wont do there job			"

								Build and run a prison.  Pretty hard to do actually.  Build a larger and larger prison to keep more and more prisoners.  Hire staff, make sure everything is secure, and keep the prisoners content.  Why?  Well if you don't, they riot and people can get hurt or killed.  There are however certain things you must do that will make them unhappy.  For example, you can check everyone for hidden weapons and other things they aren't supposed to have, and you can search their cells.  They don't like it, but you need to do it.  As you play more, you can research things.  New kinds of staff to handle new problems, upgraded security, and so on.  The game is actually fairly complex, there's a lot to it.  I didn't play the full tutorial, I suggest you do.  Also, it's fun to play with unlimited money.  It means you can test all kinds of things, and learn without having to worry about screwing yourself over.Pretty fun game overall.			"

												Prison Architect is the game that proves that you don't need flashy 3D graphics to have a great game.   The 2D visuals are still attractive nonetheless.  The only graphic deawback is the people but if you can look past that, you're in for a treat.        Let's start by saying that good prison games are hard to find.  and this one is the best prison simulator we will have for the next 10 years and here's why...    The detail of building your prison is immense.  You can design and build everything from a dormitory detention center to a full blown supermax prison complete with death row (yes, there is an electric chair).   You can even build female prisons!  Some women come complete with babies and need places to care for them.       After you get the prison constructed enough to begin housing prisoners, you then dive into running the place.  This is where the real fun begins.You'll manage food distribution, finances, the daily schedule, reform programs, drug addicted losers, staff, guards, what offences get what penalties,  the list goes on and on.That's not all, there is a full weather system so you'll need to supply heat to your prison or your inmates will complain about being cold.    Find and confiscate contraband from cigarettes and booze to weapons and escape tools.  These people will smuggle in all sorts of stuff from the visitation room from mom and dad to their buddy throwing drugs over the yard wall!     Got a prisoner doing time in solitary for getting caught with a knife?   see if he is willing to be a confidential informant in exchange for his release from solitary (not the prison).   Now he will sing like a bird and tell you who is carry what contraband (that he knows of).   He'll tell you if he knows of an upcoming trade or drug deal.  He'll fill you in on when a drop over the wall was arranged or if Joe Smith has a tunnel started under his toilet!     Best of all are gangs!  The confidential informant will also tell you who are gang members and gand leaders (that they know of).   They'll tell you who is strong, volitile, fearless, etc.   Gangs will take over territory in your prison.  The red gang might have control over the yard and the blue gang grabbed the common room.  The gangs will extort money from regular prisoners to use the room's facilities.  (Charge an inmate to use the weights in the yard for example.)  You must stop these gangs from taking over your prison!   Deploy guards, armed guards, K-9 dog handlers to take back territory.  The K-9 can sniff out drugs as well as find tunnels.      This is so much more than a building game.  The designing and building is very fun but the real fun begins when you get a lot of prisoners and especially if you have gangs enabled and they begin taking over parts of your precious creation!Once you get your prison escape proof,  load it up in ""Escape Mode"" and be a prisoner yourself!   That's right,  you can be a prisoner in your own prison!   Now you can test just how easy (or hard) your prison is to get out of.   Recruit a team of buddies, get in fights,  smuggle a weapon from the workshop,  dig under your cell to find freedom!      There are loads of mods in the Steam Workshop that make this game even better.  There are graphic mods that remove the ""cartoon"" look of the game and add more ""HD"" looks to it.  There are mods that completely add new reform programs, objects, building materials, people and staff,  etc, etc..  The game is very British,  which is ok.  But there are mods for other languages as well as American terminology.    The developers are finished adding new content and will be tying everything up in a few months with a completed, bug-free version, or so they say.   So the game is near completion.The best prison simulator on the market,  hands down.   If you own any (or all) of the Prison Tycoon games,  they have been executed and will rest in peace.   Throw them all away and buy Prison Architect right now.   You will not be disappointed!			"

The simulation raises challenges for the player to balance the game well and manage everything that is going pretty much parallel.However, there is still much potential for Prison Architect to develop. Things such as customization: different walls textures, greater detailed tech tree (tech tree is pretty shallow), storyline: Cell 211 scenario? etc.Simply amazing. 10/10 would play again and again and again.

												Prison Architect is the game that proves that you don't need flashy 3D graphics to have a great game.   The 2D visuals are still attractive nonetheless.  The only graphic deawback is the people but if you can look past that, you're in for a treat.        Let's start by saying that good prison games are hard to find.  and this one is the best prison simulator we will have for the next 10 years and here's why...    The detail of building your prison is immense.  You can design and build everything from a dormitory detention center to a full blown supermax prison complete with death row (yes, there is an electric chair).   You can even build female prisons!  Some women come complete with babies and need places to care for them.       After you get the prison constructed enough to begin housing prisoners, you then dive into running the place.  This is where the real fun begins.You'll manage food distribution, finances, the daily schedule, reform programs, drug addicted losers, staff, guards, what offences get what penalties,  the list goes on and on.That's not all, there is a full weather system so you'll need to supply heat to your prison or your inmates will complain about being cold.    Find and confiscate contraband from cigarettes and booze to weapons and escape tools.  These people will smuggle in all sorts of stuff from the visitation room from mom and dad to their buddy throwing drugs over the yard wall!     Got a prisoner doing time in solitary for getting caught with a knife?   see if he is willing to be a confidential informant in exchange for his release from solitary (not the prison).   Now he will sing like a bird and tell you who is carry what contraband (that he knows of).   He'll tell you if he knows of an upcoming trade or drug deal.  He'll fill you in on when a drop over the wall was arranged or if Joe Smith has a tunnel started under his toilet!     Best of all are gangs!  The confidential informant will also tell you who are gang members and gand leaders (that they know of).   They'll tell you who is strong, volitile, fearless, etc.   Gangs will take over territory in your prison.  The red gang might have control over the yard and the blue gang grabbed the common room.  The gangs will extort money from regular prisoners to use the room's facilities.  (Charge an inmate to use the weights in the yard for example.)  You must stop these gangs from taking over your prison!   Deploy guards, armed guards, K-9 dog handlers to take back territory.  The K-9 can sniff out drugs as well as find tunnels.      This is so much more than a building game.  The designing and building is very fun but the real fun begins when you get a lot of prisoners and especially if you have gangs enabled and they begin taking over parts of your precious creation!Once you get your prison escape proof,  load it up in ""Escape Mode"" and be a prisoner yourself!   That's right,  you can be a prisoner in your own prison!   Now you can test just how easy (or hard) your prison is to get out of.   Recruit a team of buddies, get in fights,  smuggle a weapon from the workshop,  dig under your cell to find freedom!      There are loads of mods in the Steam Workshop that make this game even better.  There are graphic mods that remove the ""cartoon"" look of the game and add more ""HD"" looks to it.  There are mods that completely add new reform programs, objects, building materials, people and staff,  etc, etc..  The game is very British,  which is ok.  But there are mods for other languages as well as American terminology.    The developers are finished adding new content and will be tying everything up in a few months with a completed, bug-free version, or so they say.   So the game is near completion.The best prison simulator on the market,  hands down.   If you own any (or all) of the Prison Tycoon games,  they have been executed and will rest in peace.   Throw them all away and buy Prison Architect right now.   You will not be disappointed!			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR at the bottom.Note: This is an early access review.It needs to be said that I am an Introversion fanboy.I have been following them ever since they first made Uplink, and the diversity of their games just keeps on amazing me(and I'm not using the A world lightly).Now with that out of the way, let's get down to it.There are a few comparisons to other games that I could pull to give a better understanding of what this game is like, but I assume most other reviews have already done this, so I'll skip this for now.Prison Architect is quirky prison design and management game.You start off with an empty lot of land, and a few workers.You design the prison, they build it.The more cells you have, the more prisoners your prison can hold.The more prisoners your prison can hold, the more money you get.This was a very simplified explanation, but in essence that is how it works.You also have to manage the needs of your prisoners, much like in the sims.As long as they have facilities to take care of their needs, they will do so themselves when they can.If these needs are not being taken care of, you might just have a riot on your hands.The MAIN objective of the game, to me at least, is to get a nice and tidy prison with minimal fights, where all the major tasks are somewhat automated and streamlined - leaving me to take care of the expansion of the next wing.Some people like to build care-bear prisons with cake and parties(exaggeration for effect) while others build Guantanamo Bay kinds of prisons with daily probing for hidden items and similar activities.How you play is your own decision, but all in all, we still are building prisons.In this early version of the game, there is enough content to have you forget about the ""outside world"" for a few hours, until you start feeling hungry(unless you planned ahead and brought foor to the PC).There are a lot of hidden mechanics that you will learn by playing the game, and with this knowledge you can improve your next prison and try to avoid the pitfalls you have had to climb out of in your previous attempts.If you for whichever reason were to run out of stuff to do, there's always the Steam Workshop, where more content is just a click away.So for the verdict:Should you buy this game? You've read this far(or skipped ahead, you little cheat, you) - So you must have some interest in it.If you are at all interested in management type games, then this is a game you do not want to miss.Yes. That's with a capital ""Y"", and even it it was in the end of a sentence instead of the start I'd still say it's a Yes.TL;DR - Great management game. Buy this game.			"

Or make your prison a literal concentration camp in which fighting results in 7 armed guards punishing you with shotgun shells to the neck. 10/10			"

												Short story:I had to buy a new video card to play this game as my old one couldn't handle it. It was the best $230 I've spent on a game in my life. Long story:8:00pm - You think to yourself, ""just one more room. I'll just build a canteen and stop. My prisoners have got to eat somewhere!"" But you don't stop at the canteen. To supply the canteen, you need a kitchen. But to power the kitchen you have to put down power lines. While waiting for it to build, you notice that the floors are dirty, so you hire some janitors. They're struggling to get through the cell doors, so you replace them with staff doors to save time. By now you've run out of money so you open up to your grants. ""There's a grant to build a hospital and hire doctors,"" you see. You were going to do that anyway, so why not get paid for it? Now you're scouting out a good location for your hospital. How many hospital beds to you think you'll need? Two? Four? A hundred? You get your workers started on the foundation for your hospital. Shoot. You need more guards to patrol the new hospital. Hire a few more guards. The staff is complaining that they're overworked and in dire need of a staff room. Got to keep the staff rested so that they work at top speed! You figure out where you're going to put the staff room and get the workers on the foundation. By then, you're able to go back to the hospital and route power to the new area, not to mention adding the beds and other requirements for a hospital room. You've overtaxed the power station with the new area, and get the workers to add some capacitors to increase the power.  All of a sudden, in the real world, your sister tells you that it's 1:00am and that you should probably go to bed. Rinse and repeat for every session I've played of this game since I installed the new video card. This game is very engaging and there is always something to do. Highly recommended!			"

								Build and run a prison.  Pretty hard to do actually.  Build a larger and larger prison to keep more and more prisoners.  Hire staff, make sure everything is secure, and keep the prisoners content.  Why?  Well if you don't, they riot and people can get hurt or killed.  There are however certain things you must do that will make them unhappy.  For example, you can check everyone for hidden weapons and other things they aren't supposed to have, and you can search their cells.  They don't like it, but you need to do it.  As you play more, you can research things.  New kinds of staff to handle new problems, upgraded security, and so on.  The game is actually fairly complex, there's a lot to it.  I didn't play the full tutorial, I suggest you do.  Also, it's fun to play with unlimited money.  It means you can test all kinds of things, and learn without having to worry about screwing yourself over.Pretty fun game overall.			"

												I can't believe I've not reviewed this game. It's amazing. Graphically simple, but it doesn't bother you. It's a really nice game to play.The pesky criminals are always trying their luck... I'm a nice warden as well, I give them nice cells and lots to do and how do they thank me? By murdering my guards and beating my doctors to death.It's really cozy!The developers are great. They've been involved and active from inception to delivery. I bought this as soon as it came out, more to do with loving Uplink that actually wanting it. But when I started playing I was hooked. It's a time stealing game that you will definitely love. Plus, when you get tired, you can mod the hell out of it.			"

												Fun game overall, I think I'm about done with it though.What I like:+ Sandbox mode+ Fine-grain control over almost everything+ Custom character bios can be amusing+ Can't just leave overnight, requires constant attention for escapes, etcWhat I don't like:- Not much replayability- AI for staff can be really dumb- Limited customization (textures, etc)- Performance is bad with larger prisonsI've sunk quite a bit of time into the game at this point, building several prisons as I figure out how everything works. Once you've got that worked out, though, the game gets fairly boring. Most of the fun is in designing and building the prison, but after you know what will keep prisoners happy, you build until your prison is complete (or until performance sucks - I've gotten up to ~2000 cells and it seems to happen around ~1500) and then there isn't much to do aside from sit and watch.One major complaint is that the staff AI is idiotic at times. If you're building, say, a 5x5 room, the game will pull 25 staff members to build one piece each - even if a few staff members are right there and the others are across the map. The few that were there could have completed the room by the time the others got to it had they built more than one piece. Multiply that on a large scale and it can take forever to get things done.Legendary prisoners can be difficult to handle - hopefully you've researched permanent solitary before they arrive, and build a separate SuperMax wing just for them. Annoying that they can repeatedly murder prisoners and staff and it just adds to their sentence (i.e. you get to deal with them for even longer) instead of promoting them to Death Row at some point.Lots of other minor gripes about how some things need to be built a certain way to function correctly.Overall, though, I've spent a lot of time building things and it was definitely entertaining at times. I'd recommend the game (on sale, for sure) if you like the architect/tycoon genres.			"

												I build a prison that holds hundreds of convicts. Prisoners are happy, except for occasional shotgun sounds that slowly decimate my population.One day, Richard arrives - a legendary prisoner. Sentenced for a total of 10 years. I treat Richard like a king in his own prison mansion. He destroys the door with his fists and kills the gardener. Richard is sentenced to two hours of solitary, but decides to break out of his high security solitary cell, kills 5 armed guards and proceeds to mow down prisoners, guards, and armed guards with a shotgun. He is tazed and sentenced to solitary. Repeat multiple times.Richard is locked into a building without exits. His sentence continues to rise as a regular supply of new cooks that are locked in with him is needed.One day - after killing yet another two cooks - he is sadly assassinated by ten armed guards. He dies after only 8.2 out of 2408 years. His legacy lives on as a new legendary prisoner arrives.2408/10, would sacrifice dozens of guards and prisoners again.No prisoners were harmed during the making of this review.			"

Early Access Review
								I wouldn't have guessed this game was early access if Steam didn't tell me. I'm very impressed by this game, and have sunk way more hours into it than I would have expected. I'm a huge fan of games like Roller Coaster Tycoon, and Sims, and anything else that involves management type ideas.This game is really neat (lol good descriptor, yes?) You control the layout of the prison, completely from scratch. You can make a dank dark prison, or a lofty posh apartment complex for inmates. The inmates are unique and many have quirky names and stories that introduce you to the personality put into this game by the developers. You control the daily schedule for the prisoners, programs and classes, police force and type, patrols, their dining experience, their in-prison jobs (laundry, license plates, cleaning etc.). There is so much I could continue to say - for a game that is about building a prison, it's so inolved and quite frankly just so much fun. My only regret is not buying some of the additional content while it was on sale!My fiance laughs when he can hear a riot break out ""oh, is Featherstone stabbing people again?"" Yes. Yes he is.

								I bought ""Prison Architect"" because I was sick of playing the types of games you use once-or-twice and then never again because they were so repetitive.  ""Prison Architect"" is quite different.  Every prison cell you create results in a change in scenario.There is a variety of prisoner characteristic's which in turn all produce another element to the game.There are also multiple regimes you can create for the prisoners which define's the mood and behaviour of the prisoners.Its a great construction and simulation game with great amounts of action which requires some thought and strategy to keep your prison running.   I recommend this game to anyone who likes to play games that are intellectually challenging. OK, I like to play the odd racing game now-and-again aswell, but for something a bit more stimulating ""Prison Architect"" will be right up your street.			"

								Prison Architect is just a fantastic game. At the beginning taking out grants and building a basic detention centre can be very easy, but you have to make sure that you think of all the factors that could affect your prisoners. One wrong move and you may go in the red.You have to gradually expand your prison, instead of allowing tons of prisoners at once. For example, if you have maximum security prisoners, you cannot accept them all at once in the beginning, because of how the prisoners will react to the little you have in the prison at the beginning, and you have to make sure that you accept prisoners at the right time, or they will just riot.The variety of the rooms and programs the game has is just phenomenal in this alpha stage, all the extra activities and programs the prisoners can do and you can expand on really makes the game never get boring.I highly recommend this game, especially in this stage of development where you can see all the new rooms and interactions being added into the game, because I think that many more things are to be added into the game.  Score  76/100 (date 13. 4 2014 v.Alpha20)  Buy it?  If you want.			"

Aside from just building the actual prison there's many more features included in the game that make it fun. The game has a campaign you can play and multiple options for map creation when you want to start a new prison. Overall, definitley a great game, and absolutley worth it when on sale!			"

								I had to completely blow-up my original review.  This is one of the most-balanced games I have ever played.  It is fairly easy to learn but the challenge seems to grow slightly faster than I can keep up.  I always feel like I am building structures just to keep up with demand.There is a bug or two that the developer is good about fixing but for the most part the game is flawless.  The only glaring omissions from the game are guard towers and a plant operations building (i.e. cooling towers etc.).It's a very solid game in the builder genre.  Although I recommend getting it on sale for around $20 I wouldn't hestiate to buy it at $30 either.			"

												I've watched this game grow for quite some time.  The developers released monthly updates along with videos of them discussing the changes and future plans of those updates.  I had no doubts in them finishing the game when I paid early access.  I wished more developers were like these guys, people would have more faith/patience in early access games if that was the case. I like just about every aspect of the game.  Everything they added I felt was necessary.  PA is a great game, and I still recommend it.  I feel something was missing from the game though. I still can't place what the problem is.  The fact that its just building prisons maybe? Want more depth? not sure... But I really think its the campaign or lack of challenges it has to offer.  I feel like they could've added more or done a lot more, with unique scenarios. Sort of like how roller coaster tycoon did.  Anyways, I've put a lot of hours in, I still come back to play every now and then.  The game is wonderful. The developers are wonderful.  And I hope they keep up with the updates even though this pretty much a finished product. "

												Update after 160 hours! Prison Architect is ""sandbox"" builder par excellance.I have had the pleasure of seeing it grow and improve over the last half a year and it draws me back in every time. There are no cons, just so you know :PBut what's Prison Architect?You are the Boss. Your prison, your rules, your design.Start from scratch and work your way up the ladder until you can house the most dangerous criminals. Or go into the unlimited fund mode and just build your personal dream prison. Prison Architect offers a variety of complex mechanics that work neatly with each other to create a living, changing prison environment.Building: classical square-based, bird eye sandbox. Environment: day and night cycle, proper shadows, chances of lakes and woods to be incorporated into your design. grass and flowers will grow uncontrollably and need to be trimmed. Gangs: criminals will now sometimes have gang affiliations. they will fight you and other prisoners and even take over your prison!! They come in all shapes and sizes, and some are even docile.Needs: prisoners have several needs they shout at you, from the easy 'Bladder' to the more difficult to reach 'Safety'. Family visits will do a lot to release stress. it's a constant fight to keep them happy, but understanding their needs is key for running a tidy prison.Contraband: Ah, you can try, but you will have a hard time preventing smuggling inside your prison. Your prisoners steal, have help from their families or have packages thrown over the fences. Fight back with metal detectors, routine searches and confidental informants. Wiretap the phones for additional insight and shake down your prison every once in a while (or daily :D )Guards: Regular, Armed and Dog Handlers, plus an extra Riot Unit to call in emergencies. station them on posts, let them patrol or teach each of them how to use tazers. they're not the smartest, but loyal to the death.Dog Handlers will sniff out smelly contraband or tunnels, while armed guards are great at keeping your inmates surpressed. be sure to plan their routes properly and concentrate forces at critical points.Rooms: a large variety of rooms, from different cell types (holding cells, solitary, regular) to security stations and armories to libraries and laundries for the prisoners. build a dog pound, common room or even a chapel for the those that want to find salvation in the arms of the lord.Cells have a quality, directly incluencing the inmates' behaviour. always good to have an eye on that ;)Staff: Psychologists for intimate group seminars with the prisoners, grounds keepers, cooks and, of course, a lawyer and accountant. Let them research, clean and fend off annoying lawsuits or loss conditions. I told you, you are the boss :PPrisoners: now, they are the true heroes of this game. quite clever and crafty little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. They will stop at nothing to try to escape you or send the prison spiraling down into a muderious abyss of blood and mayhem.building tunnels together with other prisoners. stealing the appropriate tools from around the prison. shanking suspicious inmates in the shower. initiating riots when a prisoner dies.Prisoners come in all forms and shapes. from the mid 20 stoner, in for possession, to deathrow inmates with multiple murders. some have abilites, some are even legen-wait for it-dary. and you decide their security level ;) Snitchs and Ex Law Enforcement inmates are a painful joy. not fast enough in identifying them? see them shanked to death in the shower, yard or laundry. There's a huge variety of prisoners, crimes and reputation skills, and each prisoner is indeed somewhat of an individual.Intelligence: recruit confidental informants, check the history of contraband and control your gangs. but be careful, the more you rely on your informants, the more likely they are to be killed by their fellow inmates.Logistics: still a bit of a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to get around with, but you can control who is washing which wings' clothes, preps their food etc. Size: as they say, it doesn't matter. try to manage a small prison with few but maybe violent inmates, or go ballistic with hundreds of prisoners, likely suffocating in their own filth. Prison architect is fun from small to big. But always a challenge.Random Events: Fires, floods, virus outbreaks and surprise prisoners, all the things you need to ruin your day. While a burst pipe is easily taken care of, a fire can surely burn down large parts of your prison and kill many an inmate or staffer.Be sure to have either a quarantine ward ready for outbreaks, or to isolate the affected prisoners in their cells quickly.Prison Policy Events: You can't run a prison without some politician or the other trying to boss you around. They will ask you to serve your prisoners the lowest grade food or to remove all work out benches from the yards, because some one clearly does not want your prison to be peaceful.ignore it and get annoyed by phone calls every few ingame hours, or just do as they ask and deal with the fallout. probably by bashing in heads and locking up half your prisonCampaign: a lovely little story revolving around betrayal, murder and mayhem, also serving as a perfect tutorial for the sandbox mode. The campaign introduces the mechanics in an understandable and easy to grasp way for new comers, and even after 100 hours, it still offered insight for my gameplay.There is so much more going on, but seriously, 110 hours into the game I feel like I barely scratched the surface of what Prison Architect really has to offer.Even now, after 160 hours, it still sucks me in for 5 -10 hours a time. From the urge to build more and better wards to just observing the prisoners and try to keep the place calm, there is much to do and even more to observe.Get it. This game is worth every Euro and Stotinki and will make you forget about everything else.There's still some bugs left, but the devs are still putting out updates, and so far the game as steadily improved.I know I have probably been neglecting huge parts of the game in this review, but heck, I'm just one man trying to keep people locked up.

								This is one of the best ''alpha'' games i have ever played, every update comes with something new, and these updates come monthly. And the best part is that all of the updates download automatically with no viruses. I have the game on a laptop with a 1.00ghz processor, 2gb of ram and an AMD vision graphics card, with windows 8.1. the game just flies on this. it does however slow down when you have alot of staff. But also remember to consider the RAM of your system, since this is a simulation game it eats it up!!I totally recommend this game for any one who likes simulation games.Oh and prisons... :)			"

								For a game officially still in Alpha, it definitely is great and better than some games that claim to be finished. You will notice some bugs and weird behaviour after a few dozen hours played, but usually nothing mayor.The only thing that really needs fixing is the performance in the end game. When constructing large buildings, the game slows down and only runs in slow motion. I had this even though my CPU was only occupied about 30%.I like how each monthly update brings interesting new things that make it worth to start the game again and sometimes even require complete new strategies.The graphic style is also very suitable for a game like this. Anything less comic-like would probably be too realistic. They figures still show off emotions, jump around nervously or walk slow when suppressed.For the price definitely recommended.			"

												You know that a game is good when you can get stuck on playing it for almost a full weekend (including friday).I definitly enjoyed this one for the sandbox mode, less for the campaign mode which is more of an extended tutorial honestly. The sandbox mode is like: you start off from zero, good luck with your prison. Without the implementation of grants you wouldn't really have an objective and it also sets you up with money. What I also like is the varation of choices you get like the type of warden you want, the building material, the flooring, the set up of your jails and also which gender that your prisoners have. The last one for me is a little unnecessary because I probably always will pick male prisoners in my prisoners so I don't have to build family prisoners (for females with a baby), besides I kinda find it weird why you would take your newborn child with you to prison. Also sometimes things are a bit buggy so if you come across a bug don't think you are the only one experiencing it. If you like sandboxes or games like city skylines, sims where you have to build stuff and organise it all you should pick this one up. If the idea of running a big prison sounds fun to you you should also get it.EDIT: Did I forget to mention that this game has an amazing amount of humor when you look at some biographics? : http://steamcommunity.com/id/tehteddystyle/screenshot/106228751899944771 "

												We are finally at the end, what a journey it's been. In the time since first buying it in early access to now I have built large, small and damn right disgusting prisons. The vast amount of content in this game is outstanding and all the way through it's development the team pumped out quality updates in a timey manner, a true example of how to do Early Access.Probably one of the best sandbox games out on the market right now, beautiful art work, vast amount of things to unlock and upgrade (or downgrade!) your prison with.You are only limited by your imagination, only just in these past few days have I got a solid prison up and running without bankrupting myself or having everyone escape because I tried to rush to get money. There is no hand holding through the game, you are given a plot of land and a few nudges in the right direction to get your prison started, you learn by trial and error but like the devs themselves said even when you fail it's quite hilarious and you're not left feeling angry for ""losing"" (You can't really lose, you can turn failure conditions off but more fun with them on ""If X ammount escape then you're shutdown"" kinda conditions) Not only is the game quite realistic on most things regarding prisons they also tackles difficult subjects, and weren't afraid to add them in, like death row, execution process, female prisons including babies etc and have done it very well.Hats off to the devs, loved your videos, love your game.9/10- Old review - Quality game the gets better month in month out, the humour is excellent thanks to the dev team being able to laugh at their own mistakes. Completely playable for hours on end even though it's still in Alpha, soon to be beta. Looking forward to more new features!			"

								First of all, this game is in alpha and therefore has a lot of bugs but I have to say that the core gameplay is very nicely set up.For an alpha version this game actually runs very smoothly.My first few prisons were so bad, I messed up the water main and I fried the generator (and I trapped my fair share of workers in buildings with no doors) but after I got few tries planning the layout, and after a lot of prisoners escaping leaving me in a huge deficit, I finally have my first proper prison running and it's been a blast so far.My prison doesn't look that great architectually but it's at least functioning.And testing out the Star Wars Empire mod is a real testiment to how great this game can turn out to be in the end when the developers actually want an active mod community it just makes the game so much more appealing imo.If you played Theme Hospital and this looks interesting to you, it will definitely be worth it getting the alpha.

												2 Prisoners were cleaning the outside of the prison. THEN SUDDENLY they got their circle fists out! I WAS SCARRED, but within 2 seconds they were knocked unconious by 4 guards! BEST GAME EVAR!!!SPecs: Hardrive: 500GB GPU: Intel HD CPU: Intel Celetron RAM: 4GbIt runs sooo smoothly I get about 56 FPS on average! I got Cities Skylines and that's only 6 FPS on average! SOOO PLEASED with this game. Story mode is good. Fun, addictive and awesome! One thing is that they should add more of a muti-player aspect! You can download other people's prisons, but it's not what I would want!			"

1-sentence review :Great building game, both for casual and hardcore players, although plagued by a few annoying bugs & issues and an atrophied management part.Pros :- The tutorial is a short story mode, nothing extravagant like the game description would make you think it is, but it's still a very nice way to dive into the game theme- Despite being quite common in series & movies, prison is a rare theme in management games so it's nice to finally see a game using it- Very complete prison building- Interface is mostly easy enough to usePros or Cons, depending of your taste :- Management part can be almost totally ignoredCons :- Visuals can be a bit hard on eyes are 1st, as the artistic direction lacks a bit of unity- Past 60 prisoners, game can get quite repetitive as you'd be doing more and more the same things to expend your prison- Copy/paste size is pretty limited which means you won't be able to copy your big prison wing in 1 time- Some bad bugs ; main one being the Grant state isn't correctly reloaded, which leads to getting too much money to reactivate the current grants, which is game breaking if you want to be challenged- There's basically no difficulty if you understood the tutorial- Might be a bit overpriced : $30 instead of $25, I'd say			"

												Fantastic Game. 8/10 with the current game content/mechanics.If you're looking for something new to jump into give this some serious consideration.Pros ++Easy to get started and play+Basic skill tree to unlock upgrades+Make a big or small prison, its fun to manage both+Multiple ways of making profit, but requires planning and management+Fun door access systems with logic and timing+Relatively easy to play but not as easy to perfect which adds more depth and creative goals.+Mods+A decent enough amount of content. It takes a while to set up and expand everything.Cons --Not huge on some ingame mechanics being explained in diary notes you find which are hard to read (they're in messy handwriting) but perhaps this info is listed clearly elsewhere ingame.-Game still has a few odd bugs but they are minor. -When placing a foundation near a current building its unpredictable / unintuitive as to whether the new foundation (wall) will break the adjacent wall and connect the rooms, or maintain the wall and keep them separate.-As of current some objects/sprites are limited in their function and orientation / appearance.-Ingame tooltips could provide a little more information.

								The game in it's current state is more than playable, it's enjoyable. There are bugs of course, but most of the released features work well. And there are many great features to come!It may be hard to make money at the beginning but you'll eventually overcome the problems and start developing prisons in the direction you want, there are no limits. If not satisfied with the base game, get one of many great mods directly from Steam workshop. I like to build huge Max Sec prisons, heavily-guarded and highly profitable.Pros:Endless possibilitiesExcellent gameplayGreat simulationLittle humorAwesome designMod support Steam workshop supportReasonable pricingCons:UI needs updatingBugs (Alpha!)

												Ever wanted to build your own prison? Well, Prison Architect takes that idealogy to new heights, featuring realistic requirements for prisons and prisoners. This game could only be better if it was 3D. Oh wait, theyre working on that too! Its easy for anyone to hop right into the game and set up your own prison, however, it takes practice to make a prison that lasts a long time. It seems just as you think you've done everything in the game, more things just get added in. Hot water, 3D mode, deathrow, executions, supermax, weather, map settings, land expansions, prisoner jobs, escape mode and much, MUCH more! I cannot stress enough how much I love this game, and thats not going to change anytime soon. The cost is $30 USD, but its SOOOO worth it. Stop reading this review, and buy this game right now.			"

SHOW THOSE UNRULY, UNKIND, MEAN, GRITTY, STANKY, TURD MAGGOTS HOW LITTLE THEY TRULY ARE WITH PRISON ARCHITECT, THE GAME WHERE YOU DESIGN AND RUN YOUR OWN BRAND-SPANKING-NEW- STATE OF THE ART ""CORRECTIONAL"" FACILITYTHE GOOD Build your own prison however you like! Whether you like sending those inmates to 48 hours of solitary confinement for merely looking your direction or whether you believe in unicorns and adorn your prison cells with fluffy bunnies, prison architect allows the player to determine how harsh or soft they want to make it! Witness crazy riots and fights and control them with your guards! Frequent UPDATES! MUCH MORE, BUT IMA KEEP THIS SHORT AND SWEET, JUST LIKE THE SOUND OF MY PRISONER-WORKERS CRANKING OUT ENDLESS SUPPLIES OF LICENSE PLATESThe Bad I've had some problems with some bugs. They are getting fixed with each update. nothing too major that is gamebreaking, keep in mind. Kinda hard to make really good, efficient prisons that don't riot (but what's the fun in that?) Very addicting (is that a con?) My biggest problem is a part of the game mechanics, let me explain: Time passing= 1 second real time= 1 minute game time. This wouldn't be too big of a problem, but with really spaced out or large prisons, your prisoners begin having major time restraints eating and doing other tasks in the allotted time, and doing anything that involves walking too far. This however, can be avoided by intelligently laying out your prison. (unlike the dilapidated ones I sometimes make)OVERALL, THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME. 10/10 WOULD WORK WITH LADY JUSTICE AGAIN, and ""If you do the crime, ya gotta do the time."" "

								Prison Architect is a tycoon game. You have to build and maintain your own prison. So you build cell blocks, kitchens, yards ect. Very simple, but extremly addictive - my first try took roughly around 8h - rare even for me. You will have to deal with situations typical for prisons, like riots, prisoners attacing each other or your staff, escapes... But lets star from the beggining. Tutorial isn't long, but it shows the basics just fine. After playing it, you should be able to build your own prison. You have 24 game hours before inmates arrival, abd by then you have to build basic facilities - like few cells, kitchen, offices, ect. Important thing is, that you need to think ahead. Careless expanding electrical lines may cause your generator to get overloaded, and that leads to energy shortage in whole prison. You also need to take care of risk, because the higher it is, the bigger chances are that your prisoners will do something stupid - what will affect your income. So you need to take care of their needs, don't infract their laws (lockdowns without reasons, or reasonless seraches are problem). They need to have good food, comfort, entertainment, and safety (so hiring too much ared guards will make them angrier), which is a bit too good for such scoundrels, isn't it? With game progress, you can unlock more features, like hiring K9 unit (guards with dogs), education, prison labour (making prisoners work for you), and so on. Game features much more things (like inteligence, allowing you to intercept contraband, and more), but writing about it would be pointless. This review would be too long, and that's not the point. So lets say about good and bad sides. Good thing is, that game is still in early access, and it's current form is great alredy. Playing it is (mostly) entertainging, but still there are some things that could be added, or improved. Theese are bad things: workers sometimes pass through the walls, you cant allow workers to open jail doors (so they need to wait for guard to come and open it, or for player to change door setting), or doctors  need to be sent to patients, not other way - which annoys me terribly, because if you wont notice that someone needs a doctor, he will die. And this doctor stays in his office. There should be a possibility to at least make him wander around the prison and heal everyone who needs it - and currently, you need to look for wounded prisoners/staff and send him to them. Apart of this, game is worth playing.			"

								Day one - Looked into Prison Archithect, about 4pm in the afternoon, saw the images, thought it looked a bit poxy so figured i'd read the reviews.. Reviews were all delightfully outstanding. Figured 9,000 odd reviews can't be a company ploy to get you to purchase the game, so figured I would give it a shot.. Commenced downloading..Day one, download complete, 6.00pm - Started out on the game, completed the tutorial, found the interface, and abilities somewhat endless. Once I sussed out the way foundations worked (easy if you follow the tute) I was building en'mass in the creative mode where money is endless! Dealing with prisoners, throwing the lockdown alarm and searching cells, creating new buildings and solitary confinement, setting the meal plans and daily schedule, deploying response teams and patrols, what an amazing game! - Holy Crap, what's this in the extras, MODS!? Holy crap look at the fancy stuff I can have at the (free) click of a button via the mods page, how amazing! Let's build more!Day two, 11 hours later, 5.00am, meant to be at work in an hour, where the hell did all night go!? - Holy crap this game is sweet! I'm late for work! What the living hell happend to my night? I better get these guys into their cells then go to bloody work before I get fired!!!Weeks later, play this game for hours a day, it's fantastic!

												I've been following the development of Prison Architect since Alpha 15. When it was officially launched today, I gave the new features a try, and have to admit I have very mixed feelings. First, the base sandbox game is TONS of fun! It's a prison management system, where you are free to treat prisoners with downright cruelty or as if they are on holiday. You can focus on strict profit, or on reformation. The basics are fairly simple, yet there is plenty to learn.The sandbox alone I'd recommend to anyone. With the new release, there were two main additions: The campaign and the Escape mode. TThe campaign I DO NOT recommend. For me, it completely threw off the pixelated, cartoony vibe of the early access. It was dark, crude, and downright vulgar. Maybe that's reminescent of the darker side of certain prisons, but it completely threw off the overall feeling of the Prison Architect I knew and loved! It took the game from what I'd consider the upper end of ""E: Everyone"" to the upper end of ""M: Mature"". It is not for children. It's probably not for adults. It's definitely not for me.(Side note: I created a Mod called ""Family Friendly Mod"", which tuned down the adult content of the campaign. It's now at about a ""T:Teen"" level, or about what you find on ""Prison Break"".) However, the Escape Mode is AWESOME!!! You can play it on any saved prison, which allows you to customize your difficulty. It needs a little rebalancing, but playing an an OP legendary prisoner, racking up your murder trials, setting fire to a prison... It's like a whole new game within the game. A++  "

												Prison Architect, a game made by an indie company (I think), where you build... A prison. And run it. Oddly, not as the Warden, because he's someone you can hire.You start off with about 30k, take a few grants, you have about 100k. You build up some cells, a yard, and a canteen, you bring in your first 8 prisoners or so, and you continue upgrading. It's as simple as that. Eventually, you sell your prison, and make an even larger one. Then, you make that one into a well-oiled machine, you start up another prison. Occassionally you go back into the old one to update it to the newer updates, and you continue on.As you can see, I've played it a fair bit. Would recommend. Also, I had the water-pump area catch on fire once. 10/10			"

								Now you, too can be the mastermind of your own prison complex.Highly recommended simulation game, akin to the old Theme games like Theme Hospital and the like. Even in this early stage of development, Prison Architect offers a fleshed out experience that you'll keep coming back to. The idea of the game is simple: Build a prison that functions well, sell it for profit, and build another prison two times the size with the money earned from the previous prison. Seems simple, right?Wrong. Managing your staff, prisoners, and layout all comes together in a formiddable micromanagement deal. You have the ability to pause time which heals a great deal with managing the nuances of your creation, so all-in-all it comes down to how -you- want to play the game.At the current time of writing, there's a few frustrating bugs that might push some away. You're paying for early access at the time of writing, so frustrating issues are bound to come up. Know that the game's in -alpha-, and you can help the developer by posting these issues on their official forums.The game is -very- playable at the moment, and highly recommended. Give it a try!

								I love any game that lets you create and run your own world, whatever that world may be. Prison Architect seemed silly, interesting and, at first glance, seemed to possess enough versatility over how much of a challenge you can create for yourself that I thought it was worth a try.I can't say I'm disappointed- but I was frustrated when I first started to play. This is because there are a bunch of small things that don't work quite right- for instance, sometimes you are unable to type in a name for the prison you're saving. Sometimes, your workers glitch and won't do a job, even though you have 20 and they aren't doing anything else. Sometimes, if someone dies, their body won't load onto the ambulance or hearse/ corpse wagon, whatever it is, so you literally have one guard who keeps trying constantly to get rid of the body, and does nothing else.Really. Nothing else.Now, having said what I've said, I'll add that yes, this game is in alpha, so it isn't done. Also, yes, bugs exist with any game- this, I fully understand, but there are a few other issues which make gameplay a bit clunky; first, a giant checklist taking over part of the left side of your screen, which can't be minimized. Also, this game seriously lacks guidance- you fly blind for the most part, and that's a bit offputting when you are trying to do something like, say, make a water pump system work, or figure out guard rotations. There's a shortage of tips, and since you hit the ground running when you first start to play, there isn't a great deal of time for learning curves. In addition to that, there's no clear way to understand what goes on with specific aspects of your prison, such as programs and classes- why, I asked myself at least 10 times, am I setting up a class with 7 interested and qualified inmates and the class remains empty, even though they have the time in their schedule for work??I could go on, but this is supposed to be a review, not a rant, and to be honest, all frustrations aside, this game is at least a little addicting. Though the glitches and inconveniences can be offputting, the fact is that the game itself is fun, has great potential, and, as I said before, provides a challenge. It's worth a look, and, yea, sure- it's worth the money, as long as the developers keep moving forward and improving.			"

												Hello everyone!I have played this game since alpha 21 and i gotta say its changed a lot! First of i saw a lot of bugs back there which kinda stopped me from playing this game but hearing about that prison will be out of alpha in fall, made me come back! Its really awesome game with a lot of things in!Here is a few things i have noticed! + Prisoners throw away items that they may have smuggled in into your land somewhere! You probably never see those items again.+ If its time to sleep and someone goes somewhere they are usually up to something bad and you may risk by seeing what they do+Dogs and armed guards can make canteens really quiet.+People can dig tunnels but you can discover them by doing regular jail investigations while they eat, shower or are somewhere away.+Mods can make you a prisoner or manage your own women jail- My cameras wont work (maybe im an exception)-Doors wont open automatically- My fence was like an harry potter portal in Kings Cross station (step inside the portal and you are escaped- Prisoner duplicated into two+Prisoners can form gangs and you can even have a land wars with them+Prisoners have a black marketAnd lots of other thingsI can say that this game really was enjoyable for me! Since i love strategic games and some 2D games i really loved it! Bugs were the only thing bothering me but maybe they are already fixed? "

												Really annoying game. You do the tute and then the game itself is buggy as ♥♥♥♥. Says you have to enclose cells that are already enclosed. You have to dismantle walls and reinstall doors because the stupid AI doesnt work. (There are posts all over the Internet about this issue). Then doors lock by themselves and you get some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about canteens not accessible from cells, even though there's a clear path and none of the doors are locked. Just endless irritation and frustration. Its like playing an early access game but crappier. Total waste of time and money.			"

								I wasn't sure I would be into PA, so I continued with other games not giving it much thought. Those who watch my videos had a different plan though, and regularly asked me to cover it on the channel. It wasn't until my brother picked it up for me recently that I finally gave it a shot and I'm glad he did. It's been a lot of fun!Beyond the plotting of where buildings will go, your staff and prisoners are people you will watch regularly, while trying to get things to be just right for everyone. I'm having a blast with it. Check out my new Prison Architect series here:

 My best incidentOn day 9 I found a nude black man running around my prison.What is he up to? I wonder.I started following the inmate as he ran into my crowded yard.No, no regret so far.His journey continued down the halls, through the common room.Passing both guards and inmates, noone seem to care or notice.As he gets dressed, suddenly it crosses my mind, this simple man just wanted a clean shirt.His glorious quest for a clean shirt was not unnoticed.I click on this poor man and his name is Paul.Oh Paul your so crazy.One day later a fight starts. Ma man Paul dies in the incident.Turns out Paul is a snitch.9/10 would not expect naked black man to be a snitch. "

												I want this to be a very honest review. The game is a ton of fun. I really enjoyed the time I spent with it.  However, there are some bugs and/or glitches where things just dont work they way they should. There are a ton of little things that bothered me enough to stop playing. I felt at times like I was fighting against the mechanics of the game and not the objectives and challenges of the game. From what I have heard, the developers are simply done with this project, they are moving on to other things and will not be updating this game any further. This saddens me because it could be something truely special if they spent a bit more time polishing the experience. Would I recommend this game? Yes. Would I recommend this game for $30? no.			"

												This game is a good time killer but I think there are too many bugs. For example, when I lay down a foundation to build another cell block, kitchen, etc, I get told that it is too dangerous. Too dangerous? My danger level is low, there is nothing going on to make it dangerous. On top of that my staff keeps getting caught up among each other that they cannot move so they sit there in a throng trying to get out of whatever invisible force field that is keeping them there. Play it at your own risk but be prepared to get annoyed. The makers said that they are not fixing any more bugs, so there you go.			"

								This game is a gem! I haven't had this much fun in a tycoon style game since I played Rollercoaster Tycoon in primary school years and years ago.The gameplay is fantastic, next to no bugs that you can't work around, hours and hours of fun getting your prison just right and the fact that a riot can break out and having to bring in the riot team, paramedics and fire brigade is just flippin' ridiculously awesome! The game is not a simple build walls and put the prisoners in their cells, you can segregate Min Sec, Med Sec, Max Sec, Supermax, Protected & Death Row inmates in order to help keep the peace, you can send your dog squad on patrols to sniff clothes for drugs in the laundry room, lockdown the prison and perform a shakedown, recruit CI's from solitary confinement, run appeals for prisoners on death row and execute them if need be and so much more... also the game has workshop so there's a bunch of mods you can play with too, or make your own!I rate this game 11/10, it's brilliant. There's definitely things i'd love to see added to it but let's wait for the game to leave early access, who knows what the devs have thought up.			"

												One of the most amazing games i have ever owned. Build a prison, try to manage the prison, then get called by the warden that you are fired. If you make your prison too big, then the prisoners will go crazy because they cannot go to the different areas in time. If you make it small they will either be happy or want more space to feel more free. There are a lot of different options and different things you can do with your prison when you feel it is fully builg. You can start programs for the prisoners like teaching them how to cook so they can make food during work time. There are a lot of things you can do with your prison. I would give this game a 10/10 IGN RockPaperShotgun BillGates Obama LordGaben.			"

 Prison Architect... Is it a master piece or a mediocre game read and find out below!	   First let me start out by saying this game is still in development so this review is bound to change when the game is completed but for now this is going to be my opinion on it. Prison Architect has its good side and its bad side as well i will be starting off by listing the cons first and then the pros afterwards.  Cons.    1.   You will get some extremely trouble some prisoners while you are playing this game. They will kill many of your staff and or prisoners in the process of them throwing their little eveing fits while in solitary for killing 5 of your guards as punishment. There really needs to be a drop down box to change their role from supermax to death row that way their reign of destruction is put to an end.  2. The punishment system is very limited in what you can do to inmates when they commit a new felony or offense. The only two options you have is solitary or locking them down in their cells for how ever long you deem fit.  3.  The U.I is organized but can be troublesome if you dont know where to look for certain features.   4.  The $30.00 price tag is asking a bit much for the content that is provided in game as of right now. Even with mod content the game lacks some crucial items and objects ( no diversity all your prison rooms will look the same in one way or another.)  5.  There is no quick build option for construction of your prison. Even with a worker force of 100 plus buildings can take a few minutes to get up an running. 6.  After building your prison there isnt really much more to do with it other than watch your little ant farm work like clock work.  Side Note. (There is a really annoying glitch where your workers and other members of your staff get stuck and will not perform their tasks at hand.  Only way i know to fix this glitch is by saving and quitting out and reloading the prison.) Pros   1.  Building a working and well functioning prison gives you a sense of accomplishment. Makes you feel like you acheived something great.  2.  Inside Prison Architects  core game there is mini game type stuff that you can do to keep busy (Busy work).Such as tidying wires up so they are not a huge mess  laying down pipes and electrical cables connection for your cameras to your monitors. etc...  3. There is a C.I System within the game which allows you to get prisoners in distress to pretty much spy on other prisoners and rat them out. They will tell you where drugs, weapons, high probabilty assassination targets are that need to be protected. This adds  a new layer of fun gameplay to your expirence.  4. You start off with a good amount of land in the start of your game. Which you can later upgrade into a bigger plot of land if you have enough cash to buy additonal plots to expand your prison.  5. Challenging but solid game play. This game offers a decent amount of depth in the menus for the behind the scenes type of stuff. Such as scheduling classes for your inmates so they stay educated, work shops for prison labor, fully flexible scheduling for all prisoners, grants to earn you money by completeting tasks. ETC..  6. Prison Architect has unique graphics, they are very cartoony and 2D but it does not take away from the actual gameplay of the game it self. It is still grim and gruesome even with cartoon graphics.Now for the final rating of the game... Even though the game is fun and challenging it does get kind of boring after you built your prison and can expand no more.  So i recommend starting a new prison after you are done with one and it will keep you occupied for the time being.Prison Architect is still in alpha and is pretty sturdy but due to the lack of content and the asking price of 30$ as is.. im going to have to give the game a final rating of a 7.5/10 Above Average wait until its on sale though. {UPDATE} The devs added a new random event sytem to the game and gangs since the last post of this review and those 2 major updates along with the shops as well makes me give this game a 9.0/10 an awesome game and a good amount of content.

												Ok, so im not good at writing reviews, but here you have a brownie recipie. Step 1: Choose a brownie recipeWhen searching for the best brownie recipe, first consider the texture you hope to achieve: Do you like fudgy brownies or cakey brownies? In many brownie recipes, the proportion of flour to other ingredients is significantly less than in other baked goods. Reduce the amount of flour to make your brownies dense, fudgy, or rich. If you prefer brownies with a cakelike texture, look for brownie recipes with more flour. Some cakelike brownies contain milk or buttermilk, making their texture more like rich, fluffy chocolate cake.Step 2: Chop chocolateOf course, you can't make chocolate brownies without chocolate. Using a chef's knife, coarsely chop chocolate bars or squares on a cutting board. Chopped chocolate melts smoothly and evenly, and it won't scorch. Some recipes call for making brownies with cocoa powder. Both are delicious and easy ways to make chocolate brownies.Step 3: Melt chocolate and butterPlace the chopped chocolate in a saucepan.Cut up the butter and add it to the saucepan with the chocolate.Heat and stir over low heat until all of the chocolate and butter is melted and the mixture is smooth.Remove the saucepan from the heat, and let the chocolate mixture cool. This mixture will serve as the chocolate base for your brownie recipe.Step 4: Stir in sugarAdd the sugar to the melted chocolate and butter. Stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar is completely mixed into the chocolate and butter.Step 5: Add eggsAdd the eggs one at a time. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon after each addition until the egg is completely incorporated into the chocolate mixture.Beat in the vanilla with the wooden spoon.Step 6: Add flourIn a separate bowl stir together the flour and baking soda.Add the flour mixture all at once to the chocolate mixture.Step 7: Mix batterGently stir the brownie batter until the flour is moistened.Use a heavy-duty rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the saucepan.If desired, stir in chocolate pieces or chopped nuts.Step 8: Bake, cool, and frost browniesGrease your baking pan or, if desired, line it with foil for easy removal. Spread the brownie batter in the prepared pan.Bake brownies as directed in the recipe. Most brownies bake at 350 degrees F for 25 to 35 minutes.Let the brownies cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.If you want frosted brownies, wait at least an hour after baking to be sure the brownies have completely cooled.Prepare the frosting. Chocolate-lovers may enjoy brownies with chocolate frosting, but we also recommend a simple vanilla frosting, cream cheese frosting, or even rich peanut butter frosting. Use an offset metal spatula to frost the brownies while they are still in the pan. Cut the finished dessert into bars, serve, and enjoy!(I got in prison for copy and pasting this)			"

								After putting a lot of time into a lot of different alphas, and a whole lot of failed and flawed prisons; through it all I'm still hungry for more ""Prison Architect"" because the content is as difficult and in depth as you want it to be. Even after you perfect your prison prowess it still takes effective planning and foresight to avoid the accidental riot during morning showers, or save the poor guy that gets beaten to death b/c someone didn't open a door in time for too many people.   With the new grading system, extended finance program, Beurocracy web's increasing depth, and ability to actually BECOME AN INMATE this game provides enough angles to a truly fascinating and ever convaluted punishment system that blends black and white into whole new shades of convict grey.

								I can recommend this game simply becase its the only game out there that handles this topic with any sort of success.However, much like SimCity and other management games it can't get around one gameplay issue: the most interesting things that will happen in the game are the most detrimental to your success as a manager.  The successful prison in Pison Architect is one with no incidents, no weapons found, no extra punishment, etc.  You even get extra funding the longer you go without incidents.  The problem is that this is not entertaining or fun to have the prison with no issues because the vast majority of your fun tools as the manager are for reacting to serious incidents.  Bottom line: you're working to make yourself obsolete and you are constantly having less and less to do.  Not fun			"

								With the game about to have it's offical relase October 6th I thought I would update my review. This is how you do early access correctly. Every month for the past 3 years there has been an update with new, sometimes game changing, content added. Since I started playing things like armed gaurds, dogs, a prison grading system, prisoner traits, reform programs, gangs and most recently random events, have all been added to this game. It still amazes me that such a small team has made this game. I really can't recommend this game enough. I have more hours in this game than I do in any other. I can't believe I spent 30 dollars and got 500+ hours of entertainment from this game.			"

								Prison Architect ReviewProbably the best early-access game ever to hit Steam. Prison Architect is a creative sandbox game in which you build and manage a prison. The addictive concept, depth and easy to use interface makes this one of the most intriguing and enjoyable games I have played in a long time.The top-down presentation is simple yet superb. The user-friendly interface makes navigation simple and easy to use. There is quite a lot of stuff to do in terms of construction and designing so having such a well-designed layout of functions is crucial to this games brilliance. The strategic depth here is also incredible and the way you design your prison and how you manage prisoners happiness can be huge factors to your overall success.The bigger your prison becomes; the tougher it is to manage. Suddenly you have maximum security prisoners at your door and it's up to you to expand and enhance your prison to accommodate the influx whilst keeping people including staff and fellow inmates happy and safe. There is a considerable challenge here particularly when you grow your prison and the population. The level of depth in the design of your prison along with the management strategy aspect is simply staggering.Overall, Prison Architect is an amazing game even at alpha stage. It's polished and incredibly well designed in all areas. The developers have done an amazing job so far and this game will only grow further in months to come.			"

								Prison Architect is 'different' to most strategy games out there. It is still an alpha (15/06/2014) however the game seems almost completed! The game has so much potential-some of which it has already forfillled. The glitches, such as prisoners remain seated and act as normal when a deadly fire is in the room, make the game hilarious and laughable. Even if it is an alpha it does what a game is ment to do; entertain you. It isnt severly incompleted. Eveything in the game works flawlessly-most of the time-and you forget it is an alpha. Also there are fun glitches/things, e.g. the prisons sit on the blade of a saw in the workshop as they are using it, the prison jail doors get overwhelmed with people trying to get through and the guards can't open it for them so for hours your prisons are waiting at a door!The gamemakers (introversion softwere) also go very in-depth with detain in some parts of the game. An example of this is the attention to detail to the prisons. Each is given a name, picture, list of convictions e.g. how many years served (and what for) and how many years to serve(and what for), also family, security level, #ref number, recent status, activity, mood, condition, experiance, punishment/security grading, bio and more. You can also make your own character by purchasing the 'Name in Game' upgrade dcl which allows you to create your own character which could even be based on you with your name!The only complaint I have is the price, especially of the 'Name in Game' upgrade dcl. I find that £15 for your name and bio in-game isnt worth £15. And that's just for name in the game, if you want the game as well it is just short of £35. The game (only) is £20. This game does not have good graphic qualitly however for a game like this you don't want nor need it as the graphics suit the game perfectly. Overall, it is a great game and introversion have done well-so far. I would reccormend you buy this games as if you like strategy, organisation and building this game is perfect. It is worth the £20 sale price. I would also highly recommend you upgrade the game with the 'Name in Game' dcl ONLY DURING A SALE(personally £15 is over-expensive). This is an exellant game with everything I would expect in it and more. I cannot wait to see what the game developers have instore in the next update! (Alpha 22) Great game-buy it!			"

								Fun to play but very difficult, Prison Architect is something special among real-time strategy games. The gameplay is difficult, in the best way. You have to really pay attention in order to successfully manage your resources, keeping your prisoners imprisoned and expanding the prison so you can hold more prisoners. It's a tough balancing act, trying to expand your prison while maintaining discipline, health and hygiene. Yes, hygiene. The developers didn't forget anything, and you need to make sure you have enough showers to keep the prisoners clean and enough drains to get the water out without flooding the place. You also need to hire a chef to keep them fed, and a doctor to heal them up after those unfortunate but inevitable fights with guards or other prisoners. Every room needs to be a certain size in order to hold the required commodities, for example an office needs to have a desk, chair, and filing cabinet, while a prisoner's cell needs a bed and toilet. The controls are pretty good, though I had a bit of trouble panning the screen because it moves too fast sometimes. This is definitely a mouse and keyboard game, and I don't think it would even be possible to play this game with a controller. The graphics are nothing special, just some very generic elements that almost look like pixel art in their simplicity. That actually works in the game's favor though, because it adds to the dreary atmosphere of prison life, and it's hard to differentiate between different prisoners which really makes them feel like ""just another prisoner #1234"" and makes the game feel slightly more edgy. Sound is also nothing spectacular, but again, I don't think that really detracts from the overall experience. In fact, you can play the game without sound and really not miss out on anything. I usually like to listen to music while I'm playing games anyway, so the sound isn't a big deal to me. So if you enjoy real-time strategy games, Prison Architect is definitely worth a try. It's not an easy game, but it's rewarding to play and very enjoyable.--------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

												Ok, so im not good at writing reviews, but here you have a brownie recipie. Step 1: Choose a brownie recipeWhen searching for the best brownie recipe, first consider the texture you hope to achieve: Do you like fudgy brownies or cakey brownies? In many brownie recipes, the proportion of flour to other ingredients is significantly less than in other baked goods. Reduce the amount of flour to make your brownies dense, fudgy, or rich. If you prefer brownies with a cakelike texture, look for brownie recipes with more flour. Some cakelike brownies contain milk or buttermilk, making their texture more like rich, fluffy chocolate cake.Step 2: Chop chocolateOf course, you can't make chocolate brownies without chocolate. Using a chef's knife, coarsely chop chocolate bars or squares on a cutting board. Chopped chocolate melts smoothly and evenly, and it won't scorch. Some recipes call for making brownies with cocoa powder. Both are delicious and easy ways to make chocolate brownies.Step 3: Melt chocolate and butterPlace the chopped chocolate in a saucepan.Cut up the butter and add it to the saucepan with the chocolate.Heat and stir over low heat until all of the chocolate and butter is melted and the mixture is smooth.Remove the saucepan from the heat, and let the chocolate mixture cool. This mixture will serve as the chocolate base for your brownie recipe.Step 4: Stir in sugarAdd the sugar to the melted chocolate and butter. Stir with a wooden spoon until the sugar is completely mixed into the chocolate and butter.Step 5: Add eggsAdd the eggs one at a time. Stir vigorously with a wooden spoon after each addition until the egg is completely incorporated into the chocolate mixture.Beat in the vanilla with the wooden spoon.Step 6: Add flourIn a separate bowl stir together the flour and baking soda.Add the flour mixture all at once to the chocolate mixture.Step 7: Mix batterGently stir the brownie batter until the flour is moistened.Use a heavy-duty rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the saucepan.If desired, stir in chocolate pieces or chopped nuts.Step 8: Bake, cool, and frost browniesGrease your baking pan or, if desired, line it with foil for easy removal. Spread the brownie batter in the prepared pan.Bake brownies as directed in the recipe. Most brownies bake at 350 degrees F for 25 to 35 minutes.Let the brownies cool completely in the pan on a wire rack.If you want frosted brownies, wait at least an hour after baking to be sure the brownies have completely cooled.Prepare the frosting. Chocolate-lovers may enjoy brownies with chocolate frosting, but we also recommend a simple vanilla frosting, cream cheese frosting, or even rich peanut butter frosting. Use an offset metal spatula to frost the brownies while they are still in the pan. Cut the finished dessert into bars, serve, and enjoy!(I got in prison for copy and pasting this)			"

												Prison Architect is a fun builder/management sim.  The best way to describe my fascination with it is that it's like watching an ant farm with all the ants in little orange jumpsuits.+Freedom to design your prison in whatever way you wish.  Nice extras like time-sensitive guard scheduling and automated doors and cameras.  You can reform through punishment or reform programs.  Still has monthly updates even after release.  Tons of mods.-Campaign is pretty short (I don't mind, I'm here for the sandbox).  There is no way to automate searching prisoners or cells.  Depending on your PC, performance can be an issue once you start approaching 1000 inmates.Overall, great sim game.  Hours of enjoyment to be had.			"

												Bought this on sale in the steam summer sale 2016. I'd played Prison Architect in beta, but I usually prefer to wait until games are fully released before playing them properly. While I'm unsure if I think I would play the full £20 for the game, as it is still very buggy, I feel the game would be worth the amount if it wasnt for the bugs. I paid around £10 for this game, which is a complete bargain. I aboslutely loved it from the get-go (once I figured out how to get around the few bugs I had within the game). I spent around 20 hours playing the game within two days of buying it, the campaign mode absorbed my attention completely, and I felt the campagin teaches you well for playing in sandbox or otherwise. To be fair, none of the bugs are game-breaking, generally they were small visual things, but for some people it may be enough to put you off slightly.			"

												So I've been wanting to play this game for awhile, and I bought it during the summer sale. Honestly, it's good fun for a little while, but I don't think it would have been worth the buy at regular price, so just a heads up. Now, aside from the price, let me describe what I like and dislike about my short time with the game.Pros:Nice, relaxing (for the most part) game, that captures a lot of what a real prison would look like. I would say if your a fan of sims and building games, this is worthy of your time.Sandbox mode is fun for awhile, and the great mods and maps from the community will keep you entertained.Cons:The story mode isn't that great from what i've played so far. It's very boring and simply re-hashes every aspect of prison management that you can learn in the sandbox mode.The game needs more content, better AI, better guard deployment, and just more attention to detail in general. For instance, if you snatch a set of keys from a guard, sure you can open most of the doors in the prison, but you can't free fellow inmates from handcuffs and have them join a riot. Detail and just common sense actions would make the game so much more satisfying.Summary: If you can get it on sale, I recommend it. It's a must have for anyone who enjoys sims and micromanagement games, and I'm looking forward to future updates.			"

								I remember seeing this game around, a year ago, lets say, it was good then, but it's even better now. Maybe not EVERYONE likes this game but, the amount of DETAIL put into this game is just, amazing.The game is about running a prison, and it sticks by it, your prison is in your hands, BUT, my favorite part, is that it's not FULLY in your control. Sure you can assign patrols and use non lethal, but VERY effective tools to placify an inmate. But even with that, you will always get TERRIFIED if one prisoner starts rioting, and they take out a weapon, the guards can fight them, but they attack OTHER inmates, then its the matter of getting a guard ASAP to the area, or risk a life or 2, and recently, when the ability to FAIL was added, suddenly you couldn't let the inmates escape or let a riot go on for too long, which made it MORE intense when a riot broke out.The developers themselves are probably the most best ive ever seen, they never get off track with other ideas, as explained in one of their videos, but, they take ideas from all the players, and get the community and, are now working to wipe most of the bugs out of the gameAs mentioned before, not every person may like this game, partly because of the amount of patience needed, but, i dont care, in my opinion, also, the freedom of the modding community is perfectThis game, takes the idea of running a prison, and strategy, and mashes it up into one game, would i reccomend it, OF COURSE, i have put hours, not only building my OWN prison, but downloading others, huge riots, fires, and a prison built for 16 must quickly be adjusted for 45!You dont have to, but to sum all of this up in 3 words, they would be: BUY THIS GAME			"

												So. Prison Architect.I can't say i haven't heard of this game before. I've seen a few Youtubers play it. Most notably Quill18.Purchasing this game was an impulse-buy. I wanted to try it out so damn badly, so when it came to buying it, fortunately for me, it was on a discount. Not that i'd mind the full amount, but who doesn't like a discount?As i write this review, on June 29th 2016. There are still a couple bugs within the game which i've encountered personally.1. An item menu got stuck on my screen one time after i'd clicked the plus icon to expand it.I fixed that by simply saving my game and reloading the save.2. I built extra buildings during the Campaign which i shouldn't have (until absolutely necessary).3. The CCTV system seems a bit wonky, but i'm quite sure it works.4. During my own prison-running within the game i was bulk-building foundation-and-furniture-ready luxury cells, and one of which got stuck in the foundation stage, resulting in the cell turning out as incomplete & transparent.This was fixed by placing a new foundation within the exact perimiter of the cell and adding a door of course, so the cell would get finalized.5. One thing that bothered me was the fact nobody ever told me there was a difference between a foundation and a wall.So. If you're building a huge prison block, but it keeps ♥♥♥♥ing itself up, then there's your reason. External walls: Foundation. Internal walls: Walls.All in all, a very entertaining game, with a good, decently capturing storyline/campaign.I'll definitely be on the lookout for more games by this developer in the future.7/10. Recommended.Pros:It's not too complicated.Micromanagement possibilities.Prison Reform. ♥♥♥♥ yeah.Cons:Bugs			"

								I think this is a great game even for a beta, however it does not have some of the real-world prison feel. It will keep you entertained for a good 30 hours, but then there really isn't much to do anymore. On a scale of 1-10 it is a 7.5 to me.			"

												This game is amazing! I will happily recommend it to all who like city building/management/strategy games.Pros:- gameplay is fun!- good strategical elements that has to be combined into the right mix- easy to master, but a lot of depth and content to learn how to best implement- graphics are well done- building process is fast-paced but still quite realistically simulated - you need to hire a psychologist  (and he needs an office) to be able to see inmates needs (and start group therapy sessions)- and must hire a guard chief to be able to tell guard how to do their job- can schedule which activities make up the inmates day- the game works  (haven't encountered any bugs yet)- lots of optional goals in the campaignCons:- The game feels a bit repetitive after a while- To me, the replay value was not too highConclusion: 7 out of 10.Olafr blogs about modding and gaming: http://gamersparadiseolafr.tumblr.com/Follow Olafr the Viking Steam Curator for reviews of STRATEGY - RPG - SURVIVAL games: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25341025-Olafr-the-Viking/Learn more about the Olafr Rating System (1 to 10): http://gamersparadiseolafr.tumblr.com/post/152254235900/olafr-the-viking-rating-system-1-to-10-olafrCompare this game’s rating to other games in the Olafr Rating History: http://gamersparadiseolafr.tumblr.com/post/152254318505/olafr-the-viking-rating-history-olafr-the "

								I've only knocked about 6 hours on this game so far, but I must say that's it's worth every cent.Don't let the top-down basic character look deter you from trying out this title because it makes it up with the unlimited designs and elaborate tools to build yourself a pretty dope Prison.What I enjoyed the most was the option to build a prison with Unlimited Funds, You could turn off accepting prisoners, lay out a magnificant lock-up and have a million workers pound it out.I really need to get back into playing this game.

								I quite like Prison Architect, the way the game is designed if you are willing to challenge yourself you almost always have something to strive for, always trying to build that perfect prison. Even though the game is not fully developed and there are a lot of bugs ... so many bugs it is still a very decent game that feels very polished. As well the developers continually update and roll new features out which add another layer of strategy to the game at the moment as you redesign your prison to include the new elements. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of a challenge and a game that will draw you in and keep you busy.			"

												Prison Architect is a fun builder/management sim.  The best way to describe my fascination with it is that it's like watching an ant farm with all the ants in little orange jumpsuits.+Freedom to design your prison in whatever way you wish.  Nice extras like time-sensitive guard scheduling and automated doors and cameras.  You can reform through punishment or reform programs.  Still has monthly updates even after release.  Tons of mods.-Campaign is pretty short (I don't mind, I'm here for the sandbox).  There is no way to automate searching prisoners or cells.  Depending on your PC, performance can be an issue once you start approaching 1000 inmates.Overall, great sim game.  Hours of enjoyment to be had.			"

												So I've been wanting to play this game for awhile, and I bought it during the summer sale. Honestly, it's good fun for a little while, but I don't think it would have been worth the buy at regular price, so just a heads up. Now, aside from the price, let me describe what I like and dislike about my short time with the game.Pros:Nice, relaxing (for the most part) game, that captures a lot of what a real prison would look like. I would say if your a fan of sims and building games, this is worthy of your time.Sandbox mode is fun for awhile, and the great mods and maps from the community will keep you entertained.Cons:The story mode isn't that great from what i've played so far. It's very boring and simply re-hashes every aspect of prison management that you can learn in the sandbox mode.The game needs more content, better AI, better guard deployment, and just more attention to detail in general. For instance, if you snatch a set of keys from a guard, sure you can open most of the doors in the prison, but you can't free fellow inmates from handcuffs and have them join a riot. Detail and just common sense actions would make the game so much more satisfying.Summary: If you can get it on sale, I recommend it. It's a must have for anyone who enjoys sims and micromanagement games, and I'm looking forward to future updates.			"

It seems all the developers could think to do was make unruly inmates more difficult to pacify (one man rampaging killing 7 guards by himself, or 30 guards if he has a drill).

												This game has very few rules. 1.  Hold prisoners for thier allotted time.2. Try not to get too many killed in any one day.3.  Profit.This is a management sim/sandbox. Primarily, you will be building and designing rooms, managing your employees, and running an intelegence network.  How your prisoners are treated is really up to you; you can be the reformer or the punisher.Gameplay itself can be changed when you first create a new prison.  You can choose your warden, prisoner genders, gang presence, weather effect, and random events.  Even though Prisoner Achitect is out of early access, the developers still add content every now and then.  Be sure to check the community page when you see an update and check out their announcement and demonstration video.Edit:  Since I posted this review, the developers issued thier final update (giving dev shortcuts).  The game has taken on a different dynamic for me.   While it was in early access, I would essentially be playing a new prison with a new challenge level every month as it was updated.   I think that was the most fun for me.  I still love the game, but expect this to be the finished article.

								I quite like Prison Architect, the way the game is designed if you are willing to challenge yourself you almost always have something to strive for, always trying to build that perfect prison. Even though the game is not fully developed and there are a lot of bugs ... so many bugs it is still a very decent game that feels very polished. As well the developers continually update and roll new features out which add another layer of strategy to the game at the moment as you redesign your prison to include the new elements. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of a challenge and a game that will draw you in and keep you busy.			"

												It is a fantastic game, You know something what you want in you prison..? Build it. I dont see any bucks or glitches, but sometimes you get remembered that it is still an early access Game. For example, Not all objects has a goal or does something. I give it a 9/10! And thats very good because it is still Early Access Game! --- Update --- It is still a fantastic game! Everything fits in! Everything has something to do with logistics and running your prison! You can make it totally your own by building it and customise on every kind of aspect! If you dont want to build your own and just want to play? You can do that now with the Steam workshop in-game. There is also a gamemode where you can Escape from your own prison or that one you downloaded from the workshop. I never get bored in this awesome game and can not hate it. I saw every update coming and tried everything and in my opinion it is an finished game! This is truly a 10/10 game!			"

								Prison architect is brilliance in game form. The main point is to build the biggest prion ever but you run into problems on the way like for example having 7 dollars and then when you get 1,000 grant money YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING WORKERS REPAIRING A METAL DETECTOR FOR 1,000 AND LEVING YOU BROKE! However other than that its a really fun alpha and worth your time and money.			"

								I really liked the Roller Coaster Tycoons and the original Zoo Tycoon so its good too see another fun tycoon game after years without a good one. Right now  though Prison Architect is in very early alpha and probably won't be finished for some time so its not worth full price. But at the time of this review the new Humble Bundle has it for 10 dollars and its definitely worth that price alone. Despite still being rather barebones there's enough stuff to do that keeps me interested. If you missed the bundle just wait for another big sale. There's definitely a lot of potential here for a quality tycoon game though and I'm happy with what I got.			"

												I was actually very on edge about buying the game, I am normally a person that has to go with Very good graphics to push my computer so i get a great feel of the atmosphere... But i took a leap... I mean why not? It was a summer sale.I am amazed at the game never thought i would get into it that much building a prison and everything else you would need to build along with it.The criminals keep coming in , and along with the criminals coming in along came gang members which i didnt know about which added a new depth for me. Along with having gang members in my prison they fought and my guards had to fight back and luckly tazed them.But to add to all that. I just learned about escape mode, why not be the gang member or criminal that tries to escape or shank a couple people on the way out?.Prison life can be very fun. Atleast on steam.			"

												Like all simulation games, they do get boring at some point. Even with all of the random events and such enabled, you can still lose interest quickly, but for under $10 on the summer sale? Definitely worth it. It's very fun once you start playing, and quite unpredictable, but it would be nicer if there was even more challenge. The only significant challenge I've faced is not being able to afford new cells when more prisoners come in, which even then isn't a big deal because you have a holding cell.I recommend this game to anyone looking for an alternative gaming experience. A break from the shooters and adventure games, and go back to a classical management game. It may not be totally worth the listing price unless you're a die hard fan of these types of games and can play them for weeks, but like I said, it's a steal for 75% off. "

												A strangely addictive game. I can't stop playing it just to see what the inmates get up to next.There is currently only one bug that I've seen that really annoys the heck out of me. Sometimes prisoners will be reassigned from their private cells to the public holding cell for no reason at all and the only way to get them back into their private cells is to remove the holding cell completely. Hopefully they will fix this. Other than that I've been having a blast with this game all weekend! I highly recommend.			"

												Honestly, I thought I was walking into a good game. I thought very wrong.I walked into the best game ever created.You start off with a bit of money to build a few simple cells. You then make some important rooms like a canteen, common room, solitary, and a kitchen. You then begin to gain money and increase your cells and rooms. I currently have a huge prison.I hope the devs keep updating the game. I think the game deserves more attention.			"

								I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes strategy games and grid-based design games. I have had 1000+ hours of literal non-stop fun so far from this game. This game LACKS the ability to be boring, as you can always restart and try again. It's extremely easy to mod and I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn how to Lua code. It's far more stable and less buggy than Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is a buggy mess outright in itself; I've had one or two bugs ever happen in this game (Prison Architect) over two years of playing it, with over 1,000 hours (steam/normal version combined).This game is great for anyone, and there's tablet versions for those without their computer at hand. Introversion makes enjoyable games, Uplink and Prison Architect being my favorites, then Darwinia. If they continue work with Subversion, and they complete it to full, it could be an amazing game. Or, Uplink 2.0? That'd be cool.Pros/Cons (Cons are exagurated, so take with a grain of salt, but they aren't that bad and the gameplay and replayability of this game is worth more than any kind of con this game has).Pros:Great GameplayMods via WorkshopPrisons via WorkshopCommunity is decent (the website forum is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, especially the moderators, steam community is better)Amazing Lua capabilitiesBuilt in computer logic set pieces ('remote control' research option)Cons:-Starts to lag like hell with 200+ AI's on the map (30-45fps with oc 4.1ghz fx-6300), you're going to need a decent processor (high-end i3, i5, i7, fx-6300, fx-8350)-No multiplayer, but I can see that being a bigger issue than it would be worth (how would pathfinding be handled? servers? host? if peer-to-peer, it could kill the hosts computer from the possibility of too much AI)-Needs better multi-threading, or 64-bit. Lag issues could be killed permanently if either of these were introduced. 64-bit would kill the lag harder than more cores, though.			"

								There I was, I had just put some money onto my Steam Wallet to prepare for the amazement that is the Steam Summer Sale, I was pondering for many moments, browsing the front page. I knew I wanted a game but which game. I'm on a Mac you see so not many games are available. Prison Architect was there though. I was questioning my mate  (I later found out that he had no previous experience with the game) and he just said ""If you want."" I responded with, ""Of course I want!"" And thusly proceeded to acquire Prison Architect in the usual fashion.I ordered a pizza and let the game download, presuming it would take my 'terrible' internet a while to download. I was surprised to find that the game was simply 150 MB in size and my 'terrible' internet was able to download it in a matter of minutes. I went onto it. Tried to change around with the settings, being in a Skype call and having the game sounds blaring into your ears wasn't the greatest thing. With that tweak well and truly sorted I moved on to play the game.The first thing the game asked me to do was to build an execution room and I was already excited. Have you always wanted to build a room to kill all those that wronged? Then this is the game for you! Having completed the introduction I thought I was ready to move onto larger and greater things... I've never been so wrong in my life before.I went onto load up a world in all it's default gloryness. Built the usual holding cell, office, canteen and kitchen. Proceeded to hire a warden, one million guards and two cooks. Then the normal risk prisoners arrived. I was there in all my naivety believing the guards would able to handle these prisoners... again, I've never been so wrong in my life before.Trying to pimp out the kitchen when a red sign pops up saying '1..2...3...4..5...6...7 prisoners escaped'. I immediately scanned the area, spotting out the escapees and bringing them back to justice. Turns out, the guards would rather fight a guy inside the holding cell as opposed to capturing those who flee. It was a dead end and I had to plow on.In the end, I just turned out to be really bad at the game and as much as I found it difficult it truly is an enjoyable game. I do recommend you buy it this sale or if not buy it whenever.			"

Since I started playing things like armed gaurds, dogs, a prison grading system, prisoner traits, reform programs, gangs and most recently random events, have all been added to this game. It still amazes me that such a small team has made this game. I really can't recommend this game enough. I have more hours in this game than I do in any other.

								Highly addictive and entertaining game, well worth it especially on sale. There are still quite a few bugs but you are able to work around them. My only real complaint with the game is that it starts off with a toturial level which gets you to build an execution room, however thats the only toturial you get and you are left to figure it out on your own after that. I had to restart my prison over many times because it is quite hard at first to understand how to build your prison and get it running most efficiently. It would be really helpful if they could add more toturial levels to help new begginers.			"

												This game is a Prison Simulator, built around housing and caring for the needs of your inmates. The systems in the game are very complex, yet easy to understand after some time spent with them. The needs of the prisoners are built really well as no prison thinks the exact same, and each has their personal levels of emotion. Each prisoner has his own story and outside family. You can run your prison in any style or fashion you want; from one staffed by armed guards with a truly hellish environment to a luxury prison, built around comfort of inmates. I truly enjoyed this game. I would recommend going through a bit of the campaign first to understand some of the basic operations of the prison. 9/10			"

								Prison Architect is an early access prison simulator similar to Roller Coaster Tycoon, Simcity, or the like.  It has elements of sandbox/construction with managed tiers for punishment, rehabilitation, kitchen menu etc... right down to micromanaging each hour of each prisoner's day.  You can decide to create the most horrific environment for your prisoners... or maybe you want to excel at rehabilitation & prisoner ""recovery"".  Either way the well stocked options provide freedoms to the user that all simulation games should have... most of the features seem to work already!  Game play is kind of ""real"" ... with comic book style scene transitions & backstories.  However if you can get past the prison thing and just ""play the game"" it is very enjoyable and addictive.  Though this is an early access game it is totally payable in it's current state.If you like simulation/sandbox/management style games... or enjoyed any of the ""Tycoon"" series of games... this is one with a more serious story line/undertones (you can skip the scenes also).  Definitely worth checking out.  "

												I love the improvements implemented into this game, it is amazing since coming out of early access, I really like the campaign which was a huge improvement from the tutorial in EA. Get this game if - you like management which is still deep but not boring- colourful graphics- seeing a prison wide riot break out and causes the whole place to almost burn down			"

Early Access Review
								Highly addictive and entertaining game, well worth it especially on sale. There are still quite a few bugs but you are able to work around them. My only real complaint with the game is that it starts off with a toturial level which gets you to build an execution room, however thats the only toturial you get and you are left to figure it out on your own after that. I had to restart my prison over many times because it is quite hard at first to understand how to build your prison and get it running most efficiently. It would be really helpful if they could add more toturial levels to help new begginers.			"

								With the game about to have it's offical relase October 6th I thought I would update my review. This is how you do early access correctly. Every month for the past 3 years there has been an update with new, sometimes game changing, content added. Since I started playing things like armed gaurds, dogs, a prison grading system, prisoner traits, reform programs, gangs and most recently random events, have all been added to this game. It still amazes me that such a small team has made this game. I really can't recommend this game enough. I have more hours in this game than I do in any other. I can't believe I spent 30 dollars and got 500+ hours of entertainment from this game.			"

								Gives You an experience how to run a Prison !Ok,first impressions of this game i was like,sims like prison type game ?It gives You an insight situation how prison looks like,digging tunel,inmate fighting each other,family visit,workstation,contraband,death sentence etc...The game gives the answer ""How does a prison look like""On the other side,something is missing like bribing a guards,but that not much of a problem because the game still in a development stage !And 1 last thing,if You like Prison Break movies and all about Prison,You must buy this ! :3PS : Sorry for bad English :D			"

Early Access Review
								I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes strategy games and grid-based design games. I have had 1000+ hours of literal non-stop fun so far from this game. This game LACKS the ability to be boring, as you can always restart and try again. It's extremely easy to mod and I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn how to Lua code. It's far more stable and less buggy than Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is a buggy mess outright in itself; I've had one or two bugs ever happen in this game (Prison Architect) over two years of playing it, with over 1,000 hours (steam/normal version combined).This game is great for anyone, and there's tablet versions for those without their computer at hand. Introversion makes enjoyable games, Uplink and Prison Architect being my favorites, then Darwinia. If they continue work with Subversion, and they complete it to full, it could be an amazing game. Or, Uplink 2.0? That'd be cool.Pros/Cons (Cons are exagurated, so take with a grain of salt, but they aren't that bad and the gameplay and replayability of this game is worth more than any kind of con this game has).Pros:Great GameplayMods via WorkshopPrisons via WorkshopCommunity is decent (the website forum is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, especially the moderators, steam community is better)Amazing Lua capabilitiesBuilt in computer logic set pieces ('remote control' research option)Cons:-Starts to lag like hell with 200+ AI's on the map (30-45fps with oc 4.1ghz fx-6300), you're going to need a decent processor (high-end i3, i5, i7, fx-6300, fx-8350)-No multiplayer, but I can see that being a bigger issue than it would be worth (how would pathfinding be handled? servers? host? if peer-to-peer, it could kill the hosts computer from the possibility of too much AI)-Needs better multi-threading, or 64-bit. Lag issues could be killed permanently if either of these were introduced. 64-bit would kill the lag harder than more cores, though.			"

Early Access Review
								Prison Architect is 'different' to most strategy games out there. It is still an alpha (15/06/2014) however the game seems almost completed! The game has so much potential-some of which it has already forfillled. The glitches, such as prisoners remain seated and act as normal when a deadly fire is in the room, make the game hilarious and laughable. Even if it is an alpha it does what a game is ment to do; entertain you. It isnt severly incompleted. Eveything in the game works flawlessly-most of the time-and you forget it is an alpha. Also there are fun glitches/things, e.g. the prisons sit on the blade of a saw in the workshop as they are using it, the prison jail doors get overwhelmed with people trying to get through and the guards can't open it for them so for hours your prisons are waiting at a door!The gamemakers (introversion softwere) also go very in-depth with detain in some parts of the game. An example of this is the attention to detail to the prisons. Each is given a name, picture, list of convictions e.g. how many years served (and what for) and how many years to serve(and what for), also family, security level, #ref number, recent status, activity, mood, condition, experiance, punishment/security grading, bio and more. You can also make your own character by purchasing the 'Name in Game' upgrade dcl which allows you to create your own character which could even be based on you with your name!The only complaint I have is the price, especially of the 'Name in Game' upgrade dcl. I find that £15 for your name and bio in-game isnt worth £15. And that's just for name in the game, if you want the game as well it is just short of £35. The game (only) is £20. This game does not have good graphic qualitly however for a game like this you don't want nor need it as the graphics suit the game perfectly. Overall, it is a great game and introversion have done well-so far. I would reccormend you buy this games as if you like strategy, organisation and building this game is perfect. It is worth the £20 sale price. I would also highly recommend you upgrade the game with the 'Name in Game' dcl ONLY DURING A SALE(personally £15 is over-expensive). This is an exellant game with everything I would expect in it and more. I cannot wait to see what the game developers have instore in the next update! (Alpha 22) Great game-buy it!			"
