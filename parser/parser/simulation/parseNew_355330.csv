												After playing this game for a while; it has it's good points and some very bad points. The basic overview of the game is that it is better than Demolition Company, in terms of building stability. For those who do not own Demoliton Company, it would suffice to say that sometimes you only need to walk into a building to cause parts of it to collapse; with this game that does not happen. It is certainly not Construction Simulator 2015 as you are only constructing parts of a building rather than digging foundations, pouring concrete and delivering materials to the site as was pointed out in another review, this game utilises rubber band physics, a great indicator of this is with the mobile crane, the jib of the crane moves around which in turn causes the wire and hook to bounce around pretty much resulting in damage to materials.Overall I would say that the game warrants a 7/10 as there are some issues there which need dealt with. If any developers are reading this, a proper demolition simulator with the same physics as Construction Simulator 2015 would be fab. You could have all the hand tools needed plus excavators of various sizes and types such as high reach, or with a sorter head, claws, shears etc!!!!			"

												This game is ok, but it needs a lot of fixes, some examples are as follows:                    1. Vehicles slide way too easy, even when driving slow. even the Excavator slides around                    2. several imaginary barriers, that you will bump into.                    3. vehicle fuel usage set a little too fast.                      3a. vehicles only have one speed, hint: (turtle power)                    4. vehicle suspension does not function properly on rough terrain.                    5. no customization availible for paint schemes. Just plain dull yellow.                    6. A lot of repetitive effort on repeatables in order to purchase machines and upgrades.All in all I am dissapointed in the game, and would not recommend it to a friend "

												I liked the game, but was shocked when there were only like 7 or 8 machines & only around 25 different scenerios in the ENTIRE game...wish it had a few more machines & scenerios for sure.			"

												It's a fun game, but there needs to be some bug fixes. When I pick up a wall normally, it just randomly breaks, and it's annoying especaily when you are far in the contract. I'm hoping that it will be fixed.			"

												The simulation  was fun but short lived less than 20 hours to complete all equipment upgrades and end scenerio. The number of construction vehicles is less than demonstrated on the film clips of the game. Game clips showed construction of a high rise apartment building but such construction was not part of the game play. Very misleading. The physics is acceptable but far from perfect. When you decide to go to free play, all you get is a rehash of the different scenerios already played. No way to advance. Dissapointing. Price too high for the amount of game play. Don't waste your money.			"

												As much as I like the construction games. This is another that does not deliver well. It has some great promise. While I like the repairs the fuel is a bit excessive. A real vechile could go days with out a refueling. A 5 gallon gas can on any of this is not even worth the time. The some of the eq is fun to operate and most are most difficult. I was sad to see that you can not use a joystick nor game pad. This is not worth the money spent on it!			"

												I wouldnt waste your time or money on this very poor game. Playway SA seem to have taken a backwards step in game developement, one of the first things that got me was lack of audio control when I started the game the sound nearly deafened me in settings the options were music on/off sounds on/off, there was lack of controller support nearly every game you get nowadays has controller support but this one its virtualy none.  Another cash grab game.			"

												As another reviewer pointed out, it's better than Demolition Company and that's really what I'd compare it to. It's more focused on the destruction / preparation of a work site than fully building. If you enjoy smashing and destroying things then I'm sure you'll find something to enjoy here. If you want to fully micromanage all aspects of a construction company then this one will leave you feeling empty. The destruction physics feel satisifying and there's a decent selection of vehicles and tasks to keep you busy.

												The title is misleading at the point where it says ""simulator"", because it most certainly is NOT a simulator.Its an arcade game where you are to demolish stuff using tools and machines and unlike real life, you will be breaking it down by simply driving into it with frontloaders and excavators.For each job completed youll be awarded some money, for which you can buy new machines, which will grant you access to other jobs for which you will be awarded some money, for which you can buy......asoThe game is somewhat fun for a short while, it soon becomes very repetitive though.Controls are simple and clumsy to use and after fiddling with the controller setup for a while, I got it mapped so I could use my Xbox one controller to play the game.However, you cant configure all the controls, for instance, on the excavator, to raise and lower the boom, you will be using the same controls as for driving forwards and backwards.In other words, controls cant be configured individually.The machines has rubberband physics, not as bad as Construction Machines 2015, but still, its rubberband.Especially the excavator is hard to drive when you need to turn, straight backwards and forwards works though, but the belts doesn't really seem to work independently.Physics are pretty much like in early construction machine games, where concrete chunks has a super slippery surface and no feel of mass to them.The machines aren't driven by their belts or wheels, its more the other way around, the machine is moved and the belts/wheels follow.You can easily tell when you drive the wheel loader and one of its wheels lose contact with the ground surface, because it stops spinning when in the air.Graphics arent bad, though not pristine in any way, but basically its allright.The only good thing about this game is, that the physics are slightly better than it is in the much older Demolition games where you can really drive machines into things to break them down successfully.So by that one thing, this game is a step in the right direction, but its far from good enough.Once again im sitting here with another claimed construction simulator that isnt worth the pricetag.It feels like this game (just like every other similar game out there) was done within a narrow budget, so that everything is just below par.If you like arcade games though, this game may keep you entertained for a few hrs, but still i think youll find the amount of entertainment this game has to offer, is very/too pricy.It would be gr8 if we could have one good construction sim game at 80 euro rather than the pile of 20 euro trash we have now.

												Decent little game, but not something I'd call worthy of having simulator in its name. Very arcadey handling on all vehicles, and they run out of gas or have parts break on them so fast. All 25 levels can easily be beaten in under 6 hours, probably 7 if you bothered grinding for cash to upgrade the vehicles. Missions can be replayed but there's not a whole lot of other ways to complete each level.Game looks decent and runs very well. I'd even hazard to say it's the smoothest-running, best-optimized Unity game I've yet played - proof positive it's the developers of those other games and not the engine that causes issues for so many. Controls fine with keyboard and mouse too, but the sounds are kinda lackluster.For around $7.50 or in that simulator bundle when it's on sale is about right, any pricier and I'd skip it.			"

												Edit: So I have played a little more after my first impressions. About 90 minutes into the game I have had two crashes which resulted in Blue Screens of Death. A unique experience to say the least these days. Controls are frustrating as well. I would stay away until the game at the very least is stable and on sale. $10 would be a more realistic price point IMO.So far it has been an interesting take on the construction simulator games. Very enjoyable to smash down buildings and seems to have a unique variety of missions however do not expect AAA graphics or anything of the sort. Fun game so far.Will edit after I have played more.
