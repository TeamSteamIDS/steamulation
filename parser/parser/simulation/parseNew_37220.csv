												Addicting time management game, Cooking Dash will keep you distracted for some hours and maybe days if you're into dash games like I am. The gameplay is fast and it has cute comic book graphics to tell the storyline.			"

												Like all DASH games, the formula is the same but the toppings are different. If you like these kinds of games then this one is a no-brainer! Great for wanna-be cooks!			"

												お店の店員になって客をさばくゲーム。最初の方はまったりとできるが、レベルが上がるに連れて某ハンバーガーショップのランチタイム並に忙しくなるので効率の良い動線を探り、調理時間や客のストレスを計算に入れて動かないとすぐ詰むので気をつけよう。			"

												Cooking Dash test how fast your are at learning food orders and sending them out. This game can get pretty hard, but Its enjoyable. My wife and I love to beat each others scores.			"

												This game is so DOPE.  its fun, how you can find something wrong with the premise of this game is ridiculous.  If you stick your head far enough up your♥♥♥♥♥you can find things wrong with ANY game.			"

												This is better as the tablet or mobile app, but I can not recomend it for the pc. Though the mobile version is engaging enough in the rote learning kinda way.			"
