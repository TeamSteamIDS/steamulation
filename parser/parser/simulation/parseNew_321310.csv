								Not really much of a game. Press W to move forward, mouse to move camera. That's about it.			"

								PLEASE do not buy this game. It is horrible. Made by the creators of Air Control, it is just as much of a rip off as it's predecessor. The creators have had the gall to change their name and try for another shot of scamming us out of money that could be better spent on real games. Avoid avoid avoid!			"

								I can in no way recommend this 'game' to other people. It has a cluttered, obtrusive and just plain illogical presentation. The graphics are blurry and there's zero gameplay here, except for swimming around watching other fish and creatures and looking at sea life and other objects. It's supposed to be Zen, but you would be better off watching one of those pretty aquarium screensavers or any kind of underwater documentary really.[Rating: 45/100]			"

								I was expecting something indepth and realistic; but what I got was a low quality arrangement of coral and anemone I could pass right through ruining the illusion of them being real, fish that looked like toys you would find in a dollar store, and a movement system that didn't let you dive nor take into account the direction you faced while you moved. I was very dissapointed in the quality and the content. Do not buy!			"

								For those that don’t know a company known as ‘Killjoy’, a while ago now, submitted a very low substandard piece of work onto the Steam store and sold it for around $5.00 known as ‘Air Control’. Eventually as social media caught onto this fact, that not only was it a badly programmed vagrant cash grab, but that the game itself contained many cases of copyright infringement which the developer himself just stole without gaining approval. Hence the company known as ‘Killjoy’ eventually became known as a scam artist.This tarnished reputation originally was evaded by the company changing their name to ‘Iron Game Studios’ and again another quick cash grab full of glitches and meaningless copyright infringement dribble was released onto the Steam Store, but not all consumers are dumbbells and soon many began to realise that this raw programming piece of sewage was from the exact same scammers of ‘Air Control’.

			The game Ride to Hell has nightmares about. Game Link: http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/air-control-review/1900-6415776/ End theme by the incredible Dan Bull: http://www.youtube.com/user/douglby All...		

Eventually after a massive backlash exposing this fact, it’s interesting to note that the reputable publisher Kiss LTD ( http://www.kiss-ltd.co.uk/ ) took a noble measure of immediate action removing it not only swiftly from the Steam store, but also from any other retailer, they made a formal apology that this violation somehow got through their scrutiny process and offered a refund for a period of time to anyone who bought this falsely marketed product. Since then you can bet Kiss Ltd have tightened the reins to make sure this kind of thing never happens again?However it’s interesting to note that even to this day many question if the developer ( http://zenfishgame.blogspot.com.au/ ) is really a scammer or more just a delusional programming wannabe. For one thing, regardless of the sheer volume of glitches and bugs, one can’t ignore the amount of work that ‘did’ go into this press ‘w’ simulator. 30 levels of different landscapes, decorated with many animated versions of fish. One quickly therefore asks were they the work of the developer? Or are they also a copyright infringement? How much of this product was truly his?What further makes this a puzzling thing is that the game starts off with a begging statement requesting that you meditate and imagine what life would be like as a fish. Whatever inspirational message the developer is trying to get across soon becomes lost as you begin to laughingly experience levels where a clown fish is experiencing flashbacks of her children being burnt as she swims along, and a questionable level where your clownfish seems to be on LSD.The music which is supposed to be relaxing you into some type of Zen trance, instead is piercing your eardrums with a heavenly choir that sounds like they’ve just sat on a hot poker. There is no in game volume control other than to turn the damn thing off. Even the clown fish you control eventually swims into an Angler fish and snuffs himself for which I assume was an act of mercy in trying to get out of the game. Alas you’re not so lucky and for no apparent reason whatsoever get to control other fish in the following levels again where the only objective is to press ‘w’ until you trigger the next cut scene. This isn’t always the case though, for instance one scene does not trigger any cuts, and instead you can swim endlessly into the blue beyond for 6 hrs straight or more if you wish to experience a migration scene across the whole Atlantic.What really gets my panties in a knot, is that the developer of the game even spent time translating this noble message of imagine what life would be like as a fish in more languages than what is even currently translated on the United Nations Website. Seriously! I KID YOU NOT! This guy REALLY wanted to get this message of ‘Let’s have some fish empathy!!!’ out there. I really wouldn’t be surprised if he hasn’t started door knocking by now asking people, ‘Have you ever wondered what life would be like if you were a fish?’ and let’s face it there’s probably many out there with a Christian fish symbol who might be tempted here…Ironically many who wanted it originally completely scaled from the Steam store and now it is, a number of those avid game collectors would now love to hook themselves a copy, all because of its downstream antics and history. I concur and understand why some are truly vexed about the game. Was he delusional? Was he a scammer? Was he both? My personal beliefs is that he was definitely a very ‘fishy’ person.

			Here is the full game of a product revoked from Steam as soon as it was identified from the same scammers of Air Control.
