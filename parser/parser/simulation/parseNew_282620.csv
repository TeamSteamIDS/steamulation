												Bit Planet has done some very cool things with this game.Normally, I would hit the good points first, but I want to get my complaints out of the way.On the plot side, the characterizations of the different pilots can be pretty cartoony, to the point of things becoming unbelievable. Lieutenants have an alarming tendency to order captains (and even generals) around, and it's done with complete impunity. It was hard for me to suspend my disbelief in that area. Further, there is an outsized amount of profanity used by a particular pilot, and it seems to be gratuitous rather than character establishing. (Maybe it's just me.)Speaking technically, the game does have some nagging, but mercifully un-fatal bugs. The first is that the Ingress/ hacking loop still delivers invalid codes in some situations. It's incredibly frustrating to select what should be the right code, only to have it fail...and be taking fire from a number of turrets at the same time. Also, there's an occasional graphics glitch where a ""sun"" overlay gets plastered all over the center of your screen. (The problem can be quickly fixed by selecting a different screen resolution, and then reverting.)Every once in a while, a rough edge in overall experience design makes a glaring appearance. The most notable of these was a mission where you have to save some transports that are dropping through atmosphere. The success/ fail conditions for the mission are not at all clear at first, although the success condition is so low that I suppose you can shrug your shoulders a bit.My final negative point is that ""jinking"" in a tough dogfight doesn't seem to be possible. If an enemy fighter succeeds in getting you ""zeroed,"" you either have afterburners available for escape, or you're in big trouble. The only turning option you have seems to be heading directly toward your attacker, which lets them hammer you several more times before they overshoot. Hopefully, you're not in a crowd.But the above paragraph leads me into what's really, really good about the game:Energy management.Really.There are lots of other space sims that give you the ability to transfer energy amongst three systems, such as shields, weapons, and afterburner. In every other such game that I've played, that energy management is fairly secondary. In ""Battle Of Sol,"" it's front and center in a very neat and satisfyingly challenging way. Especially when flying the Hades(?), each energy reserve is pretty shallow. You have to keep your head in the ETS game, or you will be in enormous trouble. This lends a nice boost to the tension of combat, especially because the basic dogfighting isn't all that hard.The criticality of the energy management also helps to create noticeable differentiation between the Hades and the Arrow fighters. Arrows don't let you manage energy transfer manually, and the afterburners are ""all or nothing,"" but the regen time is fast...for two out of three systems. The bugbear you get to wrestle with is that shield regeneration isn't under your control - you have to escape from combat almost entirely if your Arrow gets mangled. This ""personality difference"" really keeps you on your toes, and is a great way to add variety where a whole bunch of different ships aren't a gameplay option. Another great choice by the developers is the need to master the ""slide"" mechanic. In other games, the ability to keep your heading while changing your orientation is handy, if not necessarily required. In this game, you'll either get it or get torn to shreds. Giving thought to your heading and then engaging a slide is the only thing that will keep you effective against gun platforms and capital ships. Once you do get it, you'll feel very much more like an ace pilot, especially since you'll actually be able to do some good.Another thing I like was the (seeming) overall homage to the reimagined ""Battlestar Galactica."" The UCS missions often feature percussion-heavy music that would fit right in with BSG, and the Hades guns seem to behave - and sound - very much like what you would find on a Colonial Viper. Maybe this was all intentional, and maybe it wasn't...but it's fun either way, and made me smile.Bit Planet has really done some fine work here, and I think they could build a real challenger to Wing Commander and Freespace if they keep iterating and extending what they've got already. This particular game isn't an instant classic, mosty because it's not deep enough for that, but the seeds do seem to be there.			"

												I don't normally do this so I apologize in advanced. I will try to be as nice as possible....1) Game looks pretty nice, cap ships look cool and at first I thought ""wow this is gonna be cool!""2) Hotas support is a real pain. I don't want to go into too much detail here but it took me hours to setup. I gave up trying honestly cuz I bought this game a few days after release. Now finally today I dedicated another 3 hours to trying to to setup my Hotas. I have CH fighterstick and CH pro throttle. It is SOOOO complicated with about 40 different axis choices and it doesn't sense any axis so you must do this manually. Would be easy without the maybe 15 or so subcategories for axis. I have never seen anything this complicated and I have played many space sims. Feels like they just threw HOTAS support in for us and said ""you figure it out!"". In the end of a 3 hour setup run I finally stopped trying to designate my throttle and rolls to any axis. I just shut them off and found out how to designate those controls to the keyboard. In other words, old school 90s wing commander style play from here out, Stick and keyboard. Still, I was determined to give this an honest try.3) Sounds Really rough here. When overheating you hear a loud ""ping!"". Thought I could turn that effect down by turning sound fx down and leaving music and master volume up but nope. Just turns down other sounds but that damn ping sound stays loud as hell! The weapon sounds are also really bad here. No real gun sounds and no real missile sounds. One good thing I will say is the voice acting is pretty cool. Well done in that department.4) Gameplay. Really simple, boring fighting. Made it 10 missions in. Only way you can tell you are being attacked is a red color in the corner of your ship. No feel of impact or sound effects to help you know. Also on the flipside it's hard as hell to tell you are hitting the enemy ship other than they visually take damage. Even after all the HOTAS nightmares the joystick randomly rolls while making fast movements. The CH Fighterstick CANNOT ROLL so this is a software problem with the game. This never happened in any space sims I ever played before. Very annoying. Also everytime to fire your guns the whole screen blurs up and shakes like crazy. Not cool man....5) Summary Guys, I thank you for trying to make a fun single player space combat game. I miss these types of games dearly as a big fan of the glory days of Wing Commander, Freespace, X Wing and Tie Fighter. However, this time...mission not accomplished. I am very sorry to write a review like this. But the fact that I paid money for this game is a damn shame. I have played fan made mods of Wing Commander and Freespace games that are honestly 10 times as good as this. Those were made by non pros. Examples would be Wing Commander Saga, Wing Commander Standoff, and about a dozen Freespace mods. I do however hope you guys try again sometime soon. But you need to take your time and make a good game. Make the game interesting. Instead of just checkpoints all the time give us real destinations. The guns need to feel like guns. Missles need to be improved greatly. The art style you guys used was awesome. IT LOOKS SWEET!! Also, next time you build a space combat game, make it with the HOTAS in mind from the beginning. Don't just tack in on after the fact. Space combat games died with Freelancer and I think a big part of that was the fact that this is the beginning of mouse space combat games. Alright, that's all I have to say. Once again, I'm really sorry to the creators if this sounds harsh......but it's all the truth. I respect you a lot for trying but this has been a terrible gaming experience for me.			"

Early Access Review
								Just a couple of things...There are a lot of great things about this game - graphics, story... lots of potential.That said, flight mechanics and a couple of other things leave A LOT to be desired.1) No side thrusters - up, down, left or right.  Unless I don't understand the controls, you can't control the direction of your ship... only backward or forward.  Even Tom Hanks had side thrusters in Apollo 13.2) Buggy.  Sound goes in and out (I've checked my machine and settings.. definitely on the side of the game).  You can travel through ship models... I've designed 3d spaceships for games before and this isn't a hard issue to avoid.  I DO recommend this game as it has a lot of potential.  I suggest they model their flight mechanics as Allegiance did, which is considered semi-Newtonian.			"

												Recommendation - Not so much (After about 5 + hours)I love Space Sims so I try a new one every now and again. This is not Freespace2, Freelancer, Wing Commander or the Alpha of Star Citizen. This is a mission to mission game where a single failure and you cannot move on. Pros1. Easy to playCons1. On the rail format for story - (You pass or fail a mission but cannot move on if you fail)2. No customization for ships.3. No choice for load out.4. Cardboard props for characters.5. No interest in re-play.6. Voice acting... Meh.So why should you play. Well to be honest if you need to blow stuff up without caring of story or characters than this can get you by.			"

												+Cool space backgrounds.+Entertaining dogfights.+Voice dialogs.+Easy to learn how to play.+Nice music.+Ability to issue some basic commands to your fleet.+Story to be continued. I hope the sequel will be much better overall.-Unable to modify ships and weapons.-Very few available weapons to use. -No much variation of ships.-Difficult to control on specific objectives. In fact some of the last missions were really frustrating.-Average graphics.-Short campaign.-Unclear how the story goes.-Although you may give commands to your fleet, there's not much of any help.I put this game as recommended only for those who enjoy space sims and collect this category of games.Otherwise, I think that you will not enjoy it much.

												Edit 07/07/2015Just finished the storyline and the game definitely left me wanting more. The devs are also very responsive, I encountered a bug and it was patched immediately. Another patch dropped today so it is obvious the devs are looking to support this game. Very pleased and looking forward for a continuation of the storyline!Original ReviewThis game is an amazing accomplishment because it does something that a lot of these new space fighter games have not done, remind me of the old days. The flight mechanics are straight old school. Many have complained about the lack of strafe but old school games like Wing Commander did not have strafe. Slide however works exactly like it did in Wing Commander 3.I do have two complaints and please note I have not yet finished the game. The ships, while controlling great, do not feel to have much speed. There are afterburners but they are used up quick, which I do not mind. I just wish there top speed of the craft was higher. My second complaint is that I have only been allowed to pilot two different fighters. Again I have yet to finish the story line so maybe I will get additional starfighters as the game progresses.If you are a fan of old school starfighters I highly recommend this purchase.			"

												Going straight to the point: I don't like this game so much, because it's made of short single missions which should be part of a whole story, but: Each mission is really short and all of them (at least the ones I played so far) are located in a very limited space, you're so near to mother spaceships and enemies that it's easy to even collide with them.Gameplay is about locking targets and firing at them; when objectives are achieved, you'll fly back into mothership and the mission will quit. You have turrets and missiles, can adjust power between trust and armor so to gain advantage in any of those and can repair the hull using that same power sources.There's really not much more to tell. About the story, I couldn't understand it at all, there's a bunch of messages between pilots and commanders and they are all ""thrown"" at you without a proper background, apart from the brief introductory cutscenes which only tell a basic story about Earth being doomed and the need to find another system to live in.I'm still playing SOL, even because I've sinked only a couple of hours in and it's not so contemptible, but I expected more from a space sim, like it's advertised. This can be a nice game to buy in a bundle, I think.			"

												It's a fun old school space sim.   With about 70 min of game play I'm liking it, it was well worth the $15 I paid for it.  A lot of nostalgia value, feeling like Freespace or Starlancer, on a $15 budget.  But, MY JOYSTICK IS NOT WORKING.  I have an X-55 with a set of rudder pedals.  The game defaults to using my rudder pedals as the input device - which, for reasons, leaves me spining in space.  I'm sure that I can work around but using the whole HOTAS set up is out of the question right now. That's not a deal breaker though.  Although I am I proud HOTAS user that's not the way this game is meant to be played.  The game plays more as a arcade then sim.  But that's fun.  Bottom line:  If you've played through the real old school space games then this is something fun to do.			"

												I have a particular love for all space games, and I buy them all. This game I got on a sale, and was not expecting much.It has been said in previous reviews, it reminds me of the beginnings of Battle Star Galactica, remnants of humans trying to survive and grow. So there is story there.Now to combat:The combat, after learning through the beginning missions (and honestly the game has a steady and appropriate learning curve) is fun and engaging. Eventually the player is able to control units, they aren't useless, and it’s a fun game. More than an arcade sense of space game fun and not so in depth like Elite Dangerous or X RebirthYou want a fun game, that you don't mind spending a few hours getting to learn and play, a game that has a believable story with a sort of purpose coupled with Freelancer-like combat in FPS view, give this game a chance. Good potential, developers have great ideas. I wonder what else they can accomplish with more support.I give it a thumbs up, at the very least get it on a discount if you like space combat games, you will not be disappointed given you play a few hours to learn.

												Not exactly a great game, but still a big improvement over the initial release named Sol: Exodus. Still pretty short game (6-8 hours top). It suffers with some problems - limited replay value, cheesy characters and lines (I dont mind writing that much though), bad voice acting, cliffhanger ending, sometimes a bit stiffy controls and nonexistent ship customisation. Yet combat is kinda entertaining, mission variety (while not great) was good enough to keep me entertained through all of the short game. While some of the Freespace 2 mods are actually made better than this, we really lack games in this genre and I still had reasonable fun with it and developers are active on steam forums and game updates. So I will give it thumb up. Though I would wait for a sale.			"

												TL:DR – Did you like Freespace? Do you like or even prefer narrative based space combat games? Do you understand that a team of 6 developers are not going to give you the experience of a AAA game? If you’ve just answered yes to those questions you will get something out of the around 5 hours of campaign available in this game.I felt compelled to write a review on The Battle of Sol. At the time of writing it is sitting with a mixed rating and that seems rather unfair IMO. I’ll be honest, there are so many games on Steam that if a game has a mixed rating or less I very rarely add it to my account, even if I got it in a bundle, and I definitely wouldn’t buy it. Such is the nature of a swamped marketplace. For this game that makes me a little sad that others almost certainly take a similar life’s too short approach and will be skipping this. There are so few games in the narrative space combat genre and this game is a decent game in its own right.First to what this isn’t, this isn’t indie Star Citizen or indie Elite, there is no open world. If you ever played Freespace that is the most similar experience, all be it stripped down in many ways, it is an indie game after all. It is a narrative experience played out over a series of combat missions, if that doesn’t appeal then this game probably isn’t for you. If you’re like me and grew up playing Freespace and its sequel and loved them, then there is something for you hear.I’m just going to reiterate, this is indie Freespace, be under no illusions of that. Freespace may have been years ago but the golden age of Interplay was created with a sizeable budget and development team at that time. Technology may have moved on but the dev team appears to be only 6 in size for this game which is not going to create the content equivalent to a AAA title even many years later. The story is ok, certainly not ground-breaking but not appalling. The acting isn’t going to win awards but it’s not annoying either, to be fair I’ve heard a lot worse in games with much higher budgets. It’s not short IMO for an indie narrative game, but neither is it that long, you can complete it in around 5 hours if you are playing at a challenging setting. The missions range from great to ok, for me the game started strongly after the tutorial but tailed away towards the end as the focus was taken off dogfighting, which was a mistake IMO. You only get to fly two fighters, you don’t get to choose your weapon load out and most dogfighting you generally rely on guns anyway which is fine by me. However the controls are decent and again should be familiar to anyone who liked Freespace, just with less options for management, although you do get to give orders to wingmen at times. It plays fine with a 360 controller if, like me, you no longer bother getting the flightstick out for casual games, but I’m lead to believe there is joystick support. The graphics are ok and at 144 FPS maxed out it looks good enough but nothing special, it certainly won’t be giving Star Citizen any headaches in the art department, but luckily it’s a genre that doesn’t need awesome graphics to succeed. There is the option to replay any mission from the menu once you have unlocked it in the campaign and a number of achievements to unlock if you are that way inclined.The Devs are very active with little fixes and very responsive to bugs and issues. My one major criticism would be that it seems to have left early access slightly too early. The devs were literally patching bugs as I played, but you can now play the game from start to finish without encountering a major game breaking bug and I saw very little glitches or minor bugs.If you don’t go in expecting AAA quality there is a lot of enjoyment to be had from the around 5 hours of campaign. If you are a genre fan you should pick this up, if you’re not a genre fan it is still a fun game and better than others I have played on Steam with much higher review scores. If it’s in a bundle it’s a no brainer. "

I want to say the game is fluent and you never have to think about screen stuttering or fps or whatever. The game is fast and fun. It could be for space shooters what the Call of Duty games are for shooters. Fun and easy and good action. No need to ""learn"" the game for days until you succeed. You start the game and have fun.

												Review: 2/5In this game you pilot small fighter craft (think battlestar galactica style fighters) in narrated and linear space combat missions.The story and voice acting are boring and laughable at best. Graphics feel quite dated for a game released in 2015.As far as gameplay goes, the game attempts to make you feel like you are part of epic fleet vs fleet battles when in reality you are pointing your ship's crosshairs from red circle to red circle easily picking off enemy fighter OR pulling your hair out trying to shoot small turrets on large ships while dealing with the worst controls out of any space sim I've played. I attempted one mission atleast 10 times as I repeatedly would ram into the ship I was shooting at because you have to get within 2 meters of your target to even think about shooting these small turrets accurately. Too bad that's again rediculously frustrating to do when your ship weaves and bobs all over the place.Overall not recommended. Would need a serious overhaul.			"

I see potential to tell a better single player story, with better delivered wingman communications on the solid base of this game.I have not played with the editor yet but suspect I may talk about what can be done with this game in the community once I have finished the 2 campaigns I purchased for a reasonable price. I have spent a bit of time getting it running perfectly in stereoscopic 3D and it looks great, with some shader’s having to be turned down or off. "

												A solid, fun space-combat game which takes a lot of cues from genre classics and adds a lot of its own ideas. The story nearly identical to Battlestar Galactica, but I can hardly say that's a bad thing. Offers up some vast space battles and plenty of action, but never becomes a slog. Not the most gorgeous Unreal game, but its certainly palatable. Also probably the first time I've ever enjoyed the company of military fighter pilots in a game.

The textures and models are well designed and reliable, even running at 4k, The Battle of Sol blows the competiton out of the Water- or should that be Sky? Anyway, the efficient Dev team handle bugs like the best, taking time to sort out each circumstance and get to the root of the issue.The Storyline is inventive and enrapturing, with excellent Characterisation and good VA talent.Overall, TBoS is definitley worth adding to your library!

Early Access Review
								Keep in mind that the game is still under development, so my opinion may change between now and official release.  It's a little rough around the edges graphically (even at 1920x1080) and the controls take some getting used to (reminds me of Battlestar Galactica a bit), but I'm enjoying my experiences thus far.  Skirmish mode, for example, introduces not only the ability to dogfight a bit but actually has some sort of resource mechanic that I don't fully understand yet.  In short, Exodus of Sol has a lot of potential.  Check out my 30 minute preview/first impressions video if you'd like to see more:

								So far i like this game! Review might change down the line :) If you are a fan of Space Sim type games or  Wing Commander games im sure you will like this game. It seems to have good controls and real nice looking gfx! I say give this one a shot and lets see in time what becomes of it :)			"

												I like this space flight combat sim provided it keeps getting improved with updates. I will agree with another review here stating that the swearing by one pilot seems gratuitous. It just seems a little overboard in it's use, repeatedly using the MF word. I agree that less is more here.			"

												It's a derpy casual game. Nice Voiceacting, but that's it. Looks like a Wii game, has a rather dull story and the gameplay gets boring quickly. Nearly any other space dogfighting game will be a better pick for 15€. Alternatively, you could opt for a few beers and this game when it's on sale, as a precaution for a lonely evening.			"

												Fairly enjoyable space shooter. Would play again. Options menu is sufficient. Not available on Linux, unfortunately. It's also nothing special - no ship customization or anything like that. It's not worth the price, but it's worth it in a bundle or a cheap sale if you want some story based braindead shooting down space ships.			"

												I really want to like this game, unfortunately, controller support is terrible. I'm using an X52 Pro and am unable to bind thrust. I did research, and posted in the forum, but it's been twice now that the devs haven't answered my post. The binding menu is unintuitive due to a lack of visual ques, that is to say, there is nothing showing you that the menus are scroll enabled, and the game defaults to a joystick setting that causes your ship to just spin. I've fixed that problem, but in researching it, I found others having that same problem. Being unable to thrust makes this game unplayable, so I can't give it a good score, but please don't take this as a review of the game itself, it is still a mystery. I have respect for devs, but not being able to play is really annoying.			"

												This is a very frustrating, tiring and awesome game! The controls are not intuitive (at least for me) but once I sat through the tutorial a few times (I even took some notes) and got to play the game, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥was it fun!!!! Bad guys spawn everywhere and the fights are incredibly intense! Basically they don't really hand you much and I've played to many games lately that spoon feed me everything I need, it's a nice change of pace. I forgot what it was like to have to figure out game mechanics on my own. Very satisfying! They could've had a more original story, but it's a story we all know and love so it could be worse. (Battlestar Galactica, even the names and banter are similar) If you have the patience and enjoy these sorts of games, check it out!Edit: I just have to say that my husband was having some game issues (turned out to be steam issues) and so I went to The Battle of Sol fb page. One of the developers (Chris you are awesome!!) gave me his number and helped my husband fix his game! I've never experienced such awesome customer support. Thanks again guys!			"

												Good try, but the joystick mapping is just horrible. If you feel like wasting 2hours trying to figure out which one of the numerous axis is the one you want, then this game is for you.After a long time, Rudders are still not supported. Mapping your thrusters to the sliders on a HOTAS is still a nightmare (you have to figure out which axis is used, and for hotas, bind the reverse speed to the 2nd axis in reverse..????).Once all is finally mapped, you'll see the controls are not natural at all. It's like using a Gamepad stick emulator for the flight, it feels very poor when flying :(			"

												Mouse acceleration is a crime and the auto aim is strong in this onegraphics look pretty bad even at the highest possible settingsfeels like a port, probably is a port, a poorly made one at that. Didn't like the story, rather cliche and the fact it jumped between the two sides just made it more annoying. Stick with one or the other please. OR at least confine it to two seperate campaigns.

												Full controller support ? No, just no. Controls are terrible with a 360 gamepad and stop working at random times ( my gamepad works fine on other games, it's not broken or anything ), especially if you try to modify the default settings. Keyboard+mouse is not better.Unplayable.And if you DO get the controls to work, then the game is riddled with awful design choices and a frigging annoying energy management forcing you to constantly put the energy to the weapons, then the thrusters, then you'll deplete both bars to repair your hull because the enemies will kill you easily even on EASY, but then you can't shoot or boost so you have to put the energy into the weapons again, which overheats the thrusters, so you put energy into the thrusters and that depeltes the weapons bar which overheats too, meanwhile the enemy shoots at you, takes down your hull so you have to repair it... over, and over, and over and OVER !And do I have to mention that you can't know if your target is in your LOS or not when you target it ? You have to destroy turrets on a ship ? Well, you can target them THROUGH the ship but you don't see really well if you can hit them or not before you're close enough to be taken down. Everything is black and gray anyway.Also you can't change the roll speed, which is waaaaay to high on a keyboard.And the slide mechanic... omg why didn't they just assign buttons to left and right strafe instead of toggling it with right click...And that's not even half the problems of this game. Not gonna waste my time listing everything.Just avoid it.			"
