Early Access Review
								RaidersSphere4th is an Ace Combat ripoff. It is a good one though. Pretty much the gameplay is the exact same as Ace Combat 1-4 with the visuals reminding me a lot of Ace Combat 3 Electrosphere. Many of the planes are made up, but a few seem to be references to actual planes or Ace Combat super planes.There is some nice mission variety going on with some missions being basic, ""kill all the bad guys missions"" while others get more interesting such as destroying groud targets with ecm coverage. The ecm only last for a little bit and jams all targeting system so you can only use your guns but the enemy can also only use theirs. Upon destroying all the targets in an area yo have to climb back up to 10,000 feet to avoid being detected when the ecm wears off and then repeat this process at different target sites. There are other missions that have variety like this but this one seemed to be the most distinct out of the ones I have played.Besides the gameplay the graphics are not great. They seem like early ps2 generation graphics with the actual aircraft models being the best graphically.As far as early access goes, it's in early access to sort out mulitplayer and to posssibly add some steam workshop support. I feel there are some typos in translation that could be fixed as well, and sometimes the mission complete screens get some weird formating bugs.If you want some classic Ace Combat gameplay and don't really care about the graphics then this game delivers. However, if you really care about graphics or you want multiplayer I would wait until after the game leaves early access to pick the game up. Sekai projects games seem to actually make it through early access unlike some others so I would say that it should not be long until the game is out of early access.			"

								What I think about this game : It's an arcade combat flight sim that takes place on Planet Venus. The combat fight mechanics has the same (or at least similar) style as those of classic Ace Combat series.The AIs are quite good in this game. Like other good combat flight sims, we can't always rely on missiles alone as they can be so agile in maneuvering. So, this what makes dogfighting really fun in this game. Same goes for the friendly AIs. They are also competent in assisting the players when dealing with the enemies.As for the jets, it has a fair amounts of playable jets to choose from ( I haven't finished the game yet, so I don't know how many are in the game yet).   The graphics, while seemingly outdated if compared to many other modern combat flight sim games , still looks OK. Of course, it's better ito enable ""shader settings"" at the launcher screen. Since I'm playing this on laptop GPU, enabling it a default quality level makes the game stutters. So, I set it to low level with shader settings enabled and it still gets decent quality. I personally think that the graphic style of this game is like a mix between Ace Combat 3, Rebel Raiders : Operation Nighthawk (but better than that), and Airforce Delta series.  The storyline is quite decent. It also has a nice set of main characters.The SFXs are quite good, and so are the BGMs, especially if you're into electronic styled music with added symphonic elements.The voice-actings are done very well in this game and done good in providing the dramatic sense to the storyline.Well, since this is currently in Early Access, expect several bugs / glitches in the game. But I'm sure it's gonna be fixed sooner or later. Other than that, I strongly recommend this game, especially to those who loves arcade combat flight action games such as  Ace Combat and Airfoce Delta series.			"

												Disclaimer: I've played AC5, AC0 (100%) and AC:AH. Loved the first two, couldn't be bothered to finish the last one.I've really enjoyed what's on offer here. It's the closest I got to actually playing an Ace Combat game on PC (I tried AH, bleh). The devs certainly have a knack for making these kinds of games, since the mission variety is huge and there are a lot of missions. The story is pretty interesting, too.My only gripe is that I wish the game had a bigger budget, since I believe the team could do wonders in this genre. Unlike the current Project Aces who seem to enjoy making multiplayer events on an outdated console. AC Infinity PC please :(.I'm definitely looking forward to what the team cooks up in the future.Note: this game is harder than AC0, since shooting missiles nilly-willy won't get you far. Dogfighting does require some effort which can be immensely satisfying, but you really need to think about your attack vector.			"

												Pro-  great story with lots of minor plot twists no hands held gameplay great soundtrack (not available on steam to play seperatly. no soundtest mode; hunt down ost on the web) early 6th gen style graphics (looks more high end on higher shader settings) diverse objective oriented missions (rarely does it ever amount to ""kill everything"") final mission is epic (dont want to spoil it. kill big my friends.) 3D vision, 3D-Dive (whatever that is), Oculus DK1&2 support.con-  control config was forged in hell (patched) emphasis on the control config (good luck setting that rudder) (emphasis on patched) no countermeasures; dodge missiles manually (may be a good thing) water requires at least ""High"" shader settings to look good; which is poorly optimized shaders are poorly optimized Too much fun. You shall not escape.Despite it's flaws if you go in expecting a nostalgic flight combat game with a plot, take the time to configure your controller or joystick and, learn to dodge (unless you allready played ace combat or vector thrust (I haven't FYI) in which case I bet you will be fine) it's missions will give your money's worth.

												Its the Ace Combat we all dreamed of but never got after AC6However it does make some changes which I feel give it a nice edge over Ace Combat. Such as freeform weapon selection based on pylons and actually useful allied AI.Some weapons do have issues though and can also give you quite a headache to use. AI is also aggressive and smart enough from normal difficulty onwards such that missiles usage are practically impossible unless head on or at close range. Not to mention that their missiles seem to be enhanced on hard mode. I'd say even Ace Combat vets would have to take the normal difficulty at maximum straight off the bat. (I'd like to think I'm okay considering I S-ranked most of ACX Ace difficulty and is in the midst of an Ace run in AC6)All in all, I highly recommend this for any Ace Combat fan and a cautious recommendation for those just checking in.

												Were you let down by Ace Combat: Assault Horizon?Then I recommend trying this game out. It has pretty much the same gameplay as the classic Ace Combat games, and the influence is clearly there. Particularly related to Ace Combat 3, given the futuristic setting. That said, unlike the European release of Ace Combat 3, Raiders has a clear plot that advances with every mission. The dialogue sequences are well meshed with both the plot and the gameplay, making each mission advance seamlessly to the next one. The gameplay is as solid as you could expect, although playing on normal mode I could not help but notice that missiles in dogfights were mostly useless, everything coming down to cannons. Not something negative, though. It really makes you employ all the weapons in your arsenal.Now, negative aspects?Well, first of all, the graphics are severely outdated. You may think Ace Combat 3 on PSX looked better than this. Nothing looks particularly impressive, and the planes have a ""Homer Simpson Design Bureau"" look to them. If you came here expecting to see something cool, you are going to be disappointed. Second, the controls require a little fiddling about with if you really want something like Ace Combat. When I first played this game, the buttons configuration was switched around a bit and I had no rudder control. So, to summarize:Did you enjoy Ace Combat 3? Do you want more of that same gameplay? Do you want a simple plot with simple characters that works anyway? Do you want lots of missions? Then get this game, you of excellent taste.Would Playstation One graphics make you puke? Do you need your sci-fi to be hard and your planes to look like they were made of fiber glass and rolled between a Cuban girl´s thighs? Get Ace Combat: Assault Horizon, you FILTHY CASUAL.			"

Early Access Review
								I have not yet finished the game but I can offer my input on its current state as of May31 2015.  The gameplay resembles that of an older Ace Combat title though a little less refined.  However I must state in a positive note that the aircraft have more realism in their physics regarding banking & stalling.  On the down side the aircraft models are very simplistic (less refined) and the though the pilot is visible in the cockpit it looks like a puffy astronaut.  Really though you wont be looking at that while shooting down enemies will you?  I found the gameplay to be enjoyable though it felt a little unfinished at first with the interface trims/refinement & new control support it's improving.  The story I haven't yet finished as I stated, but it's not bad so far in its anime visual novel style. Previously in this review I'd made mention of control support issues, these have as far as I can tell been resolved, I'm able to keybind my Logitech Xtreme 3d Pro & Logitech F310 how I want and even have them both plugged in at the same time.  Previously the F310 only worked in D-input mode but it now works fine in X-input mode (x-box).  Be aware if you alternate between these two control methods you may want to leave the sensitivity setting at none or you'll have to switch it between the two.			"

								Pretty good arcade inspired by classic Ace Combat games.I'm not into the anime stuff, but the gameplay is solid. though the flyght model is a bit more forgiving than Vector Thrust and Ace Combat, overall is it's fun to play. There is a good diversity in missions so far, some of them pretty creative and interesting. Overall, I enjoy the gameplay of it.I also like some aspects of the setting. It's set on Venus at some point in the future, which reminds me Cowboy Bebop a bit. The visuals and sound feels surprisingly nostalgic, like the early 3d era of japanese videogames on PSOne and Dreamcast. Personally, I like graphics the way they are and the music greatly enhance overall appeal. But someone else could find those aspects rather unattractive. Overall, if you enjoy Ace Combat or something like Vector Thrust and you don't find the setting and visuals unattractive you should definitely try it out.			"

												Let's get the obvious cons out of the way first. The ground textures look like muddled♥♥♥♥♥♥and in some missions you won't be able to tell the difference between the ground and the clouds(thankfully your instruments are still visible in 3rd person so you'll know if you're losing altitude). The rest of the game looks like an emulated PS2 game as it does run in whatever resolution your monitor supports without upscaling.The only things that look good are water and smoke. Destroyed enemies will catch fire which lingers for the rest of the missions so by the time it's over you'll see fire and black smoke everywhere as you look around.Another potential problem is that the game doesn't have English audio making it somewhat hard to read the subtitles with 30 missiles locked onto you while dodging AAA fire from the ground and trying to hit an enemy in front of you. Thankfully you can watch a replay after completing a mission so you can read the story after completing a mission and not miss much.The sound is decent. Explosions make a big boom, guns go daka-daka, the missile lockon sound is quiet enough not to be annoying but still noticable, and Raiders will emit a pleasing turbo-whine like noise as they zip around. It makes them sound more futuristic and elegant. The music is surprisingly good too, you might want to search for the OST online.At first the gameplay seems inspired by Ace Combat but  air to air is a very different beast. The AI is very good at dodging missiles which will lead to most A2A engagmenets becoming big furballs. The dogfighting feels very WW2esque with a focus on turn-n-burn. You'll be zig-zagging while decellerating to make the enemy overshoot, stalling mid-loop to drop behind them, or using wide barrel rolls to cover less distance while maintaining your airspeed. You'll be equipped with an Ace Combat number of missiles, even smaller craft will pack 50 per slot but you'll mostly use them to force the AI to dodge so you can close the gap and shred them with your cannons. If you just want to mow down AI fighters simply by getting behind them and launching a pair of missiles then this probably isn't for you.A2G combat is much more like AC, lock on with missiles and fire away. You'll almost never run out of missiles so you don't have to worry about that. There are plenty of fantasy planes(or Raiders) and you can customise the loadout to your liking. The raiders feel different as you move through the generations. The earlier ones feel like more stable planes while the later ones get a more spaceship-y feel with quick yawing and very low stall speeds. While they're rated in A2A and A2G those stats are as useless as they are in Ace Combat. A plane with the worst A2G rating will do the same damage as the plane with the best A2G rating if you equip them with the same missiles or bombs, the higher rated plane will simply get more ammo. It's best to try them out in Free mission and see how you like them instead of relying on the stat bars.The custom loadouts also mean that if you particularly like how one of the Raiders flies(or looks) you can use it for any kind of mission. The tougher planes will have an easier time strafing ground targets but you can simply avoid it in a more fragile speedster.The missions are nicely varied though most of them will require blowing a lot of stuff up. The standouts are probably the night-raid where you have to drop below the clouds and quickly blow stuff up timed with a friendly jammer then get back  up before the jamming expires and the very vertical mission where you climb halfway to orbit with a rocket booster to attack targets from below then dropping down to line up another run. There's even a BoE-type mission with lots of flying ships(which you need to blow up) engaging a big friendly fleet, a 3rd faction shooting at everyone and tons of fighters engaged in a huge furball.The story is fine for this type of game. It's presented in mission dialogue and in VN-style seqments between the missions. The briefings are reasonably detailed and will give you a fair grasp on what you might be facing, barring any mid-mission surprises. The game could've used a few more character poses but the ones that are there look good enough. The main characters are the pilot you're flying as, your friendly voice with an internet connection for mid-mission updates and your uncle mechanic who maintains your plane and spouts exposition regarding the past. While not deep or original they're all likable and don't suffer from mid-story emo syndrome like a lot of these animesque characters seem to.While 20€ might seem a bit much for a game that looks this outdated and cheap(probably a result of different game prices for indies in Japan) it will provide plenty of fun for anyone who likes old school dogfighting. If it happens to be on sale you should probably pick it up.			"

												If this was a PS1 Ace Combat title, it would do the series proud. The combat in this game is exceptional and just feels like Ace Combat. However this is also a much harder game compared to the other Ace Combat game, I only played on normal, but I highly underestimate how strong the AI will be.The AI will ever oppurtunity to shoot a missle at you, that means you have to make a sharp turn or if your chasing a target fire off a missle and make a sharper turn when that missle gets in the right range. Also did I mention using the missle is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ This game requires much more substantial effort and intelligence to utilize weapons. You can only really use missle at the right angle and at the right distance, or when the enemy tries to matador you in which case you better have some nice moves because their shooting missles too. I found myself utilizing the gun more often which to say can be really satsifying to pull off a kill that way. Addtionally you might find some gripes with the mission variety, and although it holds true to Ace Combat, there are many missions that require you to fly through enclosed areas and simply manevuer. These levels really overstay their welcome and there is one level which you have to navigate through small tunnels in like a storm, and it would be all nice and dandy, if you couldnt't tell what was a tunnel because everything was ♥♥♥♥ing gray.The story is nice and it does a decent job at wolrd building, but if you're a stickler for details, such explaining how some person found abotut this thing, you will probably be irate. The story is fully japanese voice acted and fallows a vsual novel style presentation and thats all find, but I wish they would utlizes pictures to help explain what is going one because looking at a long series of text get boring after a while. I suspect the stroy issue is mainly due to budget constrants especially considering they decided to hire voice actors. Overall, if you don't analyze it raider sphere gives off a impression that it is a strong story.Graphics are bad, but serve its purpose, and gives a very nostalgic feel if you played these games from this era. The plane models could be better, I mean you are staring at them contantly, and it's more that they are designed wierdly and don't feel like real planes, but I guess it's my fauilt for using the Asura for like 90% of the game. The graphics are also very unoptimized, at moments I would find my crisp 60 FPS make a sharp dip to 20 FPS unexplictily, I like to think I have a very nice rig and it confuses me why this game seems taxing at times.The music is great, no complaints, very mush set the tone although can be repeative in later levels.

Not that neither are bad games though.The story segments of the game are portrayed in a Visual Novel style, more like in Airforce Delta Strike instead of animated cutscenes like in Ace Combat 5 for example.Controls are pretty straightforward and simple, someone coming from Ace Combat shouldn't be having any problems with them.Graphics look like♥♥♥♥♥and there's no way of getting over it, but you'll probably make do with them.

												A nice little arcade combat flight game, in the style of the older Ace Combat games.I like it, but there are a few notable flaws:- While the game runs well on my i7-3630QM/GT630M laptop in windowed, the game has major graphical issues when trying to run fullscreen.- The missile lock sound is a tad obnoxious, and you'll likely find yourself turning the volume of the game down pretty far because of it.- The game is grapically very dated. While it's not a glaring issue to me, some players may be turned off by the low poly models and the flat ground textures.All said, I enjoy the game and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes arcade flight games.

												I'm a huge fan of games where I get to be an elite pilot. I loved all the rogue squadrons, and I regularly go back and replay the much overlooked and under appreciated Project Sylpheed for the Xbox 360 and I keep looking for games that might have the same sort of magic. This game does not, this game is bad, and it should feel bad. The controls are ponderous and sluggish at best, I would describe controlling it with a Joypad ""like living in a waking nightmare"". Did you know there's a button that makes you look behind your aircraft? Did you know there isn't a button to make you stop doing that?Combat by the way in this game, is a chore. It seems locking on to a target has vaguely arbitrary requirements that I don't understand. You have to be at the right distance, coming in at the right angle and the wind has to be just so and the planets need to align in just the right way. Oh and don't bother trying the machine gun on your jet,  controlling your jet is so imprecise and hard to control you might as well not even bother. Chances are you're looking at the video above and you might say, but it doesn't look like thats true. That video lies.I really wanted this game to be good and it wasn't and I really wish I could get my money back. Lucky for me I bought it on sale for less than 10 bucks. Take my advice don't buy it, if somebody gives this to you stop being friends with them because they only want you to suffer.			"

												Basically this reminds me of Ace Combat 3 : Electrosphere, and this is one of Ace Combat-like game I really wanted on PC. Of course, its graphics are outdated and buggy. But does that matter? It's decent game, after all! Gameplay's awesome and it got some good plots as well.I would recommend this one to Ace Combat fans or people who like flight-shooting genre. You won't regret your single penny.			"

												Hard mode opponents are quite brutal; now that's a challenge I've been looking for. Completed all missions 1 to 30 twice on max difficulty so far at time of writing this.Your First SightFly through unearthly tall cities and ancient ruins. Many buildings you encounter will take a sizeable fraction of a minute to climb over. They're that HUGE, it gives you a feeling of a towering world different from Ace Combat's more contemporary cities; RaidersSphere4th is a flavour all its own.FlyingWorks very well with a keyboard setup, especially the feeling of the guns; landing shots are no problem.Keys are remappable. A straight W-accelerate, S-decelerate, AD-yaw, E-target (hold to focus camera on target), Space-fire, Shift-guns makes for comfortable flying and fighting with this game's tactical physics.CombatThe fun for me comes from the challenge of maneuvering to an opponent's rear (hold the target key to keep sight!), all with the threat of them doing the same.Missiles aren't button-press kill solutions; being basically rocketing archer arrows, they require good positioning on the part of the pilot to meet their mark.Practicing this game really set my mind thinking, like devising a low yo-yo in the final-tier Raider to gain speed and outrun a swarm of missiles in the last mission.MultiplayerThis game supports LAN at the very least ('connect-by-IP' style); but for that, you'll need to download a (yet untranslated at time of writing this) patch from Rectangle's official Japanese website. By using Google Translate I am able to set it up and get it working.			"

												A nice little arcade combat flight game, in the style of the older Ace Combat games.I like it, but there are a few notable flaws:- While the game runs well on my i7-3630QM/GT630M laptop in windowed, the game has major graphical issues when trying to run fullscreen.- The missile lock sound is a tad obnoxious, and you'll likely find yourself turning the volume of the game down pretty far because of it.- The game is grapically very dated. While it's not a glaring issue to me, some players may be turned off by the low poly models and the flat ground textures.All said, I enjoy the game and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes arcade flight games.
