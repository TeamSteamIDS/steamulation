												Very complex game but I like this game. I am British so I don't have any real feeling of immersion playing the American Civil War but like any strategy game its the act of fighting a strategic war, with historical troops, and finding out about things you didnt know about that makes this game really interesting. The Civil War is an interesting period of history as well in that both sides had it tough, the war was a long brutal one, with much movement and innovation. So its an interesting conflict to play.The mechanics in this game are spot on. For example you dont move alone you move at the same time as the enemy does, so you have to predict where they are going to be and often you can get surprised. So thats very realistic. Far more realistic than attacking a paused enemy. Also you have very detailed heirarchy of troops including armies and corps, a lot like Paradox's Hearts of Iron 3 in fact. You get bonuses to things like supply and attack coordination for being well supported and organised which is good.You can use gunboats to support your attacks, You can syncronise your attacks, You can even have neighbouring friendly armies 'march to the sound of guns' and automatically move to support you in a battle. Pretty much everything you feel should be in the game is actually in the game, and this game is far more polished than the first game. The only downsides are that the game might not be all that stable - many crashes have been reported and I had a critical error crash in the first tutorial, five minutes into the game on my first turn's generation, but none in the actual game since. Also the GUI is rather bland looking compared to the lovely period one in the first game but its far easier to see whats going on and there are mods to add cosmetic improvements to it.Overall I would say this is probably the most complex strategic game I have ever played. The complexity does put you off playing it unless you have a bit of time and brain power to spare, but for those who love very deep strategy games this is about as deep as they get.			"

												The bad reviews almost stopped me from getting this...This is why I am writting this review. I ended up getting the game and was very very happy with it. It has a tremendous amount of depth, features and choice options on how to manage your side of the conflict. I really enjoy the strategic and regional level choices, while coordinating supply and unit command formations. I hate bugs and I hate crashes, when i read that in the reviews it was very dissapointing and I almost didn't purchase the game. If you are experience crashes, there are several suggestions in the forum as to fixes. For me personally I used the userpath.ini delete fix and thought that worked very well cutting down on crashes. Also something to note, you can get the game to auto save between 3-12 turns...so crashes or tech issues shouldn't stop anyone from playing as you can easily recover, and sometimes just reprocess the turn.Immersion, This game via its strategic and regional level options combimed with supply, unit production and army configurations is defintely a deep, rich and immersive experience. The map is huge, has many fiters and the wego system is by far the best system to be used on this kind of game. I want to really reiterate that, some games I don't think its great for and this is the first game I've truly been able to say, is better off for having the wego system as it provides the best gaming experience for this war/era. This is not for the light hearted gamer nor the total war style of gamer. This is actually more realistic because in a grand strategy sense you are not some godlike presence that can order every individual unit on the battlefield. You do choose who commands your bde, division, corps or armies, you do get to build up these types of units and combine them to make your composition of forces, and if you pay attention to the ground your fighting on, supply, unit cohesion and all the other factors the game takes into account, you will do well. However, if you take 20k men into a seige, tell them to assault the walls with no arty support, guess what, ur men are gonna get slaughtered. I personally spend 1-2 hours per turn, the game does 2 week time frames, early in the month for the first two weeks and late in the month. This works great because the game using the wego system processes each turn into 15 days. So coordination of forces matter a lot and in reality u have every single day of the war being played. I had never been a fan of the ageod battle system, I personally dont think its right for the american rev period, nor do i think its right the for world war one era, for the civil war and the napoleonic era though its really is the most realistic and superior system for those time periods. I encourage you if you are a grand strategy fan, to try it and give yourself a few days of playing to get used to it. I believe like myself you will see the benefit and the beauty of the system in this time period for this title. You will absoutely get your monies worth if you put in the time to learn the features and options. The Grand strategy genre is my absolutely favorite and those are the games I really excell at because of all the different things you have to manage. I know this isn't billed as grand strategy because you can only play two sides, but the amount of choice, different options and features in the game make it a grand strategy title to me. Indeed, I wish they came out with a game like this that allowed u to be any country in the world like a lot of the paradox titles allow you to do. All in all i highly recommend this game if you love history, the civil war, and grand strategy games.  "

												Initially I was disappointed, as the game crashed a few times at end of turn processing on turns two and three; then the crashes ceased and I found myself drawn into the game.This is one of the best and deepest strategy games I've ever played. I'm spending hours and hours discovering some of the depth of this game and I'm only at February 1862, playing as the Confederates.The learning curve might be a little steep for casual gamers; e.g. getting a grasp of regiments, brigades, divisions, corps and armies and how to create and manipulate the fundamental military organizations.The map, music and attention to detail in the unit graphics and historical events are beautiful.The random event and tactical cards that can be played on various map locations are a very nice feature.Sad to see this game doesn't have a bigger following.Civil War 2 is a gem, imo.I			"

												This is an excellent grand strategy and Civil War game. It is for people who enjoy taking the time to plan their actions, to include both short and long term goals. Playing as the CSA in the gam'es largest campaign is quite difficult and you will develop an appreciation for the strategic and logistical problems the South faced during the War of Northern Aggression. The AI is quite good at exploiting your weaknesses and, playing as the CSA, I have often fallen afoul of Federal raids into the relatively undefended regions of Louisiana and it's important industrial center of New Orleans. The AI has also done a good job of reacting to my offenses and will quickly trade a weakened force for a stronger one. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Do you often wonder if Lee was over-rated because of the actual outcomes of battles. Do you think that Jefferson davis did well with the resources available to him. Do you get angry when you read about the battle of Cold Harbor? Does the name John bell Hood cause you to let out a deep sigh. Do you often question the effectiveness of Shermans  march to the see based on Georgia's rail line capacity to recover from the damage done.  If you ask yourself these questions please buy this game, you will enjoy it. This game was designed with the Civil ware enthusist in mind and really provides the ""Commander"" with a good overview of the grand Campaign. Currently I am using Ky's neutrality to my Advantage and marching my entire northen army down the southern east coast. I'm bleeding them and using my capacity to rest and resuply one army while keeping their main force engaged. I'm already at the gates of Richmond in 1861, and will soon out flank the city and cut it off. All this while slowly building up a an Army in southern Ill to march down the Mississipi to secure NO and Vicksburg.  These are the kind of things I imagine you would like to try as a CIVIL WAR buff and honestly it is great.			"

ENG:Ah, had to write short review of AGEod's Civil War II, but always forgot to do this :)Civil War II is a hard to start if you're not familiar with American Civil War, but that's a good side of every AGEod game, if it's hard to start and don't know exactly game's subject history - you start to dig for it, visiting subject's theme web pages, reading history books and etc.Then, when you understand how this Civil War was fought, you start to goin' deeper and deeper in the game and thanks to AGEod development team you always feel the spirit of their game, this time it's American Civil War.Before To End All Wars(latest AGEod game) Civil War II was their grandest historical wargame - from my point of view.Every time AGEod creates their new title, they always add game's subject flavor - Events, map design, battle system, communication systems, army hierarchy and what's most important - transport system, this time we're not using only roads, we have railroads and river transport which gives player a lot of space to maneuver leading his troops to victory.Small scenarios(Battles)  and probably the most detailed tutorial could be a good start for newcomers, but Civil War II still is challenging to play, especially if you're trying to win in 2 Theater Grand Campaign as Confederacy.If you're intersted in American Civil War or you think that it could be interesting for you, Civil War II is a good start, but keep in mind, that every AGEod game ask players for patience(while learning game mechanics and while waiting for AI turn :D).RUS:Всегда забывал написать небольшое ревью на Civil War II :)В Civil War II довольно тяжело начать играть если вы не знакомы с Гражданской Войнов в США, но это хорошая сторона каждого варгейма от AGEod, если трудно начать и не имеешь детального представления о сабже, то начинаешь посещять тематические сайты, ищешь книги по данным событиям и т.д.Затем, когда вы понимаете, как велась эта гражданская война, вы проникаться игрой, и благодаря команде разработчиков AGEod вы всегда будете чувствовать дух периода, которому посвящена игра, на этот раз это Гражданская война в США.Прежде чем To End All Wars (последнее AGEod игра) вышла, Civil War II была прорывов в варгеймах от AGEod - во всяком случае с моей точки зрения.Каждый раз, когда AGEod создает свой новый варгейм, они всегда добавляют игре дух того времени - эвенты, дизайн карты, боевая система, системы связи, ОШС и, что самое главное(в данном случае) - транспортная система, на этот раз мы перемещаем свои армии по дорогам, у нас есть железные дороги и речной транспорт, который дает игроку достаточно много места для маневра своих войск.Маленькие сценарии(Битвы) и, вероятно, наиболее подробное руководство может быть хорошим стартом для новичков, но Civil War II от этого не перестаёт быть сложной игрой, особенно если вы пытаетесь выиграть в Гранд кампании ведя войну на два фронта за Конфедерацию.Если вы интересуетесь Гражданской Войной в США или вы думаете, что этот период и/или эти события могут быть интересно для вас, Civil War II - хорошее начало, но имейте в виду, что каждая игра AGEod требудет от игроков терпение (во время обучения игровой механики и во время ходов AI :D).

Posted: February 26, 2015
												In short:I do not recommend this game, giving it 1 star out of 6.The game runs slow and the extreemely poor UI, bizarre AI behavior, illogical combat and supply rules inhibit gameplay behind repair. The game requires you to micromanage a lot of units, even simple actions require hundreds of clicks and repeating the same tedious minutiae over and over again.1. The game is poorly optimized and resolving a turn takes way too long. 2. The UI is very user-unfriendly and the game is absolutely horrible at providing you the information  you need to understand what is going on. This is a huge issue with a game of such large scale.3. The map gets cluttered with unit stacks and sorting these out is a tedious and unnecessarily long process.4. The game's command chain and army organisation rules are interesting, but are poorly implemented which inhibits gameplay.5. The AI makes poor, illogical choices - Confederate AI in late 1861  for example moved the vast majority of troops from Richmond in order to mount a pointless offensive at Cleveland Ohio. As a result I took Richmond in December 1861 far too easily.6. Only supports Play By Email multiplayer. We did it back in the 1990s, time to move on AGEOD.The end result is that the game is tedious, slow and user-unfriendly at its very worst. I'm thoroughly disappointed by it., especially after reading the positive reviews. Sadly the reviewers failed to report on the game's numerous shortcomings.Long, detailed version:GAMEPLAY,AI, RULES, REALISM:The AI is in general not very good and will pursue both historically implausible offensives as well as moves that are plain dumb. In my game as the Union, the confederate AI moved most of its army from the Shenandoah and Richmond to launch a strike at Cleveland Ohio. This allowed me to take a mostly undefended Richmond in December 1861, while the AI was gallivanting at lake Erie.Supply rules are very poor and create absurd situations - that Confederate army in Cleveland was cut off from the south entirely, but stayed in supply as Cleveland was a city with a harbor and thus generated a lot of supply. The game did not ""notice"" that said harbor was at a lake controlled by the Union.Political and economic decisions are good, like in most AGEOD games. However, again like in most AGEOD games, these take a back seat to actual military action and that's where the game does not perform well at all.Combat results are poorly explained and I found myself scratching my head many times. For example, a 5000 men division of mine collided during movement with a 11 000 enemy force. Both were in clear terrain, 100% supplied, I was the attacker and my general was a very poor one, my units mostly volunteer militias and I did not have enough Command points for this stack either. For some absurd reason I basically overran the enemy unit, dealing 5000+ casualties at the cost of 700 men. I checked all the after-battle reports and found no indication why this was so. The report even stated that some of my men deserted at the face of the enemy! (no such status for the opposing side) So why did I won?! This is just one example, I seen such outcomes numerous times.The tactical options once a battle takes place are very simplified, you do not get to command any units on a tactical map or nothing of that sort. Instead you pick from a series of strategy cards, which function much in a scissors-paper-rock fashion. Very disappointing.OPTIMIZATION:The game is poorly optimized, Even with the ""Give AI more time"" options turned off resolving turns takes a lot of time. On average (counted for December 1861 and March 1862) each WEGO turn takes 3.5 minutes to resolve and that is just the units moving, I'm not counting the time consumed at simulating battles. The main campaign has 114 turns, which gives you 6.6 hours of just waiting for the computer to resolve the moves.UI:The UI in most AGEOD games is bad, but here the sheer amount of units greatly increases the problems one has with this. The eastern theatre between Washington and Richmond becomes quickly cluttered with numerous stacks that with their graphics cover beneath them objectives and terrain. This made sorting out my Army of the Potomac a huge pain and took a lot of time each turn. It is absolutely necessary in the game to combine brigades into divisions, these into a corps and these into armies. The game does a poor job at depicting which corps stack belongs to which army - to check you have to click on it every time and even then all it does is to flash the army command stack - which might in some cases be a screen or more away. To remove a single brigade from a division, you need to manually disband the whole division and then re-form it. You will need to do this all the time, in order to send damaged brigades to the rear to let them rest and refit.On  a map of this size, with so many small units being built in various locations it becomes vital to quickly locate the unmoved newly deployed units. Yet the game does not have a ""go to next unmoved unit"" button. So each time you need to open the ledger with some 80+ unit stacks listed and search for that 3 unmoved militia brigades that you want to ship out by rail. Which can be a big pain, as you need to distinguish them from 16 other militia units you placed in various regions to act as immobile garrisons - the ledger will not filter these out for you.The ledger was so unwieldy and user-unfriendly, that I actually resorted to al-tabbing and creating an excel spreadsheet to keep tabs on various units.Renaming stacks could help with this mess, but sadly there's a bug which did not allow me to delete the old name and replace it with a new one. Very frustrating.In short, the horrible UI combined with the huge scale of the game made it near unplayable - it was a tedious, long and annoying process just to understand what is going on the map.GRAPHICS:While graphics in strategy games are not that important, I would like to observe two things1) Unit and leader graphics were clear, crisp and pleasant to look at. Definitely one of the stronger sides of the game.2) The map on teh other hand felt bland, the colors were unrealistic and annoying. My eyes became tired after a few hours looking at the map, which is a bad sign - does not occur in most strategy games. This is a real downgrade from AGEOD's first civil war game, where the map was in soft, natural colors and much easier to look at.SOUND:-Sounds felt generic, not bad nor very good. - Music was ok as it was period instrumental tracks. Sadly most were very short and after s few hours became very repetitive.MULTIPLAYER:Only supports Play By Email multiplayer. We did it back in the 1990s, time to move on AGEOD.			"

												Civil War II has the makings of bing one of the best strategy game available -- especially on the Civil War, definitely an underserved topic.  It's extremely complex, but that translates into a realistic feeling:  war is complex.Unfortunately, AGEOD has dropped the ball in 2 major areas:First, the bugs.  Almost all players have commented on them, so it's the game, not individual computers.  In a campaign, the game crashes about every 3rd turn.  Fortunately, reloading the game with a previous save allows the war to go on.  Except I reached March 1863 and encountered a hard crash that's unrecoverable, recurs after reboots & reloads.That's hundreds of hours down the tubes.  (I'm running an i7-3770 w/ 64 GB RAM & 4GB VRAM, Windows 10).  The game's been out almost a year -- 6 months since the last patch.  Obviously AGEOD has taken what money suckers gave them and gone on to other projects.The 2nd problem is balance.  In my games, whenever the USS Monitor meets the CSS Virginia, the Confederate ironclad is obliterated in a single battle, leaving the Monitor unscratched -- and able to navigate the Atlantic in winter to reach the Florida keys without refueling.It's impossible for the South to capture Washington.  There are over 1000 points locked into the city, ready to be released any time a Southern unit steps foot in Montgomery County (even if the unit is retreating from a minor skirmish in Frederick MD).  Not only that, a union army of about 500 points suddenly appears in Fairfax VA out of nowhere.Don't capture and then exit a union town.  A unit suddenly appears out of nowhere and retakes the town.  Though only 17-points strong, it can withstand seige by a 200-point division for more than 5 turns.Sigh.  CW II would be such an interesting game, if only AGEOD could invest just a little more time to fix the remaining problems.			"

												If you are a Paradox fan like me, this game will please you. The detailed representation of the Civil War that is packed into this game is shock and awe from everything to dipictions of officers to the variety of units. Now, I have been eyeing this game for some time now and picked it up on sale with the dlc for 25 bucks and I can't stop playing it. Not sure what the negative reviews are about with stability, I have had no issues at all and I have a good, not great rig running it. If you love historical simulation like me, get this game. There is no other like it for the USCW. Only con I find for this game and it is nothing major is scrolling with the map. It is nowhere as smooth as a Paradox game. At the same time the map is extremely detailed, more detailed than any other simulator I have played. I fully endorse this game and plead to anyone who loves the Civil War and Historical Simulation to buy and play this game.			"

												I bought this game because I've been fascinated by the Civil War for years and I'm always looking for a game  that depicts the war realistically. Most fall short but maybe this game succeeds too much. Its got everything, including a very long manual you will need to read and understand if you want to learn how to set up armies and how to train them, feed them, and lead them to victory. If you don't understand the logistics, it's going to be a frustrating, losing endeavor. You won't find a lot of help on the internet either.  On the plus side, it does have EVERYTHING: surveilance balloons, train transport, gatling guns, monitors and blockade ships, cavalry, artillery, spies, possible foreign intervention and much, much more. I've had this game for months and I still haven't mastered it, but I'm working on it.			"

												I tried AGEOD's first Civil War title and did not like it. So it was with skepticism that I bought CW2. Im glad i did, CW2 hooked me and then some. If you are looking for a Total War type experience with tactical battles, then this game is not for you. If you like classic Grand Strategy wargames, then this should be right up your alley. To me, the test of a good strategy game is one that has you wanting to finish that one more turn before going to bed and one that keeps you thinking about the game after you left the computer. This game will do that.Be forewarned...you must spend the time reading the manual, doing the tutorials and watching some ""lets play"" vids on youtube to learn how to play this game...the interface is a bit clunky at first, but not bad once you get used to it. The game unit cards and map are well done. This game reeks of civil war flavor...I have had only 2 CTD crashes in the many hours that I have played...both of these were at the start of new turn processing and were easily recoverable without any issues in proceeding with the next turn.Lots of strategic choices that allow for special actions, unit building, etc..CW2 rates a thumbs up in my book!

												If you have played any other AGEOD games and you have an interest in this period, this game is a must have. If you're an American Civil War buff, this game is a must have. If you want to learn about the American Civil War or the War of Northern Agression, this is a must have. I guess what I'm getting at is that you should seriously consider this title.Pros: extremely detailed (army leaders, units, army organisation, you name it), appealing graphics, advanced AI, historical events (e.g. suspend habeas corpus) and extremely detailedCons: extremely detailed - a history book and online video tutorials will help you here :), the manual (version 1.04) is missing information on national decisions (very small con, because you can just refer to the tooltips instead), and some stability issues (experienced a couple of crashes) - however there's dedicated support by email and forums (not on steam, on developer's website) full of people who can guide you through any issuesBuyer beware - you may become extremely addicted. Seek professional help if you connect a caffeine drip and play non-stop for 7 days. :)			"

												What makes a giant, stat-filled, historically accurate, 100 page manual, 2-d map, 2-d units, huge map of the United States, Mexico, Canada, and part of the Caribbean, fun? What makes a wargame fun is both its historical accuracy and momentous time-sink it takes to fully grasp the mechanics, gameplay, and aim of the game. The journey in learning all of it is really the best part. Sitting there and analyzing the unit pictures, stats, and reading events that happened during the time period accompanied by music from the period is what makes this game fun. If you ever learned about the American Civil War but text-books with fancy pictures and paragraphs-on-paragraphs of text didn't strike your fancy, maybe a game designed to both teach you and actively have fun in such affair, will. Civil War II will allow you to play the Union or Confederate side, which ever side strikes your fancy. Futhermore, you'll be able to mobilize these two faction's infrastructure both economically and militarily to achieve either the historic or alternate-historic victory of either side. The goal of the game is to defeat the enemies' army and naval units and capture vital objectures (towns, cities, regions, etc.) until you meet the victory conditions specified by the scenario. Most scenarios have ""sudden death"", which means if you capture all the objectures early and manage to lower the enemies' national level to a certain level, you can win the scenario before the turn limit is up. But don't let turn limits scare you away, the term limits on the grand campaign and medium sized scenarios are momentous, some ranging a whooping 80+ turns to 15+ if they are battle scenarios. In Civil War II, if you don't want to go through all motions of organizing the army and navy during the grand campaign, there are battle scenarios available as well. These scenarios usually begin with the army and navy already properly organized, and all the player has to do is manage the strategic manuvering of the army well, setting important combat stances and rules of engagement to achieve victory against the enemy. The AI in this game is swift, and strikes with an iron fist. The AI in Civil War II will not show you mercy, therefore, for new comers to such a wargame should note that the losing battles and getting your butt kicked by the AI is completely normal in the learning process of Civil War II. To sum up this review, Civil War II is a fantastic game, and is also one of Ageod's newer titles with a streamlined interface and as always, a great job in re-enacting the subject conflict with historical accuracy and attention to detail such as an accurate representation of combat, moral, etc. Both food and ammunition is accounted for, and contruct armies through corps, divisions, regiments, and brigade units, all the while building factories and armories across the nation the fuel the war engine to achieve victory. There are plenty of historical events and decisions to read and choose from, and there is a lot of content to wrap your head around to immerse yourself in the game and conflict.			"

Though, I can not spend 45 minutes on a turn when the game has a 50/50 chance of crashing. I have re-tried the game after each update for the last year hoping that they fixed the crashing issue. It's sad, because I could see myself playing this game like a religion. There comes a point in which you just have to give up, which is a shame.

												A great game for those who enjoy turn based  strategy. Unlike the vast majority of Civil War games, playing the Union actually provides a challeneg due to the excellent command system.  An immersive game, in which the player can experience the frustration of Lincoln and Jefferson.  As the Confederacy, the Unions ability to land troops well behind the ""front"" lines means leaving troops in vital areas such as New Orleans, when they are desperately needed in the north.			"

												First Impression:I can't suggest anybody but a retired gamer play this.  Only they would have the time to play such a complex game.  Not that I don't like complex.  I love Dwarf Fortress and Hearts of Iron III.  But in this game they somehow mixed complex with abstract information.  For example, a battle result screen covers the whole computer screen but I can't find where it says who won.  And also, it measures a unit's strength by giving it a 'power' number.  Hmm..how about just telling me how many soldiers or horsemen or artillerty it has?  It makes judging how much force you have in a certain stack kind of hard.  Is 230 a good number?  What about 890?  And this, of course, is not a solid number - as weather, terrian, and other factors can change it during the battle.Once again, let me point out, that I have played and enjoyed complex games.  Norm Koger's The Operational Art of War, with the 160 page manual, for example is a great game.But this game....Organizing your units has been made more complex than it every needs to be.  Units who are part of a chain of command do better than those out on their own - which makes sense.  But forming Armies and moving them can take much of your time.Sadly, for such a complex game, the political and economic parts of game are nothing but you triggering certain events that cost money and victory points and so on. There is also supplies, training, transporting, and so-on, so-forth.The UI is the most complex I have ever seen and the tutorials are good for what they explain.  But I would say they cover about 50% of the game's interface and do not even touch on the naval forces or blockades.  Even the manual points out that tooltips are needed because many functions are not covered in the manual.  Let me repeat that.  The manual states that many functions are not covered in the manual.    You will not even be able to get a refund as the tutorials will take you more then two hours.  I strongly suggest this game only for gamers who a lot of time, who love the American Civil War, and are willing to spend a few days learning how the game works.  Other wise....skip it.			"

												If you're a Civil War nerd who loves turn-based strategy games with an immensely steep learning curve, then this game might be for you. While the game developers did take some historical liberties creating game, they did accurately demonstrate the complexities, nuances, and difficulties of single-handedly commanding an entire war - let alone the American Civil War - which I have yet to see repeated. So, if you're a die-hard Civil War or turn-based strategy games, you might want to check this game out. On the other hand, the game can be buggy, the AI intelligence can be slow at times, and you essentially need a massive adderall prescription to comprehend the manual in a single reading. Furthermore, the game is offers a strictly *top-down"" all supreme commander's perspective of the war. Probably for various reasons, the game developers decided to omit tactical enagements (much to my, and others, chagrin). Also, the game's price tag is pretty steep; the only reason why I purchased the game is because I think there are a dearth of great Civil War video games for me to nerd out on in lieu of my social life. Yet, price is a matter of perspective I suppose.Finally, I know my review is rather cursory: I didn't delve too deeply into the mechanics of the game, its graphics, its GUI, and so on. I suspect anyone with a deep interest in the Civil War will probably overlook their qualms with these elements of the game just to enjoy burning Atlanta to the freaking ground (I sure did, anyway). I'm sure there are other reviews which offer a more detailed account about the game and its mechanical flaws anyway. So, in conclusion, if you're hardcore Civil War nerd, then by all means - buy the game. If not, you'll most likely want to save your money for other titles that've been tickling your fancy lately. Thanks for reading!			"

												This game is for people who like the minutia of army organization and summary battles, which of course I do. You order almost every unit in the game one regiment at a time. The battles have limited input for you, just picking formation and then the result pops up. While I love the gameplay, I have never finished a game, and this is why I can't recommend the game. I progress to a point in the game, usually early 1862, and the game has some type of graphics hiccup that causes it to crash to the desktop. Reload, crash. It might not be so bad if it save multiple versions of the game in different slots, but invariably I end up losing many months of gameplay and quit in disgust.Great game and if it was stable, I'd recommend it for true grognards.

												This game has a lot to offer.  It is complex and has a steep learning curve, but there really isn't anything else like it as far as grand strategy war games on the US Civil War.  It isn't a mod onto some other system.  This game is stable for me, unlike some other reviewers.  I have played maybe 60 hours with 2 crashes.  Both came 3+ hours into a long session.Very fun.  A little ahistorical in a few ways, but in a 120 turn game where each turn is 2 weeks, you can't script a conflict like this to unfold historically.  But great fun to see the problems the real USA/CSA had to face and how to deal with those problems.  Not a game you'll learn in 10 minutes, but its one you will play for hours and hours and get a ton out of it.			"

												This is my first review on Steam, but I had to leave a review for this game because of how strongly I feel about it. You can see by the hours I have put in that I like this game. It was my first AGEOD experience and at first I admit I was rather confused at what to do.  But after reading the AGEOD forums I found that not only is this game amazing and the best American Civil War game available, but that the developers are very interactive with their gamers and have numerous other games for different time periods while they contantly improve on their methods.You have to like the game board turn based style.  If that is not your thing, maybe its not right for you, but you never know until you try. I am now a huge AGEOD fan and it all started with this game which I bought on a whim and despite other negative reviews from people who probably prefer to play Assasin's Creed or a similar game.My opinion? 100% recomended. Right now it is by far my favorite game. Once you figure it out you can literally forget to eat all day, it is that good.			"

												Arguably the definitive strategic American Civil War simulation available on PC, it's a daunting but worthwhile investment of time and effort that is definitely rewarded. There's a lack of polish there though, some bugs, and some things definitely feel unfinished (like text entries for elements still containing placeholders), but it's a worthwhile time and money investment overall.

												One of the most exciting and gratifying games I've ever played. I kinda liked AGEOD's game before CW2, but never gave them the time to fully follow them through to mid game, but with CW2 it all changed. This game captured my attention right from the beginning, right from the main screen. There was something about it, that made it look very ""authentic"", so I gave it the oportunity, and went through all the tutorials. It probably takes you about 2 or 3 hours to go through all the tutorials when reading the whole thing, but it was worth it.When I started my first solo campaign, I started experimenting, moving the pieces. I have to be honest, sometimes I felt lost. It takes some time to get used to the user interphase. When I started to get more familiar with the game, thats when the sense of achievement started invading me. Enacting the economic, military and diplomatic decisions, recruiting a great variety of units, choosing the right generals for the right army, corps or division... OMG, loved it!Right now after 50 something hours in the game, I'm still enjoying playing the Union. I think I'm still going through the learning curve, since I believe there are still some tricks I'm missing in order to dare starting a full scenario siding with the CSA (that is a challenge). Usually I don't like writing reviews, but this game is a true gem, and as such, I think it is my duty to spread out the good word.			"

On the downside it took me about 10 hours to learn the game, and I assume there is more to learn. It is buggy and will crash after an hour or two of play.

												Long and short of it is this. Civil War 2 isn't perfect, but if you're a patient wargamer, with a love of history, then this game is for you. The strategic view, as with all AGEOD games, is about as solid as you can get while still remaining easy to use. Tactically, this game is wanting. I love the addition of the ""battle strategy"" feature, but it never felt like picking a strategy in that feature really turned the tide in battle. If AGEOD adjusts that a bit, it'd be great! I'd recommend this game for serious and semi-serious wargame enthusiasts.  If you're looking for simple, this isn't it.			"

												I have been studying this game for awhile now.... wondering if it was going to be too complicated to play. I finally decided to take the plunge and buy it. I haven't been disappointed. I have wanted a good Civil War game for a long time, and I think I have found it.You won't jump right in because it does take some reading and studying.... but it's like I am reading a cool history book about the Civil War as I learn to play it. I find it very interesting. I am taking my time learning the mechanics of the game, and watching lots of videos about it.  I seem to be catching on pretty quickly.This game isn't about graphics... they are pretty simple. This is about the strategy of the CIvil War. I usually turn the music down, but I couldn't find a way to turn it off.... only a control on how often the music plays. I found myself turning that up so that it plays the music more often, because it fits so perfectly to the theme.My only complaint so far... I wish there was an undo button... especially as I learn the game.			"

												Good game. I would recommend it, even with its occasional tendenacy to CTD (which seems to be the biggest complaint about the game). I have found, though, if you save every couple turns, which is super quick to do, it seems to forgo the CTD. However, even if it does still crash by-chance, if you save at the beginning of each turn, it takes no time to load the saved game back up. Game is very deep and has a high learning curve, which I personally enjoy. Playing or watching (via Youtube) the tutorials is a must. Graphics are nice as well. Alot to do in the game each turn, if you so desire, that can be time-consuming (in a good way). The game has many historical events, and is loaded with different options to choose from each turn to develop your economy, improve your infrastructure or counter the enemy. Many different choices can be made, for example, that affects European intervention. It's a juggling act trying to balance everything just right each turn so that you have the resources you need to furnish and maintain your standing army, while also building it up, and investing in your economy so that it still grows and keeps you stronger than the South. The problem early on is the ineptitude of your unwieldy Army, if you play the North, so it is almost impossible to win a quick victory; thus, forcing you to try to hold the South at bay while you invest in your industry and foreign diplomacy until you have the leaders, and army, necessary to crush the rebellious scourge and unify that great Union once again. I have played a little over 17 hours and I've only made it to July 1862- I like it! Currently, I'm sitting outside the flanks of Richmond with a decent size army, but, Lee has build a formidable army that is safely hunkered down in the stalwart defences of this now fortified city with reinforcements on the way. He has better generals, and a dedicated, zealous army that lives in defense, but I have time, size and the cause of righteousness on my side!Rating: 7.5/10.			"

												This Game by far is the best sim of the Civil War  since War Between the States made in the 70s by S.P.I. .  I have 3 versions of this game to date the latest one play's well its truly a great study of that war.For it to play great you need 32gigs of ram i7quad4 a fair video card the game runs perfect and the ai does a much better job. If your looking for eye candy its not there winning the game requires planing and knowing the history of the war. The map is nice looking . I got the game rather cheap onsale at steam around 30usd or less. I have 228 hrs on the game. Keep in mind the combat is not tactical  its more like reading a after action report from your Army commanders. Fog of war is a must. A high end machine makes the game perform better when you allow the ai to have the max memory allowed and as much time as it needs to makle a good move in the game settings.			"

												This game doesn't have enough good reviews. That said, Civil War 2 is a pretty good game; though I must say it bugs out on me often and crashes fairly regularly. I felt it was immersive enough to put up w/ it. Logistically and strategically, the game feels very real. Travelling over long distances, through rough terrain with little to no respite will have your men (especially the less experienced and least trained) fighting like trash in their next engagement. Battles can be a little confusing, especially at first, but if you READ the MANUAL, you'll often see how you lost a battle or why your superior forces keep running away like a bunch of cowards. Toying around with the options there's a decent amount of settings to fine tune it to your standards of ""realistic"". Basically, theres a lot to it, a lot of numbers and math going on behind the scenes. For example, you set your general's stance (aggressive passive ect) his ability to actually engage an enemy force even in the same tile however is based on a number of other factors as well (perception, fatigue, terrain type, morale, forces at his disposal) and thats even if he's capable of changing stances to begin with. Turns are taken simultaneously, your decisions that you make beforehand playing out at the same time as your opponents'; Battles are an automated affair and the whole thing plays out on a campaign map like many of the genre. You could say half the game is playing out in your mind. Personally, you can't get a more realistic simulator on a specific conflict than an AGEOD game.			"

This game is loads of fun once you know how to manage your army properly. All those comments saying the battles take a short ammount of time is correct and incorrect. you can make the engagements longer in the options and set the battle time to slow. But i dont recomend this in the grand campaign because each turn will take a very long time to do cause of all the battles. All in all if you know how to play its a great game and a must for any American civil war  strategy buffs ou there.			"

												Akin to a previous reviewer - I'm British but have a deep fascination with the ACW - the sheer bravery of men fighting a 'modern' conflict using Napoleonic tactics both humbles and appalls me. However enough ruminating - the game itself offers a very entertaining model of the strategic military aspects of the war.Leadership and command ratings of the various generals are brilliantly realised - which is somewhat of a disadvantage with the game as it has a large bearing on influencing tactics i.e. rush to get your most able generals promoted as early as possible - but , as wargamers. we have the invaluable benefit of hindsight to know that Grant, Sherman, Forrest, Cleburne et al were extremely capable - the enjoyment is in giving them opportunities to shine in other theatres and to change the course of history.Related to this is the extremely well realised Army and Corps structure - with the most able generals 'marching to the sound of the guns' and turning a desperate situation into a glorious victory. It also makes historical scenarios repeatable as it's extremely viable to tempt an opposing force into a seemingly winning situation only to throw a nasty surprise his way ala Lee and Jackson.Supply is another strength of the AGEOD engine - it's possible for many a glorious victory march by a well led force to flounder in the face of cut off supply routes.My only issue so far (playing as the CSA) is that compared to the first incarnation of the game (Blue and the Gray) is that the Union AI appears less apt to stretch my resources in the western theatre or with his naval superiority - but that might be due to me being more prepared for these eventualities.I'd recommend this game to fellow ACW affeciandos - however it won't be to everyone's tastes - you either enjoy the AGEOD engine and it's sometimes annoying fatal crashes (but every turn is auto saved and in terms of hours played they aren't that frequent) or you don't.In short the best strategic game of the Civil War you're likely to find.

												So Civil War II. A game I would only recommend to people that find niche strategy games interesting. It took me about 10-15 hours to actually figure out this game, and while the tutorials helped, the often broke for me if I did anything wrong. The manual was also helpful in this aspect, but a lot of this game is learning by doing. If I was to give feedback to AGEOD, I would ask them to make the battle system more transparent. As it is, I can see a lot of ""stats"", but I have very little idea as to why the battle swayed one way or another. The ""pre-battle"" strategy picking is also something I still dont entirely understand, and if I try to make my own selections it often turns out worse than if I have the AI pick things. Otherwise, a solid game. Theres something amazing about how the game really becomes a true simulator as you guide your troops from Washingtong to Richmond, carefully considering supplies, counter-attacks and placing rearguards.

												There are many things to love about this detailed Civil War simulator. While the learning curve may be steep, anyone with a familiarity with Paradox Interactive titles should be able to adapt pretty easily. I'm trulely impressed with all of the options and depth given to this game. It really shows that this is a passion project for the developer, there are so many little tips and tricks and ways to tweak your units to be just that much more powerful with the right experience and knowhow. This is exactly the type of game I love to play to death, which is why it pains me to say that you should stay away from this title. While wonderfully deep, this strategy game is almost unplayable due to the amount of time the AI takes to make a turn. While you're itching to get in that one more turn you'll be sitting there waiting for the computer to finally make their move. Most of the game will be spent sitting and waiting to go again. If you still really want to try the title out wait until a sale like I did, but be prepared to wait and wait and wait.			"

												First, I want to say this is the most detailed and historically correct AMerican Civil War game out there in my opinion. If you are impatient, have a low tension span, or like fast-paced games then this is not for you. The game takes a while to learn which I really like. It's fun in the learning stages but can get frustrating at some points. There are two cons I have with this game- 1. The UI could use some tweaking.  2. The game has much needed work on the stability issues (It usually crashes between 7-11 turns). Where this game really shines is how you can change history, but in a much detailed level. From industralizing the South to making decisions to convincing the border states to join the CSA, it has it all. The games engine allows you to organize your army as you see fit. When you do, many minor or major factors apply which can be game changers for the next battle. So make sure you use the system of organization wisely (brigades, divisions, corps, and armies)			"

												Immensely complicated, Civil War II is the hands down the best Civil War simulator out there. Incredibly difficult with a steep learning curve, this is a must-have for any Civil War buff. Casual gamers beware, this will require your time, patience, and skill over many and many hours before you can even dream of McClellan-type success. I think you will enjoy the challenge and appreciate history all the more.			"

Not purely a wargame but also whole new strategic options it covers such as recruitment& politics it is detailed  simulation.  Graphics are pleasent to look at.  Tutorial is sufficient to learn the basics but it needs a bit of time to invest and good opponent to really enjoy the depth game offers.			"

												30min. turns, I've played the original and this is a better streamlined version without a lot of added overhead.  Difficult the first year until you are able to move units in Divisions and Corps as there are many units until they are combined.  A simpler option is the older Civil War-From Sumter to Appomattox from 2000 but this is so much more immersive.			"

												This is my only Steam Ageod game, it has more features than a few other older Ageod games that i have played and the graphics art is different, more modern.Although Ageod games are not very hard to learn to start basic playing, it's hard to learn all the details and put them all together to play a competitive game well. So the game demands much patience and time investment, but the gameplay is very good and rewarding.Buy it only if you like ""serious"" gaming. The map and units scale is perfect for me and battles are nice, i like this style a lot.Very good game but not for the casual strategy gamer.Edit: I just read some other reviews that say this game crashes a lot. I can't remember a single time that any of my Ageod games crashed, i don't know if i am super lucky or it's because i was not buying them in the first days after release but some months/years later or because other people use laptops and other weird stuff to play their games.

												Civil War II is a very histroical detail game. Civil War II provides the player with a brief online rule booklet, a step by step introduction of the working of the game.  Very detail historical map and game pieces along with for your enjoyment music from both the Union and Confederate armies.  The game is for those who like to micromanage everything.  I felt that it was too much to handle.  The game is turn based, and when your doing one of their intro to understanding how to play the game. You have to read a lot of small print rules from pop up boxes.  The makers of this game would have done better with a step by step computer helper that would have read the rules to you and guided you correctly to understand how to play.  This game is historical based and it isn't opened ended.  I was hoping that it would let the gamer take either side and change the course of history.  It doesn't!  The game looks great but it has too many rules and after a while it is dull after hearing the computer playing ""Dixie"" a dozen times. "

												1st of all let start by saying I really do enjoy the game when it works. Im not one who needs all the bells and whistles that a game like TW Shogun 2 offers although i absolutely love that game, this is different however with no rts at all just turn based GP. the graphics, if your into that kind of thing are lame at best and the game crashes about every 6-10 turns on average (which is unacceptble for me since i payed full price) and i have a pretty sweet rig so i know this crappy game isnt maxing my pc out. simply for me to write a review on any game should speak volumes to anyone reading this as I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS but this game has P****D me off for the last time. So to sum this up people its got awesome historical value, i love the depth at which i can organize my units i.e brigades, divisions, corps and finally armys, GREAT. however all that aside for $40 these guys are completely insane like i said i can play shogun 2 on the highest graphics settings with the max # of troops possible and it doesnt even phase my rig SO WHY DOES THIS S****Y A*S GAME KEEP F*****G CRASHING ARE YOU KIDDING ME SERIOUSLY GUYS GET YOUR S**T TOGETHER AND FIX THE GOD***N GAME I PAYED YOU GOOD MONEY FOR THIS TURD WITH NO OPTION OF A REFUND SO THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS PUT OUT A D**N PATCH OR SOMETHING!!!!!!!!!With all that said please dont do what i did and read all the reviews and think ""nah my rig is bada** it should be fine"" BECAUSE IT WONT DONT BUY IT PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD I SPENT 10 MIN OF MY LIFE WRITING THIS TO SAVE YOU, THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS HEED MY ADVICE............ thank youp.s the devs should be ashamed im serious this is the only game review ive ever written but this is not the only bad game ive played (so whats that tell ya) usually i can chalk it up as loss and move on but as i said in the begining i do like the game and most of the content i just want so badly for it to work but after getting on the net and reading more into it can see thats not going to happen.... DONT BUY IT FOR F*CKS SAKE PLEASE...                                                      ..................................................ok so they did put a patch out sometime ago that fixed the issue so the games alright i just quit playing after a while. i did end up being able to complete 1 campaign all the way through a long time after i wrote this review like i said i just got fed up quit playing finally. so changing to a positive review and i appreciate the devs listing to their customers.

												This game is complete trash. I'm sorry to say it, but it's just trash. This entire post is going to list my complaints in no general order. I've spent two days trying to learn and get into this game and at the end of the day I've come up completely empty. From the start it feels like the game is out of your control. The game is completely in the hands of the AI and there's nothing you can do about it. Your troops are too numerous and you can't get your main forces in Virginia under the command limit, you're assaulted by a lot of values and a lot of information that don't make a lot of sense, and every time you hit that 'next turn' button you're hit with losses upon losses as you watch your territory dissolve away without you having any choice in the matter.The interface is so clunky. I shouldn't have to undergo so much trouble to find my own units. I'll constantly be trying to click on elements of units and just be wasting time because I'll click back to the terrain mode and unselect my units. That's so annoying. It's almost as if the Devs don't play their own game.So you lose a battle. Your first question is why? There's plenty of values that this game throws at you, but there's no way of telling exactly why you lost a battle. Were you in the wrong stance? Did terrain not work to your advantage? Did you cross a river? Were these forces working for or against you and if not, how much? The game doesn't tell you any of this. You're just hit with the after-action reports, a defeat of your own forces, and you are left to try to figure out the answers for yourselves.The lack of any immersion is apparent from the beginning of the game. You click: ""Next turn"" and you are immediately spammed with messages about troops arriving and leaving in provinces. This is where the game becomes amazingly apparent at it's failure: No one likes to be bombarded by spam! The game hits you with spam every single time a unit enters or leaves a province and by the time you're at the end of those 15 days, you have no idea who has gone where or what they are doing and you are forced to examine the entire map to find out how exactly the AI has kicked your ♥♥♥ today. It would be far more better if the map zoomed out and you could see your units moving together with the opposing enemies in your field of vision as the days passed. That would be interactive and so cool! But instead? You get spam for 5 minutes. So upsetting.I think the worst thing of this so-called ""Go at the same time"" system is incredibly misleading. It should read: ""Get perfectly countered by the AI, all the time."" No matter what you do, the AI will know what you are doing and after you have made your move, they will counter and destroy you. It's only a matter of time. I've done the Gettysburg start as the Confederacy and tried several opening moves the one thing I've noticed is that the AI will make the correct move every single time. If you split your troops, they will attack your armies with just the right size troop numbers in multiple areas and destroy them. If you mass your troops and allow the enemy to come to you, they will always do the same and either instantly defeat your army or outgrow you with superior troop recruitment before crushing. If you try to recruit troops yourself, the AI will magically know and make a beeline for that province to try to stop it. And if you try to stop it, don't worry. The AI will just magically win that battle and not tell you why, so why worry about it?And you have these foreign trade routes and honestly, even with two days trying to figure out this game I have no idea how they work. Do they give me some sort of benefit and if so, how much? They instantly get blockaded within the first 30 days of the war anyway and there's no clear starting navy on the map for me anyway, so I end up losing that part of the war without any means to resist it. And I don't even know if I should resist it. Do they give me foreign support? Huh? How about money? Do they give me anything? Hello? The game doesn't tell you these details. They just...expect you to know what to do.I've been really depressed these last few days and I bought this game to try to enjoy myself in some good ol civil war fun. But it's overwhelmingly complicated and the AI seems rigged against you anyway, so all it's done has made me more depressed. You might as well not do anything and just keep hitting the ""Next 15 days"" button. You'll get the same result if you tried to play the game. You lose.Always.			"

												I cannot tell you how much I wanted to give this game a rave review. I love the subject matter. I love their attention to detail, and the depth and the sheer possibility of intrigue and drama. That all said.. this game is criminally flawed. 1. This game has NO MULTIPLAYER. The description details it as a multiplayer game.. any experienced gamer would expect to to be a multiplayer game.. but no.. they call it multiplayer because you can PBEM thats.. play by email. MULTIPLAYER!2. This game eats itself in only a matter of turns.. and anytime I have anything interesting about to happen I get a flurry of fail messages in french. Some can be skipped by and you get to go back to a dying game that you know can go no farther. In this state its often unable to create a new save game. So it reverts on the next resume. I have never been able to finish a game because of this. 3. The South feels over-powered.. or the North feels under-powered. So there is the review.. if you love Civil War era games.. you may still want to buy this game. I am sticking it out hoping to change this review in the near future as I love the game.. and want to see them succeed.  That said.. its critically flawed.. and it basically lies about it's capabilities. This is a single player game of great depth and potential.. that cannot advance more than four turns without exploding into a ball of fire.			"

												I was really excited about this particular simulation when I found.  There are many different aspects of strategy to consider when using the simulation.  I was severely disappointed (after making the purchase) to discover that the battles are fought with extreme speed.  I was anticipating 1st Battle of Bull Run to last approximately an hour and a half to two hours.  I finished it in just under ten minutes.  The field of battle is expanded to a regional setting making it difficult to move individual units around what would have really been considered the 1st Battle of Bull Run.  I should note that I also attempted to play the Gettysburg scenario and found the same results.The creators displayed excellent ideas in bringing territories, supply and conscription into the simulation.  There is a lot of potential for this simulation if they created battles similar to CWG2.  Sadly, I don't anticipate using this simulation further unless there are serious changes.  If I had to do it all over again, I would not make this purchase...  :(			"

												This game sucks, do not buy it. The introduction on how to play the game is an outright JOKE. Where Total War Naploeon talks with you on how the game is played and what to do, this one just gives you page after page of written instructions. Not just a few words to read, but full page after page  of written instructuions. These instructions are not written that well, and can be very confusing. They tried to do too much here, and the result of this is a game that is far too complex. This whole game needs to go back to the drawing board. They divided the instructions into 3 confusing titles. If you have poor reading skills you will NEVER figure this one out, and I have excellent reading skills, and this thig confused me. I hate to see what it will do to someone who has poor reading skills. DON'T BUY THIS, IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME.			"

												It is a step backwards for AGEOD. The new engine they created is ugly, conusing even for veteran players, and on top of everything it adds little to nothing from the original Civil War's engine and gameplay. I highly recommend purchasing the original Civil War as it's engine is more appealing to the eye and much more easy to get into.			"

												This is a tough review to write, because on one hand, the game is a lot of fun. It's challenging and forces you to think about how to do things.On the other hand, there's no multiplayer. Well, there is play by e-mail but this isn't the nineties. The price for the this game should have some sort of multiplayer more sophisticated than turning off the AI and e-mailing a save game to a friend.			"

												This game is unfortunately a waste of money. Very confusing, buggy, otherwise poorly designed game and expensive to boot. I remember when I was younger (15 years ago) playing games similar to Civil War II and believe the games I played were on par (if not better) with this current iteration. Bring back Sid Meyer's Gettsburg or Civil War Generals 2. I really wish I could get my money back.			"

												I know it's hard to write a review for something I've barely played, but damn is this game inaccessible. Before you go judging, please look at my library. I'm a big fan of the EU, Victoria, and Crusader Kings series, and I don't believe a game of this type should be all that difficult for me to pick up. What little time I've spent with this game is filled with:1. Trying to understand all the various menus2. Figuring out how to enact conscription3. Figuring out how to entrench a unit4. Figuring out how to replace a general5. Wondering why those limey Brits over in the Total War franchise can't just make an American Civil War game that everyone knows would be awesome. Maybe it's my fault because I sort of breezed over the tutorials. I'll admit that. But if I know how to play ALL THE OTHER GAMES in this genre, and have for a decade, then how much should I really have to relearn? Do I need to take college courses? For potential to the hardcore (and I do mean hardest of hardcore) strategy gamers, I will give this game a 6/10.  "

												I have already purchased this and had to uninstall it because the latest update locked up the game. So, now I have having an impossible time trying to reinstalling the darn thing without paying another 39.99. Any ideas? "

												It takes a while to learn this and get into it, but once you have it is amazing.  Well worth the effort to get to grips with it.			"

This game was promoted as a new game!!!!!!!  I want my money back!!!!!!!!  I paid 49.95 for this useless game....................................Account mebotz			"

												This is the most painstakingly micro-managing crap game I have ever run across. It gives you a bunch of numbers, names of units, etc. that mean absolutely nothing. It is just one big crap shoot. Take all of the time to tediouslly make your moves and then ?????? NOTHING MATTERS! Some units don't even move, some take forever to move a couple squares, some may fight with the outcome like throwing dice, others don't even fight. They just both occupy the same town square.You end the game always feeling like you have been cheated.Because I was! What a waste of money on CRAP!! Save your money!			"

												I loved the game once i finally worked out all the mechanics of game just feel its needs a few tweaks here and there make it greater like some more historical animation during army fights with music and if possible old civil war pictures  added to dictate a win or loss . anyway i love the game and the strategy involved just hate it when i ran out of turns game over.9/10  i give game			"

												The best game available about the civil war.A broad array of possibilities, and once the gist of the game is understood, it goes very smoothly.The AI does a good job, but if you want a real challenge, you will need to either beef her up, or to play PBEM.			"

												I have played a ton of Civil War games and read a ton of books on the era.  These guys have nailed the mechanics of the war, from march times to unit dispositions in each bookmark.The supply dynamic really brings to life the cavalry tactics that the CSA employed to bring Union offensives to a halt, and forces you to make careful choices.  I have lost a whole corps to a bad winter camp placement.It's a steep learning curve, but it rewards you magnificently.			"
