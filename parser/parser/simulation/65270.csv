												At first glance this game looks kind of boring, and when I first looked up game play videos I found a 20-minute video of pounding concrete blocks with a sledge hammer, which made this game look almost as exciting as Duke Nukem Forever.  But then I found out about the explosives missions and decided to give it a try.I had hours and hours of fun playing missions over agin just blowing things up in different ways!  I think my favorite mission was the clock tower; if you pack the explosives just right, most of the structure goes skyward and then it rains bricks for a while afterward.There is some strategy to the explosives, however.  In some missions you have to avoid destroying the wrong structures while others require you to avoid making a big mess.  (Or, just for the fun of it, you can go ahead and blow everything up and fail the mission.)There is a variety of missions with different structures and different tool sets and objectives.  I found the frontloader and dumptrucks difficult to use because when you're trying to scoop up the debris it doesn't clump up nicely into the scoop, and then when you're hauling the debris, it's feather light and can slosh out of the container like water if you stop too quickly.After completing all the missions you can replay the older missions with any tools or vehicles you like (including the explosives) and unlock special tools like the repulsor gun.This game also supports user content, and you can download some add-ons from the developer website, including a rocket launcher.Another fun thing you can do is edit the tool properties files and increase the explosive power of the explosives!One problem I had with this game is that the mouse cannot be inverted, but I eventually got around that by using SakasaMouse so that I can properly pitch foward when I move the mouse forward and pitch backward when I move the mouse backward.

												Full of minor bugs, a few glitches and only about 5-7 hours worth of missions before you're done. But I wouldn't have thought it would be legal to not recomment a game that gave me the strange satisfaction of driving an excavator (digger) into a Chimney stack and having to sledge hammer your way out of the rubble.Pros: Rather good physics. Simplicity - only having to point and click at an object to damage and destroy it. C4... 'nuff said. Final mission is pretty cool to watch the result of your labours... Basic damage (i.e: large chunks, not detailed wall damage) might seem bad, but man is it time saving. Very strangely satisfying.Cons: Slightly boring at first and the airport missions can be tedious. Too short. Maybe to repetative for some.Rating: 9/10 - Highly recommended. Please make a sequal with more missions and more diversity.			"

												I love this game. The graphics aren't much cop, and the physics engine doesn't give the vehicles or rubble any real weight (I'm pretty sure real concrete doesn't bounce), but it's a fun little simulator with its own peculiar charm. Whether carefully planning a blast or just ramming sheds with a bulldozer, this is just great fun.			"

												Didn't you laugh when you saw the name of the game, but like me you clicked on it and viewed some pictures. After seeing explosives and actual equipment letting you loose in the game to really be an evil genius is just so much fun. I watched a couple videos before i knew i had to have it and their was even a demo on their site. You make the choice on what you want to use some missions (some missions are limited like no explosives), but trust me its NOT your typical go place it here then make sure you run to this spot, you place it where you want and if you want to go crazy with every explosive you have then your free to. Their are some bugs like their is no damage/health meter, but that just makes it fun when you climb a crane blow the building and travel with the rubbel! Score this 4 Out Of 5!			"

												GIANTS are a software company i have long linked with my beloved Farming Simulator 15, so when i found this little gem for £6 and being made from them i had hoped to find a game which would prove to be well made and enjoyable, and for the most part this game lives up to the description.The Vehicles:the controls are fiddly to get used to but once you do you will find you can get most tasks done quickly, the Wheel Loader is the worst for me, i had a horrible time at the start keeping rubble in the bucket, likewise the truck is a real pain to drive once loaded but other than that the rest were enjoyable, i wont go into to much detail about what vehicles there are. if you want to see them then i would suggest either go raid youtube or buy the game.The Map (Career Mode)This is no open world roaming game, it would have been much more entertaining if it was in my opinion, there is a map with different districts on it. each district has a level requirement and a series of missions for you to complete. they get harder as you progress into the higher zones but likewise the vehicles you get to play with can get the job done with ease. for me the map/districts were too small, the game started well but once you get to level 8 the game gets quite short and i personally found it to be over much to quickly. not complaining to much as it was a nice cheap game and you really do get what you pay for. but even though i found it short it was very fun wiping out the various buildings and structures.Missionsthis mode is much like career mode and in most cases its just a repeat of career mode missions but with these missions you dont have the vehicle restrictions you have in career (until level 8 when you can pick your own). again, this mode is more aimed at pointless destruction.On the whole i would say this game is well worth the price i paid and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys blowing apart things. if there was to be a sequel to this game i would certainly consider it but would very much like to see either many more districts or a game that plays much to the theme of farming simulator where you have a larger single map and take on contracts to demolish buildings and so forth and a company that you can build up from the bottom, employing npc's to do jobs and gradually buy in new vehicles and abilities.

												There's something inherently satisfying about collapsing buildings. Sometimes it's fun just doing it by cutting out the weakpoints with a jackhammer and watching it crumble, plus moving around debris with the loader and bulldozer reminds me of playing in the sandbox with Tonka toys (I live close to Minnetonka so maybe that's not a surprise). It starts becoming a little bit mindless and can be repetitive but the feel of it is just fun. It's a shame GIANTS and Focus haven't made some revamped version of this like they have with Farming Simulator.			"

No.It's buggy as hell, sound is absolute ♥♥♥♥, the graphics are poor.The physics are relatively good. But the damage model of the buildings are pre-programmed, and sometimes it falls randomly.A certain building that I played a lot with, sometimes it just collapses on it's own.Regardless, that could be fixed with patches or whatever, not happening.Onto the mods  which they claim they have. Not there.The main website directs you to a page with the mods, and there's an amazing amount of mods, adding up to a total of 10, of which 2 are actual maps.You'd hope for a big building to demolish, but it's not there.Get this game if you can get it for a dollar or two, but don't pay for the gold version, not worth it by a long stretch.

												Okay, so I reviewed this game a good three years ago. I've come back to it to give it a propper review. It seemed like my first review was a little harsh and didn't give much information on the actual gameplay so here goes:Oh wait, I can't play the game. It doesn't support Eyefinity, Surround, and even when trying to play at 1080p, the game stretches because it seems to think it still needs to render the FOV that three screens would require. Games should NEVER look to the OS to see what resolution the game is running in. They should only use the user defined resolution as a reference point. Okay, so if you're planning to buy this game and you have more than one monitor connected and they're set up in a display group, this game is not going to work. If you've ever tried to play Metro 2033 with more than one monitor, you'll know what I mean. Thanks for taking the time to read this.			"

												If being FORCED to run around hitting things with a sledgehammer while on a time limit doesnt annoy you then this game could be tolerable. They have locked all but the tutorial and even if you want to try some of the more challenging jobs in the ""Single Mission"" mode, nah you have to unlock it first.I paid my money, i wish i could play all the game without having to grind through Career mode.

												Avoid! It doesn't work, screen resolution handling is still not fixed and you may very likely experience that it wont display correctly and/or at least in a way that enables you to change to a proper resolution.On my computer, it resets my resolution to 640x480 and the game then runs in a tiny window in the top left corner of the screen, showing what looks like part of a digger, with no access to any menu or anything.The game is seriously broken, I highly advise that you either find a demo to test it out on your rig before you throw money after this game.

												I got this for 2.49 euros. There's 2.49 euros worth of fun in it, so thumbs up.There isn't a whole lot of content - a couple hours and you'll be done. Some of the missions are boring, especially the ones where you have to transport rubble. The missions where you get to use explosives make up for that though. And killing buildings with a pickaxe and jackhammer is quite satisfying.A lot of the missions can be cheesed in some way. For example, there's one where you have to take the top floor off of a building and make sure as little rubble as possible falls on the sidewalk. You're supposed to carefully destroy it with the long-arm jackhammer machine.Instead, I used the machine's arm as a ladder, went up there myself, dropped as many explosives as I could, and blew up. This won the mission as the floor was gone and all of the rubble was in a fast expanding cloud of debris up in the air, and therefore not on the sidewalk. Still, how can you *not* like that?A strange negative is that there's no way to set your mouse sensitivity, and by default it's SLOW. Set it to max in your driver settings before you start.			"

												In terms of simulation games, I generally say no to playing them. Not for the fact that they are bad games, they just arn't my kind of games. That is, until I picked this one up. Demolition Company is a very enjoyable simulation game for those that have a lust for destruction.  The physics feel really good as it is always fun to watch old buildings fall like a house of cards with explosives.  The gameplay is fun for what the game is, you destory stuff and get paid for it, with some conditional factors on the side. Don't expect too much else. The only two negatives I have with the game is: 1. Lack of challenge in some parts. (Such as no risk of getting hurt or killed. Which is a bit strange for a simulation based from a dangerous profession.)  2. No music during gameplay, some music really would be a nice touch. ( Even then this is an easy fix but still.)Overall, if you enjoy destruction or simulation games. Then I personally recommend it.  But like I said, don't expect anything ground breaking. Just expect simple, addicting, destuctive fun.			"

												I paid $10 for Demolition Company and it's a fun litte game. On many levels, it's really well-made. The equipment and vehicles are detailed and some of the controls are complex and will take a bit to get used to. The missions are straightforward, don't require anything overly complicated and the tutorials are adequate enough to give you a good understanding of how to use all the machines. I have only one main complaint and that's that the physics need a tweaking when it comes to hauling debris in either your loader or the dump truck. 2/3rds of your hauled materials will bounce, unnaturally, out of your loader's bucket while moving. The same thing applies to your dump truck. Acceleration and deceleration is very herky-jerky and the materials you're hauling will violently shift around and spill out on all sides. I also stumbled upon  another physics bug where, using your jackhammer, you can turn oil drums into projectiles, causing them to instantly break apart solid walls. Overall, the game's worth the 10 bucks. Who doesn't like breaking or blowing stuff up? It doesn't appear the developers have done anything with it in a couple of years, so it seems unlikely they'll address the physics problems mentioned above. They're aren't game breakers... they just cause some frustration and eye rolling.			"

												There is no mouse sensitivity adjustment in this game. The default speed is sluggish and might put a lot of players off. I had to turn up the speed of my mouse pointer to the fastest through windows control panel. That helped a bit. I also have a trackball, so I may not notice it as much as someone with a conventional mouse.Apart from that, I found it to be a very enjoyable game. It has some quirks with physics at times, most notably the rubble, which behaves more like Styrofoam than rendered stone and concrete; especially so, when you try to load it into a machine bucket. However, I've seen nothing that detracts too much from the fun of blowing stuff up or tearing it down. There is a multitude of vehicles and tools to aid your rabid structural rendering needs and placing twelve packs of C4 in a building and blowing it to pieces can get quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic...Progression from a lowly sledge wielding navvy, to a wreaking-ball slinging titan, felt natural and without too much obvious grind. Do the job, follow the rules (or break them), rake in the cash.If you see it on sale, or you believe you may have a penchant for sending several tons of rubble sailing over the rooftops several hundred meters away, or kicking a dump truck into high gear and ramming it through a building, I'd probably pick it up if I was you.Overall I score it 7/10.
