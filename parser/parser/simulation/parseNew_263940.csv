												The year 2000 was a very bad year for me. In fact it was the worst year of my life by far. It was the year I was diagnosed with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. It was the year I lost my husband, my soul-mate, to cancer.  In July of that year an intoxicated driver hit the automobile I was a passenger in. My neck was broken, and I was paralyzed from the shoulders down. I had been a classical musician and risen about as far as one can go with it and was enjoying every second of it. I lost that, and five of my closest friends in that. Later that year while I was still in hospital recovering, my sister died. Cancer again. We had been very close. Together with having nothing to do but stare at the ceiling, and nothing to look forward to other than that and bad tapes of all the terrible things which had happened playing over and over in my head, I determined that I would rather die than live that way. I had an advance directive and Living Will which I'd signed in 1995, and it seemed an easy thing to intentionally aspirate my food and water at supper, blame it on the MS and refuse a feeding tube and hydration via i.v. fluids based on my advanced directive and living will.But before supper time came about, my father happened by with several big boxes on a trolley. He had with him one of the hospital maintenance staff. In the boxes was an old computer of mine and my old joystick. Before I had the opportunity to say, ""What the hell do you expect me to be able to do with that?"" my dad said, â€œWe are going to set this up for you to use. Tomorrow one of the occupational therapists will be up to rig up a rod which you can use to type on the keyboard. I noticed that you have some games on your computer, and I thought you might want to try playing one of your games using your mouth to control the joystick. Don't worry. Mum's cleaned the thing more spotless than the dishes.""It turned out that the joystick was not that difficult to use, though it was going to take some practice to get really good at it. But it gave me something to do and to think about. The mouth stick didn't work well. The only joystick game on the computer was Red Baron, but I had enjoyed playing the game before my accident, and now I began setting goals for myself, including winning the duel with the Red Baron on the most difficult setting without taking any damage or losing any squadron members, and shooting down all enemy aircraft myself. Even though I still struggled with bouts of grief (as I still do to this day), I was starting to set goals and make plans for my life... two things which are entirely incompatible with committing suicide. I was only hours away from putting my plan into motion, and was it not for that one game which I could play; I would have gone through with it. So you see Damon, your game truly did save my life. If ever you are tempted to think ill of yourself or wonder if you have accomplished anything of value in your life, remember that something you did saved a life, and turned it around to being a happy one. There really isn't much better that one can do. Thank you. Thank you more than you will ever know.			"

SummaryIt's a couple of very old games. Red Baron Classic is really old and ugly, but works OK. Red Baron 3D (RB3D) isn't as old or ugly and works pretty well. RB3D should be your game of choice. Be sure to spend time with the manuals and references! These are not arcade games and you will get a lot more out of it if you put the time in doing some studying.You can dogfight with an enemy ace, fly pre-rolled single missions, build your own missions or fly in the campaign. The campaign is great, the missions and what happens during them are procedurally generated and so you really do have to expect the unexpected. Very much recommended, if and only if you want to put in some time on learning them. It can be played as an arcade flyer/shooter, but you won't really get into the meat of the games.Update 3Another half hour of game playing. First of all, I tried Red Baron Classic again. While it has a nice appeal for nostalgia, otherwise it's something good to skip and go right to Red Baron 3D (RB3D).I played a second campaign mission. I was junior man of a five pilot flight of Nieuport 11 aircraft, our target was some enemy infantry. I took off and used the (non-historic) autopilot to get to the mission area; you don't have to do this, by the way, as in the real WW1 situation, your airfield isn't that far from the front. The attack on the infantry went well, I strafed and dropped a couple of bombs. We ran across a few Fokker E.III Eindeckers and after a long, low chase, I managed to make one crash. My first kill! We flew home and I once again suprised myself by landing safely. So, have to say, the game is working fine for me. The keyboard and joystick controls are nice and so far no crashes.And, good news, the promised maps, manuals and reference card PDFs have been uploaded! So fire up those printers. A note to the reference card for Red Baron 3D. Two items are missing (they were missing on the originals). CNTL+H will jump your autopilot to the last waypoint, IE Home; basically it's a Return to Base order. And if you are using a joystick, pressing CNTL while moving the hat switch will allow you to see up and to the appropriate direction; IE holding CNTL and pressing the hat switch to the left will make your Point of View to about 45 deg up and to the left. Good way to scan above you.Update 2OK, another hour of playing in (now at 1.4 hours). I started a campaign in RB3D. I started as a British pilot, March 1st 1916. First mission is to fly to the front and shoot up a balloon. That's actually the flight leader's job. Mine apparently is to shoot at the infantry (if I am stupid enough to fly that low!).I screwed around with the first attempt just learning the controls, the keyboard and the area. It of course helps that I not only have the old RB3D manual, I also have some play aids I made up, including a cheat sheet for the joystick.Flying the mission, it helps to remember you actually have to start the engine! (use TAB and jiggle the throttle). Take off and after getting some altitude, pretend it's not WW1 and switch on the autopilot (CNRL-A for full, ALT-A for auto-navigate, Shift-A for Auto fly level). Follow the map on your kneeboard (0 on the keypad). I flew around so that my flight leader could get the balloon. Just like in real life WW1 flying, as I rookie I pretty much didn't see a damn thing except the Archie banging away at me (little poofs in the air) and the occasional stream of tracers going past me. Going home, I flew over a neighbor airfield that was under attack, then landed at my own. Amazingly I didn't crash; thankfully I remembered to shut off the engine to kill my speed (TAB again).So the mission was a success; one balloon down, all back safe, although one guy took a bit of damage. Sadly I couldn't take screenshots of the replay screens, they are cool. I'll post other shots soon.So, in summary, Red Baron 3D runs fine, looks... like a generation old game(!), works well with a joy stick, doesn't crash to desktop, and makes me all nostalgic. Mission accomplished!Update 1Fixed the graphics limitation in Red Baron 3D. On the Main Menu, select Graphic Settings, then Graphic Options, then over on the right side under the header ""Graphics"" you want to select ""Glide"". Do this and the game will run in full screen and look pretty... well, prettier.Below is my original review. Updates will be posted above!This is going to be a review in progress, since a lot of folks might have interest in the game but are wary of buying something this old. So I'll post some items as I go along. I'm giving the game a thumbs up for now since it's working for me. My specs are: Intel i7 4770K 3.5GHz, 16GB RAM, GTX 780 3GB, Win7 64bit, 480GB SSD main driveFirst of all, be aware that there are two games here. Red Baron, the original, appears to be running via DosBox and is full screen. Red Baron 3D (hereafter RB3D) runs in a window and if you make the window full screen, the colors go all to hell. So I'm staying with it in a window for now.fine once you have selected ""Glide"" as the graphics option.The promised bonus content, scans of the original printed playaid materials, are NOT present in the install, but the developers are aware of this (see this thread) and have promised to make them available soon. As an old RB3D player with the original boxed game I'm OK with forging ahead. By the way, if you install a shortcut on the desktop via the Steam library, it runs Red Baron directly, not RB3D. So only run the game from the Library for now till you set up separate shortcuts (if desired).Also to note; I have a Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick and both games recognized it; in Red Baron you do have to enable it via the Options. And one other item; it's an old, old game. It's going to look it. You are forewarned!			"

Activate ""Glide"" in Graphics Settings! Doing so fixed any graphical issues for me.(Preferences -> Graphic Setting -> Graphic Options -> Graphics -> Glide)Note: This review focuses primarily on Red Baron 3D, and will be updated with any further remarks as I log more hours in-game. I have not yet attempted multiplayer.Compatibility:Having played the original Red Baron 3D for countless hours growing up, I was ecstatic to see it finally available on Steam. My worries over compatibility were quickly set aside as both Red Baron and Red Baron 3D worked perfectly from install and recognized my joystick. Far better than on my old XP machine in fact. I have so far not experienced any of the bugs that other reviewers have mentioned. My system specs are as follow:Windows 10 64-bit, Intel Core i7-4810MQ 2.80GHz, 8.0GB RAM, Intel HD graphics 4600, GeForce GTX 860M, Thrustmaster T-16000M joystickAs the graphics are not much to talk about, given that it is an almost 20 year old game, I will move straight on to gameplay.Gameplay:All the glory of Red Baron 3D is properly restored here. The flight models are unique to each plane and very true to their real-world counterparts. You will have to take care when tending to your throttle and maneuvering about in these fragile slow-moving aircraft, making sure to not overstress your wings and not have them break off in a speedy turn. The plane will creak and the engine will sputter depending on the stresses you put onto it. The gunnery is realistic as well, with reload times and gun jams as they occurred in real life. The damage models are also very authentic. There are no health bars. Your engine might overheat and catch fire, your wings and control surfaces might be crippled and torn up by enemy machine guns and flak, and even your pilot is vulnerable. That said, the 22 flyable planes are an absolute joy to fly. My only grievance is that the two-seaters and bombers are not playable; only controllable by the AI.As for the AI; the aircraft and enemy pilots react very realistically to your actions. New pilots are hasty at the controls and will often expose themselves out of desperation in an attempt to flee. It's not uncommon to see one pushed to losing control of their own machine and sent tumbling towards the earth by pilot error. More advanced pilots will act more confidently in their planes however, quickly maneuvering their way around you to gain an advantage, using many classic and authentic dogfighting techniques. The combat is extremely intimate and chaotic when there is a swarm and friends and foes fighting alongside you in the air, so close that it almost becomes personal. Collisions, ground fire, and sneak attacks are always things to keep your head on a swivel for. Red Baron 3D does an excellent job in immersing the player in this aerial combat, where dogfights can boil down to a desperate turn-fight with short bursts of fire, where 1 well-placed bullet can mean the difference between making it back to your aerodrome or certain doom.Campaign:The Campaign mode is always where Red Baron 3D excelled most though and, in my opinion, it remains unmatched to this day in its depth and detail. In the campaign, you create your own pilot and enlist in one of the four available airforces (German, British, French, American) any time between March 1916 and the end of the war. From there, you partake in realistic missions with your squadron. This could be anything from a standard patrol, intercepting enemy reconnaissance planes, attacking an enemy aerodrome, supporting an attack on the ground, and much more.Easily the best part about the campaign, however, is that the war unfolds around you as it had in real life with updates from the frontlines. The maps are beautifully detailed and accurate, and events unfold as they had historically. At any given moment, different patrols and aircraft will be up in the air doing their own thing, and the ground forces will be moving at their own pace. You will see fighting going on below you in the frontline, and you may stumble upon a group of enemy fighters attacking a patrol different than your own. Do you break off to go support your allies, putting your own life at risk, or do you keep on your own flight path? Stay too long and you might get jumped by another passing enemy squadron. You never know what's going to happen. As there are no respawns, every decision you make is vital for your own pilot, and yet seemingly futile in the grand scheme of everything happening around you. Red Baron 3D's campaign really makes you feel like a small part of a much huger conflict, and yet you will find yourself soaring with or against some of the greatest aces of the war. The feeling of chasing down a seemingly anonymous German pilot over the western front and barely making it out the victor, only to return to your aerodrome and hear news that the infamous German ace Oswald Boelcke has been shot down by your hands is a sometimes humbling experience.If you survive long enough, you will watch your squadron evolve over time. New pilots will join your ranks to replace your fallen comrades, your squadron will be outfitted with better planes, and you might even move up the ranks to become a renowned ace yourself. Red baron 3D beautifully reconstructs the Great War in its fluid campaign and is a truly unique and remarkable experience that remains unparalleled to this day. It shows that the developers took great care and interest in creating the most authentic and immersive WW1 flight sim possible.Conclusion:Having grown up playing Red Baron 3D, I've since looked for a WW1 flight sim that could match Red Baron's depth. And while there exist other fine WW1 flight sims, far surpassing Red baron in graphical detail, the amount of attention to historical detail and immersion in Red Baron 3D's campaign is really what made it special, and in my opinion it remains unmatched to this day. I'm thrilled that it's finally available on Steam and highly recommend it to old fans and newcomers alike.			"

												Red Baron is unique among the flight simulation genre, and hands-down, one of the finest games I've ever played. The amount of research, accuracy, and dedication the developers put into this game places it head and shoulders above similar titles. While this game was made in 1990, it still holds countless hours of gameplay today.This game is filled with interesting information regarding the rise of flight during World War I, information about both sides greatest Aces, and realistically protrays how different models of aircraft would have handled. Considereing the year that Red Baron was made, I would rate it 10/10 and definitely recommend it.			"

												To this day Red Baron 3d (also known as Red Baron II) is one of the best WW1 flight simulators you can buy. This is exactly the game I remember it to be and man what a gem! Now, a few things to start off with. DO NOT expect some graphically amazing game... Red Baron 3d was made in 1998! Also, although the first Red Baron (included in this pack) is monumental for really being a genre defining game; its the second one you should be interested in amongst this pack. Now, that aside here is what you can expect... an accurate representation of what WW1 dogfighting was. IT WASNT EASY! It was a challenge and that is part of the huge charm to this game. I recommend keeping the realism factor/setting pretty high in this game. Its makes everything not only more challenging but most importantly more authentic. For straight up Dog Fights, they have a ""Fly Now"" mode in the game which is my personal favorite. You can select a plane you want to start out with in prefrences and hop right into the action. For those more inclined for long flights, the mission mode is rather good in this game from what I remember. Also, its imporant to note that this game is authentic to the actual 1998 game as can be possible for a digital download. That means included in your purchase is a manual/tutorial guide and the most important item... the REFRENCE CARD! Print out the refrence card PDF. It tells you all the controls and by the way, there is no option to switch control schemes! That being said, the controls are rather intuitive and good and it should automatically read your joystic if you have one. I recommend using a joystick as that is really the only good way to play a flight simulator. It was designed to be used with a Microsoft Sidewinder Version 1 joystick but my Sidewinder Pro (version2) works perfectly well with it. I have no idea how it deals with Logitech or other brands, although I am assuming it would be fine as I used a Saitek in 1998 to play this game. So, if you want an accurate, challenging, and cheap WW1 Dogfight simulator look no further than Red Baron 3d. Give this one a shot, I don't think you will be dissapointed.Hint:  Use the ""Glide"" setting under the Graphics prefrences and don't worry if colors appear a bit wonky on the menu or end mission screen every now and then. This was an orginal bug from the original release of the game and does not affect gameplay.			"

												So much memories! And they work! Well, most of the time. Red Baron classic tends to screw up my joystick and softlock itself. Oh well. These games have the ultimate WW1 pilot career mode that is missing from The Rise of Flight. Take to the skies, shoot down the enemy machines. Get medals and promotions. Paint your plane and become a terror to behold. 10/10 would get a headache from oversized pixels all over again!			"

But this really wins in the campign mode.If you want to live the life as a WW1 pilot, this game is for you!You can even use Tracking for it, TrackIr, Opentrack.Be sure to set it to Glide in graphic options.And don't rip your wings off!

												Unbelievably buggy- even accounting for the age and release state of the originals. I remember the original being really tricky to make run on various systems, but there is no excuse for this in a re-release at this point in history. I expect ""classic"" graphics and to have some screen resolution issues, but even in compatibility mode (something some versions of Windows don't even have anymore) this thing locks up and crashes *constantly*, bugs out when configuring controllers (& from the little I've seen, controller support isn't very good. Which in a flight sim/game is a big problem in itself),  etc on *top* of those other issues. I hope the modern remake is substantially better quality than this re-release. Which is a shame, because we could use a good WWI flight sim that was a solid release without being free-to-play.			"

												So thrilled to find this game on Steam. I spent hundreds of hours playing this back in the day living out Biggles stories. For such an old game its fantastic to find it runs just fine on my modern Win 10 machine. A few years ago it was a real pain trying to get it to work on XP. It's a game of its time though, the graphics are very dated but the planes handle realistically and dogfighting is still as thrilling and difficult as it was back in the day. The campaign is often highlighted as the best feature of the game, one that hasn't been surpassed by other WW1 sims. When you think about it, the campaign is nothing special, it's the same thing you'd find in Elite or Frontier from the time but it combines so well with the mostly static front line and regular monotony of missions that it adds immensely to the realism of the setting. It's the perfect application of that procedural generation system that makes it still one of the best open world campaigns ever made.Time to dust off the joystick and practice those Immelmann Turns!

												IF YOU PLAYED THIS IS 1990 AND LOVED IT - DONT BUY IT your childhood memories will be soiledIf you want an oldschool plane sim - DON'T BUY IT... this is simply not worth it.the old version stinks as bad as he original, it was cute back then 26 years ago, controls sucked back then too, but it is just some of he lamest plane controls ever, you can at the max use 2 keyboard keys simultaneously, so either steer 1 way and shoot, steer 2 ways, steer 1 way and change speed. you litterally can not go up, right, shoot at the same time... 2 keys max, if yo press a third, only the first key pressed works... so better remember that if you buy his and unless you play without taking dmg... you die mission one, over and over coz you crash, get shot down or crash...the new 3D version is no good either, you can not control the plane at all, for some reason you can not do anything, there is also nowhere to look up the controls so good luck finding out what to do to fix the issue.even if it was due to controls fat chance you can change those controlsthere is a ""Manual"" well, a 243 page long  PDF full of maps and historical data, but no way of finding out how to do anyhing relevan in the gameThe worst part is, the original is 26 years old the 3D version is 18 years old, whoever re-released this had as long as it takes to raise a baby to adulthood to improve this  and didn't...DO NOT -  I R E P E A T - DO  NOT BUY THIS!

												I was always interested in W.W.1 Aviation, i remember when i played a game similar to this pack. It has realistic physics, graphics that looked good at the time and an accurate depiction of WW1 aerial combat. It also has a lot of information about flying aces and the aircraft, that they flew. I recommend this game pack for every vintage flight sim fan.			"

												I have just downloaded RED BARON PACK. When I started to play it my graphics  are heavely pixilated. So much so that I cannot determine what the aircraft looks like and whether they are RAF or or German. Can you help me with this? Thank you.			"
