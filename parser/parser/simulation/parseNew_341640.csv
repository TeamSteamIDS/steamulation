												A reasonably good casual RTS game.  The gravity aspect adds and interesting dimension (no pun intended).Worth getting if on sale.  Not sure that it's worth full price, but fairly entertaining nonetheless.			"

												Fairly fun if a bit slow and repetitive feeling. Pretty fun for time-wasting, but not quite enough content to really get into.			"

												I've been working with relativity for a while now, and so this game intrigued me immensely, mostly in that, I have been considering making a game on similar principles.However, it has so distilled down the actual physics of relativity that it doesn't actually represent relativity as science currently or in the future should suggest it works.The space-time fabric that it uses is: a) too coarse, so it doesn't give you the sense that a solar system is itself a giant bowl, but rather represents it like a bunch of balls sitting on a rubber sheet each intenting the sheet locally, but not particularly much as distance increase. (Hint: gravity falls off approximately equal to r^2, which is a paraboloid, not a small dent in the space-time field) b) so massively effected by space-time distortion weapons, that you're effectively creating gravitational weapons that do hojillions more space-time manipulations than your ships, planets, and galactic black hole do.Next, the scale is so unbelievably small, that it's like beach balls rolling around on a trampoline... it's like, ""ok, these things are pretty big, but... they're not really doing anything... why are they orbiting like that?""Basically, for wanting to replicate real-world relativity, they've done a pretty poor job of it.

												Not an overall appealing game in general. I got it as part of a pack of 10 games that were all on sale for 2.50 for the whole pack. I probably got my moneys worth on this game but to pay much more than that isn't worth it. Sure it's a novelty feature to be able to play with gravity and fling planets out of orbit but there is so much other amazing stuff missing that seems like it would be obvious to add. Sure starts and black holes have gravity effects but planets do not. Also the gravity physics are pretty limp.I guess technically this game is what it says on the tin, but just barely and in the most basic way possible. I had high hopes for this name given the boldness of the name. Plus during the introduction and description of the game they start citing the names and works of some of history's bit name physicists. But when you get down to the game it's disappointing. Even a grade school kid would be disappointed in this. There are facebook games with better physics.			"

												Realy noithing special here, I didn't even finish first mision, it isn't hard it is just little to long and there is nothing there to  atract me to keep going. After tutorial and almost one misson i have feeling that I know most part of this game mechanic and concept and there is not much to dicover or fight for other that repeating the same thing over and over again, I want little more content to enjoy, not just upgrade speed or attack bar, take palnet build ship take another palnet build more ship and in the end take last planet/ destroy enemies and repeat the same thing in another little more challenging level. And graphic isn't super great to keep me little longer, its all the same all the same for most parts, not enought to keep me enteratined for more than half an hour.			"

												I asked for a refund. No full screen option, simplistic gameplay and a rubbish port. If it changes, I might buy it again.			"

												I really like this game - clever concept, good use of physics and relativity.The interface is a little clunky, and could use some work to make it easier to do multi-planet tasks, like:* Build at all planets* Patrol/Attach from all planets* Colonise all available planets			"

												I'm really enjoying this so far. I like that its origional and it has a kind of ""hitchhikers guide to the galaxy"" feel about it. + Fun strategic battles+ Origional + Good variety so far- Interface can be a bit clunky at times- Takes a little while to get properly goingOverall fun, interesting and recommended  "

												Ehh.  Nothing really interesting.  A game from the 80s with some graphics updates.  Sure, I guess it uses some basic relativistic equations (Lorentz transform seems to be used) but the game mechanic doesn't really have much to do with relativity at all.  It's just shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥in space and building things.			"

												Relativity Wars is a nice little “Grab and Hold” RTS that alls&t folks should pick up, perhaps just not at full price.The game has some nice sciency elements and the cutest voice-over ever, but the UI is a flipping nightmare.The interface works, in the end, it's not like it's brokenor anything like that, but it can be a veritable discomfortin the trailing element.  This is especially true when you're trying to manage real quick a good number of planets,because aliens with guns are attacking you and those ships need to be in the air, only air in space is non-zero, and there is no indication whatsoever of which queue is completeand which needs to be manually refilled and... oh goodness,do you see the state I am in?  I am so sorry, I was just trying to save  my planet... planets... from aliens withinexplicably unsteerable space ships.  Muscle rockets?			"

												good gme but i would of prefered if there was more actual distortions a black hole has similar distorions to a sun and all the planets and sun make tiny distortionsalso the blackhole graphic is really poor compared to the rest of the game a little dissapointed			"
